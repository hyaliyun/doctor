The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was discovered September 2012 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The first US case of MERS-CoV was confirmed on 2 May 2014. Methods. We summarize the clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory and radiologic findings, and MERS-CoVCspecific tests. Results. The patient is a 65-year-old physician who worked in a hospital in KSA where MERS-CoV patients were treated. His illness onset included malaise, myalgias, and low-grade fever. He flew to the United States on day of illness (DOI) 7. His first respiratory symptom, a dry cough, developed on DOI 10. On DOI 11, he presented to an Indiana hospital as dyspneic, hypoxic, and with a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest radiography. On DOI 12, his serum tested positive by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for MERS-CoV and showed high MERS-CoV antibody titers, whereas his nasopharyngeal swab was rRT-PCR negative. Expectorated sputum was rRT-PCR positive the following day, with a high viral load (5.31  10(6) copies/mL). He was treated with antibiotics, intravenous immunoglobulin, and oxygen by nasal cannula. He was discharged on DOI 22. The genome sequence was similar (>99%) to other known MERS-CoV sequences, clustering with those from KSA from June to July 2013. Conclusions. This patient had a prolonged nonspecific prodromal illness before developing respiratory symptoms. Both sera and sputum were rRT-PCR positive when nasopharyngeal specimens were negative.

In the first half of this article, we provide a detailed review of the history and origin of COVID-19, followed by the taxonomy, nomenclature and genome organization of its causative agent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the latter half, we analyze subgenus Sarbecovirus (167 SARS-CoV-2, 312 SARS-CoV, and 5 Pangolin CoV) genomes to understand their diversity, origin, and evolution, along with pan-genome analysis of genus Betacoronavirus members. Whole-genome sequence-based phylogeny of subgenus Sarbecovirus genomes reasserted the fact that SARS-CoV-2 strains evolved from their common ancestors putatively residing in bat or pangolin hosts. We predicted a few country-specific patterns of relatedness and identified mutational hotspots with high, medium and low probability based on genome alignment of 167 SARS-CoV-2 strains. A total of 100-nucleotide segment-based homology studies revealed that the majority of the SARS-CoV-2 genome segments are close to Bat CoV, followed by some to Pangolin CoV, and some are unique ones. Open pan-genome of genus Betacoronavirus members indicates the diversity contributed by the novel viruses emerging in this group.

METHODS Members of the Southeastern Surgical Congress were surveyed regarding system adjustments, personal impact, and productivity losses. Subgroups were analyzed for disproportionate impact across practice models (academic/employed/private), practice communities (urban, suburban, rural), and practice case-mix categories (broad general surgery, narrow general surgery, specialty practice, hospital-based practice). RESULTS 135 respondents reported that 98.5% of surgeons and 97% of hospitals canceled elective cases. Practices and hospitals reduced staffing dramatically. Telemedicine was utilized by most respondents. Hospitals variably implemented system changes, developed tests, and set up diagnostic centers. Most surgeons anticipated resumption of practice and hospital activity by July 1, 2020. More than one-quarter reported worsened financial status and personal well-being. Interestingly, family/personal relationships were improved in more than one-third. Most surgeons anticipate reduced year-end case volumes, clinical productivity, and salary. In subgroup analyses, academic surgeons were more likely than employed and private-practice surgeons to use telemedicine and to work in hospitals with in-house COVID-19 testing. Private-practice surgeons expected decreased financial status, case volumes, relative value units (RVUs), and salary. More rural surgeons anticipate reduced salary than urban and suburban surgeons. Surgeons in narrow general surgery practice reported more furlough of employees than specialty surgeons, hospital-based surgeons, and broad-based general surgeons. Narrow-practice surgeons and specialists were more likely to report RVU reductions and improved family/personal relationships.

The EEs were stratified by length of follow-up from chronic pancreatitis diagnosis to pancreatic cancer (lag period). Robustness of the results was examined in sensitivity analyses. We identified 13 eligible studies. Pooled EEs for pancreatic cancer in patients with chronic pancreatitis were 16.16 (95% CI: 12.59-20.73) for patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer within 2 years from their chronic pancreatitis diagnosis.

Using a four-question telephone survey, we surveyed a cross-section of patients who had opted to participate in virtual visits to assess their level of satisfaction surrounding audio-only visits. In addition, average clinic wait times and attendance rates by visit type were examined. RESULTS From March 17 to May 31, 2020, more than 4,000 audio-only virtual prenatal visits were completed in our system. After implementation, the percentage of visits conducted through the virtual platform gradually rose, with nearly 25% of weekly prenatal visits being performed through the virtual platform by the month of May. Clinic wait times trended downward after implementation of virtual visits (P<.001). On average, 88% of virtual prenatal visits were completed as scheduled, whereas only 82% of in-person visits were attended (P<.001). Hospital administration attempted to contact 431 patients who had participated in at least one virtual visit to assess patient satisfaction; 283 patients were reached and agreed to participate (65%). Ninety-nine percent of respondents reported that their needs were met during their audio-only virtual visits. The majority of patients preferred a combination of in-person and virtual visits for prenatal care, and patients reported many benefits with virtual visits.

Previous studies have observed highly variable alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in patients with COVID-19. However, circulating levels of the cholangiocyte injury biomarker ?3-glutamyltransferase (GGT) have yet to be reported in the existing COVID-19 case studies. Herein, we describe the relationship between GGT levels and clinical and biochemical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Our study is a retrospective case series of 98 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Wenzhou Central Hospital in Wenzhou, China, from January 17 to February 5, 2020. Clinical data were collected using a standardized case report form. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was assessed by symptomatology, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and computed tomography (CT) scan. The medical records of patients were analyzed by the research team. Of the 98 patients evaluated, elevated GGT levels were observed in 32.7%; increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and elevated ALT and AST levels were observed in 22.5%, 13.3%, and 20.4%, respectively; and elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and triglycerides (TGs) were found in 2% and 21.4%, respectively. Initially, in the 82 patients without chronic liver disease and alcohol history; age older than 40 years (P = 0.027); male gender (P = 0.0145); elevated CRP (P = 0.0366), ALT (P < 0.0001), and ALP (P = 0.0003); and increased TGs (P = 0.0002) were found to be associated with elevated GGT levels. Elevated GGT (P = 0.0086) and CRP (P = 0.0162) levels have a longer length of hospital stay. Conclusion: A sizable number of patients with COVID-19 infection had elevated serum GGT levels.

We aim to understand population level variation of nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription in people tested for COVID-19 and the relationship between ACE2 transcription and SARS-CoV-2 viral load, while adjusting for expression of: (i) the complementary protease, Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), (ii) soluble ACE2, (iii) age, and (iv) biological sex. The ACE2 gene was targeted to measure expression of transmembrane and soluble transcripts. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of n = 424 participants aged 1C104 years referred for COVID-19 testing was performed in British Columbia, Canada. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were matched by age and biological sex to patients who tested negative. Viral load and host gene expression were assessed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Bivariate analysis and multiple linear regression were performed to understand the role of nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression in SARS-CoV-2 infection. FINDINGS: Analysis showed no association between age and nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription in those who tested negative for COVID-19 (P = 0?092). Mean relative transcription of transmembrane (P = 0?00012) and soluble (P<0?0001) ACE2 isoforms, as well as TMPRSS2 (P<0?0001) was higher in COVID-19-negative participants than COVID--19 positive ones, yielding a negative correlation between targeted host gene expression and positive COVID-19 diagnosis. In bivariate analysis of COVID-19-positive participants, transcription of transmembrane ACE2 positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load (B = 0?49, R(2)=0?14, P<0?0001), transcription of soluble ACE2 negatively correlated (B= -0?85, R(2)= 0?26, P<0?0001), and no correlation was found with TMPRSS2 transcription (B= -0?042, R(2)=<0?10, P = 0?69). Multivariable analysis showed that the greatest viral RNA loads were observed in participants with high transmembrane ACE2 transcription (= 0?89, 95%CI: [0?59 to 1?18]), while transcription of the soluble isoform appears to protect against high viral RNA load in the upper respiratory tract (= -0?099, 95%CI: [-0?18 to -0?022]). INTERPRETATION: Nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription plays a dual, contrasting role in SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper respiratory tract. Transcription of the transmembrane ACE2 isoform positively correlates, while transcription of the soluble isoform negatively correlates with viral RNA load after adjusting for age, biological sex, and transcription of TMPRSS2.

Methods: We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 NAT positive rates of 4,275 specimens from 532 COVID-19 patients in Sichuan Province with different disease severities, statuses, and stages, as well as different types and numbers of specimens. Results: The total positive rate of the 4,275 specimens was 37.5%. Among seven specimen types, BALF generated a 77.8% positive rate, followed by URT specimens (38.5%), sputum (39.8%), and feces/rectal swabs (34.1%). Specimens from critical cases generated a 43.4% positive rate, which was significantly higher than that of other severities. With specimens from patients at stable status, the SARS-CoV-2 positive rate was 40.6%, which was significantly higher than that of improved status (17.1%), but lower than that of aggravated status (61.5%). Notably, the positive rate of specimens from COVID-19 patients varied significantly from 85 to 95% during 3 days before and after symptom onset, to 20% at around 18 days after symptom onset. In addition, the detection rate increased from 72.1% after testing one throat swab, to 93.2% after testing three consecutive respiratory specimens from each patient. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 NAT detection rates vary with patient disease severity and status, specimen type, number of specimens, and especially disease progression.

The Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Service (MCFRS) observed a decline in both the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and the proportion of resuscitations that resulted in cerebral performance category (CPC) 1 or 2 discharge of the patient beginning in March of 2020. This study examines whether the decline in these performance metrics persists when known COVID positive patients are excluded from the analysis. METHODS Two samples of OHCA patients for similar time periods (one year apart) before and after the start of the COVID pandemic were developed. A database of known COVID positive patients among EMS encounters was used to identify and exclude COVID positive patients. OHCA outcomes in these two groups were then compared using a Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test for difference in proportions and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for difference in means. A two-stage multivariable logistic regression model was used to develop odds ratios for achieving ROSC and CPC 1 or 2 discharge in each period. RESULTS After excluding known COVID patients, 32.5% of the patients in the pre-COVID period achieved ROSC compared to 25.1% in the COVID period (p = 0.007). 6% of patients in the pre-COVID period were discharged with CPC 1 or 2 compared to 3.2% from the COVID era (p = 0.026). Controlling for all available patient characteristics, patients undergoing OHCA resuscitation prior to be beginning of the pandemic were 1.2 times more likely to achieve ROSC and 1.6 times more likely to be discharged with CPC 1 or 2 than non-COVID patients in the pandemic era sample. CONCLUSIONS When known COVID patients are excluded, pre-pandemic OHCA resuscitation patients were more likely to achieve ROSC and CPC 1 or 2 discharge. The prevalence of known COVID positive patients among all OHCA resuscitations during the pandemic was not sufficient to fully account for the marked decrease in both ROSC and CPC 1 or 2 discharges.

In detail, SARS-CoV-2 can be regarded as a sponge to adsorb host immune-related miRNA, which forces host fall into dysfunction status of immune system. Besides, SARS-CoV-2 encodes its own miRNAs, which can enter host cell and are not perceived by the host's immune system, subsequently targeting host function genes to cause illnesses.

Meanwhile, PM2.5 activated the TGF signalling pathway and induced EMT progression in bronchial epithelial cells, thereby contributing to pulmonary fibrosis. Besides, PM2.5 suppressed autophagy of bronchial epithelial cells by up-regulating IL-17A, which in turn activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway. Furthermore, IL-17A impaired the energy metabolism of airway epithelial cells in the PM2.5-induced models.

After completing these works, three different methods are adopted to fit the daily-change tendencies of the number of confirmed cases in mainland China and Hubei Province. The three methods are the Logical Growth Model (LGM), Polynomial fitting, and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN). The analysis results on the spatial-temporal differences and their influencing factors show that: (1) The Chinese government has contained the domestic epidemic in early March 2020, indicating that the number of newly diagnosed cases has almost zero increase since then. (2) Throughout the entire mainland of China, effective manual intervention measures such as community isolation and urban isolation have significantly weakened the influence of the subconscious factors that may impact the spatial differences of the epidemic. (3) The classification results based on the number of confirmed cases also prove the effectiveness of the isolation measures adopted by the governments at all levels in China from another aspect. It is reflected in the small monthly grade changes (even no change) in the provinces of mainland China and the cities in Hubei Province during the study period. Based on the experimental results of curve-fitting and considering the time cost and goodness of fit comprehensively, the Polynomial(Degree = 18) model is recommended in this paper for fitting the daily-change tendency of the number of confirmed cases.","output":"Analysis on the spatio-temporal characteristics of COVID-19 in mainland China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SOURCE CITATION: Soto-Mota A, Marfil-Garza BA, Martinez Rodriguez E, et al.

Reporting of daily hospital COVID-19 deaths in the UK are promoted by the government and scientific advisers alike as a key metric for assessing the progress in the control of the epidemic. These data, however, have certain limitations, among which one of the most significant concerns the fact that the daily totals span deaths that have occurred between 1 and 10 days or more in the past. Data and methods. We obtained daily data published published by NHS England up to and including April 25 in the form of Excel spreadsheets in which deaths counts are presented by date of death according to age and region. Simple descriptive analyses were conducted and presented in graphical and tabular form which were aimed at illustrating the biases inherent in focussing on daily counts regardless of when the deaths occurred. We then looked at how a less biased picture could be obtained by looking at trends in death counts stratifying by individual period of delay in days between occurrence of death and when the death was included in the daily announcement. Findings. The number of hospital COVID-19 deaths announced daily overestimates the maximum number of deaths actually occurring so far in the epidemic in the UK, and also obscures the pattern of decline in deaths. Taking account of reporting delays suggests that for England as a whole a peak in hospital COVID-19 deaths may have been reached on April 8 with a subsequent gradual decline suggested. The same peak is also seen among those aged 60-79 and 80+, although there is slightly shallower decline in the oldest age group (80+ years). Among those aged 40-59 years a later peak on April 11 is evident. London shows a peak on April 8 and a clearer and steeper pattern of subsequent decline compared to England as a whole. Interpretation. Analyses of mortality trends must take account of delay, and in communication with the public more emphasis should be placed on looking at trends based on deaths that occurred 5 or more days prior to the announcement day. The slightly weaker decline seen at age 80+ may reflect increased hospitalisation of people from care homes, whereas the later peak under the age of 60 years may reflect the higher proportions at these younger ages being admitted to critical care resulting in an extension of life of several days.","output":"What can trends in hospital deaths from COVID-19 tell us about the progress and peak of the pandemic?

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted in a tertiary care of hospital from November 2020 to January 2021. All the patients that underwent the isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure were included in the study from June 2017 till June 2020. Data was collected on a data extraction form and stored in SPSS format which was analyzed for qualitative statistics keeping p<0.05 as significant. All the results were represented in the form of tables. RESULTS: A total of 1,613 patients were operated upon for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) procedure during the study period with 1,222 (75.8%) males and 391 (24.2%) females. Dyslipidemia (71.8%) was the most common risk factor. The average perfusion time decreased only slightly (~1 minute) from 96.01 minutes to 95.07 minutes (2017 to 2020). This change however was not significant (p=0.301). The rate of Left Internal Mammary Artery (LIMA) use stayed relatively stable over the 4-year period fluctuating between 88.7% and 92.9% (p=0.360). The average initial ICU stay (in hours), drain at 12 hours and 24 hours stays almost the same. The rate of mortality peaked in 2018 (4.76%) and subsequently fell to 3.57% by 2020. CONCLUSION: More males underwent CABG surgery at this tertiary care hospital and the overall complication rate and per-operative parameters improved over the years. The non-risk stratified mortality in this study was found to be higher than developed nations.","output":"Trends in per-operative parameters and postoperative complications associated with coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG); A four-year retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Legalized use of cannabis products and the rising interest in their therapeutic benefits have opened up new opportunities for therapy and marketing. However, the marked variability in formulations, administration modes, therapeutic regimens, and inter- and intra-subject responses make the standardization of medical cannabis-based regimens difficult. Legalization has made the cannabis market highly competitive and lowered the revenue margins. This study reviews some of the challenges in medical cannabis use and difficulties in standardizing its therapeutic regimens that hinder maximizing its beneficial effects. The development of tolerance toward cannabis and low adherence to chronic administration further impair its long-term beneficial effects. Digital medical cannabis is a cannabis product controlled by a second-generation artificial intelligence (AI) system that improves patient responses by increasing adherence and dealing with tolerance. Second-generation AI systems focus on a single patient's outcome and deal with the inter- and intra-subject variability in responses. The use of digital medical cannabis is expected to improve product standardization, maximize therapeutic benefits, reduce health care costs, and increase the revenue of companies. Digital medical cannabis offers several market differentiators for cannabis companies. This study presents a model for promoting the use of digital medical cannabis and presents its advantages for patients, clinicians, health care authorities, insurance companies, and cannabis manufacturers. Ongoing trials and real-world data on the use of these systems further support the use of digital medical cannabis for improved global health.","output":"Digital Medical Cannabis as Market Differentiator: Second-Generation Artificial Intelligence Systems to Improve Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite many studies on the transmission mechanism of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it remains still challenging to efficiently reduce mortality. In this work, we apply a two-population Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model to investigate the COVID-19 spreading when contacts between elderly and non-elderly individuals are reduced due to the high mortality risk of elderly people. We discover that the reduction of connections between two populations can delay the death curve but cannot well reduce the final mortality. We propose a merged SIR model, which advises elderly individuals to interact less with their non-elderly connections at the initial stage but interact more with their non-elderly relationships later, to reduce the final mortality. Finally, immunizing elderly hub individuals can also significantly decrease mortality.","output":"Two-population SIR model and strategies to reduce mortality in pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate the impact of COVID-19 on 42,401 UK SMEs and how government intervention affects their capability to survive the pandemic. The results show that, without governmental mitigation schemes, 59% of UK SMEs report negative earnings and that their residual life is reduced from 164 to 139 days. The analysis shows that government support scheme reduces the number of SMEs with negative earnings to 49% and allows extending the residual life for SMEs with negative earnings to 194 days. In addition, the support scheme reduces the number of jobs at risk in our sample by around 20%. However, our results suggest that weaker firms benefit more than strong ones. Besides, industries that are worst hit by COVID-19 are not those that benefit most from the government support scheme. We ascribe this result to the fact that the schemes do not discriminate between those firms that deserve support and those that do not deserve it.","output":"When the rainy day is the worst hurricane ever: the effects of governmental policies on SMEs during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study conducted in an EFL setting investigates students' perception of the thesis proposal presentation in an online format due to safety concerns during the Covid-19 pandemic.

People are shopping, socializing, and working online, using technology to replace the in-person experiences of ordinary life. The court system is no exception. In most places, the entire judicial structure became remote at the end of March. However, without sufficient notice and adequate time to prepare, the switch to virtual courts was not a smooth transition. Among issues that went underexamined were the privacy rights of vulnerable members of society who appear in court. Using six states that chose different online platforms as case studies, this Article exposes the troubling consequences the use of virtual courts has had on the rights of minors, mentally ill and incapacitated persons. While this research reveals that privacy protections were often inadequate even before this switch to virtual court, it analyzes the further uneven outcomes after the switch to remote proceedings. Building on these findings, the Article supports the implementation of robust guidelines and specialized courts to protect the privacy interests of vulnerable members of society.","output":"Virtual Court: Privacy and Security of the Vulnerable"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Available COVID-19 data shows higher shares of cases and deaths occur among Black Americans, but reporting of data by race is poor. This paper investigates disparities in county-level mortality rates across counties with higher and lower than national average Black population shares using nonlinear regression decomposition and estimates potential differential impact of social distancing measures. I find counties with Black population shares above the national share have mortality rates 2 to 3 times higher than in other counties. Observable differences in living conditions, health, and work characteristics reduce the disparity to approximately 1.25 to 1.65 overall, and explain 100% of the disparity at 21 days after the first case. Though higher rates of comorbidities in counties with higher Black population shares are an important predictor, living situation factors like single parenthood and population density are just as important. Higher rates of co-residence with grandchildren explain 11% of the 21 day disparity but do not appear important by 42 days, suggesting families may have been better able to protect vulnerable family members later in the epidemic. To analyze differential effects of social distancing measures use two approaches. First, I exploit the timing of interventions relative to the first case among counties that began their epidemic at the same time. Second, I use event study analysis to analyze within-county changes in mortality. Findings for social distancing measures are not always consistent across approaches. Overall, I find no evidence that school closures were less effective in counties with larger Black population shares, and some estimates suggest closures may have disproportionately helped more diverse counties and counties with high rates of grandparent and grandchild co-residence. Conversely, stay at home orders are less clearly associated with mortality in any counties, reaching peak unemployment did not reduce mortality in any models, and some estimates indicate reaching peak unemployment before the first case was associated with higher mortality rates, especially in more diverse counties.","output":"Disparities in COVID-19 mortality by county racial composition and the role of spring social distancing measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater treatment utilities are considered one of the main sources and reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study was to determine the diversity and prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli in wastewater treatment systems across the state of Oregon. Influent, secondary effluent, final effluent, and biosolids were collected from 17 wastewater treatment utilities across Oregon during the winter and summer seasons of 2019 and 2020 (n = 246). E. coli strains were recovered from samples by culturing on mTEC, followed by confirmation with MacConkey with MUG agar plates. Antibiotic susceptibility of 1143 E. coli isolates against 8 antibiotics were determined, and resistance profiles and indices were analyzed between utilities, seasons, and flows. Antibiotic resistance phenotypes were detected in 31.6% of the collected E. coli isolates. Among those antibiotic-resistant E. coli isolates, multi-drug resistance (i.e., resistance to three or more classes of antibiotics) was harbored by 27.7% with some strains showing resistance to up to six classes of antibiotics. The most prevalent resistance was to ampicillin (n = 207) and the most common combinations of multi-drug resistance included simultaneous resistances to ampicillin, streptomycin, and tetracycline (n = 49), followed by ampicillin, streptomycin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (n = 46). Significant correlations were observed between resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and resistances to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline (p < 0.001). A small percentage (1.1%) of the E. coli isolates displayed extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) activity and a single isolate carried resistance to imipenem. Compared to wastewater influent, ciprofloxacin resistance was significantly more prevalent in biosolids (p <0.05) and tetracycline resistance was significantly lower in effluent (p <0.05). Seasonal impact on antibiotic-resistant E. coli in wastewater influent was observed through significantly higher multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index, ampicillin resistance prevalence, and ciprofloxacin resistance prevalence in summer compared to winter (p < 0.05). This state-wide study confirms the widespread distribution of antibiotic-resistant, multi-drug resistant, and extended-spectrum beta lactamase-producing E. coli in wastewater systems across different flows and seasonal variations, making them the recipients, reservoirs, and sources of antimicrobial resistance.","output":"Antibiotic resistance profile of E. coli isolates in 17 municipal wastewater utilities across Oregon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explored differences in the course of physiological functions and in the subjective evaluations in response to listening to a 7-min recording of the sound of a chainsaw and to the sounds of a forest. A Biofeedback 2000x-pert apparatus was used for continual recording of the following physiological functions in 50 examined persons: abdominal and thoracic respiration and their amplitude and frequency, electrodermal activity (skin conductance level), finger skin temperature, heart rate (pulse, blood volume pulse and blood volume pulse amplitude) and heart rate variability (HRV). The group of 25 subjects listening to the sound of a chainsaw exhibited significantly lower values of blood volume pulse amplitude, lower values in peak alpha frequency HRV and higher values in peak high-frequency HRV. In the time interval from 80 s to 209 s, in which the two groups showed the greatest differences, lower values of blood volume pulse were also recorded while listening to the sound of a chainsaw. Listening to the sound of a chainsaw is associated with a greater feeling of fatigue and higher tension, while listening to the sounds of a forest is even considered to elicit feelings of improved learning abilities. The assumption that listening to the sound of a chainsaw results in higher defense arousal was confirmed. The greater variability which is exhibited by a majority of physiological functions while listening to the forest sounds may also be an innovative finding. It seems that there are two types of arousal (sympathetic and parasympathetic) following from correlations between physiological functions and subjective assessment. Low values of blood volume pulse amplitude are especially important from the health perspective. They correspond to the amount of vasoconstriction which occurs in the endothelial dysfunction related to increased mortality, incidence of myocardial infarction, leg atherosclerosis and topically to COVID-19.","output":"Differences in the Course of Physiological Functions and in Subjective Evaluations in Connection With Listening to the Sound of a Chainsaw and to the Sounds of a Forest"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Griffithsin (GRFT) has shown potent anti-HIV activity, and it is being developed as a drug candidate for HIV prevention. Successful implementation requires thorough understanding of its preformulation characterization. In this work, preformulation assessments were conducted to characterize GRFT and identify its degradation pathways under selected conditions of temperature, light, pH, shear, ionic strength, and oxidation. Compatibility with vaginal fluid simulant, vaginal enzymes, Lactobacillus spp., and human cervicovaginal secretions was assessed. The purity, melting temperature, and HIV gp120-binding affinity of GRFT stored at 4C and 25C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were assessed for 2 years. Chemical modifications were evaluated by intact mass analysis and peptide sequencing. Excised human ectocervical tissue permeability and localization of GRFT were evaluated. Our results demonstrated GRFT to be safe and stable under all the preformulation assessment conditions studied except oxidative stress. When GRFT was exposed to hydrogen peroxide or human cervicovaginal secretion, methionine 78 in the protein sequence underwent oxidation. GRFT did not permeate through human cervical tissue but adhered to the superficial epithelial tissue. The 2-year stability study revealed no significant change in GRFTs aggregation, degradation, melting temperature, or gp120-binding affinity despite a slow increase in oxidation over time. These studies elucidated desirable safety and bioactivity profile for GRFT, showing promise as a potential drug candidate for HIV prevention. However, susceptibility to oxidative degradation was identified. Effective protection of GRFT from oxidation is required for further development.","output":"Preformulation Characterization of Griffithsin, a Biopharmaceutical Candidate for HIV Prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AimsNational Vitamin A Plus Campaign (NVAC), 2020 which is a Government Program of Bangladesh was implemented to reduce Childhood blindness, Vitamin A deficiency and boosting immunity along with enhanced leadership skills during COVID-19 pandemic situation.MethodsA Mixed method study was implemented aiming to provide intervention with blue colored vitamin A capsules to children aged between 6 to 11 months and red capsules to children aged between 12 to 59 months covering 120,00 distribution centers (permanent) in entire Bangladesh for two weeks (4-17) October, 2020.

Many oncologists are having challenging conversations with their patients about how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting cancer care and may desire evidence-based communication guidance. Objectives: To identify the clinical scenarios that pose communication challenges, understand patient reactions to these scenarios, and develop a communication guide with sample responses. Design, Setting, and Participants: This qualitative study that was conducted at a single Midwestern academic medical center invited physicians to respond to a brief semistructured interview by email or telephone and then disseminated an anonymous online survey among patients with cancer. Oncology-specific, COVID-19-related clinical scenarios were identified by the physicians, and potential reactions to these scenarios were gleaned from the patient responses to the survey. Health communication experts were invited to participate in the iterative development of a communication guide, comprising 3 essential communication principles and strategies and informed by insights from physicians and patients. This study was conducted from March 25, 2020, to April 2, 2020. Interventions: Expert review, interviews, and surveys assessing challenging situations specific to cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures: Oncology-specific, COVID-19-related clinical scenarios from physician interviews; responses to each scenario from patient surveys; and applicable communication principles from health communication expert literature review. Results: Of the 8 physicians who participated in interviews, 4 were men (50%) and 4 were women (50%). These physicians represented the following disciplines: internal medicine (n = 1), hematology/oncology (n = 2), radiation oncology (n = 3), and surgical oncology (n = 2). Their disease site specialization included cancers of the breast, head and neck, melanoma, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts.

The physicians identified 8 oncology-specific, COVID-19-related scenarios in which communication might be challenging: (1) worse outcomes from COVID-19, (2) delay in cancer screening, (3) delay in diagnostic workup, (4) delay in initiation of treatment, (5) offer of nonstandard treatment, (6) treatment breaks, (7) delay in follow-up imaging or care, and (8) inability to be admitted into the hospital for management. Potential patient reactions to each of these scenarios were compiled from survey responses. For most scenarios, patient reactions involved anger, fear, and anxiety (eg, \\"I'm scared\\"; \\"This isn't fair. I am upset.\\"). These emotional patient responses informed the selection of the 3 general communication principles, which suggested language and strategies that physicians can use to respond to patients. Conclusions and Relevance: In this qualitative study, physicians and patients identified communication needs used by health communication experts to inform the development of a practical, evidence-based communication guide for oncology care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Perspectives on Oncology-Specific Language During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Southern China is a hotspot of emerging infectious diseases, in which dwell diverse species of bats, a large group of flying mammals considered natural reservoirs for zoonotic viruses. Recently, divergent filoviruses (FiVs) have been identified in bats within this region, which pose a potential risk to public health, but their true infection situation in bats remains largely unclear. Here, 689 archived bat serum samples were analyzed by ELISA, western blot and neutralization assay to investigate the seroprevalence and cross-reactivity of four divergent FiVs and two other viruses (Rabies virus and Tuhoko pararubulavirus 1) of different families within the order Mononegavirales Results showed no cross-antigenicity between FiVs and other mononegaviruses, but different cross-reactivity among the FiVs themselves. The total FiV seroreactive rate was 36.3% (250/689), with infection by the indigenous Chinese FiV DH04 or antigenically-related one being the most widely and the most highly prevalent. Further viral metagenomic analysis of fruit bat tissues also identified the gene sequence of a novel FiV. These results indicate the likely prevalence of other so far unidentified FiVs within Chinese bat population, with frugivorous Rousettus leschenaulti and Eonycteris spelaea bats and insectivorous Myotis horsfieldii and M. schreibersi bats being their major reservoirs.IMPORTANCE Bats are natural hosts of many FiVs, from which diverse FiVs were serologically or virologically detected in Africa, Europe and East Asia. Recently, very divergent FiVs were identified in Chinese bat population, but their antigenic relationship with other known FiVs remains unknown. Here we conducted serological characterization and investigation of Chinese indigenous FiVs and prototypes of other viruses in bats. Results indicated that Chinese indigenous FiVs are antigenically distant to other FiVs and infection of novel or multiple FiVs occurred in Chinese bats with FiV DH04 or antigenically-related one being the most widely and the most highly prevalent. Additionally, besides Rousettus leschenaulti and Eonycteris spelaea bats, the insectivorous Myotis horsfieldii and M. schreibersi bats are highly preferential hosts of FiVs. Seroreactive and viral metagenomic results indicated that more as yet unknown bat-borne FiVs circulate in the Southern China, and to uncover them further investigation and timely surveillance is needed.","output":"Seroreactive profiling of filoviruses in Chinese bats reveals extensive infection of diverse viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Literature reviews represent an important type of study for the various professions in healthcare. The consideration and inclusion of grey literature is gaining importance in all types of reviews. However, searching for grey literature is challenging for different reasons and the search is often insufficiently transparently reported in reviews. The aim of this protocol is to describe our planned methodical approach for a scoping review with a specific focus on grey literature related to the topic of consulting according to 7a of the German Social Law, Book XI (SGB XI) for people with dementia and their relatives in Germany. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use the following search strategies: (1) search in the German electronic databases, for example, Livivo and GeroLit (via GBV), (2) google search engines, (3) targeted websites, for example, Alzheimers association and (4) contact experts, for example, stakeholders of private care insurance companies who provide consulting according to 7a SGB XI. Additionally, we will conduct a search in the academic electronic databases MEDLINE (via PubMed) and CINAHL (via EBSCO). For included grey literature, we will conduct a backward citation tracking via reference lists. For included scientific articles, we will conduct a backward (via reference lists) and forward (via Google scholar) citation tracking. Each strategy will be conducted by one reviewer. Screening of the identified potentially relevant records will be conducted in Covidence by two reviewers independently. Results will be charted in a table and illustrated descriptively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: There are no ethical concerns with conducting a scoping review. We will discuss our results regarding consulting according to 7a SGB XI for people with dementia and their relatives with a variety of stakeholders in Germany. We will disseminate the thematic results and the methodological reflection of our search approach in the form of articles in peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed journals.","output":"Consulting concepts and structures for people with dementia in Germany: a protocol for a grey-shaded scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been one of the most significant challenges to humankind in centuries. The extremely contagious nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has put forth an immense pressure on the health sector. In order to mitigate the stress on the healthcare systems especially to battle the crisis of mechanical ventilators, we have designed a modular, and robust DIY ventilator, ATMO-Vent (Atmospheric Mixture Optimization Ventilator) which can be fully mounted within two days by two operators. The ATMO-Vent has been designed using low-cost, robust, Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components, with many features comparable to a full-fledged ventilator. ATMO-Vent has been designed based on the United Kingdom Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (UK-MHRA) guidelines for Rapidly Manufactured Ventilator System (RMVS), yet scalable to the specific requirements of different countries. ATMO-Vent is capable of adjusting the Fraction of Inspiratory Oxygen (FiO(2)) levels, Tidal Volume (TV), frequency of breaths, Inspiratory/Expiratory ratio (I/E), Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) and Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP). ATMO-Vent can operate in two modes - Continuous Mandatory Ventilation (CMV) using Volume-Controlled Ventilation (VCV) and in Assisted Control (AC) mode with pressure triggered by the patient.

We described the effects of different National Containment Measures on positive NST (Nasopharyngeal Swab Test) trend, epidemiological links and main clinical features of the largest Italian Pediatric cohort admitted to a single regional Pediatric Emergency Department Hub for COVID-19, during an eight-month period.Methods: We described 316 patients with a positive NST for SARS-CoV2, on a total of 5001 nasopharyngeal swabs performed among 13171 admissions at our PED, over a period starting from March 17th, 2020 to December 1st, 2020. Age, epidemiological link, clinical features and hospitalizations were analyzed according to different lockdown phases. Data were collected anonymously from electronic records and analyzed using SPSS 22.00 statistics software (Chicago, IL).Findings: Thirty-six percent of total admissions have been tested for SARS-CoV2. During the post Lockdown period we performed the highest percentage of NST (Nasopharyngeal Swab Test) 49,7% and found the highest percentage of positive NST on total NST effectuated 7,9%. Mean age was 6.5 years old. The 0-6 years age group accounted the highest number of positive NST. Familial link is predominant during all phases;however, we observed an increase of extra-familial and unknown link starting from the phase 4, especially among adolescents. Seventeen patients showed an intra-scholastic link. Older children were frequently symptomatic and accounted for the 1% admission in ICU (Intensive Care Unit). Seven patients were admitted with MIS-C diagnosis.Interpretation: Different levels of containment measures caused important changes in epidemiological link, mean age and number of admissions and hospitalization of patients with COVID-19.

Much of the immune system is located within the GI tract, since it must deal with the huge antigenic load introduced with food. Moreover, the incidence of immune-mediated diseases is elevated in Westernized countries, where transition nutrition prevails, owing to the shift from traditional dietary patterns towards Westernized patterns. This ecological correlation has fostered increasing attempts to find evidence to support nutritional interventions aimed at managing and reducing the risk of immune-mediated diseases. Recent studies have described the impacts of single nutrients on markers of immune function, but the knowledge currently available is not sufficient to demonstrate the impact of specific dietary patterns on immune-mediated clinical disease endpoints. If nutritional scientists are to conduct quality research, one of many challenges facing them, in studying the complex interactions between the immune system and diet, is to develop improved tools for investigating eating habits in the context of immunomediated diseases.","output":"How to Tackle the Relationship between Autoimmune Diseases and Diet: Well Begun Is Half-Done"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) is considered the gold standard for detecting sleep loss and circadian misalignment related changes in performance in laboratory and field settings. This short 3-, 5- or 10-min test appraises an individual's sustained vigilant attention on a visual stimulus through reaction time, false starts and performance lapses. The PVT has been widely used as a measure to assess vigilant attention among shift workers, but information evaluating the application and performance of this test in different naturalistic shift work settings is limited. The purpose of this review is to synthesise and evaluate existing literature which has used the PVT to assess and monitor psychomotor performance in response to shift work schedules and rosters performed in real-world settings. METHODS A systematic search of studies examining PVT performance in response to 24/7 shift work schedules (e.g., day, afternoon, evening and night shifts) performed under naturalistic conditions was conducted. Articles were identified by searching Medline, Embase, CINHAL and PsycINFO databases in April 2020. RESULTS The search yielded 135 results, of which 16 publications were suitable to be included in this review. Articles were grouped according to when the PVT was applied to a research cohort, which included (a) multiple instances per shift, (b) commencement and cessation of shift and (c) other varying times. CONCLUSIONS This review suggests PVT performance is typically congruent across studies when the test is applied at generally consistent time intervals.

Intrinsically, the results have demonstrated that the effectiveness of natural ventilation has directly influenced reducing the risks of transmitting airborne infectious viruses for the selected heritage building in Jeddah (Saudi Arabia). The adopted methods in this research may be useful to understand the potentials of conserving old heritage buildings.

We analysed the abrupt reduction in fishing pressure of the mixed small-scale and industrial fisheries in the Catalan Sea, Spanish Mediterranean, and resulting ecological and economic impacts during the first half of 2020. We used detailed fisheries data on fishing effort, landings, revenues, landings per unit of effort (LPUE) and revenues per unit of effort from January to June 2020, and complemented it with the outcomes of a marine ecosystem model. We analysed data from 2017-2019 and compared these to 2020 to characterise changes in the fishing activity from before (January-February) to during (March-May) the lockdown. Fishing effort during the lockdown dropped by 34%, landings were down by 49% and revenues declined by 39% in comparison with the same period in 2017-2019. LPUEs did not show significant changes during the lockdown, with the exception of shrimp species, especially the deep-water rose shrimp, which significantly increased in LPUE during March-May. These increases may reflect positive effects of reduced fishing on fast-growing species. Positive effects mostly disappeared in June 2020 with the relaxation of the lockdown. In agreement, the ecological simulations projected slight short-term increases of biomass for fast-growing, small-sized organisms during 2020, which quickly vanished when fishing resumed, and which had no detectable ecosystem effects. Three additional alternative ecological simulations illustrated that to substantially recover commercial species and ensure ecosystem sustainability in the study area, a sustained and notable reduction of fishing activity would be needed.","output":"Socio-ecological implications of COVID-19 in marine fisheries from the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\related government outlays will increase the level of government debt.

METHODS: We collected data on 461,083 screening mammograms and 112,207 diagnostic mammograms conducted during January 2019 through July 2020 at 62 radiology facilities in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. We compared monthly screening and diagnostic mammography volumes before and during the pandemic, stratified by age, race/ethnicity, breast density, and family history of breast cancer. RESULTS: Screening and diagnostic mammography volumes in April 2020 were 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.5% to 2.4%) and 21.4% (95% CI = 18.7% to 24.4%) of April 2019 pre-pandemic volumes, respectively, but by July 2020 rebounded to 89.7% (95% CI = 79.6% to 101.1%) and 101.6% (95% CI = 93.8% to 110.1%) of July 2019 pre-pandemic volumes, respectively.

The literature on epidemics indicates that the early diagnosis of a coronavirus infection can lead to a reduction in mortality rates. To prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from spreading, the regular identification and monitoring of infected patients are needed. In this regard, wireless body area networks (WBANs) can be used in conjunction with machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) to identify and monitor the human body for health-related information, which in turn can aid in the early diagnosis of diseases. This paper proposes a novel coronavirus-body area network (CoV-BAN) model based on IoT technology as a real-time health monitoring system for the detection of the early stages of coronavirus infection using a number of wearable biosensors to examine the health status of the patient. The proposed CoV-BAN model is tested with five machine learning-based classification methods, including random forest, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, support vector machine and multi-layer perceptron classifiers, to optimize the accuracy of the diagnosis of COVID-19. For the long-term sustainability of the sensor devices, the development of energy-efficient WBAN is critical. To address this issue, a long-range (LoRa)-based IoT program is used to receive biosensor signals from the patient and transmit them to the cloud directly for monitoring. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model using the random forest classifier outperforms models using the other classifiers, with an average accuracy of 88.6%.

No statistically significant difference was determined between the survivor and non-survivor groups with respect to age and gender, presence of any comorbidity, leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte values. Platelet count and hemoglobin count were significantly lower in the group with mortality than in the group with recovery. CONCLUSION: It should be kept in mind that low hemoglobin and platelet levels contribute to mortality. In addition, it is important to protect patients with hematological cancer from COVID-19 and undertake effective vaccination due to its mortal course.","output":"The outcome of COVID-19 in patients with hematological malignancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Face masks and respirators are the most widely used intervention measures for respiratory protection. In the wake of COVID-19, in response to shortages and lack of availability of surgical masks and respirators, the use of cloth masks has become a research focus. Various fabrics have been promoted with little evidence-based foundation and without guidelines on design principles for optimal performance. In these circumstances, it is essential to understand the properties, key performance factors, filter mechanisms and evidence on cloth masks materials. The general community might also need to decontaminate and reuse disposable, single-use devices as a last resort. We present an overview of the filter materials, filter mechanisms and effectiveness, key performance factors, and hydrophobicity of the common disposable masks, as well as cloth masks. We also reviewed decontamination methods for disposable respiratory devices. As an alternative to surgical masks and respirators, we recommend a cloth mask made of at least three layers (300-350 threads per inch) and adding a nylon stocking layer over the mask for a better fit. Water-resistant fabrics (polyesters/nylon), blends of fabrics and water-absorbing fabrics (cotton) should be in the outside layer, middle layer/layers and inside layer, respectively. The information outlined here will help people to navigate their choices if facing shortages of appropriate respiratory protection during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Last-resort strategies during mask shortages: optimal design features of cloth masks and decontamination of disposable masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented and has led to drastic reductions in non-urgent medical visits. Deferral of these visits may have critical health impact, including delayed diagnosis for melanoma and other skin cancers. We examined the influence of the pandemic on skin biopsy rates in a large population-based cohort. METHODS: Using a universal health care claims dataset from Ontario, we examined skin biopsies from January 6, 2020 to September 27, 2020, and compared these to the same period for 2019. Those diagnosed with anogenital cancers, younger than 20 years, residing out-of-province and with lapses in coverage were excluded. The sensitivity and specificity of claims diagnoses compared to a validated algorithm to identify keratinocyte carcinoma (KC), or to the cancer registry for melanoma was evaluated. Factors associated with biopsy during the early pandemic were investigated with modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: A precipitous drop in total skin biopsies (15% of expected), biopsies for KC (18%) and melanoma (27%) was seen with the onset of COVID-19 cases (p<0.01). Claims diagnoses were of high specificity for KC (99%), and for melanoma (98%), though sensitivity was less (61%, 28% respectively). In adjusted analysis, the elderly (80+ years), females and residents of certain regions were less likely to be biopsied during the pandemic. Subsequently, there were substantial improvements in biopsy rates over 10 weeks. However, compared to 2019, a large backlog of expected cases still remained 28 weeks after lockdown (45,710 all biopsy, 9,104 KC, 595 melanoma). INTERPRETATION: A drastic reduction in skin biopsies is noted early in the COVID-19 pandemic; this disproportionately affected the elderly, females and certain geographic regions. Though biopsies subsequently increased, a large backlog of cases remained after almost half a year. This will have implications for downstream care of skin cancer. Efforts should be made to limit diagnostic delay.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on skin cancer diagnosis: A population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreaks on pig farms have caused significant economic loss in the swine industry since it was first reported in Thailand a decade ago. Anecdotal evidence suggests that PEDV is now endemic in this region, therefore genome information of circulating PEDV is important for molecular surveillance and evaluation of potential benefits of field vaccination. Here, we characterized PEDV infection on commercial Thai swine farms by screening 769 samples of feces and small intestinal contents from pigs with diarrhea between 2011 and 2016. Using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting the spike (S) gene, 153 PEDV-positive samples were further subjected to analysis of the open reading frame 3 and nucleocapsid (N) genes. Comparison of 95 samples in which nucleotide sequencing was successfully obtained for all three genes revealed evolutionary diversity among the Thai PEDV strains. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that although some Thai strains changed little from years past, others resembled more closely to the recent strains reported in China. Interestingly, eight Thai PEDV strains possessed amino acid deletions in the N protein. The PEDV sequence divergence may be responsible for driving periodic outbreaks and continued persistence of PEDV on commercial swine farms. Our findings provide important insight into regional PEDV strains in circulation, which may assist future inclusions of suitable strains for future PEDV vaccines.","output":"Analysis of the spike, ORF3, and nucleocapsid genes of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus circulating on Thai swine farms, 2011C2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been an increase in stress in adolescents since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The study explored differences in perceptions regarding students' VAI and penalties for VAI among 1482 students and 42 faculty members. Furthermore, we explored the impact of socio-demographic characteristics (ethnic majority vs. minority students), gender, and academic degree on the perceived severity of VAI. Presented with a battery of scenarios, participants assessed the severity of penalties imposed by a university disciplinary committee. Furthermore, participants selected the penalties they deemed appropriate for violations engaged in by students, including: reprimanding, financial, academic, and accessibility penalties. All participants tended to suggest more severe penalties for VAI conducted in traditional analog environments than for the same offenses in digital settings. Students perceived all four types of penalties imposed by the disciplinary committee to be significantly more severe than faculty members. Moreover, findings demonstrated a significant difference between faculty and students in both perceptions of the severity of VAI and in relation to suggested punishments.

However, the mechanisms underlying these correlations are not fully known. Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients who underwent reconstructive surgery for pressure ulcers (PUs) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were included in this study. The patients postoperative progression was registered, and the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (s-WAT) surrounding the ulcers was analyzed by proteomic and immunohistochemical assays to identify the molecular/cellular signatures of impaired recovery. Patients with SCI and a COVID-19-positive diagnosis showed worse recovery and severe postoperative complications, requiring reintervention. Several proteins were upregulated in the adipose tissue of these patients. Among them, CKMT2 and CKM stood out, and CKM increased for up to 60 days after the COVID-19 diagnosis. Moreover, CKMT2 and CKM were largely found in MGCs within the s-WAT of COVID patients. Some of these proteins presented post-translational modifications and were targeted by autoantibodies in the serum of COVID patients. Overall, our results indicate that CKMT2, CKM, and the presence of MGCs in the adipose tissue surrounding PUs in post-COVID patients could be predictive biomarkers of postsurgical complications.

In fact, patients' goals for treatment are to return to premorbid levels of functioning. This highlights the importance of assessing both functional outcomes and symptom improvement when evaluating the efficacy of antidepressant medication. Not all patients who achieve symptomatic response/remission will achieve a functional response/remission. In two studies (one with agomelatine and one with escitalopram), 54% of patients receiving agomelatine and 47% of those receiving escitalopram achieved a symptomatic response, and 53% of patients in each study achieved a functional response. However, 42% of patients receiving agomelatine and 35% of those receiving escitalopram had both a symptomatic and a functional response. The four symptoms of depression with the most marked effect on function are sad mood, impaired concentration, fatigue, and loss of interest. Low energy is particularly associated with poor occupational functioning, highlighting the importance of ongoing assessment of patients with depression, focusing particular attention on the symptoms that affect their ability to function, such as fatigue. Depending on the type of residual symptoms, some patients may benefit from combination therapy, such as adding dopamine modulator therapy. Antidepressant therapy is only effective if patients continue to take their medication, and high rates of early discontinuation have been reported. Therefore, when selecting treatment for depression, physicians can maximize the likelihood of adherence and persistence by taking into account both the antidepressant efficacy of treatment, its adverse effects and acceptability to patients.","output":"Beyond Response: Aiming for Quality Remission in Depression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Data on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients disaggregated by race/ethnicity remain limited. We evaluated the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients across racial/ethnic groups and assessed their associations with COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined 629,953 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 in a large health system spanning California, Oregon, and Washington between March 1 and December 31, 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from electronic health records. Odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and in-hospital death were assessed with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: 570,298 patients with known race/ethnicity were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 27.8% were non-White minorities. 54,645 individuals tested positive, with minorities representing 50.1%. Hispanics represented 34.3% of infections but only 13.4% of tests. While generally younger than White patients, Hispanics had higher rates of diabetes but fewer other comorbidities. 8,536 patients were hospitalized and 1,246 died, of whom 56.1% and 54.4% were non-White, respectively. Racial/ethnic distributions of outcomes across the health system tracked with state-level statistics. Increased odds of testing positive and hospitalization were associated with all minority races/ethnicities. Hispanic patients also exhibited increased morbidity, and Hispanic race/ethnicity was associated with in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.39 [95% CI: 1.14-1.70]). CONCLUSION: Major healthcare disparities were evident, especially among Hispanics who tested positive at a higher rate, required excess hospitalization and mechanical ventilation, and had higher odds of in-hospital mortality despite younger age. Targeted, culturally-responsive interventions and equitable vaccine development and distribution are needed to address the increased risk of poorer COVID-19 outcomes among minority populations.","output":"Characteristics and Factors Associated with COVID-19 Infection, Hospitalization, and Mortality Across Race and Ethnicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of economies and energy usage can significantly impact the carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries.

We find that, 4h after the administration, both poly I:C and resiquimod elevated the levels of IL-6, TNF, and chemokines including CCL2 and CCL5, in maternal plasma. Both agents also increased placental mRNA levels of IL-6 and IL-10, but only resiquimod increased placental TNF mRNA. In foetal brain, poly I:C produced no detectable immune-response-related increases, whereas pronounced increases in cytokine (e.g. Il-6, Tnf) and chemokine (e.g. Ccl2, Ccl5) expression were observed with maternal resiquimod administration.

To understand the functional roles of the two structural parts of the SARS-CoV main protease, we generated the full-length of this enzyme as well as several terminally truncated forms, different from each other only by the number of amino acid residues at the C- or N-terminal regions. The quaternary structure and K(d) value of the protease were analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation. The results showed that the N-terminal 1C3 amino acid-truncated protease maintains 76% of enzyme activity and that the major form is a dimer, as in the wild type. However, the amino acids 1C4-truncated protease showed the major form to be a monomer and had little enzyme activity. As a result, the fourth amino acid seemed to have a powerful effect on the quaternary structure and activity of this protease.

RESULTS Classic plasma markers of endothelial injury, tPA and sTM significantly elevated in SARS patients in comparison to controls [t-PA: 1.48 +/- 0.16 nmol/L versus 0.25 +/- 0.03 nmol/L (P<0.0001), and sTM: 0.26 +/- 0.06 nmol/L versus 0.14 +/- 0.02 nmol/L (P<0.05)]. The only patient who died had extremely high levels of these endothelial injury markers (t-PA: 2.77 nmol/L and sTM: 1.01 nmol/L). The likelihood ratio analysis indicated the excellent discriminating power for SARS at the optimal cut-point of 0.49 nmol/L for tPA and 0.20 nmol/L for sTM, respectively. Significant numerical correlations were found among these endothelial injury markers in SARS patients. The numerical coefficient of correlation Pearson r between t-PA and sTM was 0.5867 (P<0.05). CONCLUSION Increased plasma concentrations of tPA and sTM in patients with SARS suggest the possibility of endothelial injury. SARS patients might need anticoagulant therapy or fibrinolytic therapy in order to reverse intraalveolar coagulation, microthrombi formation, alveolar and interstitial fibrin deposition. It may not only provide a useful treatment and prognostic index but also allow a further understanding of the pathological condition of the disease.","output":"Elevated plasma tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and soluble thrombomodulin in patients suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as a possible index for prognosis and treatment strategy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Clinical microbiology should have a physical presence, but not necessarily on-site diagnostic laboratory facilities, in each hospital to ensure a quality laboratory-based infection service and strong professional interaction with clinicians. The adoption of industrial practices and the introduction of new costly molecular techniques raise the possibility that non-microbiological functions of laboratory management could be left to management professionals. This remains highly controversial; the advantages must be contrasted with the potential to disrupt the traditional managerial responsibility of the microbiologist and the links between the laboratory and clinical staff. Managers and healthcare professionals must resolve this issue, perhaps with the support of the ESCMID. Views varied, according to current professional arrangements and size of the laboratory and population served, on whether there should be a common laboratory for microbiology and other pathology disciplines with joint access to new high-technology techniques, or whether microbiology must continue as a separate facility. Clinical microbiology and infection control were viewed as core services that must be present even in smaller hospitals. Larger community hospitals and teaching centres require a full complement of expertise in laboratory and clinical practice. Integration of these disciplines within a department of infection is an emerging concept. A concern was the shortfall in trained expertise because of the ageing nature of current specialists. The importance of recruiting talented new graduates was emphasised. The importance of this topic led to a recommendation that an ESCMID working party be established to investigate the current arrangements of infection services in Europe and to make recommendations for the future organisation.","output":"Report of working group 2: Healthcare needs in the organisation and management of infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During March 27-July 14, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network extended its surveillance to hospital capacities responding to COVID-19 pandemic.

We designed this retrospective case series to describe the diagnostic categories seen through telehealth, management steps completed during video visits, and to understand whether additional in-person care was required within 90 days of video visits. In addition, we estimated time and cost savings for patients attributed to video visits. RESULTS: Most men seen during video visits had an endocrinologic (29%) or anatomic (21%) cause for their infertility. 73% of video visits involved reviewing results; 30% included counseling regarding assistive reproductive technologies; and 25% of video visits resulted in prescribing hormonally active medications. The two patients (3%) who were seen in clinic after their video visit underwent a varicocelectomy in the interim. No patients required an unplanned in-person visit. From a patient perspective, video visits were estimated to save a median of 97 minutes (IQR 64-250) of travel per visit. Median cost savings per patient- by avoiding travel and taking time off work for a clinic visit-were estimated to range from $149 (half day off) to $252 (full day off).

Interactions between sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein have been identified as participating in viral adherence and infectivity. The spike glycoprotein binds to respiratory epithelium through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which endogenously interacts with Angiotensin (Ang) II to yield Angiotensin 1-7. Stimulation of human vascular smooth muscle cells by Ang II leads to increased mRNA expression of two chondroitin sulfotransferases (CHST11 and CHST15), which are required for synthesis of chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) and chondroitin 4,6-disulfate (CSE), respectively. Total sulfated GAGs, increased sulfotransferase activity, and increased expression of the proteoglycans biglycan, syndecan-1, perlecan, and versican followed treatment by Ang II. Candesartan, an Angiotensin II receptor blocker (Arb), largely, but incompletely, inhibited these increases, and the differences from baseline remained significant. These results suggest that another effect of Ang II also contributes to the increased expression of chondroitin sulfotransferases, total sulfated GAGs, and proteoglycans. We hypothesize that activation of ACE2 may contribute to these increases and suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein interaction with ACE2 may also increase chondroitin sulfotransferases, sulfated GAGs, and proteoglycans and thereby contribute to viral adherence to bronchioalveolar cells and to respiratory compromise in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Increased expression of chondroitin sulfotransferases and proteoglycans follows AngII and may help explain pathophysiology underlying Covid-19 respiratory failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Rapid technology development due to the introduction of Industrial Revolution 4.0 and Internet of Things has created a demand and gradual transition from traditional teaching and learning to technology-based learning in higher education, including healthcare education. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this process, with educators now required to quickly adapt to and adopt such changes. The abundance of available systematic reviews has made the effectiveness of such approaches ambiguous especially in healthcare education. Therefore, a protocol of the overview of systematic reviews (OoSR) is planned to extrapolate the effectiveness of technology-based learning in undergraduate healthcare education. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Scopus, CINAHL, Academic Search Complete, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection databases were selected. Screening was conducted independently by at least two authors and the decision for inclusion was done through discussion or involvement of an arbiter against a predetermined criteria. Included articles will be evaluated for quality using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews and Risk of Bias in Systematic Review tools, while primary systematic review articles will be cross-checked and reported for any overlapping using the 'corrected covered area' method. Only narrative synthesis will be employed according to the predefined themes into two major dimensions-theory and knowledge generation (focusing on cognitive taxonomy due to its ability to be generalised across disciplines), and clinical-based competence (focusing on psychomotor and affective taxonomies due to discipline-specific influence). The type of technology used will be identified and extracted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The OoSR involves analysis of secondary data from published literature, thus ethical approval is not required. The findings will provide a valuable insight for policymakers, stakeholders, and researchers in terms of technology-based learning implementation and gaps identification. The findings will be published in several reports due to the extensiveness of the topic and will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conferences.

The purpose of this study was to validate the Serbian CSS (Serbian-CSS) and to explore its predictive power over and above certain sociodemographic characteristics, individual difference variables (attitudes and personality) and general distress in relation to COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Study design An online cross-sectional study was conducted that targeted users of different social network groups at the beginning of the public COVID-19 vaccination programme in Serbia. Methods A large, online study sample (N = 3129) provided self-reported data on COVID-19 related distress, health and sociodemographic indicators, individual difference variables and attitudes towards vaccination. Results The Serbian-CSS is a valid and reliable instrument that assesses six dimensions of COVID-19 distress. The strongest predictors of vaccine acceptance were attitudes towards immigrants (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31, 0.41), followed by education (AOR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.27, 1.88) and pre-pandemic mental health issues (AOR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.30, 2.01). Conclusions The level of distress measured by the CSS had a non-substantial contribution to vaccine acceptance, which is probably due to the mild level of distress that was observed at the time of assessment.

DESIGN-Anonymous mail-out population survey. PROCEDURES-In 2005 a questionnaire was mailed to US small animal, large animal, and equine veterinarians who were randomly selected from the AVMA membership to assess precaution awareness (PA) and veterinarians' perceptions of zoonotic disease risks. Respondents were assigned a PA score (0 to 4) on the basis of their responses (higher scores representing higher stringency of ICPs); within a practice type, respondents' scores were categorized as being within the upper 25% or lower 75% of scores (high and low PA ranking, respectively). Characteristics associated with low PA rankings were assessed. RESULTS-Generally, respondents did not engage in protective behaviors or use personal protective equipment considered appropriate to protect against zoonotic disease transmission. Small animal and equine veterinarians employed in practices that had no written infection control policy were significantly more likely to have low PA ranking. Male gender was associated with low PA ranking among small animal and large animal veterinarians; equine practitioners not working in a teaching or referral hospital were more likely to have low PA ranking than equine practitioners working in such institutions. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE-Results indicated that most US veterinarians are not aware of appropriate personal protective equipment use and do not engage in practices that may help reduce zoonotic disease transmission.

The search for the understanding of the disease spreading made scientists around the world turn their attention to epidemiological studies. An interesting approach in epidemiological modeling nowadays is to use agent-based models, which allow to consider a heterogeneous population and to evaluate the role of superspreaders in this population. In this work, we implemented an agent-based model using probabilistic cellular automata to simulate SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) dynamics using COVID-19 infection parameters. Differently to the usual studies, we did not define the superspreaders individuals a priori, we only left the agents to execute a random walk along the sites. When two or more agents share the same site, there is a probability to spread the infection if one of them is infected. To evaluate the spreading, we built the transmission network and measured the degree distribution, betweenness, and closeness centrality. The results displayed for different levels of mobility restriction show that the degree reduces as the mobility reduces, but there is an increase of betweenness and closeness for some network nodes. We identified the superspreaders at the end of the simulation, showing the emerging behavior of the model since these individuals were not initially defined. Simulations also showed that the superspreaders are responsible for most of the infection propagation and the impact of personal protective equipment in the spreading of the infection. We believe that this study can bring important insights for the analysis of the disease dynamics and the role of superspreaders, contributing to the understanding of how to manage mobility during a highly infectious pandemic as COVID-19.","output":"Impact of mobility restriction in COVID-19 superspreading events using agent-based model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate the relationship between BCG vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 by bioinformatic approach.

METHODS: Florida county COVID-19 infection and death counts reported through March 2021 were supplemented with socioeconomic characteristics and 2020 presidential results to form the dataset employed in this ecological study. Poisson regression analysis measured the association of infection and mortality rates with county demographic and economic characteristics, then assessed the moderating role of county political preferences. RESULTS: Counties with higher proportions of Black residents experience disproportionately higher COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. Disparities are further inflated in counties with larger Republican vote shares. That voting effect extends to Hispanic population proportions and segregation, both of which are associated with higher COVID-19 infection and mortality rates in more Republican-leaning counties. CONCLUSIONS: Communities challenged by pre-existing health disparities, segregation, and economic hardship before the pandemic bear disproportionate risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality. Factors associated with voter preference for the 2020 Republican presidential candidate compound those problems, worsening consequences for all county residents, suggesting deeper structural health challenges.","output":"COVID-19 Infections and Mortality in Florida Counties: Roles of Race, Ethnicity, Segregation, and 2020 Election Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Balancing the use of antibacterial therapy against selection for resistance in this pandemic era has introduced both questions and guidelines. In this project, we explored how prescription of empirical antibacterial therapy differs between those with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine whether COVID-19 status and other factors play a role in the prescription of antibacterial therapy in an inpatient setting at a large referral academic medical centre. Further analysis was conducted to determine whether these factors differ between those testing positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Of 405 patients in the cohort, 175 received antibacterial therapy and 296 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. A positive SARS-CoV-2 test carried an OR of 0.3 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.49) for receiving antibacterial treatment in the first 48 h after admission (P < 0.0001) adjusting for age and procalcitonin results. Patients were 1% and 3% less likely to receive antibacterials for every year increase in age in the overall group and among those testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Younger age was found to impact use of antibacterial therapy in both the overall analysis as well as the SARS-CoV-2 negative subgroup (P = 0.03 and P = 0.01). High procalcitonin values were found to be associated with increased antibacterial therapy use in both the overall and stratified analyses.

The present study was aimed at assessing the relationship between the most abundant essential microelements (iron, zinc and copper) and their major binding proteins in the circulation in the early stage of infection. The concentration of zinc ions was measured to be higher in infected than in healthy persons, as well as ratios zinc/albumin and zinc/alpha-2-macroglobulin. Increased zinc levels could be attributed to cellular redistribution of zinc ions or to a use of zinc supplementation (zinc concentration was above the upper reference limit in one-third of infected individuals). Immunoblot analysis of protein molecular forms revealed that infected persons had greater amounts of proteinase-bound alpha-2-macroglobulin tetramer and albumin monomer than healthy individuals. The quantities of these forms were correlated with the concentration of zinc ions (r = 0.42 and 0.55, respectively) in healthy persons, but correlations were lost in infected individuals, most likely due to very high zinc concentrations in some participants which were not proportionally followed by changes in the distribution of protein species. Although we still have to wait for a firm confirmation of the involvement of zinc in beneficial defense mechanisms in patients with Covid-19, it seems that this ion may contribute to the existence of circulating protein forms which are the most optimal.

The evaluation was narrowed to two mRNA vaccines and two modified adenovirus vectored vaccines. METHODSA frequentist random effects meta-analysis was carried out after data extraction. Risk of bias of the included studies was assessed using New-Castle-Ottawa Scale. The overall risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was estimated in partially and fully vaccinated individuals. The effect size was expressed as Relative Risk (RR) and RRR (RR reduction) of SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination. Potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated through between-study heterogeneity analysis and subgroup meta-analysis. RESULTSThe systematic review identified 27 studies eligible for the quantitative synthesis. Partially vaccinated individuals presented a RRR=73% (95%CI=59%-83%) for any positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (RR=0.27) and a RRR=79% (95%CI=30%-93%) for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR (RR=0.21). Fully vaccinated individuals showed a RRR=94% (95%CI=88%-98%) for any SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR (RR=0.06) compared to unvaccinated. According to the subgroup meta-analysis, full BNT162b2 vaccination protocol achieved a RRR=84%-94% against any SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR and a RRR=68%-84% against symptomatic positive PCR. The RR for any SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR remained higher within elderly groups aged []69 years (RR=0.12-0.15) compared to younger individuals (RR=0.05-0.12). The RR against B.1.351 infection approached 0.40 for any positive PCR and 0.36 for symptomatic SARS-COV-2 while the RR of any B.1.1.7 infection was 0.14. CONCLUSIONThe current licensed vaccines may be transmission blocking, especially after full vaccination protocol. Given the substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution.

PURPOSE In this study, the ability of CURB-65, extended CURB-65, PSI and CALL scores and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) to predict intra-hospital mortality and ICU admission in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were evaluated. METHODS During March-May 2020, a retrospective, single-center study including all consecutive adult patients with diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia was conducted. Clinical, laboratory and radiological data as well as CURB-65, expanded CURB-65, PSI and CALL scores were calculated based on data recorded at hospital admission. RESULTS Overall, 224 patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were included in the study. As for intrahospital mortality (24/224, 11%), PSI performed better than all the other tested scores, which showed lower AUC values (AUC=0.890 for PSI versus AUC=0.885, AUC=0.858 and AUC=0.743 for expanded CURB-65, CURB-65 and CALL scores, respectively). Of note, the addition of hypoalbuminemia to the CURB-65 score increased the prediction value of intra-hospital mortality (AUC=0.905). All the tested scores were less predictive for the need of ICU transfer (26/224, 12%), with the best AUC for extended CURB-65 score (AUC= 0.708).

PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a retrospective study on 124 consecutive obese patients (29.8% men), who had undergone LSG between 01/01/2008 and 12/31/2010, in a highly specialized clinic. The dynamic of anthropometric and biochemical data between baseline and six months following LSG were evaluated. We also determined the change in MetS prevalence and used logistic regression to estimate predictors of MetS remission RESULTS 6 months after LSG, the body mass index (BMI) decreased from 46.84 +/- 8.62 to 33.81 +/- 7.04 kg/m2 (p < 0.001). Mean excess BMI loss (EBL) was 65.24 +/- 25.16%. The best results on weight loss were observed in young patients, not affected by MetS, with lower initial BMI.

This study therefore aimed to investigate the effects of a surgical, flannel or vertical-fold N95 masks on cardiorespiratory responses to incremental exercise. METHODS This investigation studied 11 adult males and females at rest and while performing progressive cycle exercise to exhaustion. We tested the hypotheses that wearing a surgical (S), flannel (F) or horizontal-fold N95 mask compared to no mask (control) would not promote arterial deoxygenation or exercise intolerance nor alter primary cardiovascular variables during submaximal or maximal exercise. RESULTS Despite the masks significantly increasing end-expired peri-oral %CO2 and reducing %O2, each 0.8-2% during exercise (P < 0.05), our results supported the hypotheses. Specifically, none of these masks reduced sub-maximal or maximal exercise arterial O2 saturation (P = 0.744), but ratings of dyspnea were significantly increased (P = 0.007). Moreover, maximal exercise capacity was not compromised nor were there any significant alterations of primary cardiovascular responses (mean arterial pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output) found during sub-maximal exercise.

Ironically, this caused Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Paradoxically, the pandemic strengthened state powers that have recently been weakened by globalisation. Several examples support this view. We see state power being regained through diversified state policy responses on virus containment and fiscal stimulus packages. Mass surveillance for contact tracing also makes states capable of collecting personal data. We also see state power regained via the declaration of a state of emergency, the enactment of emergency legislation, and the execution of law enforcement. Some state leaders have attempted to gain political power using the opportunity created by the pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 Paradox: Globalisation and State Power"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Never before in history, aging was such a significant factor for epidemics as it is now for the current COVID-19 pandemic, which features a drastic shift of mortality towards older ages. Our analysis of data on COVID-19-related mortality in Spain, Italy, and Sweden has shown that, in the range of 30 to 90 years of age, each dependency of the logarithm of mortality upon age is linear, and all regression lines are strictly parallel to those related to the total mortality in accordance with the Gompertz law. In all cases, irrespective of the stage and place of epidemic, mortality doubling time in this age range is close to 7,5 years. The rates of being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and of being diagnosed due to the symptomatic manifestations of the infection are dependent on age to a far lesser degree. With account for these observations, three messages are put forth: 1) Older persons are the principal victims of both SARS-CoV-2 and measures undertaken to control its spread; 2) Older persons are not the principal driving force of SARS-CoV-2 spread; 3) Older persons can and should be engaged in combating the pandemic and its consequences; however, not via selective social distancing and other discriminative measures. People aged over 65 years constitute a significant part of the current population. They have specific interests and needs, which deserve no less respect than those of any other age group. This includes the right for the quality of life that remains sustained under the emergency conditions. Since the prospects for controlling the SARS-CoV-2 are dubious, those in charge of decisions concerning ?people aged above 65? should mind that currently, unlike in the medieval ages, 65+ is the individual future of almost everyone.","output":"[Theory and practice of aging upon COVID-19 pandemic.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hyperthyroidism affects about 0.2%-2.7% of all pregnancies, and is generally treated with propylthiouracil (PTU). However, previous studies about the effects of propylthiouracil on maternal or foetal are contentious. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis was carried out to investigate the safety and efficacy of propylthiouracil during pregnancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, EBSCO, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, CNKI, Wanfang and VIP database were searched from inception until August 31, 2021 for all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or cohort studies that evaluated the efficacy of propylthiouracil and its effects on pregnancy outcomes. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used for binary variables, weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used for continuous variables. RevMan5.4 and Stata 16.0 were used for performing the meta-analysis. RESULTS: The researchers examined data from 13 randomized controlled trials and cohort studies involving 18948 infants. Congenital anomalies were not significantly associated with PTU in the pooled results (OR = 1.03, 95%CI: 0.84C1.25, P = 0.80, I(2) = 40.3%). There were no statistically significant differences in neonatal hypothyroidism (OR = 0.55, 95%CI: 0.06C4.92, P = 0.593, I(2) = 57.0%) or hepatotoxicity (OR = 0.34, 95%CI: 0.08C1.48, P = 0.151, I(2) = 0.0%) exposed to PTU compared to the control group. The serum levels of FT3, FT4, TT3, and TT4 were significantly lower in the propylthiouracil group compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis confirmed the beneficial effects of propylthiouracil treatment, namely the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes were not increased, and it also proved PTUs efficacy in the treatment of pregnant women with hyperthyroidism. The findings supported the use of propylthiouracil during pregnancy with hyperthyroidism in order to improve clinical pregnancy outcomes in patients with thyroid dysfunction.","output":"Efficacy of propylthiouracil in the treatment of pregnancy with hyperthyroidism and its effect on pregnancy outcomes: A meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus is naturally mutating over time and producing new variants. Some of them are more contagious and destructive than previous strains. Also, some variants are capable of therapeutic escaping. Earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants proved that some are supercritical, and newly mutated strains are creating new challenges to the global healthcare systems. Here we aimed to evaluate different coronavirus variants and associated challenges for healthcare systems. We searched for information online and on the PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases. We found the wild-type virus is more sensitive for neutralization and more controllable than newer variants. The Delta and Omicron variants are more highly transmissible than Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants. Also, few strains are resistant to neutralization. Therefore, there is a chance of reinfection among the vaccinated population. The transmissibility and resistance of the recently identified Omicron variant is still unclear. The Delta variant is the most dangerous among all variants due to its high transmissibility, disease severity, and mortality rate. For poor and developing countries, oxygen supply, medication, vaccination, and device supply are challenging during epidemic waves. Slowing down the transmission, mass vaccination, vaccine redesign, re-compiling action plans, and following safety guidelines can be effective solutions to the new challenges.","output":"New Coronavirus Variants are Creating More Challenges to Global Healthcare System: A Brief Report on the Current Knowledge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global anxiety and a significant threat to public health due to the current COVID-19 pandemic reiterate the need for active surveillance for the zoonotic virus diseases of pandemic potential. Influenza virus due to its wide host range and zoonotic potential poses such a significant threat to public health. Swine serve as a mixing vessel for influenza virus reassortment and evolution which as a result may facilitate the emergence of new strains or subtypes of zoonotic potential. In this context, the currently available scientific data hold a high significance to unravel influenza virus epidemiology and evolution. With this objective, the current systematic review summarizes the original research articles and case reports of all the four types of influenza viruses reported in swine populations worldwide. A total of 281 articles were found eligible through screening of PubMed and Google Scholar databases and hence were included in this systematic review. The highest number of research articles (n = 107) were reported from Asia, followed by Americas (n = 97), Europe (n = 55), Africa (n = 18), and Australia (n = 4). The H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most common influenza A virus subtypes reported in swine in most countries across the globe, however, few strains of influenza B, C, and D viruses were also reported in certain countries. Multiple reports of the avian influenza virus strains documented in the last two decades in swine in China, the United States, Canada, South Korea, Nigeria, and Egypt provided the evidence of interspecies transmission of influenza viruses from birds to swine. Inter-species transmission of equine influenza virus H3N8 from horse to swine in China expanded the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses. Additionally, numerous reports of the double and triple-reassortant strains which emerged due to reassortments among avian, human, and swine strains within swine further increased the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses. These findings are alarming hence active surveillance should be in place to prevent future influenza pandemics.","output":"A Systematic Review Analyzing the Prevalence and Circulation of Influenza Viruses in Swine Population Worldwide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via the original article","output":"Correction to: CXCL10 could drive longer duration of mechanical ventilation during COVID-19 ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have had far-reaching health, economic, social and political impacts The latter is the focus of this research note, which proposes using a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the electoral impact of reported SARS-CoV-2 infection rates The approach is illustrated using data from the 2020 Croatian parliamentary election The outcomes of interest are the vote shares for the dominant Croatian Democratic Union party, as well as the turnout The analysis concludes that there is no evidence that reported county-level infection rates affected Croatian Democratic Union support or turnout However, results using this approach may be affected by the statistical power of the analysis, issues related to causal identification and reliability of infection rate measures Nonetheless, the difference-in-differences approach can potentially be applied in contexts around the world to estimate the electoral impact of reported SARS-CoV-2 infection rates","output":"Polls and the Pandemic: Estimating the Electoral Effects of a SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: At a time of unprecedented attention to the public health impact of policing, it is imperative to understand the role of occupational safety in shaping officer behaviours. We assessed the longitudinal impact of police training in a quasi-experimental hybrid type-1 trial to reduce syringe-related occupational risk, while realigning police practices with public health prevention among people who inject drugs (PWID). SETTING: Tijuana, Mexico. PARTICIPANTS: Of 1806 Tijuana municipal police trainees, 771 reporting previous exposure to syringes were randomly selected for follow-up. All participants completed at least one follow-up visit; attrition at 24 months was 8%. INTERVENTION: Between 2015 and 2016, officers received a training intervention (Safety and Health Integration in the Enforcement of Laws on Drugs, SHIELD) bundling occupational needle stick injury (NSI) prevention with health promotion among PWID. OUTCOME MEASURES: Longitudinal analysis with generalised linear mixed models to evaluate training impact on occupational NSI risk via NSI incidence and prevalidated Syringe Threat and Injury Correlates (STIC) score. This composite indicator integrates five self-reported risky syringe-handling practices (eg, syringe confiscation, breaking) and was used as a proxy for NSI risk due to reporting bias and concerns about reliability of NSI incidence reports. RESULTS: No change in self-reported NSI incidence was observed, but significant reductions in risk (16.2% decrease in STIC score) occurred at 3 months, with a sustained decrease of 17.8% through 24 months, compared with pretraining (p<0.001). Police assignment (patrol vs administration) moderated the training effect (p=0.01). Younger age, male gender, lower rank and previous NSI were independently and significantly associated with higher NSI risk overtime, although all groups demonstrated significant reductions post-training. CONCLUSIONS: SHIELD is the first intervention to be associated with significant sustained changes in police practices that pose risk for both occupational and the publics health. Integrating occupational safety and public health education should inform other interventions to mitigate the community health detriments of policing behaviours.

This can make grief management extremely challenging for families. The Clinical Psychology unit of an Italian hospital offered a bereavement follow-up call to such families. This study aimed to explore the families' experiences and needs collected during these calls, and the role that the psychologists played through the call. A total of 246 families were called over 3 months. Multiple qualitative methods included: (i) written reports of the calls with relatives of patients who died at the hospital for COVID-19; (ii) qualitative semi-structured interviews with psychologists involved in the calls; (iii) observation of psychologists' peer group discussions. A thematic analysis was conducted. Six themes emerged: without death rituals, solitary, unexpected, unfair, unsafe, coexisting with other stressors. Families' reactions were perceived by psychologists as close to a traumatic grief. Families' needs ranged from finding alternative rituals to giving meaning and expressing different emotions. The psychologists played both a social-institutional and a psychological-human role through the calls (e.g., they cured disrupted communication or validated feelings and choices). This study highlighted the potential of traumatic grief of families of COVID-19 victims, and provided indications for supporting them within the space of a short phone call.","output":"Phone follow up to families of COVID-19 patients who died at the hospital: families' grief reactions and clinical psychologists' roles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The incidence of elevated liver chemistries and the presence of pre-existing chronic liver disease (CLD) have been variably reported in COVID-19. AIMS: To assess the prevalence of CLD, the incidence of elevated liver chemistries and the outcomes of patients with and without underlying CLD/elevated liver chemistries in COVID-19. METHODS: A comprehensive search of electronic databases from 1 December 2019 to 24 April 2020 was done. We included studies reporting underlying CLD or elevated liver chemistries and patient outcomes in COVID-19. RESULTS: 107 articles (n = 20 874 patients) were included for the systematic review. The pooled prevalence of underlying CLD was 3.6% (95% CI, 2.5-5.1) among the 15 407 COVID-19 patients. The pooled incidence of elevated liver chemistries in COVID-19 was 23.1% (19.3-27.3) at initial presentation. Additionally, 24.4% (13.5-40) developed elevated liver chemistries during the illness. The pooled incidence of drug-induced liver injury was 25.4% (14.2-41.4). The pooled prevalence of CLD among 1587 severely infected patients was 3.9% (3%-5.2%). The odds of developing severe COVID-19 in CLD patients was 0.81 (0.31-2.09; P = 0.67) compared to non-CLD patients. COVID-19 patients with elevated liver chemistries had increased risk of mortality (OR-3.46 [2.42-4.95, P < 0.001]) and severe disease (OR-2.87 [95% CI, 2.29-3.6, P < 0.001]) compared to patients without elevated liver chemistries. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated liver chemistries are common at presentation and during COVID-19. The severity of elevated liver chemistries correlates with the outcome of COVID-19. The presence of CLD does not alter the outcome of COVID-19.

In order to evaluate the proposed system in real-world scenarios, experiments were carried out at the main campus of the University of CampinasBrazil. For the first case, two prototypes were installed at both the front and rear door of a bus in order to count the number of passengers boarding and alighting on the vehicle during its operation. In the second case, three prototypes were installed in the university restaurant ticket gates in order to count the number of people entering during lunchtime. Experimental results showed an accuracy of 91.45% and 98.65% for Cases 1 and 2, respectively.

Our model dynamics is expressed by a single prognostic variable which satisfies an integro-differential equation. All unknown parameters are described with a single, time-dependent variable R(t). We show that our model has similarities to classic compartmental models, such as SIR, and that the variable R(t) can be interpreted as a generalized effective reproduction number. The advantages of our approach are the simplicity of having only one equation, the numerical stability due to an integral formulation and the reliability since the model is formulated in terms of the most trustable statistical data variable: the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID-19. Once this dynamic variable is calculated, other non-dynamic variables, such as the number of heavy cases (hospital beds), the number of intensive-care cases (ICUs) and the fatalities, can be derived from it using a similarly stable, integral approach. The formulation with a single equation allows us to calculate from real data the values of the sample effective reproduction number, which can then be fitted. Extrapolated values of R(t) can be used in the model to make reliable forecasts, though under the assumption that measures for reducing infections are maintained. We have applied our model to more than 15 countries and the ongoing results are available on a web-based platform[1]. In this paper, we focus on the data for two exemplary countries, Italy and Germany, and show that the model is capable of reproducing the course of the epidemic in the past and forecasting its course for a period of four to five weeks with a reasonable numerical stability.","output":"A novel deterministic forecast model for COVID-19 epidemic based on a single ordinary integro-differential equation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been much discussion recently about the importance of implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to protect the public from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Different governments across the world have adopted NPIs (e.g., social distancing, quarantine, isolation, lockdowns, curfews, travel restrictions, closures of schools and colleges). Two fundamental strategies, namely a strict containment strategyalso called suppression strategyand a mitigation strategy have been adopted in different countries, mainly to reduce the reproduction number (R(0)) to below one and hence to reduce case numbers to low levels or eliminate human-to-human transmission, as well as to use NPIs to interrupt transmission completely and to reduce the health impact of epidemics, respectively. However, the adoption of these NPI strategies is varied and the factors impacting NPI are inconsistent and unclear. This study, therefore, aimed to review the factors associated with the implementation of NPIs (social distancing, social isolation and quarantine) for reducing COVID-19. Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched for published and unpublished studies, undertaking a systematic search of: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine, COVID-19 Research, WHO database on COVID-19, and Google Scholar. Thirty-three studies were included in the study. Seven descriptive themes emerged on enablers and barriers to NPIs: the positive impact of NPIs, effective public health interventions, positive change in peoples behaviour and concerns about COVID-19, the role of mass media, physical and psychological impacts, and ethnicity/age associated with COVID-19. This study has highlighted that the effectiveness of NPIs in isolation is likely to be limited, therefore, a combination of multiple measures e.g., SD, isolation and quarantine, and workplace distancing appeared more effective in reducing COVID-19. Studies suggest that targeted approaches alongside social distancing might be the way forward, and more acceptable. Further research to promote country- and context-specific adoption of NPIs to deliver public health measures is needed. Studies comparing the effectiveness of interventions and strategies will help provide more evidence for future pandemics.","output":"Factors Associated with the Implementation of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions for Reducing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to produce proteins essential for their propagation, many pathogenic human viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 the causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, commandeer host biosynthetic machineries and mechanisms.

Before the impact of Covid 19 a high proportion of institutions were in financial difficulty and were reducing staff numbers. There had been growing criticism of universities, from within for becoming too managerialist, commercial and market-focussed, and from outside for failing to meet key needs of society and the economy; such as equality of access for those from minority or disadvantaged backgrounds, and the production of graduates with the skills required by employers. Some commentators have attributed these challenges to the recent strength of right-wing and populist forces, and ideas which question the role and usefulness of higher education and support for increased government control and regulation.

COVID-19 is a serious illness leading to multiple deaths in various countries including the United States. Several million Americans satisfy the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for being high risk. Unfortunately, the available supply of medical beds and equipment for mechanical ventilation are much less than is projected to be needed. The World Health Organization (WHO) and multiple agencies led by the CDC in the United States have attempted to organize intensive outbreak investigation programs utilizing appropriate preventive measures, evaluation, and treatment. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic forms to conditions encompassing multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) syndromes. The presently approved treatments are supportive but not curative for the disease. There are multiple treatments being studied. These include vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially combination therapy. Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or (UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied. The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patients' own immune system. When the immune system is over activated in an attempt to kill the virus, this can lead to the production of a large number of inflammatory factors, resulting in severe cytokine storm. The cytokine storm may induce organ damage followed by the edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection, which may lead to death. Thus, at this point, the avoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients.In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients were treated with expanded UC-MSCs. Additionally, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care have reported guidelines to treat coronavirus patients with stem cells in the hope of decreasing the number of patients going to the ICU, and, also relatively quickly getting them out of ICU. In this manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis of coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells. The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests that it might be considered for compassionate use in critically ill patients to reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States. The administration and Coronavirus Task Force might wish to approach the potential of expanded UC-MSCs as an evolutionary therapeutic strategy in managing COVID-19 illness with a 3-pronged approach: If proven safe and effective on a specific and limited basis 1. Minimize regulatory burden by all agencies so that critically ill COVID-19 patients will have access regardless of their financial circumstance.2. Institute appropriate safeguards to avoid negative consequences from unscrupulous actors.3. With proper informed consent from patients or proxy when necessary, and subject to accumulation of data in that cohort, allow the procedure to be initiated in critically ill patients who are not responding to conventional therapies.KEY WORDS: Coronavirus, COVID-19, cytokine storm, multiorgan failure, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells.","output":"Expanded Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSCs) as a Therapeutic Strategy in Managing Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: The Case for Compassionate Use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Procedural sedation has allowed many painful interventions to be conducted outside the operating room. During such procedures, it is important to maintain an appropriate level of sedation to minimize the risk of respiratory depression if patients are over-sedated and added pain or anxiety if under-sedated. However, there is currently no objective way to measure the patient's evolving level of sedation during a procedure. We investigated the use of capnography-derived features as an objective measure of sedation level. Time-based capnograms were recorded from 30 patients during sedation for cardioversion. Through causal k-means clustering of selected features, we sequentially assigned each exhalation to one of three distinct clusters, or states. Transitions between these states correlated to events during sedation (drug administration, procedure start and end, and clinical interventions). Similar clustering of capnogram recordings from 26 healthy, non-sedated subjects did not reveal distinctly separated states.","output":"Clustering of capnogram features to track state transitions during procedural sedation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 exemplifies, respiratory diseases transmitted through aerosols or droplets are global threats to public health, and respiratory protection measures are essential first lines of infection prevention and control. However, common face masks are single use and can cause cross-infection due to the accumulated infectious pathogens. We developed salt-based formulations to coat membrane fibers to fabricate antimicrobial filters. Here, we report a mechanistic study on salt-induced pathogen inactivation. The salt recrystallization following aerosol exposure was characterized over time on sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium sulfate (K2SO4), and potassium chloride (KCl) powders and coatings, which revealed that NaCl and KCl start to recrystallize within 5 min and K2SO4 within 15 min. The inactivation kinetics observed for the H1N1 influenza virus and Klebsiella pneumoniae matched the salt recrystallization well, which was identified as the main destabilizing mechanism. Additionally, the salt-coated filters were prepared with different methods (with and without a vacuum process), which led to salt coatings with different morphologies for diverse applications. Finally, the salt-coated filters caused a loss of pathogen viability independent of transmission mode (aerosols or droplets), against both DI water and artificial saliva suspensions. Overall, these findings increase our understanding of the salt-recrystallization-based technology to develop highly versatile antimicrobial filters.","output":"Study of the Pathogen Inactivation Mechanism in Salt-Coated Filters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although young adults familiar with digital technology join the workforce and bring in more advanced digital competences, the demand for digital competences in many industries increases even faster. In this study, we place the focus on the banking industry in the United Kingdom and aim for exploring those digital competences that are required for junior financial analysts. For this purpose, we apply a qualitative research approach which consists of two steps. First, we analyze job advertisements and code the identified competences by using the DigComp 2.0 framework. Second, we conduct interviews to validate and discuss our findings from the previous step. Our analysis reveals that the most important required competence categories are information and data literacy, followed by digital content creation.

Care Quality Commissions care quality ratings are given to all English care homes and could be used to identify whether care homes are at risk of COVID-19 outbreaks. METHODS: An audit was performed, April 2020, of Liverpool care homes to identify associations between COVID-19 status and care quality ratings from the Care Quality Commission. Univariable logistic regression was performed to identify whether the Care Quality Commissions ratings were associated with a care home experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak, or a home having asymptomatic cases. FINDINGS: Over half of the care homes (53.2%, n=41), had laboratory-confirmed clinical cases and 39 (95.1%) of these were reported as outbreaks. A small number of care homes (10.4%, n=8) had asymptomatic cases and over a third had no clinical or asymptomatic cases (36.4%, n=28). There was no significant difference between the overall Care Quality Commission rating of Liverpool and English care homes (p=0.57). There was no significant association between any of the Care Quality Commission rating domains and the presence of COVID-19 outbreaks and/or asymptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Care Quality Commission ratings were not associated with COVID-19 outbreaks or asymptomatic cases in care homes. Infection prevention and control components of Care Quality Commission ratings need to be strengthened to identify care homes at a potential risk of infectious disease outbreaks that may require targeted support. Further large-scale studies will be required to test the findings from this study.","output":"COVID-19 outbreaks in care homes during the first wave: are Care Quality Commission ratings a good predictor of at-risk homes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Os analistas de comportamento podem encontrar situaes, como a atual pandemia COVID-19, que os impede de fornecer servi?os ABA tradicionais pessoalmente aos clientes.

It is affecting the country in different ways ranging from a significant impact on the economy to a disrupted public health delivery of both curative and preventive services. The aim of this study was to assess health related quality of life of patients with chronic non-communicable diseases during the Coronavirus pandemic in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.MethodsA multi-facility based cross sectional study design was conducted in August 2020 among public health institutions in Addis Ababa. Health facilities were chosen purposively based on high number of patient flow. Participants from each health facility were drawn after proportional to size allocation. A translated EQ-5D-3L VAS instrument was used to collect data. Analysis was done using SPSS v.26.0.

METHODS: All patients referred to the virtual fracture clinic service from the Paediatric Emergency Department (PED) were prospectively collected. Outcome data of interest (patients discharged, referred for urgent operative treatment, referred back to emergency department for further evaluation, referred for face-to-face clinical assessment and all patients who re-presented on an unplanned basis for further management of the index injury) were compiled and collated. Cost analysis was performed using established costing for a virtual fracture clinic within the Irish Healthcare System. RESULTS: There were a total of 3961 patients referred to the virtual fracture clinic from the PED. Of these, 70% (n = 2776) were discharged. In all, 26% (n = 1033) were referred to a face-to-face appointment. Of discharged patients, 7.5% (n = 207) required an unplanned face-to-face evaluation.

In a recent work, we utilized patient-specific hemodynamic analysis of the circle of Willis to noninvasively assess stroke risk in pediatric Moyamoya disease (MMD)a progressive steno-occlusive cerebrovascular disease that leads to recurrent stroke. The objective was to identify vascular regions with critically high wall shear rate (WSR), signifying elevated stroke risk. However, sources of error including insufficient resolution of MR images can negatively impact vascular model accuracy, especially in areas of severe pathological narrowing, and thus diminish clinical relevance of simulation results, as local hemodynamics are sensitive to vessel geometry. We have developed a novel method to improve the accuracy of MR-derived 3D vascular models utilizing 2D X-ray angiography (XA), which is considered the gold standard for clinically assessing vessel caliber. In this workflow, virtual angiographies (VA) of 3D MR-derived vascular models are conducted, producing 2D projections that are compared to corresponding XA images guiding the local adjustment of modeled vessels. This VA-comparison-adjustment loop is iterated until the two agree, as confirmed by an expert neuroradiologist. Using this method, we generated models of the circle of Willis of two patients with a history of unilateral stroke. Blood flow simulations were performed using a Navier-Stokes solver within an isogeoemtric analysis framework and WSR distributions were quantified. Results for one patient show as much as 45% underestimation of local WSR in the stenotic left anterior cerebral artery (LACA) and up to a 60% underestimation in the right anterior cerebral artery when using the initial MR-derived model compared to the XA-adjusted model, emphasizing the need for verifying improved accuracy of the adjusted model. To that end, vessel cross-sectional areas of the pre- and post-adjustment models were compared to those seen in 3D CTA images of the same patient. CTA has superior resolution and signal to noise ratio compared to MR imaging but is not commonly used in clinic due to radiation exposure concerns, especially in pediatric patients. While the vessels in the initial model had normalized root mean squared deviations (NRMSDs) ranging from 26% to 182% and 31% to 69% in two patients with respect to CTA, the adjusted vessel NRMSDs were comparatively smaller (32% to 53% and 11% to 42%). In the mildly stenotic LACA of patient 1, the NRMSDs for the pre- and post-adjusted models were 49% and 32%, respectively. These findings suggest that our XA-based adjustment method can considerably improve the accuracy of vascular models, and thus, stroke-risk prediction. An accurate individualized assessment of stroke risk would be of substantial clinical benefit because it would help guide the timing of preventative surgical interventions in pediatric MMD patients.","output":"A Novel Method for Improving the Accuracy of MR-derived Patient-specific Vascular Models using X-ray Angiography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) was caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a coronavirus, which leads to enormous economic losses in the poultry industry.

In hospitalized-patients, prompt interruption of the virus-driven inflammatory process by using combination treatments seems theoretically of outmost importance. Our aim was to investigate the hypothesis of multifaceted management of these patients. Methods A treatment algorithm based on ferritin was applied in 311 patients (67.2% males; median age 63-years; moderate disease, n=101; severe, n=210). Patients with ferritin <500ng/ml received anakinra 2-4mg/kg/day  corticosteroids (Arm A, n=142) while those with 500ng/ml received anakinra 5-8mg/kg/day with corticosteroids and -globulins (Arm B, n=169). In case of no improvement a single dose of tocilizumab (8mg/kg; maximum 800mg) was administered with the potential of additional second and/or third pulses. Treatment endpoints were the rate of the development of respiratory failure necessitating intubation and the SARS-CoV-2-related mortality. The proposed algorithm was also validated in matched hospitalized-patients treated with standard-of-care during the same period. Results In overall, intubation and mortality rates were 5.8% and 5.1% (0% in moderate; 8.6% and 7.6% in severe). Low baseline pO(2)/FiO(2) and older age were independent risk factors.

The extensive shared border, and illegal cross-border transit through improvised trails between the two countries are major challenges for public health authorities. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela, and present a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic landscape in the Colombian-Venezuelan border region. We sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal (NP) clinical specimens using a custom reference-based analysis pipeline. Three assemblies obtained were subjected to typing using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages Pangolin tool. A total of 376 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from South America were obtained from the GISAID database to perform comparative genomic analyses. Additionally, the Wuhan-1 strain was used as reference. We found that two of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela belonged to the B1 lineage, and the third to the B.1.13 lineage. We observed a point mutation in the Spike protein gene (D614G substitution), previously reported to be associated with increased infectivity, in all three Venezuelan genomes. An additional three mutations (R203K/G204R substitution) were present in the nucleocapsid (N) gene of one Venezuelan genome. Conclusions: Genomic sequencing demonstrates similarity between SARS-CoV-2 lineages from Venezuela and viruses collected from patients in bordering areas in Colombia and from Brazil, consistent with cross-border transit despite administrative measures including lockdowns.

Compared to patients with favorable outcome, these patients were more often 'on' PPI therapy (86% vs 23%, p < 0.05) and had higher RDQ scores in each domain: heartburn (p < 0.05), regurgitation (p < 0.05) and dyspepsia (p < 0.05). A positive SAP was the only pH-impedance parameter statistically associated with successful postoperative outcome (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES On therapy, a preoperative positive symptom association probability is the only pH-impedance parameter associated with favorable outcome after laparoscopic fundoplication for refractory reflux symptoms. These results should be confirmed by prospective studies.","output":"24-hour pH-impedance monitoring on therapy to select patients with refractory reflux symptoms for antireflux surgery.

This article investigates early English-language COVID-19-related discussions of racism on Twitter to assess whether they affected the strength of the George Floyd protests.Design/methodology/approach: Tweets mentioning COVID-19 were gathered from 10 March to 5 June 2020 and investigated with time series graphs and word association thematic analysis.Findings: There were four main phases of racism discussions: right wing Chinese virus comments;Donald Trumps Chinese virus comments;discussions of high ethnic minority COVID-19 death rates;and reactions to the George Floyd killing. Tweets about the first three issues increased at the start of the George Floyd protests, suggesting that they fed into them. Despite the huge increase in tweeting about racism after George Floyd, only 12% of tweets mentioned him or Black Lives Matter, with the remainder often making more general anti-racism statements. Thus, the killing of George Floyd seems to have opened a large scale social media space for public generalizations about systematic and institutionalized racism.Originality: This is the first large-scale systematic study of the evolution of discussions of racism on Twitter during COVID-19.","output":"Twitter during COVID-19: George Floyd Opening a Space to Address Systematic and Institutionalized Racism?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has given rise to emerging respiratory infections with pandemic diffusion.

METHODS Between June 2019 and November 2019, a survey amongst consecutive regular orthopedic and orthopedic trauma patients at the outpatient clinics from three European level I trauma centers was conducted via paper-based questionnaires, composed of participants\` demographics as well as five open and closed questions. Participation was voluntary and anonymity was granted. RESULTS In total, 780 participants (female 302, 38.7%, male 478, 61.3%) with a mean age of 43.8 years (SD 17.1, range from 14 years to 94 years) were included. The majority of the participants (57,6%) were eager to use a remote consultation. Participants with an age of more than 55 years were significantly less likely to use a remote consultation than their younger counterparts (OR= 0.18, p=0.003. r2=0.141). Among the whole study population, 86.2% stated, that they had a device compatible with an online video consultation. The highest willingness to conduct a video consultation in respect of the participants\` occupation was observed in \\"part-time\\"-jobs (70.6%), whereas the lowest disposition was seen in retired patients (37.1%) (p= 0.0001). The most stated reason why to conduct a video consultation was \\"communication of medical findings\\" (67.8%). The most stated advantage was the \\"reduction of physical consultations\\" (66.4%). \\"No physical examination\\" was the most frequently stated disadvantage (75.9%). CONCLUSION The majority of orthopedic and orthopedic trauma outpatients would use a video consultation, especially because of commuting and time issues and ideally to communicate medical findings, such as x-ray reports or lab values. Elderly patients appear to be less eager in regard to video consultations. These results may change for even better acceptance in view of a current pandemic situation, as experienced since early 2020.

In this study, we investigated whether Hup A improved the metabolic and cognitive functions in the high fat-induced (HFD) obese mice and genetic ob/ob mice. HFD and ob/ob mice were treated with Hup A (0.1, 0.3 mg  kg(?1)  d(?1), ig) for 3 months. Body weight was monitored and glucose tolerance tests were performed.

DESIGN Retrospective observational research. METHOD We compared prevalences of ED visits from the Dutch Injury Surveillance System (DISS) between the period of semi-lockdown (16 March-10 May 2020) and the same period in 2019. The same comparisons were made for the period of relaxation of measures (11 May-5 July 2020) and for the period of relaxation versus lockdown. To eliminate a possible effect of avoiding emergency care, analyses were performed on severe injury related ED-visits. RESULTS The prevalence of severe injury related ED-visits during the period of lockdown was 27 percent lower compared to the same period in 2019 (6.755 versus 4.902, P<0.05). This decrease was observed for all types of injuries and age groups, but was strongest for sports injuries (-53%) and among 10-19-year-olds (-55%). In contrast, the number of ED-visits increased after accidents with jobs in the house (+31%) and roller-skates (+223%). Among 0-11-year-olds, more accidents with trampolines were reported (+68%). During the period of relaxation, the number of severe injury related ED-visits increased with 19 percent, but was 11 percent lower compared to 2019.

Little is known regarding the relationship between colchicine use and infectious disease outcomes. The objective of this study was to systematically examine infectious adverse events associated with colchicine usage and the clinical use of colchicine for infectious diseases. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA methodology. PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases were searched (up to 12th October, 2020) for interventional and observational studies that included colchicine usage associated with infectious adverse events or infectious disease outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 9,237 studies were initially identified and after exclusions, 36 articles comprising 21 interventional studies and 15 observational studies were included in this systematic review. There were 19 studies that reported infectious adverse events and 17 studies that examined the efficacy of colchicine in treating infectious disease. Only two out of six studies reported a significant benefit using colchicine in the management of viral liver disease. There was some evidence colchicine is beneficial in managing COVID-19 by reducing time to deterioration, length of stay in hospital and mortality. Colchicine had some benefit in managing malaria, condyloma accuminata and verruca vulgaris, viral myocarditis and erythema nodosum leprosum based on case-series or small, pilot clinical studies. Two of the clinical trials and five of the observational studies reported significant associations between infections adverse events and colchicine usage. Risk of pneumonia was found in three studies and post-operative infections were reported in two studies. Risks of urinary tract infections, H. pylori and C.difficile were only reported by one study each. CONCLUSION: There is a current lack of clinical evidence that colchicine has a role in treating or managing infectious diseases. Preliminary studies have demonstrated a possible role in the management of COVID-19 but results from more clinical trials are needed. There is inconclusive evidence that suggests colchicine is associated with increased risk of infections, particularly pneumonia.","output":"A systematic review of the infectious complications of colchicine and the use of colchicine to treat infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A significant unmet need for new contraceptive options for both women and men remains due to side-effect profiles, medical concerns, and the inconvenience of many currently available contraceptive products. Unfortunately, the development of novel nonsteroidal female contraceptive medicine has been stalled in the last couple of decades due to the lack of effective screening platforms. Drosophila utilizes conserved signaling pathways for follicle rupture, a final step in ovulation that is essential for female reproduction. Therefore, we explored the potential to use Drosophila as a model to screen compounds that could inhibit follicle rupture and be nonsteroidal contraceptive candidates. Using our ex vivo follicle rupture assay, we screened 1,172 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Capproved drugs and identified six drugs that could inhibit Drosophila follicle rupture in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, we characterized the molecular actions of these drugs in the inhibition of adrenergic signaling and follicle rupture. Furthermore, we validated that three of the four drugs consistently inhibited mouse follicle rupture in vitro and that two of them did not affect progesterone production. Finally, we showed that chlorpromazine, one of the candidate drugs, can significantly inhibit mouse follicle rupture in vivo. Our work suggests that Drosophila ovulation is a valuable platform for identifying lead compounds for nonsteroidal contraceptive development and highlights the potential of these FDA-approved drugs as novel nonsteroidal contraceptive agents.","output":"A platform utilizing Drosophila ovulation for nonhormonal contraceptive screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of the study is to understand how socially shared misinformation and rumors can enhance the motivation to protect personal interests and enhance social practices of panic buying.

METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study conducted online involving Brazilian health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were collected through a structured questionnaire (Google Online Form) sent to health professionals on social networks and analyzed through logistic regression by using sociodemographic variables. The set of grouped variables was assigned to the final model when p <0.05. A network was built using the Mixed Graph Models (MGM) approach. A centrality measurement chart was constructed to determine which nodes have the greatest influence, strength and connectivity between the nodes around them. RESULTS: The predictors of violence in the adjusted regression model were the following: being a nursing technician / assistant; having been working for less than 20 years; working for over 37 hours a week; having suffered violence before the pandemic; having been contaminated with COVID-19; working in direct contact with patients infected by the virus; and having family members who have suffered violence. The network created with professionals who suffered violence demonstrated that the aggressions occurred mainly in the workplace, with an indication of psycho-verbal violence. In cases in which the aggressors were close people, aggressions were non-verbal and happened both in public and private places. The assaults practiced by strangers occurred in public places.

Methods: The Enfant Confinement Handicap besOins (ECHO [child lockdown disability needs]) national survey was developed by a multidisciplinary group and disseminated in France from April 6, 2020 via email and social networks. This online survey was addressed to the parents of children with physical disabilities aged 0 to 18 years. It explored the experiences of children and their families during the lockdown. Information regarding childrens wellbeing, rehabilitation and family organization was collected. The first 1000 eligible surveys were analyzed. Results: The children (mean [SD] age 9.5 [4.8] years) mostly had cerebral palsy (42%) or neuromuscular diseases (11%). The lockdown had negative effects on morale (44% of children), behaviour (55% of children) and social interactions (55% no contact with other children).

We find that during the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic of February-December 2020 the returns earned by banks are positively related to coskewness, while this relationship is negative during tranquil periods. In particular, in the economic recession of February-April 2020, we observe that the bank coskewness has increased by three times compared to the pre-pandemic period. Our interpretation is that during tranquil periods investors are willing to pay a premium for stocks with high coskewness in order to hedge against market drawdowns. In contrast, during crises, exposure to coskewness increases the risk of suffering losses, i.e. it commands higher expected returns. We corroborate these findings by showing that during recessions the stock return coskewness correlates tightly to the turnover ratio, suggesting that investors trade more frequently on coskewness when they face financial turmoil.

They appeared unaware of the risk of dependence from Kamini and most had struggled to manage their use for many months before presenting for treatment. METHODS: After two cases were presented at a clinical meeting, a chart review was conducted of cases across four public opioid treatment clinics in south-east Queensland with about 1500 patients registered, identifying 10 further cases. RESULTS: Twelve patients presented with features of opioid withdrawal, seeking treatment after use of Kamini for periods between 6 months and 8 years. Eleven patients were born in India. Nine patients stabilised on buprenorphine maintenance treatment, three of whom commenced long-acting injectable buprenorphine. One patient left after 1 day and subsequently began methadone treatment with a private prescriber. Two patients on smaller doses and shorter-term use undertook withdrawal with prescribed (off-label) trans-dermal buprenorphine. One patient, initially lost to follow-up, later stabilised on long-acting injectable buprenorphine. Reasons for presenting included supply shortages and financial distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Kamini represents an illicit source of non-prescription opioid in Australia. Although classified as an illegal import by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, patients confirm that it is readily available in Brisbane.

The effectiveness in reducing mortality from opioid overdose has been demonstrated in multiple systematic reviews. However, the economic impact of community naloxone distribution programs is not fully understood. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to conduct a review of economic evaluations of community distribution of naloxone, assessing for quality and applicability to diverse contexts and settings. DATA SOURCES: The search strategy was performed on MEDLINE, Embase, and EconLit databases. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND INTERVENTIONS: Search criteria were developed based on two themes: (1) papers involving naloxone or narcan and (2) any form of economic evaluation. A focused search of the grey literature was also conducted. Studies exploring the intervention of community distribution of naloxone were selected. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Data extraction was done using the British Medical Journal guidelines for economic submissions, assigning quality levels based on the impact of the missing or unclear components on the strength of the conclusions. RESULTS: A total of nine articles matched our inclusion criteria: one cost-effectiveness analysis, eight cost-utility analyses, and one cost-benefit analysis. Overall, the quality of the studies was good (six of high quality, two of moderate quality, and one of low quality). All studies concluded that community distribution of naloxone was cost effective, with an incremental cost-utility ratio range of $US111C58,738 (year 2020 values) per quality-adjusted life-year gained.

What environmental and financial benefits could be expected from valorizing DDGS to biochar and its reuse for natural gas substitution? Modeling indicated that the valorized CSF could be produced and used as a source of energy for the bioethanol production plant The use of heat generated from CSF incineration supplies the entire heat demand of the torrefaction unit and the heat demand of bioethanol production (15-30% of the mass of CSF and depending on the lower heating value (LHV) of the CSF produced) The excess of 70-85% of the CSF produced has the potential to be marketed for energetic, agricultural, and other applications Preliminary results show the relationship between the reduction of the environmental footprint (~24% reduction in CO2 emissions) with the introduction of comprehensive on-site valorization of DDGS The application of DDGS torrefaction and CSF recycling may be a source of the new, more valuable revenues and bring new perspectives to the bioethanol industry to be more sustainable and profitable, including during the COVID-19 pandemic and other shocks to market conditions","output":"Synergy of thermochemical treatment of dried distillers grains with solubles with bioethanol production for increased sustainability and profitability.

AIM: To examine pregnant women's levels of stress, mental and physical health, and health behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online, with recruitment and data collection occurring between 16/6/20 and 17/7/20. Participants were pregnant women recruited via online pregnancy/parenting communities. Participants self-reported their levels of general stress, pregnancy-specific stress and COVID-19 related stress, mental and physical health, general health behaviours, and COVID-19 related health behaviours. FINDINGS: 573 pregnant women participated in the survey. Participants were most commonly resident in the United States (42.6%, n=243), Ireland (41.2%, n=235) or the United Kingdom (10%, n=57). The majority (80.0%, n=457) were married and educated to degree level or above (79.3, n=453). Pregnant women reported high levels of pregnancy-specific and COVID-19-related stress, and low levels of mental and physical health, during the pandemic. Encouragingly, pregnant women in this study generally reported high levels of adherence to public health advice and pregnancy health behaviours. Stress and general mental health outcomes were best predicted by well-being factors (including stress and social support). Health impairing behaviours (e.g. poor diet) were predicted by both well-being and demographic factors.

Methods: The human capital approach (HCA) model was used to estimate the TDVHL of the 30,916 human lives lost due to COVID-19 in France; i.e., assuming a discount rate of 3% and the national average life expectancy at birth of 83.13 years. To test the robustness of the estimated TDVHL, the model was rerun (a) using 5% and 10% discount rates, while holding the French average life expectancy constant; and (b) consecutively substituting national life expectancy with the world average life expectancy of 73.2 years and the world highest life expectancy of 88.17 years. Results: The human lives lost had a TDVHL of Int$10,492,290,194, and an average value of Int$339,381 per human life lost. Rerun of the HCA model with 5% and 10% discount rates decreased TDVHL by Int$1,304,764,602 (12.4%) and Int$3,506,938,312 (33%), respectively. Re-calculation of the model with the world average life expectancy decreased the TDVHL by Int$7,750,187,267 (73.87%). Contrastingly, re-estimation of the model with the worlds highest life expectancy augmented TDVHL by Int$3,744,263,463 (35.7%). Conclusions: The average discounted economic value per human life lost due to COVID-19 of Int$339,381 is 8-fold the France gross domestic product per person.

However, SARS-CoV-2 variants, notably B.1.617.2 (WHO Delta), have changed the clinical landscape of COVID-19 in the United States. Delta became the dominant variant in Arkansas (AR) the 1st week of July 2021. Schools contributed to pediatric infections during the January 2021 surge in COVID-19 infections even with physical mitigation measures (PMM) that were removed in March 2021. We present preliminary data suggesting a shift in the clinical presentation of children with Delta variant infection. Methods Pediatric (ages  18 years) case records for the 3 months representing key inflection points of the COVID-19 Pandemic in AR were reviewed. Outcomes (hospitalizations, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, death) were recorded by the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) in a statewide database. Fishers Exact Test was used with p-values < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Results During July 2020, 3,268 pediatric cases were reported to ADH with 55 hospitalizations, 6 ICU admissions, 2 mechanical ventilations, and no deaths. A second peak in January 2021 included 11,735 pediatric cases, a 259.1% increase. Increases were also seen in hospitalizations (n=74), ICU admissions (n= 11), and mechanical ventilations (n=2). No deaths reported. The beginning of an exponential growth in cases during July 2021, before the opening of schools, included 8,031 pediatric cases. Despite 31.6% fewer cases than the previous peak, hospitalizations increased 41.9% (n=105) (p < 0.0001) and included increases in ICU and ventilator use of 68.6% (n=18) (p 0.0016) and 300% (n=8) (p 0.0034), respectively. One pediatric death was reported. (Tbl 1) Conclusion In the absence of PMM and despite the summer closure of schools, pediatric COVID-19 cases and severe outcomes increased significantly. Initial analysis of the AR July 2021 Delta variant surge indicates a statistically significant increase in pediatric COVID-19 disease and severity as indicated by a proportional increase in hospitalizations, ICU, and ventilator use. Further studies are warranted to better define Delta related childhood disease. Our findings also have implications for school PMM efforts.

In May, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study of IgG antibodies for nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2 among the residents of Blaine County, Idaho, a ski resort community with high COVID-19 attack rates in late March and Early April (2.9% for ages 18 and older). Participants were selected from volunteers who registered via a secure web link, using prestratification weighting to the population distribution by age and gender within each ZIP Code. Participants completed a survey reporting their demographics and symptoms; 88% of volunteers who were invited to participate completed data collection survey and had 10 ml of blood drawn. Serology was completed via the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay. Primary analyses estimated seroprevalence and 95% credible intervals (CI) using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to account for diagnostic uncertainty. Stratified models were run by age, sex, ZIP Code, ethnicity, employment status, and a priori participant-reported COVID-19 status. Sensitivity analyses to estimate seroprevalence included base models with post-stratification for ethnicity, age, and sex, with or without adjustment for multi-participant households. IgG antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 were found among 22.7% (95% CI: 20.1%, 25.5%) of residents of Blaine County. Higher levels of antibodies were found among residents of the City of Ketchum 34.8% (95% CI 29.3%, 40.5%), compared to Hailey 16.8% (95%CI 13.7%, 20.3%) and Sun Valley 19.4% (95% 11.8%, 28.4%).

However, there is a growing trend toward plant-based meat alternatives, most of which are to be classified as ultra-processed food (UPF). The paper aimed to understand the consumption of different ultra-processed foods to describe their relation to dietary patterns and sustainability. The objective was (1) to depict the status-quo of consumption of plant-based meat alternatives along with other UPF groups (i.e., convenience products, fast foods, snacks, ultra-processed beverages) in a German sample (n = 814) and (2) to investigate the extent to which all examined UPFs are represented in different dietary patterns (vegetarian, flexitarian, regular meat-eaters, high meat-eaters). UPF intake and dietary groups were determined using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Potential factors influencing UPF consumption, such as attitudes toward sustainability and healthy eating practices, were assessed using validated and fitted psychometric scales. Overall, the frequency of UPF consumption varies significantly along the product groups studied. Plant-based meat alternatives were the least consumed food (12.3%), followed by convenience products (57.4%), fast foods (55.9%), ultra-processed beverages (80.1%), and sweet and salty snacks (97.3%). Plant-based meat alternative consumption predominated within a vegetarian diet, while other UPFs, like convenience products, fast foods, sweet and salty snacks, and ultra-processed beverages, were mainly consumed by meat-eaters. Remarkably, flexitarian diets depict low consumption of all types of ultra-processed foods. In order to meet societal sustainability goals, diets and corresponding societal and political actions should emphasize not only plant orientation but also the increase of non- and low-processed foods.","output":"Plant-Based Diets Are Not Enough?

PICO?, a no canister single-use system offers a lightweight, portable alternative to traditional negative pressure wound therapy, with improved clinical performance. The aim of this study was to determine the potential mechanism(s) of action of single-use negative pressure wound therapy versus traditional negative pressure wound therapy. Approach: Single-use negative pressure wound therapy and traditional negative pressure wound therapy were applied to an in vivo porcine excisional wound model, following product use guidelines. Macroscopic, histological and biochemical analyses were performed at defined healing time-points to assess multiple aspects of the healing response. Results: Wounds treated with single-use negative pressure displayed greater wound closure and increased re-epithelialisation versus those treated with traditional negative pressure. The resulting granulation tissue was more advanced with fewer neutrophils, reduced inflammatory markers, more mature collagen and no wound filler-associated foreign body reactions. Of note, single-use negative pressure therapy failed to induce wound edge epithelial hyperproliferation, while traditional negative pressure therapy compromised peri-wound skin, which remained inflamed with high transepidermal water loss; features not observed following single-use treatment. Innovation: Single-use negative pressure was identified to improve multiple aspects of healing versus traditional negative pressure treatment. Conclusion: This study provides important new insight into the differing mode of action of single-use versus traditional negative pressure and may go some way to explaining the improved clinical outcomes observed with single use negative pressure therapy.","output":"Pre-Clinical Assessment of Single-Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy During In Vivo Porcine Wound Healing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to review relevant randomized controlled trials in order to determine the efficacy of decompression and lumbar interbody fusion in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis.

METHODS: We performed an observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study of all smartphone apps associated with COVID-19. Between April 27 and May 2, 2020, we searched the App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android) for COVID-19 apps. The search terms used were coronavirus, COVID-19, and SARS-COV-2. The apps were downloaded and evaluated. The variables analyzed were name, platform, country, language, category, cost, update date, size, version, number of downloads, developer, and purpose. Purpose was further classified into the following categories: news, general information, self-diagnosis, contact tracing, notices to contacts, notification of close cases, awareness, helplines, monitoring of clinical parameters, recording of symptoms and treatment, and messaging with health care professionals. RESULTS: We identified 114 apps on the investigated platforms. Of these, 62/114 (54.4%) were on Android and 52/114 (45.6%) were on iOS. Of the 114 apps, 37 (32.5%) were developed in Europe, 32 (28.1%) in Asia, and 30 (26.3%) in North America. The most frequent languages were English (65/114, 57.0%), Spanish (34/114, 29.8%), and Chinese (14/114, 12.3%). The most common categories were health and well-being/fitness apps (41/114, 41.2%) and medicine apps (43/114, 37.7%). Of the 114 apps, 113 (99.1%) were free. The mean time between the date of the analysis and the date of the last update was 11.1 days (SD 11.0). Overall, 95 of the 114 apps (83.3%) were intended for the general population, 99 apps (7.9%) were intended for health professionals, and 3 apps (2.6%) were intended for both. Regarding the type of developer, 64/114 apps (56.1%) were developed by governments; 42/114 (64.1%) were developed by national governments, and 23/114 (35.9%) were developed by regional governments. The apps with the highest number of downloads (100,000+) were developed by governments (P=.13), except for the World Health Organization app (500,000+).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, radiographers in our Hospital were challenged when performing CXR for the patients whose native language is not English. Most of these patients were foreign workers living in the same dormitory which had formed the largest COVID-19 cluster in our country. These dormitory residents found it difficult to understand and adhere to breathing instructions, resulting in a suboptimal degree of inspiration when the CXRs were taken. This may ultimately affect the diagnostic value of the radiographs. This paper aims to share and evaluate how radiographers tackled this issue and continued to acquire fully-inspired CXR for the dormitory residents despite the language barrier. Methods Using a combination of online survey and retrospective analysis of the rejection rates of CXR done over the period of early April to early June, a team of radiographers evaluated the effectiveness of using audio recordings in managing the issue of not achieving a fully inspired CXR for patients due to language barrier. Results The rejection rate for CXR due to suboptimal inspiration decreased from 26% to 9% upon implementation of the audio recordings. 92.3% of the CXRs taken within this period also fulfilled the criteria of a fully-inspired CXR, as evidenced by having at least 9 posterior ribs seen above the right hemi-diaphragm. Survey results found a fairly balanced number of radiographers who agreed and disagreed that a fully-inspired CXR was achieved for most of their patients after utilisation of translation manuals and audio recordings. Conclusion After the implementation of audio recordings, the decrease in rejection rate of CXR and an audit which demonstrated that CXR quality was upheld had proven that the radiographers successfully achieved fully-inspired CXR for suspected COVID-19 patients. This confirmed that using pre-recorded audio instructions was an efficient intervention albeit being a one-way communication, leads to more accurate imaging results, aligning with existing literature on communication experiences between radiographers and patients. Moreover, the decreased rejection rate of CXRs had increased department efficiency consequently reducing departmental expenses in the long run. Implications of practice Given that we have an ageing population and the vast majority of the elderly converse in their various dialects, positive feedback from radiographers presented opportunities to expand the translation manual and audio recordings to include local dialects. These can be seamlessly integrated in CXR and other procedures in the hospital setting. To ensure that the translations are culturally sensitive, attention should be paid to the translation process of instructions into other languages and local dialects by enlisting the help of native speakers.","output":"Bridging the Communication Gap between Radiographers and Patients to Improve Chest Radiography Image Acquisition: A Multilingual Solution in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Audio Description: \\"How is the coronavirus affecting immigration and security along the U S border with Mexico?

The prevalence of asthma is increasing in many parts of the world that have adopted aspects of the Western lifestyle, and the disease poses a substantial global health and economic burden. Asthma involves both the large-conducting and the small-conducting airways, and is characterized by a combination of inflammation and structural remodelling that might begin in utero. Disease progression occurs in the context of a developmental background in which the postnatal acquisition of asthma is strongly linked with allergic sensitization. Most asthma cases follow a variable course, involving viral-induced wheezing and allergen sensitization, that is associated with various underlying mechanisms (or endotypes) that can differ between individuals. Each set of endotypes, in turn, produces specific asthma characteristics that evolve across the lifecourse of the patient. Strong genetic and environmental drivers of asthma interconnect through novel epigenetic mechanisms that operate prenatally and throughout childhood. Asthma can spontaneously remit or begin de novo in adulthood, and the factors that lead to the emergence and regression of asthma, irrespective of age, are poorly understood. Nonetheless, there is mounting evidence that supports a primary role for structural changes in the airways with asthma acquisition, on which altered innate immune mechanisms and microbiota interactions are superimposed. On the basis of the identification of new causative pathways, the subphenotyping of asthma across the lifecourse of patients is paving the way for more-personalized and precise pathway-specific approaches for the prevention and treatment of asthma, creating the real possibility of total prevention and cure for this chronic inflammatory disease.

SARS-CoV-2 infected patients exhibit acute respiratory distress syndrome which can be compounded by endemic respiratory viruses and thus highlighting the need to understand the genetic bases of clinical outcome under multiple respiratory infections. In this study, 42 individual datasets and a multi-parametric based selected list of over 12,000 genes against five medically important respiratory viruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus were collected and analysed in an attempt to understand differentially regulated gene patterns and to cast genetic markers of individual and multiple co-infections. While a certain cohort of virus-specific genes were regulated (negatively and positively), notably results revealed a greatest correlation among gene regulation by SARS-CoV-2 and RSV. Furthermore, out of analysed genes, the MAP2K5 and NFKBIL1 were specifically and highly upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo or in vitro. In contrast, several genes including GPBAR1 and SC5DL were specifically downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 datasets. Additionally, we catalogued a set of genes that were conserved or differentially regulated across all the respiratory viruses.

To optimize the diagnostic pathway during the current COVID-19 outbreak, the hospital administration of our tertiary center applied a highly structured framework assigning specific tasks to the different units composing the Department of Imaging. In particular, since the beginning of the pandemic, a mobile CT scanner in a truck was rented and became operative for all patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and another CT was assigned for all suspected cases. The success and efficacy of the management applied by our administration is demonstrated by the fact that during the outbreak, the radiological workflow was never interrupted. In fact, despite the national lockdown only a 29.3% decrease of CT scans occurred compared to the previous year. Moreover, none of the healthcare providers of the Department contracted the infection at work.

They play crucial roles in regulating pathobiological processes, such as cancer, inflammation, and infectious diseases. The bioactive metabolites ceramide, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and sphingosine have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of several microbes. In contrast to ceramide, which often promotes bacterial and viral infections (for instance, by mediating adhesion and internalization), sphingosine, which is released from ceramide by the activity of ceramidases, kills many bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. In particular, sphingosine is an important natural component of the defense against bacterial pathogens in the respiratory tract. Pathologically reduced sphingosine levels in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells are normalized by inhalation of sphingosine, and coating plastic implants with sphingosine prevents bacterial infections. Pretreatment of cells with exogenous sphingosine also prevents the viral spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) from interacting with host cell receptors and inhibits the propagation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in macrophages.

So far, limited data has shown transplacental transmission of antibodies after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination with BNT162b2 in the third trimester. Our aim was to detect vertically transferred immunity after COVID-19 vaccination with BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, BioNTech-Pfizer) or mRNA-1273 (Spikevax, Moderna) in the first, second or third trimester of pregnancy, and investigate the impact of maternal characteristics on umbilical cord antibody titre in newborns after delivery. Study Design Women who gave birth in our department and were vaccinated against COVID-19 during pregnancy were enrolled in CRONOS Satellite, a subproject of the German COVID-19-Related Obstetric and Neonatal Outcome Study. The titre of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was quantified in umbilical cord blood using the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant immunoassay. Correlations between antibody titre and variables, including week of pregnancy when vaccinated, interval between vaccination and delivery, age and body mass index (BMI) were assessed with Spearman?s rank correlation. A follow-up was conducted by phone interview 4 C 6 weeks after delivery. Results The study cohort consisted of 70 women and their 74 newborns. Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all samples, irrespective of the vaccination type or time of vaccination. None of the parameters of interest showed a meaningful correlation with cord blood antibody concentrations (rho values < 0.5). No adverse outcomes (including foetal malformation) were reported, even after vaccination in the first trimester. Conclusions Transplacental passage of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from mother to child was demonstrated in all cases in the present study. It can therefore be assumed that the newborns of mothers vaccinated at any time during pregnancy receive antibodies via the placenta which potentially provide them with protection against COVID-19.

World Health Organization (WHO) has designated it as a global variant of concern (VOC) and has named as Omicron. A surge in new COVID-19 cases has been reported from certain geographical locations, primarily in South Africa (SA) following the emergence of Omicron. Materials and methods: We performed an in silico analysis of the complete genomic sequences of Omicron available on GISAID (until 2021-12-6) to predict the functional impact of the mutations present in this variant on virus-host interactions in terms of viral transmissibility, virulence/lethality, and immune escape. In addition, we performed a correlation analysis of the relative proportion of the genomic sequences of specific SARS-CoV-2 variants (in the period of 01 Oct-29 Nov 2021) with the current epidemiological data (new COVID-19 cases and deaths) from SA to understand whether the Omicron has an epidemiological advantage over existing variants. Results: Compared to the current list of global VOCs/VOIs (as per WHO) Omicron bears more sequence variation, specifically in the spike protein and host receptor-binding motif (RBM). Omicron showed the closest nucleotide and protein sequence homology with Alpha variant for the complete sequence as well as for RBM. The mutations were found primarily condensed in the spike region (28-48) of the virus. Further, the mutational analysis showed enrichment for the mutations decreasing ACE2-binding affinity and RBD protein expression, in contrast, increasing the propensity of immune escape. An inverse correlation of Omicron with Delta variant was noted (r=-0.99, p< .001, 95% CI: -0.99 to -0.97) in the sequences reported from SA post-emergence of the new variant, later showing a decrease. There has been a steep rise in the new COVID-19 cases in parallel with the increase in the proportion of Omicron since the first case (74-100%), on the contrary, the incidences of new deaths have not been increased (r=-0.04, p>0.05, 95% CI =-0.52 to 0.58). Conclusions: Omicron may have greater immune escape ability than the existing VOCs/VOIs. However, there are no clear indications coming out from the predictive mutational analysis that the Omicron may have higher virulence/lethality than other variants, including Delta.

Accumulating evidence supports their importance in defense against human viral infections such as CMV1, EBV2, dengue3, HIV4, 5 and SARSCoV-26. Moreover, expansion of so called CD28null cytotoxic CD4+ T cells have been reported in the blood of patients with rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA)7, myositis8 and vasculitis9 as well as in cardiovascular diseases10. Objectives: Here, we aimed to investigate the presence and clonal expansion of CD4+ CTL in the peripheral blood (PB) and synovial fluid (SF) of RA patients using single cell technologies. Methods: We assessed the expression of cytotoxic effector molecules and transcription factors in CD4+ T cells in synovial fluid (n=21) and paired peripheral blood (n=16) from ACPA-and APCA+ RA patients by multi-parameter flow cytometry. We performed single cell sequencing, in combination with 5 TCRab sequencing, on purified CD4+ T cells from the peripheral blood (PB) and synovial fluid (SF) of ACPA+ RA patients (n=7). Results: Flow cytometry experiments show that Granzyme-B+ Perforin-1+ CD4+ CTL are significantly increased in the SF of ACPA+ RA patients as compared to ACPA-RA patients (p=0.0072). The presence of CD4+ CTL could be confirmed by single cell sequencing in SF of each ACPA+ RA patient tested (n=7). Moreover, we found that the adhesion G-protein coupled receptor GPR56 is selectively expressed on the recently described peripheral helper (TPH) T-cell subset11 and associates with the expression of tissue resident memory markers LAG-3, CXCR6 and CD69. In blood, we confirmed a previous report12 showing that GPR56 delineates cytotoxic CD4+ T cells. Finally, expanded TCR clones expressing cytotoxic effector molecules were identified in synovial fluid of ACPA+ RA patients and, for some patients, in their corresponding peripheral blood. Conclusion: We identified GPR56 as a marker of TPH cells in SF of ACPA+ RA patients that associates with tissue residency receptors.

SI at 8 days, which was closer to the SI of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, 8 4 days), SI of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, 7 6 days) As for demonstration that a larger SI could lead to overestimation in R0, we conducted the simulation with two schemes that are ?

However, there are concerns about the overall strength of COVID-19 impact evaluation studies given the circumstances for evaluation and concerns about the publication environment. This study systematically reviewed the strength of evidence in the published COVID-19 policy impact evaluation literature. METHODS: We included studies that were primarily designed to estimate the quantitative impact of one or more implemented COVID-19 policies on direct SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 outcomes. After searching PubMed for peer-reviewed articles published on November 26 or earlier and screening, all studies were reviewed by three reviewers first independently and then to consensus. The review tool was based on previously developed and release review guidance for COVID-19 policy impact evaluation, assessing what impact evaluation method was used, graphical display of outcomes data, functional form for the outcomes, timing between policy and impact, concurrent changes to the outcomes, and an overall rating. RESULTS: After 102 articles were identified as potentially meeting inclusion criteria, we identified 36 published articles that evaluated the quantitative impact of COVID-19 policies on direct COVID-19 outcomes. The majority (n=23/36) of studies in our sample examined the impact of stay-at-home requirements. Nine studies were set aside because the study design was considered inappropriate for COVID-19 policy impact evaluation (n=8 pre/post; n=1 cross-section), and 27 articles were given a full consensus assessment. 20/27 met criteria for graphical display of data, 5/27 for functional form, 19/27 for timing between policy implementation and impact, and only 3/27 for concurrent changes to the outcomes. Only 1/27 studies passed all of the above checks, and 4/27 were rated as overall appropriate. Including the 9 studies set aside, reviewers found that only four of the 36 identified published and peer-reviewed health policy impact evaluation studies passed a set of key design checks for identifying the causal impact of policies on COVID-19 outcomes. DISCUSSION: The reviewed literature directly evaluating the impact of COVID-19 policies largely failed to meet key design criteria for useful inference. This was largely driven by the circumstances under which policies were passed making it difficult to attribute changes in COVID-19 outcomes to particular policies. More reliable evidence review is needed to both identify and produce policy-actionable evidence, alongside the recognition that actionable evidence is often unlikely to be feasible.","output":"Problems with Evidence Assessment in COVID-19 Health Policy Impact Evaluation (PEACHPIE): A systematic review of evidence strength"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic was initially characterized by misinformation and fear related to transmission that has been previously shown to produce stigma toward persons perceived to be at risk for transmission. This study evaluated perceptions toward scenarios with variable levels of perceived risk for COVID-19 acquisition, and compared stigma to COVID-19 to depression and opioid use disorder. METHODS: Respondents (N = 280) from the United States completed a web-based survey 6 months after pandemic declaration. Questions included demographics and COVID-19 misconceptions, expected response to hypothetical scenarios with variable risk for COVID-19, and the Attribution Questionnaire-9 for COVID-19, depression, and opioid use disorder. RESULTS: Participants had several COVID-19 misconceptions, including that opioids increased immunity (63.6%), persons were more susceptible based upon racial/ethnic background (63.2%), and underlying health conditions did not influence risk (58.9%). Respondents were highly likely (64/100) to assume someone coughing had COVID-19 and the majority (93.5%) recommended quarantining persons with recent travel. However, the majority of respondents (>70% in all cases) also believed they would not change their COVID-19-related behavior when interacting with persons of different racial, ethnic, and age backgrounds. Finally, persons with COVID-19 engendered greater pity, less fear, less blame, less anger, and more willingness to help from respondents relative to persons with opioid use disorder. CONCLUSION: Stigma ratings toward persons perceived at risk of transmitting COVID-19, collected soon after the onset of the pandemic, showed less evidence of stigma relative to persons with opioid use disorder despite pronounced misconceptions regarding COVID-19 risk.

METHODS From the six World Health Organization regions, 28 countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases were identified, and 111 pharmacy colleges were randomly selected from these countries. Two online surveys were sent to faculty members and senior administrators. They assessed changes in teaching and learning, experiential training, assessment, readiness for and challenges with distance e-learning and work-related stress. KEY FINDINGS Data were collected from 46 colleges. The majority (80.4%) of colleges transitioned to distance e-learning. On-site experiential training was discontinued in 55.5% of colleges and 25.0% redesigned on-site training into remote learning experiences. Assessments were modified in 75.9% of colleges. Assuring the integrity of assessments and delivering practical classes were the most prominent faculty challenges. The majority of faculty (75.0%) and administrators (61.9%) reported moderate work-related stress. Nevertheless, most academics felt that they received adequate support from their institutions and had positive perceptions of the transition to distance e-learning during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic required drastic changes for most programs' teaching methods. Our results showed that educational institutions were somewhat able to support faculty and the needs of educational programs were largely met. However, academic rigour and provision of experiential training can be improved. Faculty emotional support and training needs were not fully addressed in these difficult times.

Several studies have previously aimed to correlate the effects of Ascaris-Plasmodium coinfections but have obtained contradictory and inconclusive results. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate parasitological and immunopathological aspects of the lung during murine experimental concomitant coinfection by Plasmodium berghei and Ascaris suum during larvae ascariasis. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were inoculated with 1  10(4) P. berghei strain NK65-NY-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) intraperitoneally and/or 2500 embryonated eggs of A. suum by oral gavage. P. berghei parasitaemia, morbidity and the survival rate were assessed. On the seventh day postinfection (dpi), A. suum lung burden analysis; bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL); histopathology; NAG, MPO and EPO activity measurements; haematological analysis; and respiratory mechanics analysis were performed. The concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-6, IL-4, IL-33, IL-13, IL-5, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-, TNF and TGF- were assayed by sandwich ELISA. RESULTS: Animals coinfected with P. berghei and A. suum show decreased production of type 1, 2, and 17 and regulatory cytokines; low leukocyte recruitment in the tissue; increased cellularity in the circulation; and low levels of NAG, MPO and EPO activity that lead to an increase in larvae migration, as shown by the decrease in larvae recovered in the lung parenchyma and increase in larvae recovered in the airway. This situation leads to severe airway haemorrhage and, consequently, an impairment respiratory function that leads to high morbidity and early mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the Ascaris-Plasmodium interaction is harmful to the host and suggests that this coinfection may potentiate Ascaris-associated pathology by dampening the Ascaris-specific immune response, resulting in the early death of affected animals.

We analyze U.S. data for 70 years from 1948 until 2018. To capture their fluctuation essence, we concentrate on the non-Gaussianity of their distributions. We investigate how the non-Gaussianity of these variables affects the coupling structure of them. We distinguish regular from rare events, in calculating the correlation coefficient, emphasizing that both cases might lead to a different response of the economy. Through the multifractal random wall model, one can see that the non-Gaussianity depends on time scales. The non-Gaussianity of unemployment is noticeable only for periods shorter than one year; for longer periods, the fluctuation distribution tends to a Gaussian behavior. In contrast, the non-Gaussianities of inflation fluctuations persist for all time scales. We observe through the bivariate multifractal random walk that despite the inflation features, the non-Gaussianity of the coupled structure is finite for scales less than one year, drops for periods larger than one year, and becomes small for scales greater than two years. This means that the footprint of the monetary policies intentionally influencing the inflation and unemployment couple is observed only for time horizons smaller than two years. Finally, to improve some understanding of the effect of rare events, we calculate high moments of the variables increments for various q orders and various time scales. The results show that coupling with high moments sharply increases during crises.","output":"Coupled Criticality Analysis of Inflation and Unemployment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As many students in higher education are skilled users of mobile technology, mobile learning (mLearning) can be a promising educational strategy to enhance their learning experience. mLearning might also be well suited for nursing students as they navigate between multiple learning contexts in their educational curriculum. As an educational strategy, mLearning may also reduce challenges caused by the theory-practice gap in nursing by supporting skills and knowledge transfer between the university and clinical settings. As the introduction of basic physical assessment skills (B-PASs) into Norwegian bachelors degree education in nursing occurred quite recently, there is a lack of competence in supervision and teaching in both university and clinical settings. As such, mLearning appears to be a good strategy to support student B-PAS learning and knowledge transfer across learning contexts. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore and elicit the perspectives of students regarding the way in which a selection of digital learning resources supports B-PAS learning and application in clinical rotation, which of the selected digital learning resources are beneficial to include in a suite of mLearning tools, and how the selected digital learning resources could support the transfer of skills and knowledge from the academic to clinical context. METHODS: We used a longitudinal participatory design approach to co-design a suite of mLearning tools. The co-design processes took place in several workshops (WSs) over a period of 3 months: 2 WSs with first-year students (n=6), 3 WSs with second-year students (n=6), and 3 WSs with third-year students (n=8). The students evaluated several digital learning resources in both academic and clinical contexts. The digital learning resources included digital simulation with virtual patients, massive open online courses, and multimedia learning material. In the co-design WS, the potential and benefits of these digital learning resources for the learning and application of B-PASs were explored. RESULTS: The students reported that the digital learning resources stimulated learning in 7 different ways. They also emphasized the importance of including all selected and tested digital learning resources. Moreover, students supported the inclusion of additional learning material, such as multiple-choice tests and written assignments, aimed at providing feedback and contributing to knowledge development. CONCLUSIONS: The co-design processes and collaboration with the nursing students provided insight into how a suite of mLearning tools may support the learning and application of B-PASs and human bioscience knowledge in clinical rotation. From the students perspective, one of the strengths of the suite of mLearning tools was the range of content, as this met a broader range of student learning preferences regarding learning B-PASs. The suite of mLearning tools contributes to and supports skills training and knowledge transfer between multiple learning contexts.","output":"Configuration of Mobile Learning Tools to Support Basic Physical Assessment in Nursing Education: Longitudinal Participatory Design Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic parastomal hernia repair with modified Sugarbaker technique has become increasingly the operation of choice because of its low recurrence rates. This study aimed to assess feasibility, safety, and efficiency of performing the same operation with single-incision laparoscopic surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients referred from March 2010 to February 2013 were considered for single-port laparoscopic repair with modified Sugarbaker technique. A SILS port (Covidien, Norwalk, Connecticut, USA) was used together with conventional straight dissecting instruments and a 5.5- mm/52-cm/30 laparoscope. Important technical aspects include modified dissection techniques, namely, \\"inline\\" and \\"chopsticks\\" to overcome loss of triangulation, insertion of a urinary catheter into an ostomy for ostomy limb identification, safe adhesiolysis by avoiding electocautery, saline -jet dissection to demarcate tissue planes, dissection of an entire laparotomy scar to expose incidental incisional hernias, adequate mobilization of an ostomy limb for lateralization, and wide overlapping of defect with antiadhesive mesh. RESULTS Of 6 patients, 5 underwent single-port laparoscopic repair, and 1 (whose body mass index [BMI] of 39.4 kg/m(2) did not permit SILS port placement) underwent multiport repair. Mean defect size was 10 cm, and mean mesh size was 660 cm(2) with 4 patients having incidental incisional hernias repaired by the same mesh. Mean operation time was 270 minutes, and mean hospital stay was 4 days. Appliance malfunction ceased immediately, and pain associated with parastomal hernia disappeared.

We analysed cardiological parameters including ECG and high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) level and their association with mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. METHODS We retrospectively analysed the demographics, comorbidities, laboratory findings and electrocardiographic parameters of 453 consecutive patients, whose outcome was clear, died or discharged. Findings were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Also, the same comparison was made between cardiac injury and no-cardiac injury subgroups. RESULTS The cardiac injury group had significantly higher in-hospital mortality than the no-cardiac injury group. Also, frequencies of atrial fibrillation, axis change, ST-segment/T-wave change, fragmented QRS, premature atrial/ventricular contraction was found to be higher in the cardiac injury group. Moreover, non-survivors had longer QRS intervals, more frequent ST-segment/T-wave changes and isolated S1Q3T3 pattern than surviving patients. Laboratory results showed median values of hs-TnT at the admission of 4.95 ng/L (IQR, 3-12.35) with concentrations markedly higher in the non-surviving patients vs survivors. Hs-TnT value along with age and respiratory rate was found to be an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Comorbidities were more frequently reported in non-surviving and cardiac injury groups than those surviving and without cardiac injury. CONCLUSIONS In COVID-19 patients, both elevated hs-TnT and ECG abnormalities, suggesting cardiac involvement, on admission portends an ominous prognosis and indicates at higher risk of in-hospital mortality.

We used hemoperfusion (HP) as a therapeutic option in our patients. The aims of this study are to report characteristics, rates and outcomes of all patients affected by infection with SARS-CoV-2 undergoing HD and were treated under our care focusing on the impact of HP on them. METHOD: This is an observational study. Our Dialysis Unit has been assigned as a referral unit for Covid-19 positive HD patients. Patients divided to 2 groups: first group of patients underwent HD sessions with Hemoperfusion (A) and the second one received HD sessions without any other extracorporeal blood purification method (B). We used resin-directed hemoadsorption cartridges (HA-330 and HA-130) manufactured by the Jafron Biomedical Company, China.

Group B 9 patients (7 males) with mean age of 75 years old did not receive HP during their hospitalization. All of them were presented symptomatic. 8 out of 9 patients died after 6 days of hospitalization (range: 1-14 days), 2 of them in ICU. CONCLUSION: To sum up, HP seems to be a helpful, safe an quite efficient tool in the battle against Covid-19 in HD patients. Despite the method is unspecific, our lack of strong evidence, our views are with the opinion that is an reliable alternative therapy. However, the real impact of HP on the patients clinical course (time of initiation, therapeutic protocols, tools to evaluate response) has yet to be determined. The above notice does not minimize the great interest for the method that renal community should give.","output":"MO857 HEMOPERFUSION IN HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 INFECTION: IMPACT ON CLINICAL COURSE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper presents improvement of a commonly used learning algorithm for logistic regression.

METHODS Forty-eight patients with localized prostate cancer were enrolled in this study and were divided randomly into two groups, which were treated by the standard PR technique (standard PR group; n = 24) or the three-layer PR technique using peritoneum (three-layer PR group; n = 24) during RARP. We prospectively analyzed the continence rate by the 1-hour pad test. All patients underwent urethrocystography at 6 days postoperatively to evaluate position of vesicourethral junction. Pelvic MRI was also performed at 6 months postoperatively for anatomical evaluation. RESULTS Four weeks after RARP, the urinary continence rate was significantly higher in the three-layer PR group (57%) than in the standard PR group (26%, p = 0.036). Urethrocystography demonstrated that the postoperative craniocaudal distance from the symphysis pubis to the level of the vesicourethral junction was significantly shorter in the three-layer PR group than in the standard PR group (p < 0.01), suggesting that there was less tension on the vesicourethral anastomosis after three-layer PR. MRI confirmed that three-layer PR provided firmer reinforcement of the structures, supporting the posterior aspect of the urethral sphincter complex. CONCLUSIONS This prospective comparative study might suggest that three-layer two-step PR using peritoneum during RARP is a simple and feasible method seeming to improve early recovery of postoperative continence compared with standard two-step PR, although larger multicenter randomized controlled trials will be needed.","output":"Three-Layer Two-Step Posterior Reconstruction Using Peritoneum During Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy to Improve Recovery of Urinary Continence: A Prospective Comparative Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this literature review is to examine the significance of the nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) gene in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).

The occurrence of such variants is mainly related to mutations in hemagglutinin (HA). Previously we discovered mutations in H5N1 influenza virus hemagglutinin, which contributes to virus immune evasion. The purpose of this work was to study the role of these mutations in changing other, non-antigenic properties of the virus and the possibility of their maintenance in the viral population. Mutations were introduced into the HA gene of a recombinant H5N1 influenza A virus (VNH5N1-PR8/CDC-RG) using site-specific mutagenesis. The variant viruses were investigated and compared with respect to replication kinetics in chicken embryos, thermostability, reproductive activity at different temperatures (33, 37 and 40C), and virulence for mice. Amino acid substitutions I155T, K156Q, K156E+V138A, N186K led to a decrease in thermal stability, replication activity of the mutant viruses in chicken embryos, and virulence for mice, although these effects differed between the variants. The K156Q and N186K mutations reduced viral reproduction at elevated temperature (40C). The analysis of the frequency of these mutations in natural isolates of H5N1 influenza viruses indicated that the K156E/Q and N186K mutations have little chance to gain a foothold during evolution, in contrast to the I155T mutation, which is the most responsible for antigenic drift.

However, the fever-based screening procedure employing IRT suffers from low sensitivity, because monitoring body temperature alone is insufficient for detecting infected patients. To overcome the drawbacks of fever-based screening, this study aims to develop and evaluate a multiple vital sign (i.e., body temperature, heart rate and respiration rate) measurement system using RGB-thermal image sensors. Methods: The RGB camera measures blood volume pulse (BVP) through variations in the light absorption from human facial areas. IRT is used to estimate the respiration rate by measuring the change in temperature near the nostrils or mouth accompanying respiration. To enable a stable and reliable system, the following image and signal processing methods were proposed and implemented: (1) an RGB-thermal image fusion approach to achieve highly reliable facial region-of-interest tracking, (2) a heart rate estimation method including a tapered window for reducing noise caused by the face tracker, reconstruction of a BVP signal with three RGB channels to optimize a linear function, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio and multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm for estimating the pseudo-spectrum from limited time-domain BVP signals within 15 s and (3) a respiration rate estimation method implementing nasal or oral breathing signal selection based on signal quality index for stable measurement and MUSIC algorithm for rapid measurement. We tested the system on 22 healthy subjects and 28 patients with seasonal influenza, using the support vector machine (SVM) classification method. Results: The body temperature, heart rate and respiration rate measured in a non-contact manner were highly similarity to those measured via contact-type reference devices (i.e., thermometer, ECG and respiration belt), with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.71, 0.87 and 0.87, respectively. Moreover, the optimized SVM model with three vital signs yielded sensitivity and specificity values of 85.7% and 90.1%, respectively. Conclusion: For contactless vital sign measurement, the system achieved a performance similar to that of the reference devices. The multiple vital sign-based screening achieved higher sensitivity than fever-based screening.

In a two-wave study (T1: N = 254; T2: N = 135) conducted in May and June 2020, we find that individual differences in fairness and gratitude were associated with more adaptive (i.e. positive emotions) and prosocial (i.e. remaining familiar with the pandemic, adhering to public health guidelines, prioritizing saving lives) responses to the pandemic. These effects are mediated through differences in impact legacy motives (i.e. being concerned about the impact one leaves behind once they have passed).

This makes a serious threat to the world in terms of public health. The present study aimed to compare the COVID-19 epidemic parameters in Turkey with the top ten countries that reported the highest number of confirmed cases worldwide on April 25, 2020. Plus, it might provide better insight into the efficacy of national interventions on the course of the disease by measuring the case-fatality rate. Methods A detailed search of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering official websites, and announcements were conducted between January 22 and April 25, 2020. COVID-19 related datasets for the distribution of the infection on each reported day were obtained. Results Although the growth rate sharply increased by more than 1.2% in the late January 2020, the cumulative number of cases remained below 1500 around the world. The epidemic growth curve in Turkey was very similar to the US and Italy during the period. The case-fatality rate in Turkey was 2.51%, which below the countries with the most cases, except Russia, and the recoveryCdeath ratio appeared to be at a moderate level among these countries.

Investigating the microbiome using next-generation sequencing technology has revealed examples of mutualism and conflict between microbes and humans. Comparing to bacteria, the viral component of the microbiome (i.e., the virome) is understudied. Somatic tissues of healthy individuals are usually inaccessible for the virome sampling; therefore, there is limited understanding of the presence and distribution of viruses in tissues in healthy individuals and how virus infection associates with human gene expression and perturbs immunological homeostasis. RESULTS: To characterize the human virome in a tissue-specific manner, here we performed meta-transcriptomic analysis using the RNA-sequencing dataset from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. We analyzed the 8991 RNA-sequencing data obtained from 51 somatic tissues from 547 individuals and successfully detected 39 viral species in at least one tissue. We then investigated associations between virus infection and human gene expression and human disease onset. We detected some expected relationships; for instance, hepatitis C virus infection in the liver was strongly associated with interferon-stimulated gene upregulation and pathological findings of chronic hepatitis. The presence of herpes simplex virus type 1 in one subjects brain strongly associated with immune gene expression. While torque teno virus was detected in a broad range of human tissues, it was not associated with interferon responses. Being notable in light of its association with lymphoproliferative disorders, Epstein-Barr virus infection in the spleen and blood was associated with an increase in plasma cells in healthy subjects. Human herpesvirus 7 was often detected in the stomach; intriguingly, it associated with the proportion of human leukocytes in the stomach as well as digestive gene expression. Moreover, virus infections in the local tissues associated with systemic immune responses in circulating blood. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive investigation of the human virome in a variety of tissues in healthy individuals through meta-transcriptomic analysis. Further investigation of the associations described here, and application of this analytical pipeline to additional datasets, will be useful to reveal the impact of viral infections on human health.","output":"A tissue level atlas of the healthy human virome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Having a vaccine available does not necessarily imply that it will be used.

We examine the respective prominence of the MFT dimensions in government communication regarding childhood vaccinations and explore its effect on parents vaccine hesitancy. We measure the MFT dimension loading of the vaccination information brochures from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) between 2011-2019 and connect this information with the electronic national immunisation register to investigate if the use of moral foundations in government communication has a measurable effect on vaccination uptake. We find the largest positive effect for the dimensions Authority/Subversion and Liberty/Oppression and suggestive evidence in favour of a small positive effect for Purity/Degradation. Conversely, Loyalty/Betrayal actually has a negative effect on vaccination rates. For the dimension Harm/Care, we find no significant effect. While Purity/Degradation and Harm/Care appear to be the two most frequently used moral foundations by RIVM, these dimensions have in fact no or only a minor effect on parents vaccine hesitancy. Reducing the use of these moral foundations may be the first step towards optimising government communication in this context.

Introduction: In Spain the state of alarm secondary to COVID-19 dramatically changed the medical and surgical assistance activity of other pathologies. Regarding urological pathologies, those considered as non-urgent (andrology and reconstructive surgery) were postponed or even unattended. Material and Methods: In May 2020, once the first COVID-19 wave was almost over and still in the state of alarm, a 24-item survey was sent to 120 urologists from the Andrology Group and the Urologic Reconstructive Surgery Group of the Spanish Urological Association (AEU). Its aim was to determine the impact on clinical and surgical practice in both subspecialties. Results: We observed a response rate of 75.8% with 91 answered surveys. Before the state of alarm, 49.5% of urologists had 1-2 weekly surgical sessions available, surgical waiting list was 3-12 months for the 71.4%, and 39.6% attended between 20-40 patients weekly in office. During the state of alarm, 95.6% were given any kind of surgical guidelines, prioritizing emergency and oncologic pathologies. In the 85.7% of the hospitals neither andrology nor reconstructive surgeries were performed. In office, around 50% of patients were attended not on-site, most of them through telemedicine (phone calls and e-mails).

Here, we studied the variations of amount and composition of municipal solid waste before the pandemic in 2019 and during the pandemic in 2020C2021 in USA, Brazil, Canada, UK, France and Italy. We used a stringency index and a composite mobility index to assess the lockdown intensity and peoples movements. Results show that the mobility index sharply decreased with lockdown intensity, and enforcing measures were more efficient in France and Italy. Compared to 2019, prolonged lockdowns caused larger decreases in the quantity of commercial and construction wastes versus household waste. The initial implementation of lockdown or unlocking measures promoted inhabitants consumption, generally leading to the increased waste amount, by about 9% for Trento and 12% for Montreal at the beginning of lockdown, respectively. Moreover, larger variations in the waste amount in Trento, from ? 25.3 to 9.8%, were in line with higher lockdown intensity compared to those in Montreal, from ? 9.5 to 12.7%, affected by peoples mobility, consumers behaviors and waste management.

The parameter t(t), equivalent to the doubling-time of the virus described by our research group, has also been useful in this regard. AIMS: To identify and compare parameters suitable for monitoring the course of the pandemic and to evaluate the extent to which these reflect qualitatively and quantitatively the effects of interventional measures introduced to control the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Parameters potentially useful for monitoring the course of the pandemic were obtained empirically or derived using the Bateman SIZ model and observational data for the daily increase in the number of new infections. The doubling-time in the number of infections, t(t), was obtained by curve-fitting observational data for the previous 14-day interval and a fixed value for t? (half-life for rate of recovery = 6.24 days). The effects of the interventional measures on the course of the pandemic as reflected in the modulation of the identified parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 5 different parameters (Incidence(t), R9(t), t_stable(S), Incidencecalc(t+14), t(t)) of potential value in monitoring the course of the pandemic were identified. Lockdown measures altered Incidence(t), and these effects could be quantitated from alterations in the reproduction factor, R9(t), a parameter with prognostic value reflecting the consequences of non-intervention. The parameter t_stable(S) is a function of the proportion of susceptible persons and therefore reflects the effects of vaccination. Although vaccination was in progress, together with lockdown and restrictions associated with the Recovered-Vaccinated-tested rule, R9(t) remained above 1.0 apparently due to the emergence of the more virulent M? variant (4th wave of the pandemic in Germany). CONCLUSION: i) The newly identified parameters provide qualitative and quantitative information on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. ii) R9(t) is a suitable parameter for assessing the effects of interventional measures and may have prognostic value. iii) The parameter t_stable(S), a function of the proportion of susceptible persons, reflects the effects of vaccination. iv) Incidencecalc(t+14) provides prognostic information on the projected course of the pandemic with the assumption that the factors driving the pandemic do not change and is recommended as a suitable parameter for making decisions in real-time, with minimum delay, whether lockdown measures should be implemented.","output":"Effect of lockdown and vaccination on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is associated with a large number of cardiovascular sequelae, including dysrhythmias, myocardial injury, myocarditis and thrombosis.

We describe key features and early learnings of these programs in the hospital setting. METHODS: Relevant clinical and operational leadership from an academic medical center, pediatric teaching hospital, and safety net county health system met to share learnings shortly after deploying inpatient telemedicine. A summative analysis of their learnings was re-circulated for approval. RESULTS: All three institutions faced pressure to urgently standup new telemedicine systems while still maintaining secure information exchange. Differences across patient demographics and technological capabilities led to variation in solution design, though key technical considerations were similar. Rapid deployment in each system relied on readily available consumer-grade technology, given the existing familiarity to patients and clinicians and minimal infrastructure investment. Preliminary data from the academic medical center over one month suggested positive adoption with 631 inpatient video calls lasting an average (standard deviation) of 16.5 minutes (19.6) based on inclusion criteria. DISCUSSION: The threat of an imminent surge of COVID-19 patients drove three institutions to rapidly develop inpatient telemedicine solutions. Concurrently, federal and state regulators temporarily relaxed restrictions that would have previously limited these efforts. Strategic direction from executive leadership, leveraging off-the-shelf hardware, vendor engagement, and clinical workflow integration facilitated rapid deployment.

METHODS: Five hundred and sixty-five archived, SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patient specimens received at the Pathology Department of the Indus Hospital & Health Network between January 2021 and June 2021 were retested in June 2021. Samples had been stored at -70C or below throughout this duration. Sample integrity following storage was assessed as the percentage of samples with reproducible results, and as consistency of cycle threshold (Ct) values between the original testing and the repeat testing. RESULTS: Of the 565 samples evaluated in this study, 86% gave reproducible results upon retesting. However, there was no correlation between the duration of storage and result reproducibility, though the majority (69% for PCR Target-I and 78% for PCR Target-II respectively) of non-reproducible results had Ct values above 30. Similarly, there was a consistent increase of Ct values upon storage at ultra-freezer temperatures, though the effect again was more contingent upon freezing the sample in the ultra-freezer rather than the duration of storage. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 positive respiratory specimens for PCR can be stored for up to six months at -70C or below without loss of sample integrity, though there is some loss of PCR-detected viral targets as evidenced by an immediate increased in the PCR-generated Ct values.

It tends to be a longer support and there are several factors that can degrade the physical structure of the ECMO cannula and put the cannula at risk for breakage. Case Report: A 63-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia. Two days later, she was intubated and VV-ECMO was initiated due to treatment-resistant acute respiratory failure;a 28Fr CrescentTM dual-lumen cannula (Medtronic, MN) was inserted through the left subclavian vein and connected to a centrifugal oxygen pump with a centrifugal oxygenator. Within six weeks after onset, the patient was unable to be weaned from the ventilator and was transferred to our center with ECMO connected for consideration of lung transplantation. Two days after transfer, the patient developed acute aphasia, altered mental status, disturbed consciousness, and left arm seizures. A suction sound was heard from the left subclavian cannula insertion site and the ECMO bubble detector alarmed, but local inspection, chest X-rays, and CT scans of the brain and chest showed no obvious abnormalities. The patient was reintubated for encephalopathy and subsequently underwent a tracheostomy. The patient regained normal neurological function over the next 7 days. However, the air bubble sensor alarmed and suction sound was heard at the cannulation site again, and air bubbles were seen in the oxygenator. Due to concerns about air entrapment and cannula failure, we changed to a dual-canal VV-ECMO configuration using a right internal cervical and a left femoral cannula. The removed cannula had a 2 cm fracture distal to the skin insertion site. After resumption of ECMO, no new neurological episodes occurred. While awaiting lung transplantation, the patient died due to sepsis and multiple organ failure. An autopsy revealed a possible cause of cerebrovascular disease patent foramen ovale and air embolism to the brain. If a patient has been on ECMO for a long time and the bubble sensor warns of air detection, cannula breakage and impending air embolism should be suspected clinically, even if the defect is not found on examination and is not evident on imaging. If the COVID-19 epidemic continues, increased transport events may increase ECMO cannula breakage.","output":"A Case Report of ECMO Patient with Cerebrovascular Complication Caused by a Broken Dual Lumen Cannula"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aging is a major risk factor of high incidence and increased mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19.

Most hospitals or countries can train their own models using in-house data, however empirical evidence shows that those models perform poorly when tested on new unseen cases, surfacing the need for coordinated global collaboration. Due to privacy regulations, medical data sharing between hospitals and nations is extremely difficult. We propose a GAN-augmented federated learning model, dubbed ST-FL (Style Transfer Federated Learning), for COVID-19 image segmentation. Federated learning (FL) permits a centralised model to be learned in a secure manner from heterogeneous datasets located in disparate private data silos. We demonstrate that the widely varying data quality on FL client nodes leads to a sub-optimal centralised FL model for COVID-19 chest CT image segmentation. ST-FL is a novel FL framework that is robust in the face of highly variable data quality at client nodes. The robustness is achieved by a denoising CycleGAN model at each client of the federation that maps arbitrary quality images into the same target quality, counteracting the severe data variability evident in real-world FL use-cases. Each client is provided with the target style, which is the same for all clients, and trains their own denoiser.

Twenty individuals received NIR t-PBM (n = 9) or sham therapy (n = 11) twice a week for 8 weeks. Sexual desire, arousal, and orgasm were assessed using the Systematic Assessment for Treatment-Emergent Effects-Specific Inquiry (SAFTEE-SI).

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are of multifactorial etiology, and manifest with jaw dysfunction, masticatory muscle tension or pain, as well as headache. Though bruxism can act as an exacerbating factor for TMD, stress can also play crucial role in the onset. The study aimed to measure occurrence of TMD and bruxism symptoms in the medical student population, asses the stress level, and evaluate adopted stress-coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. A survey study was performed among 1018 students at Medical University of Lodz during April 2020. A self-designed questionnaire for screening TMD and bruxism symptoms, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and Brief-COPE questionnaires were applied. TMD and bruxism symptoms were observed in the majority of subjects during social isolation. The perceived stress levels were significantly higher in those experiencing TMD and bruxism symptoms. Mostly maladaptive, emotion-focused coping strategies were chosen by study subjects experiencing high levels of stress.

Our static analysis reveals a moderate liquidity connectedness among our sample cryptocurrencies, whereas BTC and LTC play a significant role in connectedness magnitude. A distinct liquidity cluster is observed for BTC, LTC, and XRP, and ETH, XMR, and Dash also form another distinct liquidity cluster. The frequency domain analysis reveals that liquidity connectedness is more pronounced in the short-run time horizon than the medium- and long-run time horizons. In the short run, BTC, LTC, and XRP are the leading contributor to liquidity shocks, whereas, in the long run, ETH assumes this role. Compared with the medium term, a tight liquidity clustering is found in the short and long terms. The time-varying analysis indicates that liquidity connectedness in the cryptocurrency market increases over time, pointing to the possible effect of rising demand and higher acceptability for this unique asset.

METHODS: CgA and VS-I plasma concentrations were measured at hospital admission from March to May 2020 in 190 patients. 40 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers served as controls. CgA and VS-I levels relationship with demographics, comorbidities and disease severity was assessed through Mann Whitney U test or Spearman correlation test. Cox regression analysis and Kaplan Meier survival curves were performed to investigate the impact of the CgA and VS-I levels on in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Median CgA and VS-I levels were higher in patients than in healthy controls (CgA: 0.558 nM [interquartile range, IQR 0.358C1.046] vs 0.368 nM [IQR 0.288C0.490] respectively, p = 0.0017; VS-I: 0.357 nM [IQR 0.196C0.465] vs 0.144 nM [0.144C0.156] respectively, p<0.0001).

Our objective was to describe the Spanish experience of this technique and analyze its reliability and short- to mid-term efficacy. METHODS: National multicenter observational study, which retrospectively recruited all patients (of any age) with VSD (of any location or type) who underwent percutaneous NitOcclud occlusion, using an intention-to-treat analysis, until January 2019. RESULTS: A total of 117 attempts were made to implant at least 1 NitOcclud in 116 patients in 13 institutions. The median [range] age and weight was 8.6 [0.4-69] years and 27 [5.8-97] kg, respectively. In 99 patients (85%), the VSD was an isolated congenital defect. The location was perimembranous in 95 (81%), and 74 (63%) of them were aneurysmatic. The mean fluoroscopy time was 34 [11.4-124] minutes. Of the 117 attempts, 104 were successful (89%) with a follow-up of 31.4 [0.6-59] months. At the last review, final complete occlusion of the defect without residual shunt or with only a minimal shunt was achieved in 92.3% (no shunt, n=73; trivial shunt, n=23). Four patients required a second procedure for residual shunt occlusion. Two devices had to be surgically explanted due to severe hemolysis. There were no deaths or other major complications. CONCLUSIONS: The NitOcclud device can be used successfully for a wide anatomical spectrum of VSD. The main issue is residual shunt, but its incidence decreases over time. The incidence of hemolysis was very low and no permanent changes were detected in atrioventricular conduction.","output":"Spanish registry of percutaneous VSD closure with NitOcclud L VSD Coil device: lessons learned after more than a hundred implants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients often experience several transitions of care following critical illness. Research has explored the challenges which patients have with medication management across these transitions. It is unclear whether patients admitted to critical care due to COVID-19 will have similar challenges. The aim of this study was to explore medication management in critical care survivors following severe COVID-19. METHODS: Between 3 and 7 months post hospital discharge, patients who had been admitted to critical care due to severe COVID-19 were invited to an established recovery service. During the clinic consultation a medication review was performed by a pharmacist. This included medicines reconciliation, assessing the appropriateness of each of the prescribed medications and identification of medication changes. We also assessed changes to pain management in the discharge period. RESULTS: In total, 78 patients had a full medication review available. Over 70% of patients were taking an increased dose of medicine or a new medicine at clinic. There was a significant overall increase in new medication during the clinic consultation, across different British National Formulary classifications (OR: 1.73 (95% CI: 1.28 to 2.34), p<0.001). Compared with pre critical care admission, there was a significant increase in the number of patients taking regular analgesia following severe COVID-19 infection (23 (29.5%) vs 39 (50%), p<0.001).

This information is important for implementing wastewater-based epidemiology, but it also provides insight relevant to the design and regulation of potable reuse systems. Specifically, smaller systems may be more prone to influent concentration spikes that can drive enteric pathogen risk during disease outbreaks. It may be possible to leverage reactor hydraulics to achieve peak averaging in these scenarios, although it then becomes important to consider how elevated risks at the lower percentiles potentially offset benefits at the upper percentiles. Informed by SARS-CoV-2 concentration dynamics, the current study simulated relative risk for a hypothetical enteric pathogen. Simulated reactor hydraulics (i.e., dispersion) increased pathogen concentrations by up to 2.6 logs at lower percentiles but also decreased concentrations by up to 1.1 logs at the upper percentiles that sometimes drive public health risk. Collectively, these data highlight the importance of considering outbreak conditions, pathogen spikes, and peak averaging in the design and operation of treatment systems and in the development of regulatory frameworks.","output":"Pathogen Peak Averaging in Potable Reuse Systems: Lessons Learned from Wastewater Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By outlining the times and outcomes in the spread of Covid-19 infection across European countries, and zeroing in on Italy as the territory that recorded the highest number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Europe between February and June 2020, this contribution lays the premise for investigating the thesis upheld in this volume, namely that territorial features significantly affect the intensity and severity of contagion.

Finally, the predictions of crucial targets of anisodamine on SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed by molecular docking studies. We discovered that anisodamine suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells, and reduced the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry to HEK293/hACE2 cells. Furthermore, molecular docking studies indicated that anisodamine may target SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) with the docking score of ?6.63 kcal/mol and formed three H-bonds with Gly143, Cys145, and Cys44 amino acid residues at the predicted active site of Mpro.

The purpose of this study was to clarify this relationship, while accounting for some other factors that likely influence scientific impact (e.g., the reputations of the scientists conducting the research and academic journal in which the research was published). To accomplish this purpose, approximately 800 peer-reviewed articles describing original research were evaluated for scientific impact, popular media attention, and reputations of the scientists/authors and publication venue. A structural equation model was produced describing the relationship between non-scientific impact (popular media) and scientific impact (citations), while accounting for author/scientist and journal reputation. The resulting model revealed a strong association between the amount of popular media attention given to a scientific research project and corresponding publication and the number of times that publication is cited in peer-reviewed scientific literature. These results indicate that (1) peer-reviewed scientific publications receiving more attention in non-scientific media are more likely to be cited than scientific publications receiving less popular media attention, and (2) the non-scientific media is associated with the scientific agenda.

Methods. Nasal lavage fluid was collected from patients who were submitted to SARS-CoV-2 screening test, due to a preceding positive rapid antigen test. A control group was enrolled among healthcare professionals whose nasopharyngeal swab tested negative. Nasal lavages were performed using isotonic saline solution injected through a nasal fossa. Both lavage fluid and traditional nasopharyngeal swab were analyzed by real time PCR and antigenic test. Results. A total of 49 positive subjects were enrolled in the study. Results of the analysis on lavages and nasopharyngeal swabs were concordant for 48 cases, regardless of the antigenic and molecular test performed. Real time PCR resulted weakly positive at swab in one case and negative at lavage fluid. Among the control group (44 subjects) nasopharyngeal swab and lavage fluid analyses returned a negative result.

This included stay-at-home orders that prevented people from leaving their homes for work or study, except for urgent medical care or buying essential items. This practice could have both short and long-term implications for health and wellbeing of people in the UK. Using longitudinal data of 10,630 UK adults, this study prospectively examined the association between home confinement status during the stringent lockdown in the UK (March 23-May 13, 2020) and 20 indicators of subjective well-being, social well-being, pro-social/altruistic behaviors, psychological distress, and health behaviors assessed approximately one month after the stringent lockdown ended. All analyses adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics and social isolation status in the beginning of the pandemic. Home confinement during the lockdown was associated with greater subsequent compliance with COVID-19 rules, more perceived major stressors, and a lower prevalence of physical activity. There was modest evidence of associations with lower life satisfaction, greater loneliness, greater depressive symptoms, greater anxiety symptoms, and more perceived minor stressors post-lockdown. However, there was little evidence that home confinement was associated with other indices of subsequent health and well-being. While our study shows that home confinement impacts some indices of subsequent health and wellbeing outcomes even after lockdown, the degree of the psychological adaptation to the difficult confinement behavior remains unclear and should be further studied.

A total of N = 208 students (82.7% female; M age = 20.90, SD = 4.10) completed an online questionnaire assessing health behaviors and environmental factors at the beginning of their first semester. RESULTS: Current and expected physical activity was associated to that of all social ties, current and expected alcohol use to partner's and peers alcohol use, while current and expected eating was only associated to peers eating. The relationship between partner's or peers and participant's alcohol use was moderated by coresidence, with a greater probability of engaging in these behaviors observed in case of coresidence. Perceived peer encouragement for alcohol consumption moderated the relationship between peer alcohol use and the number of drinks consumed by participants per month. Participants who spend more time with peers were more likely to consume higher amounts of alcohol. No differences were found regarding present and expected behaviors of participants who moved out of their parents home and those who did not. CONCLUSION: Partners and peers significantly influence students health behaviors, particularly alcohol use. Interventions to prevent health risk behaviors among freshmen should therefore address these social ties influence.","output":"Health behaviors of German university freshmen during COVID-19 in association with health behaviors of close social ties, living arrangement, and time spent with peers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aerosol production represents a major concern during the majority of dental procedures. The aim of the present study is to investigate the dynamics of aerosol particles after 15 min of continuous supragingival ultrasonic instrumentation with no attempt of containment through particle count analysis. Eight volunteers were treated with supragingival ultrasonic instrumentation of the anterior buccal region. A gravimetric impactor was positioned 1 m away and at the same height of the head of the patient. Particles of different sizes (0.3C10 m) were measured at the beginning of instrumentation, at the end of instrumentation (EI), and then every 15 min up to 105 min. The 0.3-m particles showed non-significant increases at 15/30 min. The 0.5C1-m particles increased at EI (p < 0.05), and 0.5 m remained high for another 15 min. Overall, all submicron aerosol particles showed a slow decrease to normal values. Particles measuring 3C5 m showed non-significant increases at EI. Particles measuring 10 m did not show any increases but a continuous reduction (p < 0.001 versus 0.3 m, p < 0.01 versus 0.5 m, and p < 0.05 versus 1C3 m). Aerosol particles behaved differently according to their dimensions. Submicron aerosols peaked after instrumentation and slowly decreased after the end of instrumentation, whilst larger particles did not show any significant increases.

Adherence depends on public perceptions about pandemic risk. The goal was to explore the roles of education, income, and country on misperceptions, risk perceptions and personal risk perceptions about COVID-19. Data were extracted from 3 preregistered surveys. Binary logistic regressions were conducted to investigate the roles country, education, and income had on outcome variables. Across the USA, Canada, and UK, individuals in the highest income quartile were significantly less likely to hold misperceptions (OR=0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.83) and to perceive personal risk (OR=0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.75) regarding COVID-19 compared with individuals in the lowest income quartile. When comparing these income quartiles in the USA, the difference in perceived risk was heightened (OR=0.21, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.57). Citizens of the UK were more likely to have risk perceptions compared with citizens of the USA (OR=1.50, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.88). Citizens of Canada were less likely to perceive personal risk compared with US citizens (OR=0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.69). Proper risk perception and understanding of COVID-19 are necessary for adherence to public health initiatives. The lowest income quartile was shown to have more misperceptions and personal risk perceptions across all 3 countries, highlighting the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 in this group.

These were screened by both authors for inclusion/exclusion criteria resulting in 127 included articles. Articles included were quantitative studies in OECD countries assessing select mental disorders (depression, anxiety, and trauma-/stress-related disorders) and illness outcomes (self-harm and suicide) during periods of economic recession. Articles were limited to publication from 2008 to 2020, available online in English, and utilizing outcome measures specific to the disorders and outcomes specified above. A significant relationship was found between periods of economic recession and increased depressive symptoms, self-harming behaviour, and suicide during and following periods of recession. Results suggest that existing models for mental health support and strategies for suicide prevention may be less effective than they are in non-recession times. It may be prudent to focus public education and medical treatments on raising awareness and access to supports for populations at higher risk, including those vulnerable to the impacts of job or income loss due to low socioeconomic status preceding the recession or high levels of financial strain, those supporting others financially, approaching retirement, and those in countries with limited social safety nets. Policy makers should be aware of the potential protective nature of unemployment safeguards and labour program investment in mitigating these negative impacts.

METHODS: Healthy unerupted third molars surgically removed for therapeutic reasons (n = 25p/g), were randomly assigned to six groups. Conventional etching (CE) or SE was applied prior to pit and fissure sealants bonding. Enamel conditioned surfaces were evaluated by SEM at  500,  1000, and  2000 magnification to determine etching patterns. Subsequently, 25 PFS blocks (3  2  1.5 mm) p/g were bonded to enamel surface. Samples were stored in water at 37 C for 24 h, previous to SBS and ARI test. One-way ANOVA and Tamhane statistic tests were used for SBS; while MannCWhitney U and KruskalCWallis were employed for ARI (p  0.05). RESULTS: For SBS test, CE_PFS_3M and SE1_PFS_Shofu groups showed the lowest values (8.74  4.02 and 8.75  3.90, respectively). The highest scores were observed in SE_PFS_Kuraray group (13.46  5.83).

Remdesivir is currently being evaluated for clinical efficacy and safety in patients with COVID-19. Objective To describe the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients following treatment with remdesivir at a community hospital. Methods A retrospective review of medical records was conducted in August 2020 for all patients given remdesivir while hospitalized for severe COVID-19 between May 1 and August 19, 2020. A convenience sample of consecutive patients with treatment including remdesivir, antibiotics, convalescent plasma, dexamethasone, or a combination of multiple drugs was included in the analysis. Patients receiving remdesivir were administered a 5-day treatment course. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL/min, those with liver function tests 5 times the normal reference range, and those who were pregnant were excluded from treatment with remdesivir. Differences in between men and women were detected with 2 and independent samples t tests. The degree to which presenting symptoms influenced patient outcomes was analyzed with a stepwise logistic regression. Results Among the 76 patients who received remdesivir, the mean (95% confidence interval, CI) age was 63 years (59.8-66.2). Thirty-six (47.4%) were men and 40 (52.6%) were women. Forty-nine (64.5%) were white and 27 (35.5%) were nonwhite. The majority of patients (54; 71.1%) had at least 1 comorbid condition, with hypertension being the most common (43; 56.6%). The mean (95% CI) length of stay for patients who received remdesivir was 10.09 days (8.6-11.6) and the mean (95% CI) duration of oxygen therapy was 9.42 days (8.0-10.8). A total of 14 (18.4%) patients given remdesivir were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an mean (95% CI) length of stay of 9.29 days (5.6-13.0). Women administered remdesivir were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (11 [27.5%] vs 3 [8.3%]; P=.031). The mortality rate was 14 patients (18.4%), with no statistically significant difference observed between men (5; 13.9%) and women (9; 22.5%; P=.33). No significant difference was seen amongst sexes for duration of oxygen therapy (men, 8.0 days [6.2-9.8] vs women, 10.76 days [8.8-12.8]; P=.051) or length of stay (men, 8.61 days [6.7-10.5] vs women, 11.43 days [9.3-13.5]; P=.058). There was no statistically significant difference in pooled racial groups (white vs nonwhite) for in-hospital mortality, number admitted to the ICU, days spent in the ICU, duration of oxygen use, or length of stay. Conclusion Remdesivir may show clinical efficacy for the treatment of severe COVID-19 in a community setting.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the social media habits of young adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of subjects from Boston Childrens Hospital outpatient IBD and diabetes clinics. Patients above 18 years of age were invited to complete a brief anonymous survey, which asked about the various ways they use several social media platforms. RESULTS: Responses were received from 108 patients (92.5% response rate), evenly split across disease type. We found that 83% of participants spent at least 30 minutes per day on social media, most commonly on Instagram and Facebook. Although the content varied based on the platform, patients with IBD posted or shared content related to their disease significantly less than those with T1D (23% vs 38%, P=.02). Among Instagram users, patients with IBD were less likely to engage with support groups (22% vs 56%, P=.04). Among Twitter users, patients with IBD were less likely to seek disease information (77% vs 29%, P=.005). Among Facebook users, patients with IBD were less likely to post about research and clinical trials (31% vs 65%, P=.04) or for information seeking (49% vs 87%, P=.003). Patients with IBD were also less likely to share their diagnosis with friends or family in person. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with IBD were less willing to share their diagnosis and post about or explore the disease on social media compared to those with T1D.

Publications that showcase best practices often lack system-wide perspectives towards cybersecurity in HEIs. Our paper, therefore, aims to bridge this literature gap and generate institutional cybersecurity strategies for HEI leaders and policy-makers from a system perspective. We first review how the cybersecurity landscape has evolved over the last few decades and its latest trends and projections for the next decade. By analysing these historical developments and new changes, we further illuminate the importance of strengthening HEI cybersecurity capacities. As we explore why HEIs face severe challenges to tackle the ever-escalating cyberattacks, we propose a system-wide approach to safeguard HEI cybersecurity and highlight the necessity to reassess prioritised areas. By taking an extensive literature review and desk research of methods that could respond to the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of the next decade, we synthesise our findings with a set of institutional strategies, with takeaways designed to equip HEIs better to address cybersecurity threats into the future. The strategies include: (1) Strengthening Institutional Governance for Cybersecurity;(2) Revisiting Cybersecurity KPIs;(3) Explicating Cybersecurity Policies, Guidelines and Mechanisms;(4) Training and Cybersecurity Awareness Campaigns to Build Cybersecurity Culture;(5) Responding to AI-based Cyber-threats and Harnessing AI to Enhance Cybersecurity;(6) Introduction of New and More Sophisticated Security Measures;(7) Paying Attention to Mobile Devices Use, Using Encryption as a Daily Practice;and (8) Risk Management.

BACKGROUND The mental health specialty is facing a recruitment crisis in the United Kingdom but there is limited evidence about which factors encourage and discourage people to consider a career in mental health DESIGN: Quantitative, observational, online survey using a multiple ordinal logistic regression model to identify if there were any significant predictors of the extent to which participants would consider a career in mental health. The design and write up of the study were guided by the STROBE checklist. METHOD We gathered the views of 231 participants (female = 188, 81.7%) aged between 16 and 65 (mean = 22.7, SD = 8.9), using an online survey, the majority of whom were studying on, or graduates of, psychology/social studies degrees. Information was gathered about the extent to which a range of factors influenced consideration of a career in mental health. RESULTS The majority (71.2%) of participants reported that they would definitely or probably consider undertaking a career in mental health, and over half (51.4%) would consider a career as a mental health nurse. The ability to help others and receiving appropriate training required for the role were important career choice factors. Being female, having a mental health condition, and greater knowledge of mental health, were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of considering a career in mental health, while having had experience of working with people with mental health difficulties was significantly negatively associated. CONCLUSIONS Students and graduates of psychology and social studies degrees appear to be a large, untapped recruitment pool for mental health services.

There is a need to understand the drivers for this exposure disparity in order to develop effective interventions aimed at improving population health and reducing health inequities. With a focus on London, UK, this paper assembles evidence to examine why indoor exposure to PM(2.5), NO(x) and CO may disproportionately impact low-income groups. In particular, five factors are explored, namely: housing location and ambient outdoor levels of pollution; housing characteristics, including ventilation properties and internal sources of pollution; occupant behaviours; time spent indoors; and underlying health conditions. Evidence is drawn from various sources, including building physics models, modelled outdoor air pollution levels, timeCactivity surveys, housing stock surveys, geographical data, and peer-reviewed research. A systems framework is then proposed to integrate these factors, highlighting how exposure to high levels of indoor air pollution in low-income homes is in large part due to factors beyond the control of occupants, and is therefore an area of systemic inequality. POLICY RELEVANCE: There is increasing public and political awareness of the impact of air pollution on public health. Strong scientific evidence links exposure to air pollution with morbidity and mortality. Deprived communities may be more affected, however, with limited evidence on how deprivation may influence their personal exposure to air pollution, both outdoors and indoors. This paper describes different factors that may lead to low-income households being exposed to higher levels of indoor air pollution than the general population, using available data and models for London (i.e. living in areas of higher outdoor air pollution, in poor-quality housing, undertaking more pollution-generating activities indoors and spending more time indoors). A systems approach is used to show how these factors lead to systemic exposure inequalities, with low-income households having limited opportunities to improve their indoor air quality. This paper can inform actions and public policies to reduce environmental health inequalities, considering both indoor and outdoor air.","output":"Systemic inequalities in indoor air pollution exposure in London, UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chitosan is broadly used as a biological material since of its excellent biological activities.

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is an adaptive immune system found in the majority of archaea and about half of bacteria which stores pieces of infecting viral DNA as spacers in genomic CRISPR arrays to reuse them for specific virus destruction upon a second wave of infection. In detail, small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) are transcribed from CRISPR arrays and incorporated into type-specific CRISPR effector complexes which further degrade foreign nucleic acids complementary to the crRNA. This review gives an overview of CRISPR immunity to newcomers in the field and an update on CRISPR literature in archaea by comparing the functional mechanisms and abundances of the diverse CRISPR types. A bigger fraction is dedicated to the versatile and prevalent CRISPR type III systems, as tremendous progress has been made recently using archaeal models in discerning the controlled molecular mechanisms of their unique tripartite mode of action including RNA interference, DNA interference and the unique cyclic-oligoadenylate signaling that induces promiscuous RNA shredding by CARF-domain ribonucleases. The second half of the review spotlights CRISPR in archaea outlining seminal in vivo and in vitro studies in model organisms of the euryarchaeal and crenarchaeal phyla, including the application of CRISPR-Cas for genome editing and gene silencing. In the last section, a special focus is laid on members of the crenarchaeal hyperthermophilic order Sulfolobales by presenting a thorough comparative analysis about the distribution and abundance of CRISPR-Cas systems, including arrays and spacers as well as CRISPR-accessory proteins in all 53 genomes available to date. Interestingly, we find that CRISPR type III and the DNA-degrading CRISPR type I complexes co-exist in more than two thirds of these genomes. Furthermore, we identified ring nuclease candidates in all but two genomes and found that they generally co-exist with the above-mentioned CARF domain ribonucleases Csx1/Csm6. These observations, together with published literature allowed us to draft a working model of how CRISPR-Cas systems and accessory proteins cross talk to establish native CRISPR anti-virus immunity in a Sulfolobales cell.","output":"Heavily Armed Ancestors: CRISPR Immunity and Applications in Archaea with a Comparative Analysis of CRISPR Types in Sulfolobales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contact tracing can play a key role in controlling human-to-human transmission of a highly contagious disease such as COVID-19. We investigate the benefits and costs of contact tracing in the COVID-19 transmission. We estimate two unknown epidemic model parameters (basic reproductive number [Formula: see text] and confirmed rate [Formula: see text] ) by using confirmed case data. We model contact tracing in a two-layer network model. The two-layer network is composed by the contact network in the first layer and the tracing network in the second layer. In terms of benefits, simulation results show that increasing the fraction of traced contacts decreases the size of the epidemic. For example, tracing [Formula: see text] of the contacts is enough for any reopening scenario to reduce the number of confirmed cases by half. Considering the act of quarantining susceptible households as the contact tracing cost, we have observed an interesting phenomenon. The number of quarantined susceptible people increases with the increase of tracing because each individual confirmed case is mentioning more contacts. However, after reaching a maximum point, the number of quarantined susceptible people starts to decrease with the increase of tracing because the increment of the mentioned contacts is balanced by a reduced number of confirmed cases.

We aimed to establish whether infectious epidemics are associated with any changes in the incidence of suicide or the period prevalence of self-harm, or thoughts of suicide or self-harm, with a secondary objective of establishing the frequency of these outcomes. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and AMED were searched from inception to 9 September 2020. Studies of infectious epidemics reporting outcomes of (a) death by suicide, (b) self-harm or (c) thoughts of suicide or self-harm were identified. A random-effects model meta-analysis for the period prevalence of thoughts of suicide or self-harm was conducted. RESULTS: In total, 1354 studies were screened with 57 meeting eligibility criteria, of which 7 described death by suicide, 9 by self-harm, and 45 thoughts of suicide or self-harm. The observation period ranged from 1910 to 2020 and included epidemics of Spanish Flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome, human monkeypox, Ebola virus disease and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Regarding death by suicide, data with a clear longitudinal comparison group were available for only two epidemics: SARS in Hong Kong, finding an increase in suicides among the elderly, and COVID-19 in Japan, finding no change in suicides among children and adolescents. In terms of self-harm, five studies examined emergency department attendances in epidemic and non-epidemic periods, of which four found no difference and one showed a reduction during the epidemic. In studies of thoughts of suicide or self-harm, one large survey showed a substantial increase in period prevalence compared to non-epidemic periods, but smaller studies showed no difference. As a secondary objective, a meta-analysis of thoughts of suicide and self-harm found that the pooled prevalence was 8.0% overall (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.2-12.0%; 14 820 of 99 238 cases in 24 studies) over a time period of between seven days and six months. The quality assessment found 42 studies were of high quality, nine of moderate quality and six of high quality. CONCLUSIONS: There is little robust evidence on the association of infectious epidemics with suicide, self-harm and thoughts of suicide or self-harm. There was an increase in suicides among the elderly in Hong Kong during SARS and no change in suicides among young people in Japan during COVID-19, but it is unclear how far these findings may be generalised.

Egypt has assigned certain hospitals specifically for the quarantine of COVID-19 patients, where operational medical teams work continuously for 14 days, after which they are released for self-isolation at home for a similar period. Aims: The study aimed to evaluate and compare perceived adverse psychological symptoms (stress, anxiety, depression), and insomnia by health-care professionals working in quarantine and non-quarantine hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt, and to explore associated factors with adverse psychological symptoms and insomnia. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was performed in April 2020, using a snowball sampling method. Sociodemographic information perceived general health, healthy lifestyle, insomnia (using Insomnia Severity Index), adverse psychological symptoms (using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21), worries and concerns about COVID-19, future perspective about COVID-19, and coping strategies were collected. Results: Five hundred and forty health-care professionals participated; 10.2% (n=55) worked in quarantine hospitals.

Methods On weekdays an electronic prescribing list of all patients prescribed piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem and ciprofloxacin was generated, and the consults team performed either a bedside or notes review. Data was collected prospectively on 730 patients on which infection was treated, which specialty managed the patient, microbiology samples sent, duration and indication of treatment documentation, and advice given by consults team. Data was then collected over a further 6 weeks looking at whether the base specialty carried out the advice of the AMS team. Results The main indication for broad spectrum antibiotic use was urinary tract infection (151/720) and hospital acquired pneumonia (104/720). Poor documentation of antimicrobial indication and duration was observed across all specialties (277/720). Just over 50% of appropriate microbiology samples were sent (422/726). For 42% of cases (311/730), colleagues were advised to stop or reduce antibiotic duration. In 30% of cases (220/730), narrowing of antibiotic spectrum was advised. Thirty percent (219/730) were advised on IV to oral switch. There was a modest reduction in antimicrobial consumption in some specialties comparing the year prior to the introduction of the service 2019C20 to 2020C21;17.4% reduction respiratory (7810/9137), 0.2% increase in medicine (272698/267351) and 2.1% surgery (68722/67309).

This study capitalized on the prospective process of legalization of same-sex marriage (SSM) in Taiwan to capture changes in gay and bisexual mens desire and attitudes towards parenthood as a function of the legalization of SSM. Methods: 863 respondents (Mean age = 27.9 years 5.8) completed an online survey shortly before and 1? years after the legalization of SSM. They reported their childbearing desire, marital status, and attitudes towards childbearing and marriage. Results: Contrary to our expectation of an increase in childbearing desire due to enhanced legal recognition of same-sex relationships, our study found that fewer participants in the follow-up survey expressed a childbearing desire (59.0% vs 74.2%), and the perceived importance of childbearing dropped mildly (3.48 to 3.26, Cohens d=0.269). Those who expressed a consistent childbearing desire attached greater importance to SSM and regarded SSM as a source of a sense of security and recognition by friends/family. The perceived importance of SSM was mildly positively related to the perceived importance of childbearing. Conclusion: Although the decrease in childbearing desire and its perceived importance may be attributable to a lack of access to family building options (e.g., surrogacy and adoption) and the COVID-19 pandemic, our findings illustrate that parenthood can be a logical next-step for Taiwanese male same-sex couples and call for the development of affordable family building options for these men.","output":"Does Same-Sex Marriage Legalization Invoke Childbearing Desire in Gay and Bisexual Men in Taiwan: A Panel Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the risk factors for acute myocardial injury in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of a COVID-19 cohort, in which 149 confirmed COVID-19 patients enrolled were divided into the group of myocardial injury (19 cases) and the group of non-myocardial injury (130 cases). Myocardial injury was defined according to Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction released by European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 2018, that cardiac troponin (cTn) was above 99th percentile of the reference level. Clinical information and results of laboratory tests of the eligible patients were collected. Factors associated with myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients were evaluated. RESULTS Compared with the group of non-injury, the patients in the group of injury were older and had a larger proportion of severe or critical cases (P < 0.05), higher respiratory rate and lower percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) without oxygen therapy on admission (P < 0.05). All inflammatory indexes except for tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-) showed significant elevation in the patients of the group of injury (P < 0.05).

A growing body of literature raises the issue of Vitamin C and Vitamin D as a risk-assessment tool, and therapeutic option, in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this pilot study was to measure serum Vitamin C and Vitamin D levels in a cohort of patients with critical COVID-19 illness in our community hospital ICU, correlate with other illness risk factors (age, BMI, HgbA1c, smoking status), generate hypotheses, and suggest further therapeutic intervention studies. METHOD: This pilot study included all 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients hospitalized in May 2020 in the ICU of North Suburban Medical Center, Thornton, Colorado, in whose care the principal investigator (C.A.) was involved. We measured patients' serum Vitamin C and Vitamin D levels, and standard risk factors like age, BMI, HbA1c, and smoking status. Variables in this study were gauged using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients (15 males and 6 females, 17 Hispanic and 4 Caucasian, of median age 61 years, range 20C94), there were 11 survivors. Serum levels of Vitamin C and Vitamin D were low in most of our critically ill COVID-19 ICU patients. Older age and low Vitamin C level appeared co-dependent risk factors for mortality from COVID-19 in our sample. Insulin resistance and obesity were prevalent in our small cohort, but smoking was not. CONCLUSION: Our pilot study found low serum levels of Vitamin C and Vitamin D in most of our critically ill COVID-19 ICU patients. Older age and low Vitamin C level appeared co-dependent risk factors for mortality. Many were also insulin-resistant or diabetic, overweight or obese, known as independent risk factors for low Vitamin C and Vitamin D levels, and for COVID-19. These findings suggest the need to further explore whether caring for COVID-19 patients ought to routinely include measuring and correcting serum Vitamin C and Vitamin D levels, and whether treating critically ill COVID-19 warrants acute parenteral Vitamin C and Vitamin D replacement.","output":"Serum levels of vitamin C and vitamin D in a cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients of a north American community hospital intensive care unit in may 2020.

Since Austria is less progressive in this area than many other countries, this research aimed to elucidate enablers and barriers to it reclassifying medicines and make recommendations for change in the context of similar research conducted elsewhere. METHODS: Qualitative research using a heuristic approach was conducted in Austria in 2018. Informed by their own \\"insider\\" and \\"outsider\\" knowledge, the authors identified themes from personal interviews with 24 participants, including reclassification committee members, government officials and stakeholders, before comparing these themes with earlier research findings. RESULTS: Significant barriers to reclassification included committee conservatism, minimal political support, medical negativity and few company applications. Insufficient transparency about committee decisions, expectations of adverse committee decisions and a limited market discouraged company applications. Austria's 'social partnership' arrangement and consensus decision making aided a conservative approach, but the regulator and an alternative non-committee switch process were enabling. Pharmacy showed mixed interest in reclassification. Suggested improvements include increasing transparency, committee composition changes, encouraging a more evidence-based approach by the committee, more pharmacy undergraduate clinical training, and companies using scientific advisory meetings and submitting high quality applications. CONCLUSION: Removing barriers to reclassification would facilitate non-prescription availability of medicines and encourage self-care, and could reduce pressure on healthcare resources.","output":"Why are self-medication opportunities limited in Austria?

Chief among these are disorders associated with the dopamine system. These include Parkinson's disease, ADHD, schizophrenia, and mood disorders, which show stark differences in prevalence and outcome between men and women. In order to reveal the influence of biological sex as a risk factor in these disorders, there is a critical need to collect fundamental information about basic properties of the dopamine system in males and females. In Long Evans rats, we measured dynamic and static properties related to the mesolimbic dopamine system. Static measures included assessing ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine cell number and volume and expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter. Dynamic measures in behaving animals included assessing (1) VTA neuronal encoding during learning of a cue-action-reward instrumental task and (2) dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in response to electrical stimulation of the VTA, vesicular depletion of dopamine, and amphetamine. We found little or no sex difference in these measures, suggesting sexual congruency in fundamental static and dynamic properties of dopamine neurons. Thus, dopamine related sex-differences are likely mediated by secondary mechanisms that flexibly influence the function of the dopamine cells and circuits. Finally, we noted that most behavioral sex differences had been reported in Sprague-Dawley rats and repeated some of the above measures in that strain. We found some sex differences in those animals highlighting the importance of considering strain differences in experimental design and result interpretation.","output":"Sex and strain differences in dynamic and static properties of the mesolimbic dopamine system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Las carencias sociales de Mxico empeorarn por la pandemia SARS-COV2 A saber, el acceso a la salud, derechos laborales bsicos, y la infructuosa respuesta del gobierno para erradicar la violencia machista contra las mujeres El desinters histrico para fomentar una cultura del apoyo mutuo y el autocuidado ha provocado que gran parte de la ciudadana se haya desconectado de sus derechos sociales y sanitarios As, no se sigue una indicacin -qudate en casa- por desigualdades estructurales Propongo que la libertad efectiva puede conseguirse mediante la aprobacin de la renta bsica universal desde una perspectiva feminista Concluyo que las secuelas de la pandemia, que definirn la vida cotidiana, ameritan la aprobacin de esta medida Igualmente, las mujeres como clase sexual requieren proteccin desde una perspectiva feminista Many of the social deprivations of Mexico will be worsened due to SARS-COV2 pandemic Namely, the insufficient access to public health, lack of labor rights, and the unsuccessful government&#039;s response to eradicate male violence against women The historical unconcern in promoting a culture rooted in mutual aid and self-care has provoked many citizens are disconnected from their social and health rights Thus, people&#039;s inability to carry through one direction -stay home- is unfulfilled, in part, due to structural inequalities I affirm that effective liberty could be obtained by approving a Universal Basic Income from a feminist perspective I conclude that the aftermath of COVID-19, which will define everyday life for a while, require the endorsement of such measure Likewise, women as a class deserve protection from a feminist critical framework Les mancances socials de Mxic empitjoraran per la pandmia SARS-COV-2 A saber, l&#039;accs a la salut, els drets laborals bsics I la infructuosa resposta de govern per eradicar la violncia masclista contra les dones El desinters histric per fomentar una cultura de suport mutu I l&#039;autocura ha provocat que gran part de la ciutadania s&#039;hagi desconnectat dels seus drets socials I sanitaris Aix, no se segueix una indicaci -queda&#039;t a casa- per desigualtats estructurals Proposo que la llibertat efectiva pot aconseguir-se mitjan?ant l&#039;aprovaci de la renda bsica universal des d&#039;una perspectiva feminista Concloc que les seqeles de la pandmia, que definiran la vida quotidiana, mereixen l&#039;aprovaci d&#039;aquesta mesura Igualment, les dones com a classe sexual requereixen protecci des d&#039;una perspectiva feminista","output":"Repensando la renta bsica, el apoyo mutuo y el gnero durante la pandemia de la COVID-19 en Mxico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection was first reported in Wuhan city, central China, which has spread rapidly.

After manic-like attack, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody in CSF was positive, while the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on CSF for the SARS-CoV-2 was negative. The patient received Olanzapine for treatment and his mood problems concurrently improved as indicated by scores of Young Manic Rating Scale (YMRS). LIMITATION: This is a single case report only, and the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF was not performed simultaneously when SARS-CoV-2 was positive in samples of sputum and stool. CONCLUSION: This first case of COVID-19 patient with manic-like symptoms highlights the importance of evaluation of mental health status and may contribute to our understanding of potential risk of CNS impairments by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"First report of manic-like symptoms in a COVID-19 patient with no previous history of a psychiatric disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The field of infectious diseases currently takes a reactive approach and treats infections as they present in patients. Although certain populations are known to be at greater risk of developing infection (eg, immunocompromised), we lack a systems approach to define the true risk of future infection for a patient. Guided by impressive gains in omics technologies, future strategies to infectious diseases should take a precision approach to infection through identification of patients at intermediate and high-risk of infection and deploy targeted preventative measures (ie, prophylaxis). The advances of high-throughput immune profiling by multiomics approaches (ie, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, proteomics) hold the promise to identify patients at increased risk of infection and enable risk-stratifying approaches to be applied in the clinic. Integration of patient-specific data using machine learning improves the effectiveness of prediction, providing the necessary technologies needed to propel the field of infectious diseases medicine into the era of personalized medicine.","output":"Harnessing the Potential of Multiomics Studies for Precision Medicine in Infectious Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Between 2000 and 2017, eight major exporting countries engaged in currency manipulation in order to increase their trade surpluses with the rest of the world.

I argue that the state\\\\level decision to stop depreciating its exchange rate stems from the reduced benefits and increased costs of currency manipulation. As production becomes more global, an increase in tradable inputs decreases the traditional benefits of a depreciated currency, in particular an increase in exports. Utilizing panel data across 63 countries between 2000 and 2018, I demonstrate that global production networks moderate the traditional relationship between export dependence and currency manipulation. I further discuss how this relationship may reverse given the reshoring of production networks in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic.","output":"The end of currency manipulation?

Methods: We developed a mass spectrometric decision tree classification algorithm using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Serum samples were grouped into acute SARS (n = 74; <7 days after onset of fever) and non-SARS [n = 1067; fever and influenza A (n = 203), pneumonia (n = 176); lung cancer (n = 29); and healthy controls (n = 659)] cohorts.

These differences in preparedness and policy may lead to different death tolls from COVID-19 as well as other diseases. Methods: We applied an ensemble of 16 Bayesian probabilistic models to vital statistics data to estimate the impacts of the pandemic on weekly all-cause mortality for 40 industrialised countries from mid-February 2020 through mid-February 2021, before a large segment of the population was vaccinated in these countries. Results: Over the entire year, an estimated 1,410,300 (95% credible interval 1,267,600-1,579,200) more people died in these countries than would have been expected had the pandemic not happened. This is equivalent to 141 (127-158) additional deaths per 100,000 people and a 15% (14-17) increase in deaths in all these countries combined. In Iceland, Australia and New Zealand, mortality was lower than would be expected if the pandemic had not occurred, while South Korea and Norway experienced no detectable change in mortality. In contrast, the USA, Czechia, Slovakia and Poland experienced at least 20% higher mortality. There was substantial heterogeneity across countries in the dynamics of excess mortality. The first wave of the pandemic, from mid-February to the end of May 2020, accounted for over half of excess deaths in Scotland, Spain, England and Wales, Canada, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands and Cyprus. At the other extreme, the period between mid-September 2020 and mid-February 2021 accounted for over 90% of excess deaths in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Hungary, Latvia, Montenegro, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Conclusions: Until the great majority of national and global populations have vaccine-acquired immunity, minimising the death toll of the pandemic from COVID-19 and other diseases will require actions to delay and contain infections and continue routine health care.","output":"Lessons learned and lessons missed: impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on all-cause mortality in 40 industrialised countries prior to mass vaccination (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To model reliably behavioral systems with complex bio-social interactions, accounting for uncertainty quantification, is critical for many application areas. However, in terms of the mathematical formulation of the corresponding problems, one of the major challenges is coming from the fact that corresponding stochastic processes should, in most cases, be considered in bounded domains, possibly with obstacles. This has been known for a long time and yet, very little has been done for the quantification of uncertainties in modelling complex behavioral systems described by such stochastic processes. In this paper, we address this challenge by considering a coupled system of Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equations (SDEs) describing interactions between active and passive participants of a mixed-population group. In developing a multi-fidelity modelling methodology for such behavioral systems, we combine low- and high-fidelity results obtained from (a) the solution of the underlying coupled system of SDEs and (b) simulations with a statistical-mechanics-based lattice gas model, where we employ a kinetic Monte Carlo procedure. Furthermore, we provide representative numerical examples of healthcare systems, subject to an epidemic, where the main focus in our considerations is given to an interacting particle system of asymptomatic and susceptible populations.","output":"Combining Coupled Skorokhod SDEs and Lattice Gas Frameworks for Multi-fidelity Modelling of Complex Behavioral Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sarcopenia or muscle wasting is a progressive and generalized skeletal muscle disorder involving the accelerated loss of muscle mass and function, often associated with muscle weakness (dynapenia) and frailty. Whereas primary sarcopenia is related to ageing, secondary sarcopenia happens independent of age in the context of chronic disease states such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sarcopenia has become a major focus of research and public policy debate due to its impact on patient's health\\\\related quality of life, health\\\\care expenditure, morbidity, and mortality. The development of sarcopenia in patients with CKD is multifactorial and it may occur independently of weight loss or cachexia including under obese sarcopenia. Hormonal imbalances can facilitate the development of sarcopenia in the general population and is a common finding in CKD. Hormones that may influence the development of sarcopenia are testosterone, growth hormone, insulin, thyroid hormones, and vitamin D. Although the relationship between free testosterone level that is low in uraemic patients and sarcopenia in CKD is not well\\\\defined, functional improvement may be seen. Unlike testosterone, it is known that vitamin D is associated with muscle strength, muscle size, and physical performance in patients with CKD. Outcomes after vitamin D replacement therapy are still controversial. The half\\\\life of growth hormone (GH) is prolonged in patients with CKD. Besides, IGF\\\\1 levels are normal in patients with Stage 4 CKDa minimal reduction is seen in the end\\\\stage renal disease. Unresponsiveness or resistance of IGF\\\\1 and changes in the GH/IGF\\\\1 axis are the main causes of sarcopenia in CKD. Low serum T3 level is frequent in CKD, but the net effect on sarcopenia is not well\\\\studied. CKD patients develop insulin resistance (IR) from the earliest period even before GFR decline begins. IR reduces glucose utilization as an energy source by hepatic gluconeogenesis, decreasing muscle glucose uptake, impairing intracellular glucose metabolism. This cascade results in muscle protein breakdown. IR and sarcopenia might also be a new pathway for targeting. Ghrelin, oestrogen, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone may be other players in the setting of sarcopenia. In this review, we mainly examine the effects of hormonal changes on the occurrence of sarcopenia in patients with CKD via the available data.","output":"Effects of hormonal changes on sarcopenia in chronic kidney disease: where are we now and what can we do?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the dynamic changes of the antibody specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in convalescents who have suffered from SARS.

A curve of level of IgG was drawn to describe the change by the specific month in the year. RESULTS Most of the 310 convalescents underwent successive or non-successive testing for 2 - 4 months and 15 were tested for 5 months, 15 for 6 months, and 2 for 7 months. IgG was detected in each sample with the mean of A value of 0.97 +/- 0.37 (0.197 - 1.849). The mean IgG level peaked in July (1.203), about 35 days after discharge, and then gradually declined to 0.857 in December, a decline by 27.3%.

In the study group, 1041 and 459 cases were diagnosed as definite and highly probable cases, respectively. There were 993 PCR-positive cases (66.2%). Among all cases, 1144 (76.3%) were diagnosed with non-severe pneumonia, whereas 212 (14.1%) had severe pneumonia. Death occurred in 67 patients, corresponding to a mortality rate of 4.5% (95% CI:3.5-5.6). The univariate analysis demonstrated that various factors, including male sex, age &#8805;65 years and the presence of dyspnea or confusion, malignity, chronic obstructive lung disease, interstitial lung disease, immunosuppressive conditions, severe pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, and sepsis, were positively associated with mortality. Favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were not associated with survival. Following multivariate analysis, male sex, severe pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, malignancy, sepsis and interstitial lung diseases were found to be independent risk factors for mortality. Among the biomarkers, procalcitonin levels on the 3rd-5th days of admission showed the strongest associations with mortality (OR: 6.18; 1.6-23.93).

Overall, controlling for several potential confounders, counties with higher levels of Trump support do not necessarily experience greater mortality rates due to COVID\\\\19. The predicted weekly death counts per county tended to increase over time with the implementation of several key health policies. However, the difference in COVID\\\\19 outcomes between counties with low and high levels of Trump support grew after several weeks of the policy implementation as counties with higher levels of Trump support suffered relatively higher death rates.

Extensive exploration of microbiota-harboring STPs is required to understand their full carcinogenic potential. Here, we applied 16S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate bacteriome present in moist STPs immensely consumed in India (Khaini, Moist-snuff, Qiwam, and Snus). Further, the functional metagenome was speculated by PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) to assign the abundance of genes related to nitrogen metabolism, bacterial toxins, antibiotic drug resistance and other pro-inflammatory molecules. Highly diverse bacterial communities were observed in all moist STPs. Taxonomic analysis revealed a total of 549 genera belonging to four major phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Overall, the core bacterial genera Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Prevotella, Acetobacter, Lactobacillus, Paracoccus, Flavobacterium, and Bacteroides were significantly abundant in moist STPs. Elevated moisture-holding products like Moist-snuff and Qiwam harbor rich bacterial species diversity and showed similar bacteriome composition. Furthermore, Qiwam products showed the highest level of genes associated with nitrogen metabolism, antibiotic resistance, toxins, and pro-inflammation (predicted by PICRUSt) which can contribute to the synthesis of TSNAs and induction of oral cancer.

RESULTS 26 patients with ruptured aneurysms underwent PED treatment (mean age 51.4  13.2 years;16 women). At presentation, 8 patients (30.8%) had a Hunt-Hess grade of IV or above; 11 required extraventricular drain placement. Aneurysm morphologies were: 8 dissecting, 8 blister-like, 6 fusiform, and 4 saccular. There were 22 anterior circulation and 4 posterior circulation aneurysms. PED deployment was successful in all patients, with adjunctive coiling utilized in 12. Periprocedural complications occurred in 5 (19.2%), including 3 inhospital deaths. 23 patients (88.5%) had postoperative angiography at a mean of 5.9 months: 18 aneurysms (78.3%) were completely occluded, 3 (13.0%) had residual neck filling, and 2 (8.7%) had residual dome filling. All blister-type aneurysms were completely occluded at follow-up. Clinical follow-up was available for an average of 10.1 months (range 2-21 months), with one asymptomatic in-stent stenosis and one asymptomatic thromboembolic stroke noted.

To do so, we pursue two different perspectives: (i) As a generalization of the uniform combinatorial prior, we consider the case that the defective set is uniform over a \\\\emph{subset} of all possible sets of a given size, and study how this impacts the information-theoretic limits on the number of tests for approximate recovery; (ii) As a generalization of the i.i.d.~prior, we introduce a new class of priors based on the Ising model, where the associated graph represents interactions between items. We show that this naturally leads to an Integer Quadratic Program decoder, which can be converted to an Integer Linear Program and/or relaxed to a non-integer variant for improved computational complexity, while maintaining strong empirical recovery performance.","output":"Model-Based and Graph-Based Priors for Group Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to almost 3,000,000 deaths across 139 million people infected worldwide. Involvement of the pulmonary vasculature is considered a major driving force for morbidity and mortality. We set out to summarize current knowledge on the acute manifestations of pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) resulting from COVID-19 and prioritize long-term complications that may result in pulmonary hypertension (PH). RECENT FINDINGS Acute COVID-19 infection can result in widespread involvement of the pulmonary vasculature, myocardial injury, evidence of persistent lung disease, and venous thromboembolism. Post COVID-19 survivors frequently report ongoing symptoms and may be at risk for the spectrum of PH, including group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension, group 2 PH due to left heart disease, group 3 PH due to lung disease and/or hypoxia, and group 4 chronic thromboembolic PH. SUMMARY The impact of COVID-19 on the pulmonary vasculature is central to determining disease severity. Although the long-term PVD manifestations of COVID-19 are currently uncertain, optimizing the care of risk factors for PH and monitoring for the development of PVD will be critical to reducing long-term morbidity and improving the health of survivors.","output":"At a crossroads: coronavirus disease 2019 recovery and the risk of pulmonary vascular disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During public health crises including the COVID-19 pandemic, resource scarcity and contagion risks may require health systems to shift-to some degree-from a usual clinical ethic, focused on the well-being of individual patients, to a public health ethic, focused on population health.

We critically appraise one of the most fundamental differences among policies, namely the use of criteria to categorically exclude certain patients from eligibility for otherwise standard medical services. We examine these categorical exclusion criteria from ethical, legal, disability, and implementation perspectives. Focusing our analysis on the most common type of exclusion criteria, which are disease-specific, we conclude that optimal policies for critical care resource allocation and the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should not use categorical exclusions. We argue that the avoidance of categorical exclusions is often practically feasible, consistent with public health norms, and mitigates discrimination against persons with disabilities.","output":"Eliminating Categorical Exclusion Criteria in Crisis Standards of Care Frameworks."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A high frequency of virus infections has been recently pointed out in the exacerbations of asthma in children. Objectives: To confirm this, using conventional and molecular detection methods, and expanding the study to younger children. Study design: One hundred and thirty-two nasal aspirates from 75 children hospitalized for a severe attack of asthma were studied (32 infants, mean age 9.1 months; and 43 children, mean age 5.6 years). According to the virus, a viral isolation technique, immunofluorescence assays (IFA) or both were used for the detection of rhinovirus, enterovirus, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, adenovirus, coronavirus 229E, influenza and parainfluenza virus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used for the detection of rhinovirus, enterovirus, RS virus, adenovirus, coronavirus 229E and OC43, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Results: Using IFA and viral isolation techniques, viruses were detected in 33.3% of cases, and by PCR techniques, nucleic acid sequences of virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were obtained in 71.9% of cases. The combination of conventional and molecular techniques detects 81.8% of positive samples. Two organisms were identified in the same nasal sample in 20.4% of the cases. The percentage of detections was higher (85.9%) in the younger group than in the other (77%). The most frequently detected agents were rhinovirus (46.9%) and RS virus (21.2%). Using PCR rather than conventional techniques, the detection rates were increased 5.8- and 1.6-fold in rhinovirus and RS virus infections, respectively. The detection levels of the other organisms are as follows: 9.8, 5.1, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.7, and 2.2% for enterovirus, influenza virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respectively. Conclusion: These results confirm the previously reported high frequency of rhinovirus detection in asthmatic exacerbations in children. They also point out the frequency of RS virus detection, and emphasize the fact that PCR assays may be necessary to diagnose respiratory infections in asthma.","output":"Detection of viral, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in exacerbations of asthma in children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper studied the impact of COVID-19 on Chinas capital market and major industry sectors via an improved ICSS algorithm, a time series model with the exogenous variable and a non-parametric conditional probability estimation.

Few treatment options with variable efficacy results are available for its management. We aimed to illustrate the efficacy of Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) treatment in COVID-19 patients with resistant CS. Material and methods This research is a prospective pilot study which included ten COVID-19 positive patients with CS state with no response after two doses of tocilizumab. Each patient received three to five TPE sessions according to his/her response. Respiratory status {oxygen (O-2) requirements and data of mechanical ventilation} and laboratory markers (IL-6, CRP, ferritin, D dimer, LDH) were assessed before and after TPE. We reported mortality at 28 day of illness. Results Six males and four females were enrolled in the study with a mean age of (52.9 years). Seven patients (70%) were on mechanical ventilation (MV). After TPE, oxygenation parameters and most laboratory markers improved significantly in all patients (p < 0.05). Four patients survived and were discharged (40%). One was on MV and three were not. The four patients had better hypoxic index (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) (>100 vs <100), started TPE sooner after tocilizumab failure (2-3 vs 5-6 days), needed fewer TPE sessions (3 vs 4-5, p = 0.03), and less duration in ICU (6.5 vs 12.5 days) compared to those who did not benefit. Conclusions In patients with CS state who did not respond well to tocilizumab and steroids, TPE could be a good option.

More data on HIV-positive men (MLHIV) committing IPV are needed to develop perpetrator-focused IPV and HIV prevention interventions. We investigated the relationship between IPV and HIV transmission risk and IPV-associated factors. METHODS: We used data from the cross-sectional survey EVOLCam which was conducted in Cameroonian outpatient HIV structures in 2014. The study population comprised MLHIV declaring at least one sexual partner in the previous year. Using principal component analysis, we built three variables measuring, respectively, self-reported MLHIV-perpetrated psychological and physical IPV (PPV), severe physical IPV (SPV), and sexual IPV (SV). Ordinal logistic regressions helped investigate: i) the relationship between HIV transmission risk (defined as unstable aviremia and inconsistent condom use) and IPV variables, ii) factors associated with each IPV variable. RESULTS: PPV, SPV and SV were self-reported by 28, 15 and 11% of the 406 study participants, respectively. IPV perpetrators had a significantly higher risk of transmitting HIV than non-IPV perpetrators. Factors independently associated with IPV variables were: i) socio-demographic, economic and dyadic factors, including younger age (PPV and SPV), lower income (PPV), not being the household head (SPV and SV), living with a main partner (SPV), and having a younger main partner (SPV); ii) sexual behaviors, including 2 partners in the previous year (PPV and SPV), lifetime sex with another man (SPV), inconsistent condom use (SV), and >20 partners during lifetime (SV); iii) HIV-related stigma (PPV and SV). CONCLUSION: IPV perpetrators had a higher risk of transmitting HIV and having lifetime and recent risky sexual behaviors. Perpetrating IPV was more frequent in those with socioeconomic vulnerability and self-perceived HIV-related stigma. These findings highlight the need for interventions to prevent IPV by MLHIV and related HIV transmission to their(s) partner(s).","output":"Intimate partner violence by men living with HIV in Cameroon: Prevalence, associated factors and implications for HIV transmission risk (ANRS-12288 EVOLCAM)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies had shown that severe cases of COVID-19 tend to have high viral loads and correlate with functional impairment of cytotoxic lymphocytes, and the features of cytokine storm syndrome are similar to manifestations of severe influenza that have been partially explained by suppressed perforin expression. To test the hypothesis that the spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 may inhibit the perforin expression, we determined the kinetics of immune responses of CD8+ T cells to low dose (LD) or high dose (HD) of S1 stimulation through an in vitro dendritic cell (DC)-T cell model over seven days of incubation. The cytotoxic activity and intracellular perforin expression of CD8+ T cells induced by HD-S1-presenting DCs were aberrantly lower than those induced by LD-S1-presenting DCs from day three of incubation. Discrepantly, the levels of lymphoproliferation and cytokine (interferon- and tumor necrosis factor-) production induced by HD-S1-presenting DCs were significantly higher than those induced by LD-S1-presenting DCs from day four. The dose-related responses between doses of S1 and intracellular perforin expression showed a significant linear correlation with a negative slope. In conclusion, the S1 subunit may suppress the perforin expression in CD8+ T cells to decrease the cytotoxic capacity to kill spike-presenting cells in a dose-dependent manner; the persistence of antigen presentation may result in an overproduction of interferon- and subsequent proinflammatory cytokines. That may help explain the insufficient cytotoxicity against high quantities of viruses or highly replicated strains of SARS-CoV-2 in severe cases of COVID-19.","output":"Dose-Related Aberrant Inhibition of Intracellular Perforin Expression by S1 Subunit of Spike Glycoprotein That Contains Receptor-Binding Domain from SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease. Because the mumps vaccine can cause aseptic meningitis in rare cases, this vaccine is not routine in Japan. This has led to low vaccine coverage and severe disease burden in Japan.

Although a recent study reported that mumps vaccine coverage rates are improving in Japan, current coverage rates are far below the optimal rate to suppress the ongoing epidemic, which has caused an average annual financial loss of 85 billion JPY between 2000 and 2016. Recent reports have demonstrated a much lower incidence of vaccine-induced aseptic meningitis in newly developed vaccines, especially when administered at 1 year of age. Cost-effectiveness studies suggest that routinization of the currently distributed domestic vaccine would be highly cost-effective. In addition, questionnaire surveillance data suggest that the majority of the Japanese population accepts the nominal risk of the vaccine when the proper information is provided. Finally, there are some successful programs in Japan that have attained high vaccine coverage rates with financial support from local governments.

This finding led to a concern for the implications of potential delays in care for the obstetric population. HYPOTHESIS/PROBLEM: This study examines the impact of the pandemic on prehospital care amongst pregnant women. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted comparing obstetric-related EMS activations in Maryland (USA) during the pandemic (March 10-July 20, 2020) to a pre-pandemic period (March 10-July 20, 2019). Comparative analysis was used to analyze the difference in frequency and acuity of calls between the two periods. RESULTS: There were fewer obstetric-related EMS encounters during the pandemic compared to the year prior (daily average during the pandemic 12.5 [SD = 3.8] versus 14.6 [SD = 4.1] pre-pandemic; P <.001), although the percent of total female encounters remained unchanged (1.6% in 2020 versus 1.5% in 2019; P = .091). Key indicators of maternal status were not significantly different between the two periods. African-American women represented a disproportionately high percentage of obstetric-related activations (36.2% in 2019 and 34.8% in 2020). CONCLUSIONS: In this state-wide analysis of EMS calls in Maryland early in the pandemic, no significant differences existed in the utilization of EMS by pregnant women. Prehospital EMS activations amongst pregnant women in Maryland only decreased slightly without an increase in acuity. Of note, over-representation by African-American women compared to population statistics raises concern for broader systemic differences in access to obstetric care.","output":"911 EMS Activations by Pregnant Patients in Maryland (USA) during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic presents a severe threat to human health worldwide.

This was a single-centre, prospective randomized controlled cohort study. Routine care versus QCB (quercetin, vitamin C, bromelain) supplementation was compared between 429 patients with at least one chronic disease and moderate-to-severe respiratory symptoms. Demographic features, signs, laboratory results and drug administration data of patients were recorded. The endpoint was that QCB supplementation was continued throughout the follow-up period from study baseline to discharge, intubation, or death. The most common complaints at the time of hospital admission were fatigue (62.4%), cough (61.1%), anorexia (57%), thirst (53.7%), respiratory distress (51%) and chills (48.3%). The decrease in CRP and ferritin levels was higher in the QCB group (all Ps were < 0.05). In the QCB group, the increase in platelet and lymphocyte counts was higher (all Ps were < 0.05). QCB did not reduce the risk of events during follow-up. Adjustments for statistically significant parameters, including the lung stage, use of favipiravir and presence of comorbidity did not change the results.

Herein, we report a case of a 58-year-old post-transplant woman, considering the concrete timing of PTX for both SHPT and THPT. She initiated hemodialysis with end-stage renal disease at the age of 24, and underwent first kidney transplantation at the age of 28.

Diagnostic images including ultrasound, computed tomography, and 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile scintigraphy indicated THPT as the reason for prolonged post-transplant hypercalcemia. Therefore, PTX was performed 14 months after the second transplantation. Histology showed nodular hyperplasia of all parathyroid glands, indicating autonomous secretion of parathyroid hormone. In general, patients with more severe THPT are recognized with more severe SHPT prior to transplantation during the dialysis period.

METHODS: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by IES-R, PHQ-9, and GAD-7, respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the perceptions of threat of COVID-19, and the satisfactions of the hospital's support measures. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify associated variables of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. FINDINGS: We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1%). 29.8%, 13.5% and 24.1% HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (odds ratio [OR], 1.31; 95% CI, 0.47C0.97; p = 0.032), years of working >10 years (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.47C2.79; p<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.27C1.80; p<0.001), history of mental disorders (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.77C6.05; p<0.001), family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02C1.48; p = 0.03), hospital-based and department-based care (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60C0.97; p = 0.024) and full coverage of all departments for avoiding nosocomial infection (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53C0.89; p = 0.004) were associated with stress. INTERPRETATION: Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the pandemic. In addition, since HWs often have a greater stigma against mental problems than the general public, it is worthwhile to address the needs of the HWs during this pandemic and to provide appropriate psychological supports for those people at high risk of mental problems.","output":"COVID-19 in Wuhan: Sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A small number of individuals infected within a community can lead to the rapid spread of the disease throughout that community, leading to an epidemic outbreak. This is even more true for highly contagious diseases such as COVID-19, known to be caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Mathematical models of epidemics allow estimating several impacts on the population and, therefore, are of great use for the definition of public health policies. Some of these measures include the isolation of the infected (also known as quarantine), and the vaccination of the susceptible. In a possible scenario in which a vaccine is available, but with limited access, it is necessary to quantify the levels of vaccination to be applied, taking into account the continued application of preventive measures. This work concerns the simulation of the spread of the COVID-19 disease in a community by applying the Monte Carlo method to a Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered (SEIR) stochastic epidemic model.

China has experienced the unprecedented epidemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in an era when social media has fundamentally transformed information production and consumption patterns. OBJECTIVE: This study examined public engagement and government responsiveness in the communications about COVID-19 during the early epidemic stage based on an analysis of data from Sina Weibo, a major social media platform in China. METHODS: Weibo data relevant to COVID-19 from December 1, 2019, to January 31, 2020, were retrieved. Engagement data (likes, comments, shares, and followers) of posts from government agency accounts were extracted to evaluate public engagement with government posts online. Content analyses were conducted for a random subset of 644 posts from personal accounts of individuals, and 273 posts from 10 relatively more active government agency accounts and the National Health Commission of China to identify major thematic contents in online discussions. Latent class analysis further explored main content patterns, and chi-square for trend examined how proportions of main content patterns changed by time within the study time frame. RESULTS: The public response to COVID-19 seemed to follow the spread of the disease and government actions but was earlier for Weibo than the government. Online users generally had low engagement with posts relevant to COVID-19 from government agency accounts. The common content patterns identified in personal and government posts included sharing epidemic situations; general knowledge of the new disease; and policies, guidelines, and official actions. However, personal posts were more likely to show empathy to affected people ((2)(1)=13.3, P<.001), attribute blame to other individuals or government ((2)(1)=28.9, P<.001), and express worry about the epidemic ((2)(1)=32.1, P<.001), while government posts were more likely to share instrumental support ((2)(1)=32.5, P<.001) and praise people or organizations ((2)(1)=8.7, P=.003). As the epidemic evolved, sharing situation updates (for trend, (2)(1)=19.7, P<.001) and policies, guidelines, and official actions (for trend, (2)(1)=15.3, P<.001) became less frequent in personal posts but remained stable or increased significantly in government posts. Moreover, as the epidemic evolved, showing empathy and attributing blame (for trend, (2)(1)=25.3, P<.001) became more frequent in personal posts, corresponding to a slight increase in sharing instrumental support, praising, and empathizing in government posts (for trend, (2)(1)=9.0, P=.003). CONCLUSIONS: The government should closely monitor social media data to improve the timing of communications about an epidemic. As the epidemic evolves, merely sharing situation updates and policies may be insufficient to capture public interest in the messages. The government may adopt a more empathic communication style as more people are affected by the disease to address public concerns.","output":"Public Engagement and Government Responsiveness in the Communications About COVID-19 During the Early Epidemic Stage in China: Infodemiology Study on Social Media Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics and control of an epidemic using a partial differential equation (PDE) based Susceptible-Latent-Infected-Recovered (SLIR) model.

Existing studies have shown that the soluble secreted APP (sAPP) fragment obtained from the hydrolysis of APP by -secretase has a synaptic function. Thereinto, a nine-residue fragment (APP9mer) of the extension domain region of sAPP can bind directly and selectively to the N-terminal sushi1 domain (SD1) of the -aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 1a (GABABR1a) protein, which can influence synaptic transmission and plasticity by changing the GABABR1a conformation. APP9mer is a highly flexible, disordered region, and as such it is difficult to experimentally determine the optimal APPmer-SD1 binding complex. In this study we constructed two types of APP9mer-SD1 complexes through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation, aiming to explore the recognition function and mechanism of the specific binding of APP9mer with SD1, from which the most probable APPmer-SD1 model conformation is predicted. All the data from the analyses of RMSD, RMSF, PCA, DCCM and MM/PBSA binding energy as well as comparison with the experimental dissociation constant Kd suggest that 2NC is the most likely conformation to restore the crystal structure of the experimental APP9mer-SD1 complex. Of note, the key recognition residues of APP9mer are D24, D25, D27, W29 and W30, which mainly act on the 9-45 residue domain of SD1 (consisting of two loops and three short -chains at the N-terminus of SD1).

Mounting evidence depict signs and symptoms involving multiple organs, most of which supported by pathological data. A plausible link to these manifestations is vascular and endothelial dysfunction/damage. However, much of the current knowledge relies on opinion and incipient evidence. We aim to objectively appraise current evidence on the association between COVID-19 and vascular disease, specifically endotheliitis and vasculitis. METHODS: Two researchers independently entered the search terms COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND vasculitis, endotheliitis OR endothelium in the following online platforms: MedRxiv and LitCovid (PubMed). The search period was set from November 1, 2019 to August 28, 2020. Manuscripts with unavailable full texts, not in English, mainly on pre-clinical data, presenting only study designs or not directly related to the topics of this review were excluded. Retrospective and prospective studies, especially longitudinal ones, were given priority to the purpose of this review. Since there was paucity of prospective controlled evidence, case reports/series were also considered. RESULTS: A total of 318 manuscripts were initially found. Sixty-seven (21%) were excluded: 59 (18.5%) met exclusion criteria and 8 (2.5%) were duplicates. One hundred and forty-two manuscripts (44,6%) did not provide original data and were also excluded: 35 (11%) were comments, 108 (33.9%) reviews; 1 (0.3%) position paper. One hundred and seven (33.6%) studies were considered for the present scoping review: 81 (25,5%) case reports/series; 18 (5.7%) prospective; 8 (2.5%) retrospective. Viral inclusions in endothelial cells, mononuclear cell infiltrates in the intima of small vessels and markers of endothelial cell apoptosis were demonstrated. Specificities of COVID-19 may lead to diverse vascular manifestations in different levels of the vascular bed. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence indicates that COVID-19 targets vasculature and endothelium. However, high quality data is still lacking and studies with prospective designs and appropriately matched controls are needed.","output":"Coronavirus disease-19: The multi-level, multi-faceted vasculopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objective: Host defence mechanisms to counter virus infection include the activation of the broncho-alveolar haemostasis Fibrin degradation products secondary to extravascular fibrin breakdown could contribute to the marked increase in D-Dimers during COVID-19 We sought to examine the prognostic value on lung injury of D-Dimers in non-critically ill COVID-19 patients without thrombotic events Methods: This study retrospectively analysed hospitalized COVID-19 patients classified according to a D-Dimers threshold following the COVID-19 associated haemostatic abnormalities (CAHA) classification at baseline and at peak (Stage 1: D-Dimers less than three-fold above normal;Stage 2: D-Dimers three- to six-fold above normal;Stage 3: D-Dimers six-fold above normal) The primary endpoint was the occurrence of critical lung injuries on chest computed tomography The secondary outcome was the composite of in-hospital death or transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) Results: Among the 123 patients included, critical lung injuries were evidenced in 8 (11 9%) patients in Stage 1, 6 (20%) in Stage 2 and 15 (57 7%) in Stage 3 (p = 0 001) D-Dimers staging at peak was an independent predictor of critical lung injuries regardless of the inflammatory burden assessed by CRP levels (OR 2 70, 95% CI (1 50&ndash;4 86);p &lt;0 001) and was significantly associated with increased in-hospital death or ICU transfer (14 9 % in Stage 1, 50 0% in Stage 2 and 57 7% in Stage 3 (p &lt;0 001)) D-Dimers staging at peak was an independent predictor of in-hospital death or ICU transfer (OR 2 50, CI 95% (1 27&ndash;4 93);p = 0 008) Conclusions: In the absence of overt thrombotic events, D-Dimers quantification is a relevant marker of critical lung injuries and dismal patient outcome","output":"D-Dimers Level as a Possible Marker of Extravascular Fibrinolysis in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter describes the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in the general population with special consideration to diagnosis in pregnant women.

comfortable expressing themselves in a work environment, without fear of embarrassment or criticism from others. Psychological safety in healthcare is associated with improved patient safety outcomes, enhanced physician engagement and fostering a creative learning environment. Therefore, it is important to establish the key levers which can act as facilitators or barriers to establishing psychological safety. Existing literature on psychological safety in healthcare teams has focused on secondary care, primarily from an individual profession perspective. In light of the increased focus on multidisciplinary work in primary care and the need for team-based studies, given that psychological safety is a team-based construct, this study sought to investigate the facilitators and barriers to psychological safety in primary care multidisciplinary teams. METHODS: A mono-method qualitative research design was chosen for this study. Healthcare professionals from four primary care teams (n = 20) were recruited using snowball sampling. Data collection was through semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was used to generate findings. RESULTS: Three meta themes surfaced: shared beliefs, facilitators and barriers to psychological safety. The shared beliefs offered insights into the teams background functioning, providing important context to the facilitators and barriers of psychological safety specific to each team. Four barriers to psychological safety were identified: hierarchy, perceived lack of knowledge, personality and authoritarian leadership. Eight facilitators surfaced: leader and leader inclusiveness, open culture, vocal personality, support in silos, boundary spanner, chairing meetings, strong interpersonal relationships and small groups. CONCLUSION: This study emphasises that factors influencing psychological safety can be individualistic, team-based or organisational. Although previous literature has largely focused on the role of leaders in promoting psychological safety, safe environments can be created by all team members. Members can facilitate psychological safety in instances where positive leadership behaviours are lacking - for example, strengthening interpersonal relationships, finding support in silos or rotating the chairperson in team meetings. It is anticipated that these findings will encourage practices to reflect on their team dynamics and adopt strategies to ensure every members voice is heard.

METHODS: Two biomedical databases were searched between September 2019 and June 2020 for case reports and series of pregnant women with a diagnosis of COVID-19 based either on a positive swab or high clinical suspicion where no swab had been performed. Additional registry cases known to the authors were included. Steps were taken to minimise duplicate patients. Information on coagulopathy based on abnormal coagulation test results or clinical evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and on arterial or venous thrombosis, were extracted using a standard form. If available, detailed laboratory results and information on maternal outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: One thousand sixty-three women met the inclusion criteria, of which three (0.28, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.6) had arterial and/or venous thrombosis, seven (0.66, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.1) had DIC, and a further three (0.28, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.6) had coagulopathy without meeting the definition of DIC. Five hundred and thirty-seven women (56%) had been reported as having given birth and 426 (40%) as having an ongoing pregnancy. There were 17 (1.6, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.3) maternal deaths in which DIC was reported as a factor in two. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that coagulopathy and thromboembolism are both increased in pregnancies affected by COVID-19.

The scientific literature regarding hyponatremia was reviewed using PubMed, ClinicalKey, and Web of Science databases. Studies published between 2011 and 2020 were screened and eligible studies were selected according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement and specific inclusion criteria. The most common infections that were associated with hyponatremia were viral and bacterial infections, including COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). The etiology varied according to the infection site, setting and patient cohort it concerned. In several studies, hyponatremia was associated with prolonged hospitalization, worse outcomes, and higher mortality rates. Hyponatremia can also play a diagnostic role in differentiating pathogens that cause a certain infection type, as it was observed in community-acquired pneumonia.

Given the heterogeneity of patients from ethnic minorities, established strategies for patient centredness might not work in their case. The concept of coproduction provides a new perspective on how to collaboratively create the highest possible value for both the patient and the healthcare system. The concept acknowledges that all service is coproduced and directs attention to the relationship between patient and care provider. Coproduction is still a new concept in healthcare and its use with vulnerable groups of patients requires further study. This protocol outlines a scoping review to be conducted on the current knowledge on coproduction of service by immigrants and their service providers in the healthcare sector. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will use Joanna Briggs methodology for scoping reviews. The data will stem from the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Ovid EMBASE, EBSCO CINAHL, EBSCO PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. We will also screen the websites of national authorities and research organisations for publications and review the literature lists of the identified articles for relevant references. We will include all types of literature on coproduction of healthcare or social service by immigrants and service providers, including their relationship with one another, communication and collaboration. Two reviewers will independently screen eligible publications and extract data using a checklist developed for this scoping review. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The results of the study will provide an innovative perspective on the coproduction of value in healthcare service by immigrant patients and care providers. We will present the results at national and international conferences, seminars and other events with relevant stakeholders and immigrant patients, and publish them in a peer-reviewed journal.","output":"Coproduction of healthcare service with immigrant patients: protocol of a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-COronaVIrus Diseases 2019 (SARS-COVID-19) pandemic has posed a serious threat to human health (death) and substantial economic losses across the globe. It was however presumed that extreme preventive measures of entire lockdown in India might have reduced the air pollution level and therefore decreased the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) daily AOD product was deployed to investigate the change in AOD level during lockdown phases across the Indian Territory as compared to the long-term mean AOD level (2000-2019) of the same periods. The key findings of the study revealed that AOD level over the Indian Territory is greatly reduced (~45%) during the lockdown periods as compared to the long-term mean AOD level (2000-2019). Furthermore, a noteworthy negative AOD anomaly (~6 to 37%) was observed across the four metropolitan cities in India during the entire lockdown period (25th March to 15th May 2020). However, coal mining regions of the various coalfields in India showed a positive anomaly (~+11 to 40%) during the lockdown periods due to ongoing mining operations. In a nutshell, the study results indicated a huge drop in the AOD level over Indian Territory during lockdown periods. It is expected that the pandemic can influence some policy decisions to propose air pollution control methods. Lockdown events possibly may play a crucial role as a potential solution for air pollution abatement in the future. It may not be uncommon in future when the governments may implement deliberately selective lockdowns at pollution hotspots to control the pollution level.","output":"Effect of lockdown due to SARS COVID-19 on aerosol optical depth (AOD) over urban and mining regions in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: It is a matter of debate whether diabetes alone or its associated comorbidities are responsible for severe COVID-19 outcomes. This study assessed the impact of diabetes on intensive care unit (ICU) admission and in-hospital mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on a countrywide cohort of 40,632 COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 2020 and March 2021. Data were provided by the Austrian data platform. The association of diabetes with outcomes was assessed using unmatched and propensity-score matched (PSM) logistic regression. Results: 12.2% of patients had diabetes, 14.5% were admitted to the ICU, and 16.2% died in the hospital. Unmatched logistic regression analysis showed a significant association of diabetes (odds ratio [OR]: 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15C1.34, p < 0.001) with in-hospital mortality, whereas PSM analysis showed no significant association of diabetes with in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.08, 95%CI: 0.97C1.19, p = 0.146). Diabetes was associated with higher odds of ICU admissions in both unmatched (OR: 1.36, 95%CI: 1.25C1.47, p < 0.001) and PSM analysis (OR: 1.15, 95%CI: 1.04C1.28, p = 0.009).

This study aimed to describe the cognition and social behaviors related to COVID-19 among medical college students in China and to explore the relevant factors that have affected individual social behaviors. The study could enrich practical research on the social behaviors of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods From February to April 2020, online questionnaire survey was conducted meticulously. Based on their majors, the students were divided into a medical student group (249 cases) and a near-peer medical student group (397 cases). Descriptive statistics was used to elaborate the cognition related to the pandemic and the status quo of social behaviors among these students. A multiple linear regression model was established to analyze the relevant factors affecting individual social behaviors from various perspectives during the pandemic. Results Regarding the cognition situation: 76.32% of those surveyed had good pandemic awareness, and the average general cognition score was 30.55  3.17 points. In terms of social behaviors, the average scores for purposive rational actions and affective actions during the outbreak were relatively high, scoring 8.85  1.72 points (>10 points) and 4.32  1.41 points (>6 points), respectively, while the average value rational actions score was relatively low at 5.95  1.90 points (>10 points). The results of the multiple linear regression model showed that urban college students had higher scores for purposive rational actions;college students with the CCP membership had higher value rational actions scores;school and major were also significant factors affecting affective actions scoring. The COVID-19 cognition score had a significant effect on the social behavior score in all dimensions (P < 0.001). Conclusions The cognition of COVID-19 among students in Chinese medical colleges was good, and pandemic cognition was an important factor that affected individual social behaviors. Universities and colleges should strengthen the publicity and education of knowledge related to COVID-19, guide students to internalize their knowledge of the pandemic into positive behaviors, and help to win the battle of pandemic prevention and control.","output":"Cognition and Social Behaviors Related to COVID-19 Among Students in Medical Colleges: A Cross-Sectional Study in Guangdong Province of China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dendritic cells (DCs), as well as complement, play a major role during human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) entry and infection at mucosal sites. Together, DCs and complement are key points for understanding host defence against HIV-1 infection and for studying the impact of new drugs on the regulation of innate host-pathogen interactions and adaptive immunity. For this, we evaluated the antiviral effect of the P80 natural essence (Longan extract) on interactions of non- and complement-opsonized HIV-1 with DCs. In viability assays, we first illustrated the effects of P80 natural essence on DC function. We found that P80 concentrations above 1.5% caused increased cell death, while at concentrations between 0.5% and 1% the compound exerted efficient antiviral effects in DCs and illustrated an adjuvant effect regarding DC activation. DC maturation, as well as co-stimulatory capacity, were significantly improved by P80 natural essence via p38 MAPK phosphorylation in presence of the viral challenge independent of the opsonization pattern. These findings might be exploited for future therapeutic options to target DC subsets directly at mucosal sites by P80 natural essence and to block entry of both, non- and complement-opsonized HIV-1.","output":"P80 Natural Essence Exerts Efficient Anti-HIV-1- as Well as Adjuvant Effects in DCs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the initial identification of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in December of 2019, researchers have raced to understand its pathogenesis and begun devising vaccine and treatment strategies. An accurate understanding of the body's temporal immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is paramount to successful vaccine development and disease progression monitoring. To provide insight into the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, plasma samples from 181 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients collected at various timepoints post-symptom onset (PSO) were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies via lateral flow. Additionally, 21 donors were tracked over time to elucidate patient-specific immune responses. We found sustained levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies past 130 days PSO, with 99% positivity observed at 31-60 days PSO. By 61-90 days PSO, the percentage of IgM-/IgG+ results were nearly equal to that of IgM+/IgG+ results, demonstrating a shift in the immune response with a decrease in IgM antibody levels. Results from this study not only provide evidence that the antibody response to COVID-19 can persist for over 4 months, but also demonstrates the ability of Easy Check&#8482; to monitor seroconversion and antibody response of patients. Easy Check was sufficiently sensitive to detect antibodies in patient samples as early as 1-4 days PSO with 86% positivity observed at 5-7 days PSO.

The emergence of COVID-19 resulted in high volume of patients admitted to our tertiary care center with severe ARDS. Many developed withdrawal symptoms upon tapering of continuous sedation and were unable to be safely extubated despite improved ventilator requirements. A protocol using enteral methadone was developed to facilitate tapering of continuous sedation and mitigate the severity of iatrogenic withdrawal. Methods: Data was collected through retrospective chart review of patients treated with protocolized methadone for IWS during 04/2020-08/2020. Inclusion criteria were FiO2  60%, PEEP  12cmH220,  5 days of continuous fentanyl or hydromorphone (100 mcg/hr or 1.5 mg/hr respectively), and approval by the toxicology and addiction medicine service. Those receiving high dose vasopressors, paralytics, or QTc 500ms were excluded. Descriptive statistics after initiation of methadone are presented in the following case series. Results: There were 32 patients treated with methadone for IWS during the study period. Of these participants, 90% were male (N=29) with median age of 59 (IQR 52-63.5). Opioid infusions were successfully weaned in 75% of patients (N=24) treated with methadone. Median time to wean continuous opioids after starting methadone was 2.5 days (mean 4.08, IQR 1-5). At the end of the study period, 40% (N=13) of patients died from complications of COVID-19. Of the patients who survived, 7 required tracheostomy placement and 16 were successfully extubated. One patient developed prolonged QT with ectopy and was switched to IV Buprenorphine. She was subsequently weaned off continuous sedation after 5 days. Another patient developed prolonged QT but was able to resume after holding for 48 hours. Conclusion: IWS is a barrier to de-escalation of care in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. IWS is associated with longer ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation. Protocolized methadone use can be an effective tool for mitigating IWS as suggested by the findings in this study. This study is limited by the lack of a control group. Future directions include comparison to a matched cohort of patients not treated with methadone. Continued investigation with prospective studies in the context of changing practice guidelines for COVID-19 are also warranted. If methadone is found to be safe and effective in future studies, widespread use could help reduce the strain on ICU resources by COVID-19.","output":"Enteral methadone for iatrogenic opioid withdrawal in patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome: A case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modelling has its place, but outputs should be handled with care","output":"Predicting the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the Ebola outbreak continued to rage in West Africa, Western countries began to be directly affected by the disease.

A few weeks later, tension rose dramatically when two of the nurses who treated the initial US patient developed Ebola. One of the nurses traveled to Ohio and back before becoming sick. She flew by plane and had contact with other travelers. Officials were very worried that Ebola flare-ups would start to occur across the country. On October 6, 2014, a nursing assistant in Spain was diagnosed with Ebola. Like the US nurses, she had helped treat a repatriated Ebola victim. On October 23, 2014, a new US case was identified. A doctor was diagnosed with Ebola in New York City after returning from Guinea. On the same day, an Ebola case was discovered in the West African country of Mali. The Ebola outbreak seemed out of control and poised to start a major international epidemic. In West Africa, however, a corner had been turned. Healthcare efforts had shifted from treating all Ebola patients in medical facilities to providing families with supplies to take care of sick patients at home. Toward the end of October 2014, reports started to surface about there being fewer cases in West Africa, especially in Liberia. These reports were initially treated with caution.

This studys primary objective was to analyze the hospitals potential hazards of COVID-19 prevention and control. The second objective was to review the disaster plan and make recommendations to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals. METHODS: An expert group for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in the First Peoples Hospital of Long-quanyi Dis-trict, Chengdu, China was established. We adopted the hazard vulnerability analysis (HVA) to risk-stratify potential hazards and calculated relative risk values. We used the Delphi expert consultation method to propose and implement targeted improvement measures for the top five potential hazards. Then, the effects before and after the intervention were compared. RESULTS: The top five hazards were: insufficient Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (25.68%), inadequate diagnosis ability of clinicians (22.55%), and inadequate management strategies of patients and caregivers (22.38%), lack of professional ability of pre-checking and triage staff (16.96%), lack of knowledge of COVID-19 of medical staff (15.59%). After taking targeted improvement measures, the average score of the hospital staffs COVID-19 knowledge test increased from 73.26 points to 90.44 points, the average test score of the outsourcing company employees increased from 68.55 to 89.75 points. The differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: HVA can be used to systematically risk-stratify potential threats, measure the probability of those potential hazards, and develop various hospital prevention and control measures for COVID-19 epidemics.","output":"The Application of Hazard Vulnerability Analysis in the Prevention and Control of COVID-19 in Medical Institutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To explore the management strategies for patients with gynecological malignant tumors during the outbreak and transmission of COVID19.

After bibliometric analysis of 999 scientific references, a survey of 16 clinical trials and analysis of 84 patents, it was possible to identify the dominant algae, molecules and viruses that have been shaping and driving this promising field of research. A description of the most promising discoveries is presented according to molecule class. We observed a diverse range of algae and respective molecules displaying significant antiviral effects against an equally diverse range of viruses. Some natural algae molecules, like carrageenan, cyanovirin or griffithsin, are now considered prime reference molecules for their outstanding antiviral capacity.

It is processed into VP0, VP3, and VP1 by the viral proteases, and VP0 is cleaved autocatalytically into VP4 and VP2. We observed that poliovirus VP0 is recognized by an antibody against a cellular autophagy protein, LC3A. The LC3A-like epitope overlapped the VP4/VP2 cleavage site. Individually expressed VP0-EGFP and P1 strongly colocalized with a marker of selective autophagy, p62/SQSTM1. To assess the role of capsid proteins in autophagy development we infected different cells with poliovirus or encapsidated polio replicon coding for only the replication proteins. We analyzed the processing of LC3B and p62/SQSTM1, markers of the initiation and completion of the autophagy pathway and investigated the association of the viral antigens with these autophagy proteins in infected cells. We observed cell-type-specific development of autophagy upon infection and found that only the virion signal strongly colocalized with p62/SQSTM1 early in infection. Collectively, our data suggest that activation of autophagy is not required for replication, and that capsid proteins contain determinants targeting them to p62/SQSTM1-dependent sequestration. Such a strategy may control the level of capsid proteins so that viral RNAs are not removed from the replication/translation pool prematurely.","output":"Interaction of Poliovirus Capsid Proteins with the Cellular Autophagy Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The triglyceride and glucose index (TyG) has been proposed as a marker of insulin resistance.

Regression models were used to investigate the association between TyG with severity and mortality of COVID-19. RESULTS: In this cohort, 39 (25.8%) patients had diabetes, 62 (41.1%) patients were severe cases, while 33 (22.0%) patients died in hospital. The TyG index levels were significantly higher in the severe cases and death group (mild vs. severe 8.7  0.6 vs. 9.2  0.6, P < 0.001; survivor vs. deceased 8.8  0.6 vs. 9.3  0.7, P < 0.001), respectively.

We evaluated the impact of vaccination on COVID-19 outbreak and disease outcomes in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We used an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with COVID-19 characteristics, demographics of Ontario, and age-specific clinical outcomes. We implemented a two-dose vaccination program according to tested schedules in clinical trials for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, prioritizing healthcare workers, individuals with comorbidities, and those aged 65 and older. Daily vaccination rate was parameterized based on vaccine administration data. Using estimates of vaccine efficacy, we projected the impact of vaccination on the overall attack rate, hospitalizations, and deaths. We further investigated the effect of increased daily contacts at different stages during vaccination campaigns on outbreak control. RESULTS: Maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) with an average of 74% reduction in daily contacts, vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was projected to reduce hospitalizations by 27.3% (95% CrI: 22.3% - 32.4%) and 27.0% (95% CrI: 21.9% - 32.6%), respectively, over a one-year time horizon. The largest benefits of vaccination were observed in preventing deaths with reductions of 31.5% (95% CrI: 22.5% - 39.7%) and 31.9% (95% CrI: 22.0% - 41.4%) for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively, compared to no vaccination. We found that an increase of only 10% in daily contacts at the end of lockdown, when vaccination coverage with only one dose was 6%, would trigger a surge in the outbreak. Early relaxation of population-wide measures could lead to a substantial increase in the number of infections, potentially reaching levels observed during the peak of the second wave in Ontario. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination can substantially mitigate ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks. Sustaining population-wide NPIs, to allow for a sufficient increase in population-level immunity through vaccination, is essential to prevent future outbreaks.","output":"Projecting the impact of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of social distance on people during COVID-19 pandemic using twitter sentiment analysis through a comparison between the k-means clustering and Mini-Batch k-means clustering approaches To find the most common frequent words, two datasets have been investigated (WHO and Bahrain ministry of health datasets) to be as data preparation and exploration Another two datasets (English and Arabic datasets) are used in the clustering of k-means In this paper, a comparison between k-means and Mini-Batch k-means is performed to find a pattern The word frequency shows that there are several words related to the pandemic The sentiment analysis result show that in USA, Australia, Nigeria, Canada, and England, most tweets are neutral However, the majority of tweets are positive tweets from both Italy and India In addition, the k-means cluster in the English dataset reveals several cluster trends where COVID-19 pandemic procedures are addressed in cluster 1, and health workers are encouraged in cluster 3 ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Tweets Sentiment Analysis during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic loneliness is associated with a range of mental health difficulties.

The aim of this study was to synthesise, meta-analyse and explore the heterogeneity in RCTs of psychological interventions for loneliness in order to establish their efficacy. Five databases (Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science and CINAHL) were systematically searched in order to identify relevant studies. Included studies were required to be peer-reviewed RCTs examining psychological interventions for loneliness. Two independent coders examined the abstracts of the 3973 studies and 103 full texts, finding 31 studies that met inclusion criteria, 28 of which contained sufficient statistical information to be included in the meta-analysis. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The 31 studies (N = 3959) that were included in the systematic review were conducted with participants from a diverse range of cultures, age groups and populations. The interventions were of mixed quality and were mostly face to face, group-based and delivered weekly. The most common type of intervention was Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). 28 studies (N = 3039) were included in a meta-analysis which found that psychological interventions significantly reduced loneliness compared to control groups, yielding a small to medium effect size (g = 0.43). Subgroup analysis and meta-regressions were conducted in order to explore heterogeneity and found that type of psychological intervention was approaching significance as a moderator of the effectiveness of psychological interventions for loneliness.

However, taking into consideration the automation and specific qualities of the sector, human resources should be given much more attention as they are constantly challenged and face diverse difficulties at work while cooperating in various organic and non-organic teams. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 326 employees of Pyrzowice (Poland), Szymany (Poland), and Ko?ice (Slovakia) airports (however, people employed at the Polish airports were predominant, N = 250). The average age of the participants was 39.3 years, and the sample was predominantly male (N = 278, 85.3%). During the research procedure, the following questionnaires were used: the Feeling of Threat in the Workplace Questionnaire, the Feeling of Stress Questionnaire, the 10-Item Personality Inventory, and the Mini-COPE Stress Inventory. RESULTS The regression analysis indicated that personality variables did not allow for predicting the level of stress. However, the helplessness-oriented style ( = 0.191, p = 0.004), avoidant behaviors ( = 0.244, p < 0.001), and the feeling of threat ( = 0.147, p = 0.009) were significant predictors of the feeling of stress, and their high level corresponded with a higher level of stress. The final model explained 23% of the total variance in the feeling of stress. CONCLUSIONS Based on the results, practical recommendations should concern developing employees' skills related to monitoring stressors and strengthening proactivity in difficult or threatening situations. Such proactive strategies may decrease the tendency to use avoidant and helplessness-oriented behaviors that may cause a higher level of stress perceived by employees.

The software determined more than 100 candidate probe pairs per dataset, from more than 300 16S rRNA sequences, in less than 5 min. Results demonstrated how ORMA improved the performance of the LDR assay on cyanobacteria, correctly identifying 12 out of 14 samples, and allowed the perfect discrimination among the 13 milk pathogenic-related species. ORMA represents a significant improvement from other contexts where enzyme-based techniques have been employed on already known mutations of a single base or on entire subsequences.","output":"ORMA: a tool for identification of species-specific variations in 16S rRNA gene and oligonucleotides design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates how people in Japan perceived the severity of and probability of infection from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and how their willingness to purchase a hypothetical vaccine depends on these perceptions and their risk attitudes. We conducted a large-scale panel survey three times between 13 March to 13 April 2020 in Japan. By analyzing the data, we found that the perception of COVID-19 became more serious. The estimation of the fixed effect model reveals that a person becomes more willing to pay for a vaccine as the person evaluates COVID-19 as a more severe disease, considers a higher probability of infection, and becomes more risk averse. Since the sensitivity of willingness to pay for the vaccine on risk aversion increased during the period, the change in risk attitude contributed to an increase in willingness through the sensitivity channel, while it decreased through the magnitude channel.","output":"The Willingness to Pay for a Hypothetical Vaccine for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Japanese encephalitis is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) that is prevalent in Asia and the Western Pacific. Currently, there is no effective treatment for Japanese encephalitis. Curcumin (Cur) is a compound extracted from the roots of Curcuma longa, and many studies have reported its antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the high cytotoxicity and very low solubility of Cur limit its biomedical applications. In this study, Cur carbon quantum dots (Cur-CQDs) were synthesized by mild pyrolysis-induced polymerization and carbonization, leading to higher water solubility and lower cytotoxicity, as well as superior antiviral activity against JEV infection. We found that Cur-CQDs effectively bound to the E protein of JEV, preventing viral entry into the host cells. In addition, after continued treatment of JEV with Cur-CQDs, a mutant strain of JEV was evolved that did not support binding of Cur-CQDs to the JEV envelope. Using transmission electron microscopy, biolayer interferometry, and molecular docking analysis, we revealed that the S123R and K312R mutations in the E protein play a key role in binding Cur-CQDs. The S123 and K312 residues are located in structural domains II and III of the E protein, respectively, and are responsible for binding to receptors on and fusing with the cell membrane. Taken together, our results suggest that the E protein of flaviviruses represents a potential target for the development of CQD-based inhibitors to prevent or treat viral infections.","output":"Development of antiviral carbon quantum dots that target the Japanese encephalitis virus envelope protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has caused significant disruptions in supply chains.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a retrospective review of 80 patients submitted to RPN from May 2016 to February 2020. The patients were divided into two groups of 40, the first submitted to the surgical procedure with use of three robotic arms and the second with four arms. The group division was performed independently of the complexity of the cases, age or gender of the patients and laterality of the renal lesions. Peri- and postoperative data were analyzed for comparison between the two groups. RESULTS Both techniques had similar oncological outcomes (positive tumor margins), renal function preservation (warm ischemia time) and hemorrhagic complications (estimated blood loss and renal artery pseudoaneurysm), with a small difference in the need for blood transfusion, favoring the technique with three arms. CONCLUSIONS The two robotic partial nephrectomy techniques had similar oncological and postoperative outcomes, with minimal perioperative complications. The three-arm technique is safe and feasible regardless of the complexity and size of the tumor. Additionally, the use of the three-arm technique reduced surgery costs by US$ 413.00 per patient.","output":"Analysis of surgical and histopathological results of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy with use of three or four robotic arms: an early series results."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A prominent theory of bilingual speech production holds that appropriate language selection is achieved via inhibitory control. Such inhibition may operate on the whole-language and/or item-specific level. In this study, we examined these two levels of control in parallel, by introducing a novel element into the traditional cued language switching paradigm: half of the stimuli were univalent (each required naming in the same language every time it appeared), and the other half were bivalent (each required naming in different languages on different trials). Contrasting switch and stay trials provided an index for whole-language inhibition, while contrasting bivalent and univalent stimuli provided an index for item-specific inhibition. We then investigated the involvement of domain-general brain mechanisms in these two levels of language control. Neuroimaging studies report activation of the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), a key region in the executive control brain network, during language switching tasks. However, it is unclear whether or not the pre-SMA plays a causal role in language control, and at which level it exerts control. Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to transiently disrupt the pre-SMA, we observed an essential role of this brain region in general speech execution, while evidence for its specific involvement in each level of inhibition remains inconclusive.","output":"Whole-Language and Item-Specific Inhibition in Bilingual Language Switching: The Role of Domain-General Inhibitory Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Secondary bacterial pneumonia following influenza infection is a significant cause of mortality worldwide.

Factors related to this adaptation in UK primary care have not yet been examined. AIM: To assess the responsiveness and prioritisation of primary care consultation type for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional database study examining consultations between 17 February and 10 May 2020 for patients aged 65 years, drawn from primary care practices within the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) sentinel network, UK. METHOD: The authors reported the proportion of consultation type across five categories: clinical administration, electronic/video, face-to-face, telephone, and home visits. Temporal trends in telephone and face-to-face consultations were analysed by polypharmacy, frailty status, and socioeconomic group using incidence rate ratios (IRR). RESULTS: Across 3 851 304 consultations, the population median age was 75 years (interquartile range [IQR] 70C82); and 46% (n = 82 926) of the cohort (N = 180 420) were male. The rate of telephone and electronic/video consultations more than doubled across the study period (106.0% and 102.8%, respectively). Face-to-face consultations fell by 64.6% and home visits by 62.6%. This predominantly occurred across week 11 (week commencing 9 March 2020), coinciding with national policy change. Polypharmacy and frailty were associated with a relative increase in consultations. The greatest relative increase was among people taking 10 medications compared with those taking none (face-to-face IRR 9.90, 95% CI = 9.55 to 10.26; telephone IRR 17.64, 95% CI = 16.89 to 18.41).

The model handles uncertainties in key parameters, using a stochastic re-sampling technique, allowing us to evaluate infection levels as a function of COVID-19 prevalence and projected pupil and staff headcounts. Assuming average national adult prevalence, for the first scenario (as at 1 June 2020) we found that between 178 and 924 [90% CI] schools would have at least one infected individual, out of 16 769 primary schools in total. For the second return (July), our estimate ranged between 336 (2%) and 1873 (11%) infected schools. For a full return in September 2020, our projected range was 661 (4%) to 3310 (20%) infected schools, assuming the same prevalence as for 5 June. If national prevalence fell to one-quarter of that, the projected September range would decrease to between 381 (2%) and 900 (5%) schools but would increase to between 2131 (13%) and 9743 (58%) schools if prevalence increased to 4 June level. When regional variations in prevalence and school size distribution were included in the model, a slight decrease in the projected number of infected schools was indicated, but uncertainty on estimates increased markedly. The latter model variant indicated that 82% of infected schools would be in areas where prevalence exceeded the national average and the probability of multiple infected persons in a school would be higher in such areas. Post hoc, our model projections for 1 September 2020 were seen to have been realistic and reasonable (in terms of related uncertainties) when data on schools' infections were released by official agencies following the start of the 2020/2021 academic year.","output":"Pupils returning to primary schools in England during 2020: rapid estimations of punctual COVID-19 infection rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental degradation has become an important global issue due to the extraordinary increase in greenhouse gas emissions in recent years. Therefore, identifying the main determinants of environmental degradation is one of the primary agenda items of researchers and policymakers.

Although these studies provide very important information about the causes of CO(2) emissions and environmental degradation, some deficiencies remain in the related literature. The agricultural sector activities, which are an important sector at a global level and have significant potential impacts on CO(2) emissions, have not been adequately studied. In order to fill this gap, the effects of agriculture and renewable energy on CO(2) emissions were examined for lucky-seven countries during the period 1995C2014. The results of panel cointegration reveal the presence of long-run nexus among the variables. While the findings indicate that agriculture increases CO(2) emissions, renewable energy is a very important catalyst in reducing CO(2) emissions in lucky-seven countries.

However, many of these models have focused only on the (order of the) genes of a genome, disregarding other important elements in it. Recently, researchers have shown that considering existing regions between each pair of genes, called intergenic regions, can enhance the distance estimation in realistic data.

After the first wave, several countries, notably in the European Union, are suffering a very rapid increase in the number of cases in the pandemic second wave. Health systems are under stress; hospital beds and ICU beds are increasingly occupied by COVID-19 patients, and hospitals are struggling to keep their normal operations. We review some basic epidemiological data of this new disease, regarding its appearance, reproductive rate, ways of transmission, number of cases, death rate, usefulness of diagnostic tests, basic treatment options, and prevention and control strategies, including vaccines. RECENT FINDINGS: The basic control strategy falls into two well established categories: active attack (control) or organized defense (mitigation). The control strategy relies on classic testing, tracing, and tracking possible cases of COVID-19. Those actions draw from classical epidemiology: to actively find and detect cases, isolate if positive for 10 days and treat when needed. At the same time, the search for close contacts, test them when needed and quarantine and monitor for 10 to 14 days in order to break chains of transmission. The mitigation strategy include basic measures to protect people at increased risk of severe illness, like social distancing, wearing a mask when social distancing is not possible, avoiding crowds, avoiding indoor crowded spaces, increase ventilation indoors and washing or sanitizing hands often. They include also targeted restrictions in peoples mobility, and lock-downs, widely used during the first wave in order to spare the health system, become overwhelmed and increasingly used in Europe once more in the current strong second wave. SUMMARY: Waiting for effective and safe vaccines and treatments, stopping the ongoing COVID-19 transmission is our only defense wall. We do not know yet which strategy or strategies worked best.

The application of increasingly rigorous containment measures allowed to reduce the impact of the CoViD-2019 pandemic on the Italian National Health System but at the same time these restriction measures gave also the opportunity to assess the effect of anthropogenic activities on air pollutants in an unprecedented way. This paper aims to study the impact of the partial and total lockdown (PL and TL, respectively) on air quality in the Metropolitan City of Milan. As results, the severe limitation of people movements following the PL and the subsequent TL determined a significant reduction of pollutants concentration mainly due to vehicular traffic (PM10, PM2.5, BC, benzene, CO, and NOx). The lockdown led to an appreciable drop in SO2 only in the city of Milan while it remained unchanged in the adjacent areas. Despite the significant decrease in NO2 in the TL, the O3 exhibited a significant increase, probably, due to the minor NO concentration. In Milan and SaA the increase was more accentuated, probably, due to the higher average concentrations of benzene in Milan than the adjacent areas that might have promoted the formation of O3 in a more significant way.","output":"Lockdown for CoViD-2019 in Milan: What are the effects on air quality?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, an unprecedented number of employees faced the challenges of telework.

It is believed that under-reporting is a relevant factor in determining the actual mortality rate and, if not considered, can cause significant misinformation. Therefore, this work aims to estimate the under-reporting of cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Brazilian states using data from the InfoGripe. InfoGripe targets notifications of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). The methodology is based on the combination of data analytics (event detection methods) and time series modeling (inertia and novelty concepts) over hospitalized SARI cases. The estimate of real cases of the disease, called novelty, is calculated by comparing the difference in SARI cases in 2020 (after COVID-19) with the total expected cases in recent years (2016C2019). The expected cases are derived from a seasonal exponential moving average. The results show that under-reporting rates vary significantly between states and that there are no general patterns for states in the same region in Brazil. The states of Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso have the highest rates of under-reporting of cases. The rate of under-reporting of deaths is high in the Rio Grande do Sul and the Minas Gerais. This work can be highlighted for the combination of data analytics and time series modeling. Our calculation of under-reporting rates based on SARI is conservative and better characterized by deaths than for cases.","output":"Estimation of COVID-19 Under-Reporting in the Brazilian States Through SARI"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tocilizumab (TCZ) has been used in the management of COVID-19-related cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Concerns exist regarding the risk of infections and drug-related toxicities. We sought to evaluate the incidence of these TCZ complications among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: All adult inpatients with COVID-19 between 1 March and 25 April 2020 that received TCZ were included. We compared the rate of late-onset infections (>48 hours following admission) to a control group matched according to intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation requirement. Post-TCZ toxicities evaluated included: elevated liver function tests (LFTs), GI perforation, diverticulitis, neutropenia, hypertension, allergic reactions, and infusion-related reactions. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were included in each group. Seventeen infections in the TCZ group (23%) and 6 (8%) infections in the control group occurred >48 hours after admission (P = .013). Most infections were bacterial with pneumonia being the most common manifestation. Among patients receiving TCZ, LFT elevations were observed in 51%, neutropenia in 1.4%, and hypertension in 8%. The mortality rate among those that received TCZ was greater than the control (39% versus 23%, P = .03). CONCLUSION: Late onset infections were significantly more common among those receiving TCZ. Combining infections and TCZ-related toxicities, 61% of patients had a possible post-TCZ complication.

For the fulfillment of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, the promotion of preventive care medicine through HAI management is a crucial issue. This study explores the perspectives of Saudi tertiary healthcare workers (HCWs) on HAIs and infection control measures. METHODS: Quantitative data were assessed to determine HCWs' knowledge of HAI and their attitudes towards and practice of infection control measures. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect qualitative data from 40 doctors and nurses. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Further, routine sterile procedures in the wards and intensive care units were video recorded, and the footage was discussed by the infection control team and the personnel involved in the videos. This discussion was videographed and transcribed. Both interview data and reflective discussion of the video were analysed using thematic analysis. The quantitative data were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Kruskal-Wallis test revealed no difference in mean knowledge, attitude, or practice scores between nurses/ doctors or the genders. There was a significant difference in knowledge score and practice scores between the Intensive care unit & the Paediatric ward /infection control department with the maximum scores in knowledge and practice among participants from the intensive care unit. Logistic regression analysis for dependent variables (knowledge and attitude) and independent variables like age, gender, designation, and departments was not significant. The qualitative data yielded four themes: knowledge of HAI and infection control, infection control measures in practice, a shortfall in infection control measures and HAI, and required implementation. Video-reflexive ethnography (VRE) revealed lapses in handwashing practice and proper usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), especially surgical masks. CONCLUSION: Early introduction of training programmes in medical and nursing schools and video demonstrations of appropriate infection control practices during sterile procedures would be highly beneficial to HCWs. A possible reason for the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in this part of Saudi Arabia could be a lapse in PPE usage. Intensive training programs for all the HCWs, strict vigilant protocols, and a willingness to change behaviour and practice, will significantly benefit the spread of outbreaks.","output":"Healthcare workers' perspectives on healthcare-associated infections and infection control practices: a video-reflexive ethnography study in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel class of diaryl substituted azetidin-2-one derivatives were designed, asymmetrically synthesized, and evaluated for antiproliferative activities.

There remains a need for validated risk prediction models to assess short-term mortality risk among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a 7-day and 14-day mortality risk prediction model for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study with a separate multicenter cohort for external validation using two hospitals in New York, NY, and 9 hospitals in Massachusetts, respectively. A total of 664 patients in NY and 265 patients with COVID-19 in Massachusetts, hospitalized from March to April 2020. RESULTS: We developed a risk model consisting of patient age, hypoxia severity, mean arterial pressure and presence of kidney dysfunction at hospital presentation. Multivariable regression model was based on risk factors selected from univariable and Chi-squared automatic interaction detection analyses. Validation was by receiver operating characteristic curve (discrimination) and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit (GOF) test (calibration). In internal cross-validation, prediction of 7-day mortality had an AUC of 0.86 (95%CI 0.74C0.98; GOF p = 0.744); while 14-day had an AUC of 0.83 (95%CI 0.69C0.97; GOF p = 0.588). External validation was achieved using 265 patients from an outside cohort and confirmed 7- and 14-day mortality prediction performance with an AUC of 0.85 (95%CI 0.78C0.92; GOF p = 0.340) and 0.83 (95%CI 0.76C0.89; GOF p = 0.471) respectively, along with excellent calibration. Retrospective data collection, short follow-up time, and development in COVID-19 epicenter may limit model generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-AID risk tool is a well-calibrated model that demonstrates accuracy in the prediction of both 7-day and 14-day mortality risk among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

METHOD: A survey was created to assess variables of information dissemination, risk management, and managerial support. The GAD-7 was employed as measure for anxiety during and pre the pandemic The survey was conducted online via an anonymised questionnaire and disseminated by management through the heads of various disciplines within the mental health work force, using the local email portal in the Cork region. It was made available for research participation for a period of one month(JULY). Following this stage, the reported data were analysed utilizing paired samples t-test, Pearson's correlations, and a hierarchical regression. Demographic variables were controlled for during analysis. RESULT: 102 mental health healthcare workers participated in the survey (81.2% Female, 18.8% Male). The mean GAD-7 total scores for Pre-COVID-19 doubled in the during COVID-19 condition. The largest effect can be seen on the GAD-7 facet of feeling afraid as if something awful might happen with pre-COVID-19 GAD-7 mean scores more than quadrupling during COVID-19 conditions. Managerial support had a moderate negative relationship with GAD-7 scores during the COVID-19 pandemic. Information dissemination total scores also had a moderate positive correlation with managerial support total scores and perceived risk/safety total scores. There was no correlation found between the GAD-7 total scores during COVID-19 pandemic and Information dissemination total scores nor Risk/safety total scores. Childcare was a concern for 64% of staff that it was applicable to; 45% of these staff considered altering work hours; 17% reported issues from management regarding these requests. CONCLUSION: Mental health workers have seen a dramatic increase in anxiety since the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the context of expecting something bad to happen. Managerial support appears to be a protective factor for increased anxiety levels in this population. Childcare has been a predominant concern and altering working hours to accommodate this has been problematic for almost 1 in 5 mental health workers. Staff satisfaction with information dissemination positively affects perceived managerial support and perceived risk management. This study is limited by the utilization of a novel self-created measure for examining variables specific to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the employment of a retrospective measure to obtain baseline anxiety scores of staff members before the pandemic.","output":"Anxiety levels among health care workers within Irish mental health services during COVID-19: a survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As social video games are increasing in popularity, it is important to understand how this can impact an individuals social well-being, particularly during the COVID-19 crisis.

Anonymized records of pediatric (14 years) ED visits included patient characteristics, arrival mode, triage code, clinical presentation, and discharge mode. Year-on-year variation of the main ED visit characteristics, and descriptive trends throughout the study period have been examined. RESULTS: Overall, 425,875 ED presentations were collected, 279,481 in 2019, and 146,394 in 2020 (? 48%), with a peak (? 79%) in MarchCApril (first pandemic wave), and a second peak (below ? 60%) in NovemberCDecember (second pandemic wave). Burn or trauma, and fever were the two most common clinical presentations. Visits for nonurgent conditions underwent the strongest reduction during both pandemic waves, while urgent conditions reduced less sharply.

Antibody tests enable detection of individuals past the initial phase of infection and will help to examine possible vaccine responses. The major targets of human antibody response in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the spike glycoprotein (S) and nucleocapsid protein (N). We have developed a rapid homogenous approach for antibody detection termed LFRET (protein L-based time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer immunoassay). In LFRET, fluorophore-labeled protein L and antigen are brought to close proximity by antigen-specific patient immunoglobulins of any isotype, resulting in TR-FRET signal generation. We set up LFRET assays for antibodies against S and N and evaluated their diagnostic performance using a panel of 77 serum/plasma samples from 44 individuals with COVID-19 and 52 negative controls. Moreover, using a previously described S construct and a novel N construct, we set up enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S and N. We then compared the LFRET assays with these enzyme immunoassays and with a SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization test (MNT). We found the LFRET assays to parallel ELISAs in sensitivity (90-95% vs. 90-100%) and specificity (100% vs. 94-100%). In identifying individuals with or without a detectable neutralizing antibody response, LFRET outperformed ELISA in specificity (91-96% vs. 82-87%), while demonstrating an equal sensitivity (98%).

When accounting for psychosocial resilience factors, few external resources and demographic variables emerged as significant predictors. CONCLUSION: With ongoing stressors and traumas, employing coping strategies that emphasize distraction over trauma processing may be warranted. Clinical and community outreach efforts should target trauma coping self\\\\efficacy to bolster resilience during a pandemic.","output":"Mental health and resilience during the coronavirus pandemic: A machine learning approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Public health systems in Canada have undergone significant policy renewal over the last decade in response to threats to the publics health, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome. There is limited research on how public health policies have been implemented or what has influenced their implementation. This paper explores policy implementation in two exemplar public health programs -chronic disease prevention and sexually-transmitted infection prevention - in Ontario, Canada. It examines public health service providers, managers and senior managements perspectives on the process of implementation of the Ontario Public Health Standards 2008 and factors influencing implementation. METHODS: Public health staff from six health units representing rural, remote, large and small urban settings were included. We conducted 21 focus groups and 18 interviews between 2010 (manager and staff focus groups) and 2011 (senior management interviews) involving 133 participants. Research assistants coded transcripts and researchers reviewed these; the research team discussed and resolved discrepancies. To facilitate a breadth of perspectives, several team members helped interpret the findings. An integrated knowledge translation approach was used, reflected by the inclusion of academics as well as decision-makers on the team and as co-authors. RESULTS: Front line service providers often were unaware of the new policies but managers and senior management incorporated them in operational and program planning. Some participants were involved in policy development or provided feedback prior to their launch. Implementation was influenced by many factors that aligned with Greenhalgh and colleagues empirically-based Diffusion of Innovations in Service Organizations Framework. Factors and related components that were most clearly linked to the OPHS policy implementation were: attributes of the innovation itself; adoption by individuals; diffusion and dissemination;the outer context C interorganizational networks and collaboration; the inner setting C implementation processes and routinization; and, linkage at the design and implementation stage. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors influenced public health policy implementation. Results provide empirical support for components of Greenhalgh et als framework and suggest two additional components C the role of external organizational collaborations and partnerships as well as planning processes in influencing implementation. These are important to consider by government and public health organizations when promoting new or revised public health policies as they evolve over time. A successful policy implementation process in Ontario has helped to move public health towards the new vision.

Methods: We retrospectively collected data of 47 patients diagnosed as severe type of COVID-19 from February 8 to 22, 2020, including demographics, illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, management, and compared differences between men and women. Results: Of the 47 patients, 28 (59.6%) were men. The median age was 62 years, and 30 (63.8%) had comorbidities. The initial symptoms were mainly fever (34 [72.3%]), cough (36 [76.6%]), myalgia (5 [10.6%]) and fatigue (7 [14.9%]). Procalcitonin level was higher in men than in women (0.08 vs. 0.04ng/ml, p=0.002). N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide increased in 16 (57.1%) men and 5 (26.3%) women (p=0.037). Five men (17.9%) had detected positive influenza A antibody, but no women. During 2-week admission, 5 (17.9%) men and 1 (5.3%) woman were reclassified into the critical type due to deterioration. Mortality was 3.6% in men and 0 in women respectively. Four (21.1%) women and one man (3.6%) recovered and discharged from hospital.

The rapid development and deployment of extremely effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have seemingly brought within reach the end of the pandemic. However, the virus has acquired mutations; and emerging variants of concern (VOC) are more infectious and reduce the efficacy of existing vaccines. While promising efforts to combat these variants are underway, the evolutionary pressures leading to these variants are poorly understood. To that end, here we have studied the effects on the structure and function of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain of three amino-acid substitutions found in several variants of concern, including alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), and gamma (P.1). We found that these substitutions alter the RBD structure, stability, and ability to bind to ACE2, in such a way as to possibly have opposing and compensatory effects. These findings provide new insights into how these VOC may have been selected for infectivity while maintaining the structure and stability of the receptor binding domain.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Beta Variant Substitutions Alter Spike Glycoprotein Receptor Binding Domain Structure and Stability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Poor emotion regulation is associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, limited prospective research prevents any directional conclusions. No known studies have assessed emotion regulation with PTSS in American Indians, a high-risk population for poor mental health outcomes. The present prospective study explored whether emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression) predicted later PTSS related to the COVID-19 global pandemic in a solely American Indian sample. METHODS: American Indian participants (N = 210; Mean (SD) age = 54.85(13.08) years, 58.7% female) completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) during Phase 1 (a few weeks before pandemic declaration) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic during Phase 2 (7C8 weeks after pandemic declaration). Bivariate correlations and hierarchical linear regression analyses were utilized. RESULTS: ERQ reappraisal was negatively associated with IES-R total scores, such that higher reappraisal predicted lower PTSS. In contrast, ERQ suppression was positively associated with IES-R total scores, such that higher suppression predicted higher PTSS. CONCLUSIONS: Greater suppression and lower reappraisal predicts PTSS in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an entirely American Indian sample, providing critical information for future interventions in a population at high-risk for mental health disparities.","output":"Emotion Regulation Strategies Predict PTSS During the COVID-19 Pandemic in an American Indian Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Internationally, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in fewer cardiac surgical procedures being performed and an increase in the proportion of non-elective cases. To date there has been no study examining the impact of COVID-19 on the provision of cardiac surgery in Australia. Aim The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the provision of cardiac surgery in a single, large major cardiac centre and dedicated COVID-19 hospital. A retrospective cohort study was undertaken utilising prospectively collected data. Methods Prospectively collected patient and operative data was examined to assess whether there was a reduction in the number of cases performed and whether there was a difference in patient demographics, surgical procedures or case urgency. Data was examined from the period of COVID-restrictions in 2020 and compared with data from the same time period in 2019. Results From 3 March 2020 to 30 June 2020, 136 adults underwent cardiac surgery at our institution, representing an overall reduction in operative caseload of 21%. The largest impact was noticed in May and April and coincided with statewide restrictions on elective surgery. Surgical acuity was unchanged with 58% of operations classified as non-elective procedures performed during the index admission. There was a small non-significant increase in the proportion of isolated coronary artery bypass surgery and aortic valve surgeries performed. Conclusion From March to June 2020 our local hospital response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a reduction in cardiac surgery service delivery.

However, these improvements in vaccination have been heterogeneous, with some countries demonstrating greater levels of change and sustainability. Understanding what these high-performing countries have done differently and how their decision-making processes will support targeted improvements in childhood vaccine delivery. Methods and analysis - We studied three countries - Nepal, Senegal, Zambia - with exemplary improvements in coverage between 2000-2018 as part of the Exemplars in Global Health Program. We apply established implementation science frameworks to understand the how and why underlying improvements in vaccine delivery and coverage. Through mixed methods research we will identify drivers of catalytic change in vaccine coverage and the decision-making process supporting these interventions and activities. Methods include quantitative analysis of available datasets and in-depth interviews and focus groups with key stakeholders in the global, national, and sub-national government and non-governmental organization space, as well as community members and local health delivery system personnel.

Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials demonstrated its high immunogenicity, promoting neutralizing IgG together with specific T-cell response. A third dose of SOBERANA Plus (SARS-CoV-2 RBD-dimer) further increased the specific anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies. Methods: In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial we randomly assigned 44 031 participants, aged 19-80 years to three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 28 days apart either a) two doses of 25 microg SOBERANA 02, or b) two doses of 25 microg SOBERANA 02 followed by a third dose of 50 microg SOBERANA Plus, or c) two doses of placebo. Reported study endpoints are vaccine efficacy (VE) evaluated through laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 cases and safety. During the trial, the SARS CoV-2 isolates in Havana were predominantly (beta 74.0 %) and shift gradually to delta (100%).

Aim: To determine the prevalence and predictors of COVID-19-related depression, anxiety and stress symptoms among pregnant women. Materials and methods: This was a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study conducted among 456 pregnant women attending prenatal care at Abakaliki, Nigeria during COVID-19-related lockdown. They were screened for psychological morbidities using DASS 21 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale). Results: Severe and extremely severe depression were reported in 33 (7.2%) and 29 (6.4%) participants respectively. 15 (3.3%) and 35 (7.7%) women had severe and extremely severe anxiety respectively. 105 (23%) had severe anxiety whereas 76 (16.7%) reported extremely severe stress. Multiparity (2 - 4) and occupations such as trading and farming were predictors of depression whereas grandmultiparity, urban residence and trading were identified as predictors of anxiety and stress. Conclusion: Depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were relatively common among pregnant women during COVID-19-related lockdown in Abakaliki, Nigeria.

Similarly to other regions, in Catalonia, during the beginning of summer 2021, the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) rapidly replaced the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7). Here we analyze how the spread of the Delta variant led to substantial epidemic pressure despite the disposal of vaccines. Methods: We employ an age-stratified epidemiological model that accounts for the vaccination status and incorporates the presence of both the Alpha and Delta variant. We adjust the model in a Bayesian framework to the reported case numbers and the sequencing data. The approach allows to infer the transmission advantage of the Delta variant, as well as the temporal evolution of the age-dependent contact rates. Findings: We show that the combination of an increasing interaction rate among the younger population, a still low vaccination coverage and the spread of the Delta variant resulted in the infection of a substantial part of the younger population. We find only little effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions that were put in place. Our analysis suggests a transmission advantage of the Delta variant between 40\\\\% and 60\\\\% with respect to the Alpha variant. Our inference approach based on this retrospective analysis can be used in the future to forecast the potential impact of new variants of the virus. Interpretation: The easing of restrictions during a vaccine roll out requires close monitoring of the epidemic evolution and the changing contact rates. If the younger, more frequently interacting part of the population did not yet have access to the vaccine, increasing contact rates can lead to a rapid rise in infections in relatively short time. The epidemiological situation is particularly difficult to asses, if the vaccine roll out coincides with the emergence of a new, more transmissible variant.

Many scholars have studied the institutional management of these incidents, but a qualitative study of stakeholders' perspectives on vaccine hesitancy in China is missing. To address this lacuna, we conducted in-depth interviews and collected online data to explore diverse stakeholders' narratives on vaccine hesitance. Our analysis shows the different perspectives of medical experts, journalists, parents, and self-defined vaccination victims on vaccination and vaccination hesitance. Medical experts generally consider vaccines, despite some flaws, as safe, and they consider most vaccine safety incidents to be related to coupling symptoms, not to vaccinations. Some parents agree with medical experts, but most do not trust vaccine safety and do not want to put their children at risk. Media professionals, online medical experts, and doctors who do not need to align with the political goal of maintaining a high vaccination rate are less positive about vaccination and consider vaccine hesitance a failure of expert-lay communication in China. Our analysis exhibits the tensions of medical expert and lay perspectives on vaccine hesitance, and suggests that vaccination experts 'see like a state', which is a finding consistent with other studies that have identified the over-politicization of expert-lay communication in Chinese public discourse.

Globes were evaluated ex vivo with macroscopic, SLO and OCT imaging. Macula and peripheral regions were processed for Epon embedding and immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Fundus analysis shows hemorrhagic spots and increased vitreous debris in several of the COVID-19 eyes compared to the controls. OCT-based measurements indicated an increased trend in retinal thickness in the COVID-19 eyes; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Histology of the retina showed presence of hemorrhages and central cystoid degeneration in several of the donors.

Among the eight extant pangolin species, the Chinese pangolin (CP) is most threatened with extinction. Thus, this species is categorized as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Taiwan is a single Formosa Island where the population of CP has been increasing for the last decade due to continuous conservation initiatives. The presence of sufficient samples of CP that are adapted to distinct environmental conditions could provide valid morphometric results. However, the morphometric relationships, growth type, and condition factors have not yet been enumerated for any pangolin species including Chinese pangolin. The study included 282 rescued and rehabilitated individuals from central and southern Taiwan. Adult male and female pangolins measure between 75.2C103 cm and 66C114.9 cm from the snout to the tip of the tail and weigh between 4C7.6 kg and 3C5.8 kg, respectively. Adults also showed negative allometric growth (b < 3) as their length increased. However, the average relative condition factor (KR) was 1.02  0.16 and showed the majority of rescued adults in normal (59.7%) and good (39%) health conditions. ABSTRACT: Morphometric relationships and condition factors are crucial to quickly understanding the fitness and well-being of animals. Total length (cm) and bodyweight (g) of 282 (male = 167 and female = 115) pangolins were accounted for in this study which was received and rehabilitated in Pingtung Rescued Center, Pingtung and Endemic Species Research Institute, Nantou, Taiwan. The allometric equation; W = aL(b) was used to estimate the length-weight relationships where R(2) = 0.70, a = 0.61, and b = 1.98. The ratio of total body length and tail length was between 1.1 and 2.7. Pangolins exhibited negative allometric growth (b < 3) as their length increased. The average relative condition factor (K(R)) was 1.04, indicating a state of good health for rescued individuals. However, Fulton condition factor (K(F)) and K(R) fluctuated in different months but was significantly heavier during the wet seasons. This study recommended to release healthy animals with K(F) of 0.8 or higher back into the wild in order to increase their survival rate. The study, thus will be helpful to promote standardized guidelines for conducting physical measurements and understanding health status. Additionally, it will support the recovery of this threatened species by husbandry and diet management in ex-situ and in-situ conservation.","output":"Morphometric Relationships, Growth and Condition Factors of Critically Endangered Chinese Pangolin (Manis pentadactyla)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lung plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis, as it is responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

HRV infections usually lead to more severe and longer duration of lower respiratory tract (LRT) symptoms in asthmatics than in otherwise healthy individuals. However, the exact mechanism by which viruses contribute to exacerbation of asthma is unknown. Objectives The main objective of our study was to investigate the relationship of the enhanced severity of LRT symptoms to viral dynamics or cytokine responses in the upper respiratory tract (URT). Study design Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal study in which asthmatics and healthy controls were followed during natural viral respiratory tract infections. Results Our study confirmed that viral respiratory tract infections caused more severe problems of the LRT in asthma patients as compared to healthy controls. However, for all subjects, the severity of LRT symptoms were not related to viral load or prolonged viral shedding in the URT. In addition, we did not detect differences in proinflammatory cytokines in the URT between asthmatics and controls. Conclusion Persistence of the virus, as well as viral load in the URT, may not be associated with the induction and/or persistence of asthmatic symptoms.","output":"Enhanced severity of virus associated lower respiratory tract disease in asthma patients may not be associated with delayed viral clearance and increased viral load in the upper respiratory tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Between November 2018 and May 2019, Canada experienced a nationwide salmonellosis outbreak linked to the presence of Salmonella enterica ser.

Until now there has been limited research focusing on the prevalence of psychological distress and associated factors in COVID-19 patients and their relatives. The objective of our study was to assess psychological distress in COVID-19 patients and their relatives 30 days after hospital discharge. METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study at two Swiss tertiary-care hospitals we included consecutive adult patients hospitalized between March and June 2020 for a proven COVID-19 and their relatives. Psychological distress was defined as symptoms of anxiety and/or depression measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), i.e., a score of &#8805;8 on the depression and/or anxiety subscale. We further evaluated symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), defined as a score of &#8805;1.5 on the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). RESULTS: Among 126 included patients, 24 (19.1%) had psychological distress and 10 (8.7%) had symptoms of PTSD 30 days after hospital discharge. In multivariate logistic regression analyses three factors were independently associated with psychological distress in patients: resilience (OR 0.82; 95%CI 0.71 to 0.94; p = 0.005), high levels of perceived stress (OR 1.21; 95%CI 1.06 to 1.38; p = 0.006) and low frequency of contact with relatives (OR 7.67; 95%CI 1.42 to 41.58; p = 0.018). The model showed good discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92. Among 153 relatives, 35 (22.9%) showed symptoms of psychological distress, and 3 (2%) of PTSD. For relatives, resilience was negatively associated (OR 0.85; 95%CI 0.75 to 0.96; p = 0.007), whereas perceived overall burden caused by COVID-19 was positively associated with psychological distress (OR 1.72; 95%CI 1.31 to 2.25; p<0.001). The overall model also had good discrimination, with an AUC of 0.87.

Methods This study consists of a Scoping Review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. To conduct this review, we mapped scientific evidence on domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. The inclusion criteria were: journal articles on domestic violence set in Latin American countries, particularly Brazil, in the context of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, published between March 2020 and June of 2021. Articles that were not published in journals, studies focusing on child violence or the elderly population, suicide-related approaches, editorials and letters to readers were excluded. The databases used were: National Library of Medicine (PubMed), Embase, COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease, Scopus Preview, Web of Science, LILAC's, Database of the best Evidence-Based Health (Epistemonikos) with the following strategic keywords: \\"domestic violence\\" \\"female'/exp OR female\\" \\"domestic violence AND women\\" \\"SARS-CoV-19\\") AND (\\"domestic violence\\") SARS-CoV-2\\" OR \\"2020-nCoV\\". The databases above were accessed in July 2021. The articles selected from the databases were synthetized following the double-check procedure and the topics that were most relevant to the subject discussed were separated. The articles used were in English, Portuguese, and Spanish. Results We discussed domestic violence against women in the context of social isolation, showing a significant increase and highlighting aggravating factors - financial instability, exacerbation of the female workload, increase in drug and alcohol consumption, lack of access to care services - and statistics that demonstrate the significant increase in countries such as Argentina, Ecuador, Paraguay and Brazil, especially in S?o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Paran, among other states. Despite the meaningful increase in the number of cases and the aggravating factors for domestic violence against women in Latin America and Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic, the reality of underreporting, resulting, among others, from limited legal, social and economic support and the lack of well-prepared intersectoral services may be a limitation in this scenario, since the situation can be even more acute. We presented measures adopted in Brazil and alternatives to confront the critical situation of domestic violence against women, aggravated by social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 18 most relevant articles were read twice by each author, following the Double-Check protocol. The articles used addressed important questions around the established goals: a) characteristics of the current scenarios in Latin America and, specifically, in Brazil, with regard to violence against women; b) factors that intensify this type of violence; c) numbers that demonstrate an increase in cases; and finally e) strategies to combat domestic violence against women.

Currently, the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard diagnostic method for determining COVID-19 infection. Various failures in the detection of the disease by means of laboratory samples have raised certain doubts about the characterisation of the infection and the spread of contacts. In clinical practice, chest radiography (RT) and chest computed tomography (CT) are extremely helpful and have been widely used in the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19. RT is the most common and widely available diagnostic imaging technique, however, its reading by less qualified personnel, in many cases with work overload, causes a high number of errors to be committed. Chest CT can be used for triage, diagnosis, assessment of severity, progression, and response to treatment. Currently, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have shown promise in image classification, showing that they can reduce diagnostic errors by at least matching the diagnostic performance of radiologists. This review shows how AI applied to thoracic radiology speeds up and improves diagnosis, allowing to optimise the workflow of radiologists. It can provide an objective evaluation and achieve a reduction in subjectivity and variability. AI can also help to optimise the resources and increase the efficiency in the management of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Use of Conventional Chest Imaging and Artificial Intelligence in COVID-19 Infection.

Acute and/or long-standing inflammation has been implicated as both a cause and effect of schizophrenia. Heightened immune responses have been documented in large cohorts of individuals with schizophrenia. While not completely known, multiple hypotheses, such as disruption of the bloodCbrain barrier, alterations in the kynurenine/tryptophan pathway, and increased microglial activation, have been presented to correlate inflammation with schizophrenic symptoms. Measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) is a commonly performed and inexpensive test on patients serum to determine levels of systemic inflammation in the body. Multiple studies have reported an elevated CRP level in different stages of schizophrenia, indicating its potential to be used as a viable biomarker in the diagnosis and monitoring of schizophrenia along with assessing treatment response to conventional and non-conventional treatment regimens.

Chronic joint pain related to hypermobility is a common referral to pediatric rheumatology clinics. Our aim is to describe the musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) characteristics of the knee in a population with joint hypermobility and pain in comparison to control participants. METHODS: Participants were recruited into three groups for a case-control study. Case group participants had knee hypermobility and pain symptoms (H + P). Participants in one control group had knee hypermobility without pain symptoms (H-P), and participants in the other control group had no knee hypermobility or pain symptoms (NP). B-mode and Doppler MSUS images were obtained and scored for each knee. Descriptive statistics are used for demographic variables and MSUS findings. Regression analysis is used to evaluate risk of synovial effusion and higher synovial effusion/hypertrophy quantitative score. RESULTS: MSUS assessment was performed on 91 knees of 50 participants. H + P knees were more likely to have positive findings noted on MSUS (94% vs. 70% of H-P and 74% of NP knees, p = 0.043). Patellar tendon hyperemia was more common in H + P knees (52%, vs. 19% among H-P and 23% among NP, p = 0.025). Participants who reported taking scheduled non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) had an increased risk of synovial effusion (RR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.07C2.30, p = 0.026) and a trend towards increased risk of a higher synovial effusion/hypertrophy quantitative score (RR = 1.77, 95% CI = 0.92C3.38, p = 0.086). CONCLUSIONS: While positive MSUS findings were frequent in all participants, patellar tendon hyperemia was more frequent in participants with knee hypermobility and pain symptoms. Additionally, reported use of NSAIDs was associated with an increased risk of synovial effusion and higher synovial effusion/hypertrophy quantitative score.

These questionnaires measured seven attitudes toward COVID-19, personal risk, and public health. HEXACO trait data had already been collected at this time from all participants, and Big Five data had been collected from a subset of 100 participants. The findings suggest that there are weak-to-moderate correlations but no strong correlations between Big Five traits, HEXACO traits, and attitudes. Conscientiousness was associated with greater trust, and openness with less trust in U.S. and European governments preparedness for future epidemics. Openness was also associated with less fear of getting infected after being exposed to a person who had or was exposed to COVID-19.

Today, Americans use social media to communicate with friends, family, and peers, access entertainment and education, engage in various business and commercial activities, and influence the lifestyles of consumers. As the spectrum of purposeful use of social media diversifies, this paper examines geographic patterns of social media adoption, diffusion, and utilization in U.S. counties. Alongside, the paper also examines demographic and socioeconomic determinants of purposeful social media utilization. Overall, the study sheds light on an important aspect of the contemporary digital divide in the United States.To examine purposeful social network and media use, the paper focuses on penetration of popular social media/networking platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and YouTube in U.S. counties. The purpose of use of such platforms C to engage in e-communication, e-commerce, e-entertainment, e-health, and e-education are also examined through the dual lenses of geographic and socioeconomic variations. By borrowing from Adoption-Diffusion Theory (ADT) and Spatially Aware Technology Utilization Model (SATUM), the papers conceptual framework posits associations of 18 independent variables with 17 indicators of social media penetration and purposeful usage. Spatial patterns and disparities of social media penetration and purposeful use are analyzed and provide important clues about the geography of the social media digital divide. For example, social media penetration and purposeful use in counties in the U.S. rural south are found to rival counties in the Rocky Mountain States and in some cases exceed counties in urban metropolitan areas in the West- and East Coasts. The presence of spatial bias in social media penetration and use is also diagnosed using spatial autocorrelation analysis. This in turn influences the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression-based analysis of socioeconomic, infrastructural, and social capital underpinnings. For a sample of 3,076 counties in the lower 48 states, leading determinants of purposeful social media use are found to be age structure, urbanization, race/ethnicity and professional, scientific, technical services and overall service sector occupations are found to influence social network access and purposeful use. These findings have important policy implications to broaden the reach and impacts of social media in the U.S.Overall, as the digital divide literature expands its focus from access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) to their actual use and ultimate impact, this study is unique due to its focus on purposeful use of social media.

Recent data suggest that persistent SARS-CoV-2 spike antigenemia may contribute to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). We quantified SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) antigens in blood of pediatric patients with either acute COVID-19 or MIS-C using ultrasensitive immunoassays (Meso Scale Discovery). METHODS: Plasma was collected from inpatients (<21 years) enrolled across 15 hospitals in 15 US states. Acute COVID-19 patients (n=36) had a range of disease severity and positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR within 24 hours of blood collection. Patients with MIS-C (n=53) met CDC criteria and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (RT-PCR or serology). Controls were patients pre-COVID-19 (n=67) or within 24h of negative RT-PCR (n=43). RESULTS: Specificities of N and S assays were 95-97% and 100%, respectively. In acute COVID-19 patients, N/S plasma assays had 89%/64% sensitivity, respectively; sensitivity in patients with concurrent nasopharyngeal swab cycle threshold (Ct) < 35 were 93%/63%. Antigen concentrations ranged from 1.28-3,844 pg/mL (N) and 1.65-1,071 pg/mL (S) and correlated with disease severity. In MIS-C, antigens were detected in 3/53 (5.7%) samples (3 N-positive: 1.7, 1.9, 121.1 pg/mL; 1 S-positive: 2.3 pg/mL); the patient with highest N had positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR (Ct 22.3) concurrent with blood draw.

Aim of the study is to assess the effect and feasibility of lung transplantation as a treatment for patients with severe irreversible respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Materials and Methods : This retrospective study pertains analysis of 119 patients in critical condition, who were referred to Lung Transplant Ward between July 2020 and June 2021 after developing respiratory failure requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, invasive ventilation or both as well as few patients on high flow oxygen therapy. Inclusion criteria for referral were confirmed lack of viral disease and exhaustion of other therapeutic options. Results : 21,84% of the referred patients were disqualified from such treatment due to existing contraindications. Among suitable patients 75,8% died without transplantation. Among all patients, who were qualified for lung transplantation only 9 patients became double lung transplant recipients. Intraoperative mortality for this procedure was 33%. 4 patients were discharged after the procedure and are currently self-reliant with full respiratory capacity.

METHODS: Using publicly available data, we examined the effect of timing of mandated social distancing on the rate of COVID-19 cases in 119 geographic regions, derived from 41 states within the United States and 78 other countries. The highest number of new COVID-19 cases per day recorded within a geographic unit was the primary outcome. The total number of COVID-19 cases in regions where case numbers had reached the tail end of the outbreak was an exploratory outcome. RESULTS: We found that the highest number of new COVID-19 cases per day per million persons was significantly associated with the total number of COVID-19 cases per million persons on the day before mandated social distancing (? = 0.66, P < 0.0001). These findings suggest that if mandated social distancing is not initiated until the number of existing COVID-19 cases has doubled, the eventual peak would result in 58% more COVID-19 cases per day.

This paper includes an empirical network-level analysis of supplier reachability under Random Failure Experiment (RFE) and Intelligent Attack Experiment (IAE). Specifically, this study investigates the effect of RFA and IAE across multiple tiers and scales. The global supply chain data was mined and analyzed from about 45,000 firms with about 115,000 intertwined relationships spanning across 10 tiers of the backward supply chain of medical equipment. This complex supply chain network was analyzed at four scales, namely: firm, country-industry, industry, and country. A notable contribution of this study is the application of a supply chain tier optimization tool to identify the lowest tier of the supply chain that can provide adequate resolution for the study of the supply chain pattern. We also developed data-driven-tools to identify the thresholds for breakdown and fragmentation of the medical equipment supply chain when faced with random failures or different intelligent attack scenarios. The novel network analysis tools utilized in the study can be applied to the study of supply chain reachability and viability in other industries.","output":"Ten-tier and multi-scale supplychain network analysis of medical equipment: Random failure and intelligent attack analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Brazil, within the SUS, Primary Health Care (PHC) gained relevance from the Family Health Strategy's structuring from the 1990s to the 2000s.

Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are innovative platforms to improve diet and PA and have the potential to mitigate these disparities. However, these are understudied among African Americans. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine whether an mHealth lifestyle intervention is associated with improved diet and PA-related psychosocial factors in African Americans and whether these changes correlate with diet and PA behavioral change. METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis evaluating changes in diet and PA-related self-regulation, social support, perceived barriers, and CVH behaviors (daily fruit and vegetable intake and moderate-intensity PA [MPA] per week) in 45 African American adults (mean age 48.7 years, SD 12.9 years; 33/45, 73% women) enrolled in the FAITH! (Fostering African American Improvement in Total Health) app pilot study. The intervention is a 10-week, behavioral theoryCinformed, community-based mHealth lifestyle intervention delivered through a mobile app platform. Participants engaged with 3 core FAITH! app features: multimedia education modules focused on CVH with self-assessments of CVH knowledge, self-monitoring of daily fruit and vegetable intake and PA, and a sharing board for social networking. Changes in self-reported diet and PA-related self-regulation, social support, perceived barriers, and CVH behaviors were assessed by electronic surveys collected at baseline and 28 weeks postintervention. Changes in diet and PA-related psychosocial factors from pre- to postintervention were assessed using paired 2-tailed t tests. The association of changes in diet and PA-related psychosocial variables with daily fruit and vegetable intake and MPA per week was assessed using Spearman correlation. Associations between baseline and 28-week postintervention changes in diet and PA-related psychosocial measures and CVH behaviors with covariates were assessed by multivariable linear regression. RESULTS: Participants reported improvements in 2 subscales of diet self-regulation (decrease fat and calorie intake, P=.01 and nutrition tracking, P<.001), one subscale of social support for healthy diet (friend discouragement, P=.001), perceived barriers to healthy diet (P<.001), and daily fruit and vegetable intake (P<.001). Improvements in diet self-regulation (increase fruit, vegetable, and grain intake, and nutrition tracking) and social support for healthy diet (friend encouragement) had moderate positive correlations with daily fruit and vegetable intake (r=0.46, r=0.34, and r=0.43, respectively). A moderate negative correlation was observed between perceived barriers to healthy diet and daily fruit and vegetable intake (r=?0.25). Participants reported increases in PA self-regulation (P<.001). Increase in social support subscales for PA (family and friend participation) had a moderate positive correlation with MPA per week (r=0.51 and r=0.61, respectively).

So, rapid detection of all respiratory pathogens can facilitate prompt treatment and prevent the deterioration of respiratory disease. Previously published primers and probes of the TaqMan array card (TAC) for respiratory pathogens are not sensitive to Chinese clinical specimens. This study aimed to develop and improve the TAC assay to detect 28 respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens in a Chinese population. METHODS: To improve the sensitivity, we redesigned the primers and probes, and labeled the probes with minor groove binders. The amplification efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity of the primers and probes were determined using target-gene containing standard plasmids. The detection performance of the TAC was evaluated on 754 clinical specimens and the results were compared with those from conventional methods. RESULTS: The performance of the TAC assay was evaluated using 754 clinical throat swab samples and the results were compared with those from gold-standard methods. The sensitivity and specificity were 95.4 and 96.6%, respectively. The lowest detection limit of the TAC was 10 to 100 copies/L.

We identified 33 determinants of handwashing in these settings and, of these, 21 appeared to be altered by the conflict and displacement. Determinants of handwashing behaviour in the post-conflict period were predominantly explained by disruptions to the physical, psychological, social and economic circumstances of displaced populations.

Methods: Data were collected retrospectively for four quality measures reported quarterly in our lab: Diagnostic error rate, Appropriateness of initial outpatient TTE orders and American College of Cardiology Initial TTE Image Quality Metric (IQM) and Comprehensive Exam Metric (CEM). These measures were compared between two similar quarters in pre-COVID (2019) and COVID era (2020) for non-COVID patients. Additionally, IQM and CEM of 40 TTEs in COVID patients were compared with those of non-COVID patients. Results: The IQM and CEM scored significantly less in COVID patients compared to non-COVID patients (p<0.001 for both). Systemic and pulmonary veins, pulmonary arteries and arch were not adequately evaluated in COVID patients. In non-COVID patients, there were no significant differences in the IQM and diagnostic error rate but improvement in CEM and appropriateness of TTE orders from 2019 to 2020.

This study examines two central questions regarding the adoption of urban agriculture practices at the household level during the COVID-19 pandemic: whether the outbreak of the novel coronavirus elicited participation in urban agriculture (e.g., community growing and home growing) and what are the characteristics of individuals who participate. To answer these questions, we conducted two online surveys in Phoenix, AZ, and Detroit, MI. The first round occurred during 2017 and the second during the lock-down in 2020. Using bivariate probit models, we find that (1) considerably fewer individuals participate in urban agriculture at community gardens compared to at-home gardening; (2) participation overall is lower in 2020 compared to 2017; and (3) respondents in Detroit practice urban agriculture more than respondents in Phoenix. Across both cities, our results suggest that the continuity of individuals' participation in growing food at community gardens and home is fragile. Not all characteristics that determined who participated in community gardens before COVID-19 are determining the likelihood to participate during the pandemic. In addition, growing food at home before COVID-19 was practiced by larger households and employed respondents, yet, during the pandemic, we find that home-growing was more likely when children were in the household and households were smaller and younger (Detroit), and younger and more educated (Phoenix). These findings suggest that many urban households' food-growing practices may not yet be mainstream and that other barriers may exist that inhibit households' participation.","output":"Who practices urban agriculture?

METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search was carried out to find studies published from December 2019 to 22 March 2020 from five databases. The language of literatures included English and Chinese. Mean difference (MD) of lymphocyte count in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of lymphopenia for severe form of COVID-19 was evaluated with this meta-analysis. RESULTS: Overall 13 case-series with a total of 2282 cases were included in the study. The pooled analysis showed that lymphocyte count was significantly lower in severe COVID-19 patients (MD -0.31109/L; 95%CI: -0.42 to -0.19109/L).

This study examined the possible correlations between climate variables and the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Victoria, Australia, from 25 January to 31 October 2020. Appropriate regression models and cross-correlation diagnostics were used to examine the effect of temperature, rainfall, solar exposure, and ultraviolet index (UVI) with the number of daily confirmed cases. Significant positive associations were identified for solar exposure and maximum and average UVI for confirmed cases one and 19 days later. Negative associations for these variables were found for confirmed cases five days later. Minimum temperature had a significant negative correlation one day later and a positive effect 21 days later. No significant correlation was found for maximum temperature and rainfall. The most significant relationships were found for confirmed cases 19 days after changes in the meteorological variables.

Routine data collection means that MindSpot has been able to monitor trends in mental health symptoms and service use prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and these have been reported in two earlier studies. This third study describes user characteristics and volumes in the first 8 months of COVID-19, including a comparison between users from states and territories with significantly different COVID-19 infection rates. METHODS: We examined trends in demographics and symptoms for participants starting an online assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic, from March to October 2020. Participants from the state of Victoria (n = 4203), which experienced a significantly larger rate of COVID-19 infections relative to the rest of Australia, were compared to participants from the rest of Australia (n = 10,500). Results were also compared to a baseline comparison period prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 14,703 people started a mental health assessment with MindSpot between 19th March and 28th October 2020. We observed two peaks in service demand, one in the early weeks of the pandemic, and the second in AugustCSeptember when COVID-19 transmission was high in Victoria. Mean symptom scores on standardised measures of distress (K-10), depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) were lower during this second peak in service demand, but there were significantly higher levels of concern about COVID-19 in participants from Victoria, and a higher proportion of Victorian respondents reported that they had made significant changes in response to the pandemic. Many respondents reported changes to their mental health, such as increased feelings of worry. Most respondents reported implementing strategies to help manage the psychological impact of COVID-19, such as maintaining social connections and limiting exposure to news or social media. CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe increased levels of clinical anxiety or depression on standardised symptom measures. However, there were increases in service demand, and increased levels of concern and difficulties related to COVID-19, particularly in Victoria. Encouragingly, a significant proportion of participants have implemented coping strategies. These results continue to suggest that the mental health impacts of COVID-19 represent a normal response to an abnormal situation rather than an emerging mental health crisis.

We aimed to analyse characteristics of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in Brazil, and to examine the impact of COVID-19 on health-care resources and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of all patients aged 20 years or older with quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital and registered in SIVEP-Gripe, a nationwide surveillance database in Brazil, between Feb 16 and Aug 15, 2020 (epidemiological weeks 8-33). We also examined the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic across three 4-week periods within this timeframe (epidemiological weeks 8-12, 19-22, and 27-30). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. We compared the regional burden of hospital admissions stratified by age, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and respiratory support. We analysed data from the whole country and its five regions: North, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast, and South. FINDINGS: Between Feb 16 and Aug 15, 2020, 254a288 patients with RT-qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to hospital and registered in SIVEP-Gripe. The mean age of patients was 60 (SD 17) years, 119a657 (47%) of 254a288 were aged younger than 60 years, 143a521 (56%) of 254a243 were male, and 14a979 (16%) of 90a829 had no comorbidities. Case numbers increased across the three 4-week periods studied: by epidemiological weeks 19-22, cases were concentrated in the North, Northeast, and Southeast; by weeks 27-30, cases had spread to the Central-West and South regions. 232a036 (91%) of 254a288 patients had a defined hospital outcome when the data were exported; in-hospital mortality was 38% (87a515 of 232a036 patients) overall, 59% (47a002 of 79a687) among patients admitted to the ICU, and 80% (36a046 of 45a205) among those who were mechanically ventilated. The overall burden of ICU admissions per ICU beds was more pronounced in the North, Southeast, and Northeast, than in the Central-West and South. In the Northeast, 1545 (16%) of 9960 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation outside the ICU compared with 431 (8%) of 5388 in the South. In-hospital mortality among patients younger than 60 years was 31% (4204 of 13a468) in the Northeast versus 15% (1694 of 11a196) in the South. INTERPRETATION: We observed a widespread distribution of COVID-19 across all regions in Brazil, resulting in a high overall disease burden. In-hospital mortality was high, even in patients younger than 60 years, and worsened by existing regional disparities within the health system.

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is an active pathogen of wild ungulates and livestock; its infection frequently caused irreversible vesicles on the tongue or other positions, leading to enormous economic loss. Tea tree oil (TTO) has been shown to be a popular remedy for many skin diseases owing to its antibacterial, antipruritic, and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the potential effect of TTO on VSV proliferation and the corresponding inflammatory response in cells remain unclear. In this study, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay was used to evaluate the cell viability of TTO, and cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC50) was calculated. Then, fluorescence observation, reverse transcriptionCquantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot (WB), and flow cytometry (FCM) assay were used to evaluate the antiviral effect of TTO against VSV under three manners of pre-infection before medication, co-administration, pretreatment before infection at safe doses to Vero cells. Meanwhile, the mRNA expressions of interleukin 8, tumor necrosis factor , and ISG56 in cells were also detected. The results showed that the maximum safe concentration of TTO to Vero cells was 0.063% and the CC50 is 0.32%. Most notably, TTO dose-dependently inhibited the VSV GFP fluorescence generation and restrained the replication of VSV in gene and protein levels regardless of the treatment modes. Based on the results of the FCM, effective concentration 50 of TTO against VSV is 0.019%. Similarly, the mRNA expression of the above cytokines induced by viral infection was also remarkably curbed. These findings suggest that TTO emerged blocking, prophylaxis, and treatment action against VSV replication and suppressed the related inflammation in Vero cells.

A locally developed COVID inflammation score (CIS) defined patients at risk for severe disease. Patients with life-threatening inflammation were offered off-label treatment with the immune modulator ruxolitinib. RESULTS: Between 4 March 2020 and 26 June 2020 COVID-19 patients (n = 196) were treated. Median patient age (70 years) and comorbidity were high in interstudy comparison. Mortality in all patients was 17.3%. However, advance care planning statements and physician directives limited treatment intensity in 50% of the deceased patients. CIS monitoring of ruxolitinib-treated high-risk patients (n = 20) on days 5, 7, and15 resulted in suppression of inflammation by 42% (15C70), 54% (15C77) and 60% (15C80).

Such physical performance is largely influenced by the strength of the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles. Flexibility of the hamstrings is important because quadriceps muscle activity influences the hip flexion angle. Therefore, hamstring flexibility is essential to improve physical performance. In this study, Myofascial Release (MFR) was applied to the hamstrings to evaluate its effects. MFR on the hamstrings was performed on 17 young adults. Physical function and physical performance were measured before, immediately after, and 5 days after the MFR intervention: finger floor distance (FFD), range of motion (ROM) of the straight leg raising test (SLR), standing long jump (SLJ), squat jump (SJ), functional reach test (FRT), comfortable walking speeds (C-walking speed), and maximum walking speeds (M-walking speed).

Patients with a PCIA consumed significantly more opioids (pa?=a?0.001) without significant more side-effects. CONCLUSION: The PCIA did not provide a superior pain control compared to oral analgesics. In view of the considerable effort and the high opioid consumption, it cannot be recommended as a standardized application for pain control after TE.","output":"Analgesia after tonsillectomy with controlled intravenous morphine - overdue or exaggerated?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging new viral pathogen that causes severe respiratory disease. SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. As there are no confirmed antiviral drugs or vaccines currently available for the treatment of COVID-19, discovering potent inhibitors or vaccines are urgently required for the benefit of humanity. The glycosylated Spike protein (S-protein) directly interacts with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S-protein. As the S-protein is exposed to the surface and is essential for entry into the host, the S-protein can be considered as a first-line therapeutic target for antiviral therapy and vaccine development. In silico screening, docking, and molecular dynamics simulation studies were performed to identify repurposing drugs using DrugBank and PubChem library against the RBD of S-protein. The study identified a laxative drug, Bisoxatin (DB09219), which is used for the treatment of constipation and preparation of the colon for surgical procedures. It binds nicely at the S-protein-ACE2 interface by making substantial - interactions with Tyr505 in the 'Site 1' hook region of RBD and hydrophilic interactions with Glu406, Ser494, and Thr500. Bisoxatin consistently binds to the protein throughout the 100 ns simulation. Taken together, we propose that the discovered molecule, Bisoxatin may be a promising repurposable drug molecule to develop new chemical libraries for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host.","output":"Identification of a repurposed drug as an inhibitor of Spike protein of human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by computational methods."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is a medical pandemic originated in China due to the virus, eventually affecting all parts of the world.

Alterations in the gut microbiome, leading to reduced butyrate production, have been reported in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. A new butyrate releaser, useful for all the known applications of butyrate, presenting physiochemical characteristics suitable for easy oral administration, (N-(1-carbamoyl-2-phenyl-ethyl) butyramide (FBA), has been recently developed. We investigated the protective action of FBA against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human small intestine and enterocytes. Relevant aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed: infectivity, host functional receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), neuropilin-1 (NRP1), pro-inflammatory cytokines expression, genes involved in the antiviral response and the activation of Nf-kB nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2-like) 2 (Nfr2) pathways. We found that FBA positively modulates the crucial aspects of the infection in small intestinal biopsies and human enterocytes, reducing the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and NRP1, pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-15, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and TNF-, and regulating several genes involved in antiviral pathways. FBA was also able to reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, and ACE2, TMPRSS2 and NRP1 expression. Lastly, through the inhibition of Nf-kB and the up-regulation of Nfr2, it was also able to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-15, MCP-1 and TNF- in human enterocytes. The new butyrate releaser, FBA, exerts a preventive action against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Several cognitive and behavioural responses may contribute to the neurobiological adaptations that maintain persistent vestibular symptoms. This paper will present the protocol of a two-arm parallel group feasibility randomised controlled trial designed to determine whether a fully powered efficacy trial is achievable by examining the feasibility of recruitment, acceptability and potential benefits of an integrated cognitive behavioural therapy and vestibular rehabilitation (CBT-VR) treatment for people with persistent dizziness. METHODS: Forty adult patients will be recruited from a tertiary vestibular clinic with persistent movementCtriggered dizziness for 3 months or longer who have moderateChigh levels of dizziness handicap. Participants will be 1:1 randomised, using a minimisation procedure, to six sessions of either CBT-VR (intervention arm) or VR only (control arm). Measures will be collected at baseline and 4 months post randomisation. The primary feasibility outcomes include descriptive data on numbers meeting eligibility criteria, rates of recruitment, numbers retained post randomisation, treatment adherence and an acceptability questionnaire. Treatment effects on self-report outcomes will be estimated to determine that 95% confidence intervals for the effects are consistent with anticipated effects and minimum clinically important differences, and to provide information needed for the power calculation of an efficacy trial. A nested qualitative study will be conducted post-intervention (intervention group only) to explore the acceptability of the intervention and identify any areas in need of improvement. DISCUSSION: If a trial of CBT-VR is feasible, acceptability data will be used to enhance the intervention if needed and refine the multicentre RCT protocol.

As an initial step toward development of ketone therapies, we investigated the effect of chronic oral ketone ester (KE) supplementation as a prevention or treatment strategy in rodent heart failure models. METHODS: Two independent rodent heart failure models were used for the studies: transverse aortic constriction/myocardial infarction (MI) in mice and post-MI remodeling in rats. Seventy-five mice underwent a prevention treatment strategy with a KE comprised of hexanoyl-hexyl-3-hydroxybutyrate KE (KE-1) diet, and 77 rats were treated in either a prevention or treatment regimen using a commercially available -hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3-butanediol monoester (DeltaG; KE-2) diet. RESULTS: The KE-1 diet in mice elevated -hydroxybutyrate levels during nocturnal feeding, whereas the KE-2 diet in rats induced ketonemia throughout a 24-hour period. The KE-1 diet preventive strategy attenuated development of left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling post-transverse aortic constriction/MI (left ventricular ejection fractionSD, 368 in vehicle versus 4511 in KE-1; P=0.016). The KE-2 diet therapeutic approach also attenuated left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling post-MI (left ventricular ejection fraction, 4111 in MI-vehicle versus 617 in MI-KE-2; P<0.001). In addition, ventricular weight, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, and the expression of ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) were significantly attenuated in the KE-2Ctreated MI group. However, treatment with KE-2 did not influence cardiac fibrosis post-MI. The myocardial expression of the ketone transporter and 2 ketolytic enzymes was significantly increased in rats fed KE-2 diet along with normalization of myocardial ATP levels to sham values. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic oral supplementation with KE was effective in both prevention and treatment of heart failure in 2 preclinical animal models. In addition, our results indicate that treatment with KE reprogrammed the expression of genes involved in ketone body utilization and normalized myocardial ATP production following MI, consistent with provision of an auxiliary fuel.

Here we report on a medical student telephone initiative set-up by a final year GP trainee (the equivalent of a family medicine resident), which aimed to support patients at high risk and vulnerable to the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 [Covid-19]. In addition, it was hoped the project would mitigate a digital divide, enable proactive anticipatory planning, and provide an active learning environment to compensate for the pandemics impact on medical education. METHODS: Thirty-three medical students conducted daily telephone conversations with high risk and vulnerable patients as specified by the initial NHSE published lists. They confirmed public health messages, offered details for voluntary support groups, established need for medication delivery, explored levels of digital connectivity, and prompted discussions around end-of-life choices. Students had access to online reflective resources and daily remote debriefing sessions with the GP trainee. A convergent mixed-methods evaluation was subsequently undertaken, using quantitative process and descriptive data and individual qualitative interviews were conducted according to a maximal variation sampling strategy with students, General Practitioners [GPs], and the GP trainee. Inductive thematic analysis was then applied with cross-validation, respondent validation, and rich evidential illustration aiding integrity. RESULTS: Ninety-seven high risk and 781 vulnerable calls were made. Individuals were generally aware of public heath information, but some struggled to interpret and apply it within their own lives. Therefore respondents felt students provided additional practical and psychological benefits, particularly with regard to strengthening the links with the community voluntary groups. The project was widely liked by students who reported high levels of skill development and widened awareness, particularly valuing the active learning environment and reflective feedback sessions. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates utilization of medical students as wider assets within the primary health care team, with an initiative that enables support for vulnerable patients whilst promoting active medical education. Ongoing integration of students within normal primary health care roles, such as chronic disease or mental health reviews, could provide similar opportunities for supported active and reflective learning.

Given prior quality concerns about antibiotic management for children during telemedicine visits outside of primary care, we sought to examine acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) visit volume and antibiotic management for children via telemedicine integrated within pediatric primary care. METHODS Using electronic health record data from 47 practices within a large pediatric primary care network, we identified visits for ARTI from April-September 2020. For these visits, we categorized antibiotic management consistent with clinical guidelines as guideline concordant. We compared telemedicine and in-person visit guideline-concordant antibiotic management, diagnoses, and antibiotic prescribing using chi-square tests and examined trends over time using descriptive statistics. Antibiotic stewardship during the study period included learning collaborative videoconferences and sharing of clinic and clinician-level metrics through an interactive dashboard. RESULTS During the 6-month period, 8,332 ARTI visits were identified, with 3,003 (36%) via telemedicine. Guideline-concordant antibiotic management occurred in 92.5% of telemedicine visits compared to 90.7% of in-person office visits (p=0.004). Telemedicine ARTI visits receiving diagnoses of acute otitis media or streptococcal pharyngitis declined from peak of 52% (May) to 7% (September).

We aimed to investigate the associations of heart rate trajectories and variability with functional outcome and mortality in patients with acute ICH. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted among 332 patients with acute ICH. Latent mixture modeling was used to identify heart rate trajectories during the first 72 h of hospitalization after ICH onset. Mean and coefficient of variation of heart rate measurements were calculated. The study outcomes included unfavorable functional outcome, ordinal shift of modified Rankin Scale score, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: We identified 3 distinct heart rate trajectory patterns (persistent-high, moderate-stable, and low-stable). During 3-month follow-up, 103 (31.0%) patients had unfavorable functional outcome and 46 (13.9%) patients died. In multivariable-adjusted model, compared with patients in low-stable trajectory, patients in persistent-high trajectory had the highest odds of poor functional outcome (odds ratio 15.06, 95% CI 3.67C61.78). Higher mean and coefficient of variation of heart rate were also associated with increased risk of unfavorable functional outcome (P trend < 0.05), and the corresponding odds ratios (95% CI) comparing two extreme tertiles were 4.69 (2.04C10.75) and 2.43 (1.09C5.39), respectively. Likewise, similar prognostic effects of heart rate dynamic changes on high modified Rankin Scale score and all-cause mortality were observed.

However, the mechanisms that regulate the dynamics and functions of these contact sites remain unresolved. We show that annulate lamellae (AL), a relatively unexplored subcellular structure representing subdomains of ER enriched with a subset of nucleoporins, are present at ER-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCS). Depletion of one of the AL-resident nucleoporins, Nup358, results in increased contacts between ER and mitochondria. Mechanistically, Nup358 modulates ERMCS dynamics by restricting mTORC2/Akt signalling. Our results suggest that growth factor-mediated remodelling of ERMCS depends on a reciprocal binding of Nup358 and mTOR to the ERMCS tethering complex consisting of VAPB and PTPIP51. Furthermore, Nup358 also interacts with IP3R, an ERMCS-enriched Ca2+ channel, and controls Ca2+ release from the ER. Consequently, depletion of Nup358 leads to elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+ and autophagy via activation of Ca2+/CaMKK2/AMPK axis. Our study thus uncovers a novel role for AL, particularly for Nup358, in regulating mTORC2-mediated ERMCS remodelling and Ca2+-directed autophagy, possibly via independent mechanisms.","output":"Nup358 regulates remodelling of ER-mitochondrial contact sites and autophagy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a report of the first three cases of endovascular aneurysm treatment that were proctored by a remote interventionalist using a novel high-resolution low-latency streaming technology.

The aim of the current study is to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of health care professionals in Greece towards SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: From 10-25 February 2020, 500 health care workers were approached. Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards SARS-CoV-2 were assessed via a personal interview questionnaire. For knowledge, each correct answer was given 1 point; attitudes, or concerns aimed at prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and practices, or behaviors towards performing preventive practices, were assigned 1 point each. Points were summed and a score for each category was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 461 health care workers returned the questionnaire and were included in the analysis (mean age  SD: 44.2  10.78 years, 74% females). The majority were nurses (47.5%), followed by physicians (30.5%) and paramedics (19%). The majority of subjects (88.28%) had a good level of knowledge (knowledge score equal to 4, or more). The majority of participants (71%) agreed with the temporary traveling restrictions ban. The uptake of a future vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was estimated at 43%. Knowledge score was significantly associated with both attitudes score (p = 0.011) and practices score (p < 0.001), indicating that subjects with a high knowledge score demonstrated a more positive perception on preventive measures and would practice more preventive measures. Attitudes score was significantly associated with practices score (p = 0.009) indicating that subjects with a higher attitudes score are more likely to perform practices towards the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. CONCLUSION: There is a high level of knowledge concerning SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among Greek health care workers and this is significantly associated with positive attitudes and practices towards preventive health measures. The high level of knowledge of health professionals about SARS-CoV-2 may have contributed considerably to the successful management of the pandemic in Greece.

The Co/NiS and SS bonds in dumbbell-shaped CoS2 and NiS2 were not entirely broken after oxidizing physically adsorbed Hg0, whereas the FeS and SS bonds in dumbbell-shaped FeS2 were. Thus, the activation energies of CoS2/TiO2 and NiS2/TiO2 for oxidizing physically adsorbed Hg0 were smaller than that of FeS2/TiO2, causing the stronger abilities of CoS2/TiO2 and NiS2/TiO2 to oxidize physically adsorbed Hg0 than that of FeS2/TiO2. However, the bonding strengths of Hg-S in HgS adsorbed on dumbbell-shaped CoS2 and NiS2 were relatively weaker because of the sharing of S2- in HgS with S- and Co2+/Ni2+, causing the decreases in heat stabilities of HgS adsorbed on CoS2/TiO2 and NiS2/TiO2.

Older adults with multiple chronic health conditions, who need tools to help with their daily management, may be especially good candidates for interventions on voice-controlled devices because these patients often have physical limitations, such as tremors or vision problems, that make the use of laptops and smartphones challenging. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess whether participants using an evidence-based intervention (ElderTree) on a smart display will experience decreased pain interference and improved quality of life and related measures in comparison with participants using ElderTree on a laptop and control participants who are given no device or access to ElderTree. METHODS: A total of 291 adults aged 60 years with chronic pain and 3 additional chronic conditions will be recruited from primary care clinics and community organizations and randomized 1:1:1 to ElderTree access on a smart display along with their usual care, ElderTree access on a touch screen laptop along with usual care, or usual care alone. All patients will be followed for 8 months. The primary outcomes are differences between groups in measures of pain interference and psychosocial quality of life. The secondary outcomes are between-group differences in system use at 8 months, physical quality of life, pain intensity, hospital readmissions, communication with medical providers, health distress, well-being, loneliness, and irritability. We will also examine mediators and moderators of the effects of ElderTree on both platforms. At baseline, 4 months, and 8 months, patients will complete written surveys comprising validated scales selected for good psychometric properties with similar populations. ElderTree use data will be collected continuously in system logs. We will use linear mixed-effects models to evaluate outcomes over time, with treatment condition and time acting as between-participant factors. Separate analyses will be conducted for each outcome. RESULTS: Recruitment began in August 2021 and will run through April 2023. The intervention period will end in December 2023. The findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study with a large sample and long time frame to examine whether a voice-controlled smart device can perform as well as or better than a laptop in implementing a health intervention for older patients with multiple chronic health conditions. As patients with multiple conditions are such a large cohort, the implications for cost as well as patient well-being are significant. Making the best use of current and developing technologies is a critical part of this effort.

This article aims to synthesise the very limited evidence from empirical studies on moral injury and to discuss a better understanding of the concept of moral injury, its importance in the healthcare context and its relation to the well-known concept of moral distress. A scoping literature review design was used to support the discussion. Systematic literature searches conducted in April 2020 in two electronic databases, PubMed/Medline and PsychInfo, produced 2044 hits but only a handful of empirical papers, from which seven well-focused articles were identified. The concept of moral injury was considered under other concepts as well such as stress of conscience, regrets for ethical situation, moral distress and ethical suffering, guilt without fault, and existential suffering with inflicting pain. Nurses had witnessed these difficult ethical situations when faced with unnecessary patient suffering and a feeling of not doing enough. Some cases of moral distress may turn into moral residue and end in moral injury with time, and in certain circumstances and contexts. The association between these concepts needs further investigation and confirmation through empirical studies; in particular, where to draw the line as to when moral distress turns into moral injury, leading to severe consequences.

Besides being easy to send messages, sharing short messages in group chat is considered effective compared to sending massively to several users. The ease of sending short messages in group chat is often used as the spread of fake news and untrue news or hoaxes, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, the information shared can be easily shared by anyone without seeing a valid source. The dissemination of information related to Covid-19 without a clear source is a dangerous act, because it can lead users into false information and endanger themselves. Fake message detectors have not been widely implemented in instant message applications, for this reason, there is a need for a detector and a machine to analyze activities in group chat and see whether the message is included in content containing fake news or not. If a group chat has a lot of fake news, you can be sure that the group chat is not good to follow. The use of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is considered quite effective in classifying an object, the results can be determined whether it is included in fake news, miss-information news, or true news. The process of processing messages is carried out by the massive text processing method because the characteristics of the text are different for each user so that text processing can be maximized for later classification.

With NH residents poor initial vaccine response, the rise of NH breakthrough infections and outbreaks, characterization of the durability of immunity to inform public health policy on the need for boosting is needed. We report on humoral immunity from 2 weeks to 6-months post-vaccination in 120 NH residents and 92 ambulatory healthcare worker controls with and without pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and serum neutralization titers, were assessed using a bead-based ELISA method and pseudovirus neutralization assay. Anti-spike, anti-RBD and neutralization levels dropped more than 84% over 6 months time in all groups irrespective of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. At 6 months post-vaccine, 70% of the infection-naive NH residents had neutralization titers at or below the lower limit of detection compared to 16% at 2 weeks after full vaccination. These data demonstrate a significant reduction in levels of antibody in all groups. In particular, those infection-naive NH residents had lower initial post-vaccination humoral immunity immediately and exhibited the greatest declines 6 months later. Healthcare workers, given their younger age and relative good-health, achieved higher initial antibody levels and better maintained them, yet also experienced significant declines in humoral immunity. Based on the rapid spread of the delta variant and reports of vaccine breakthrough in NH and among younger community populations, boosting NH residents may be warranted.","output":"Significant reduction in humoral immunity among healthcare workers and nursing home residents 6 months after COVID-19 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Covid-19 disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although corticosteroids have shown some promising results in Covid-19 patients, their effectiveness remains controversial. In this systematic review, we evaluated the effect of corticosteroids in mortality, Hospitalization, ICU admission, intubation, and mechanical ventilation in Covid-19 patients. METHODS: We searched major databases from March-2020 to Jan-2021. Twenty-nine studies were included after evaluating the eligibility of the literature. The extracted data for mortality, hospitalization, admission to the ICU, intubation, and mechanical ventilation were analyzed with RevMan? 5.4. Categorical variables are presented with odds ratios (OR), and numerical variables are shown with the mean difference. RESULT: Corticosteroid treatment had no impact on mortality in 18,190 covid patients with OR = 1.12[0.83C1.50]. When we include the randomized controlled trials, corticosteroids reduced the mortality by 20% (OR = 0.80 [0.73, 0.88]; P < 0.001). Additionally, the risk of admission to the ICU, the need for endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation were comparable between patients receiving corticosteroids and controls. The duration of hospitalization was also similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Corticosteroid therapy may not be effective for reducing mortality, length of hospitalization, the likelihood of intubation and mechanical ventilation, and ICU admission in patients suffering from Covid-19 pneumonia.","output":"Effects of corticosteroids on Covid-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis on clinical outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental factors in time and space play a critical role in advancing the sustainable development of the fresh agricultural product supply chain.

In March 2020 we established one of the first virtual wards with the aim of supporting patients with a continuing oxygen requirement safely at home during their COVID-19 illness.MethodsThe virtual ward was delivered by the integrated care ImpACT+ service. This multi-disciplinary service comprises respiratory consultants, respiratory specialist nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and fitness instructors. Our local criteria for on-boarding included: 10 days post onset of symptoms, oxygen requirement 4L or less and the ability to manage with home monitoring equipment. A mix of telephone and home contacts were offered and daily consultant MDTs undertaken. Therapy team members were up-skilled to support oxygen assessments and weaning regimes to maximise service capacity. A direct electronic referral icon was created on the hospital whiteboard system accompanied by a nurse-led telephone referral service. The scheme was advertised through posters and in-reach work into COVID-19 areas.Results107 patients were managed on our virtual ward since March 2020. This included 99 COVID-19 patients and 8 with other acute respiratory exacerbations. The mean continuous oxygen prescription on discharge was 1.5 L (range 0.5C4L) and for ambulatory purposes 2.4L (1C6L). 55 patients with COVID-19 were discharged on anticoagulation, 33 on steroids and 21 on antibiotics. 8 30-day readmissions, 3 deaths (2 expected).

Six peer-reviewed databases and websites of nine large migration organisations were searched to identify the literature on forced migrants and sexual and gender minorities. Twenty English-language studies from 2000C2021 were included and analysed drawing on a conceptual framework. Studies emerged from six regions and the majority of research participants identified as gay men. In general, quality appraisal demonstrated studies as either medium or high quality. Findings suggested five common themes associated with SOGIE health and well-being, including: daily exposure to discrimination, harassment and violence; coping, social support and resilience; access to services; mental health; and physical and sexual health. Depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were prevalent amongst SOGIE migrants, particularly when associated with detention or camp environments, and were exacerbated by social isolation. Barriers to accessing healthcare were identified and specific sexual health services were often found lacking, especially for trans persons. Unsurprisingly, during transit, SOGIE migrants are very likely to experience the double marginalisation of their migrant or minority status and their gender identity.

COVID-19-related deaths in Brazil were analyzed during the period of social distancing measures. Mortality data for COVID-19 was obtained from the Worldometer website (www.worldometer.info). Deaths were estimated up to the 31st day after the occurrence of the 5th COVID-19-related death in Brazil. Social distance was measured using Google's community mobility reports (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/). The Brazilian epidemic curves were interconnected, and mathematical models were evaluated to fit the mortality estimation curves. The optimistic model was defined in the opening period of social distancing and, therefore, in the lower mobility (40-60%). The realistic model was calculated according to relaxed social distance measures (<40%) and the pessimistic model was calculated based on the transmission rate between 2-3. Thus, the equations of the mathematical models provided the outcomes for the date of June 9, 2020, as follows: realistic model with 40,623 deaths, pessimistic model with 64,310 deaths and the optimistic model with a projection of 31,384 deaths. As a result of these analyzes, on May 24, 2020, there were a total of 22,965 deaths related to COVID-19, and those deaths included within the proposed mathematical models were 17,452 for the optimistic model, 22,623 for the realistic model and 32,825 for the pessimistic model.

The potential degradation of surgical skills during this hiatus has not yet been studied. Our previous work demonstrated that suturing performance is associated with urinary continence recovery after robotic prostatectomy. Herein, we use objective virtual reality (VR) simulation metrics to evaluate suturing technical skill degradation during the COVID-19 shutdown. METHODS: Surgeons completed a robotic VR suturing sponge exercise immediately prior to and after a mandated six-week surgical hiatus that ran from March 20, 2020 to May 5, 2020 at our institution. VR simulator metrics were collected including completion time, economy of motion, instrument collisions, needle drops, and missed targets. Comparisons of parameters before/after the shutdown were performed with either paired Student's t test or Wilcoxon-matched signed rank test. RESULTS: 22 urologic surgeons completed VR sessions preand post- COVID-19 shutdown. Surgeons were classified a priori as novice (<10 cases, n=6), training (10-300 cases, n=7), or expert (>300 cases, n=9) surgeons. Among all participants, weekly robotic surgery caseload decreased from median (IQR) 2.75 (0.5-6.0) pre- COVID to 0.75 (0-1.5) during the shutdown (p<0.001). Overall, we saw an increase in exercise completion time (p<0.001) and missed targets (p=0.004) as well as worse economy of motion (p=0.002) after the shutdown (Figure 1a, 2a, 3a).

Vascular endothelial growth factor is of significant interest for targeted therapy in R/M HNSCC because of its central role in tumorigenesis and immunosuppression. Axitinib is a potent inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1 , VEGFR2, VEGFR3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, as well as c-kit and offers such an approach. METHODS This article reports the results of a phase 2 trial evaluating axitinib in R/M HNSCC according to the Choi criteria for radiographic response assessment. The primary endpoint of this trial was 6-month overall survival. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients were enrolled, and 28 were evaluable for a response. Patients were heavily pretreated with 61% having had at least 1 previous systemic treatment in the metastatic setting (range, 0-5). The median overall survival of 9.8 months and the 6-month overall survival rate of 70% met the protocol-defined criteria for clinical efficacy. The best overall response rate was 42%. Correlative analyses demonstrated that PI3K signaling pathway alterations were associated with an increased response to therapy (75% vs 17%). A marked response to therapy was seen in a subgroup of patients who were treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor after progression on axitinib. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with axitinib is associated with improved survival in patients with heavily pretreated head and neck cancer, and PI3K pathway alterations may serve as a biomarker for response. Further investigation is warranted to evaluate axitinib in biomarker-selected populations, especially in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. LAY SUMMARY Metastatic head and neck squamous cancer is an incurable disease with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. This study is the first to demonstrate that the targeted oral drug axitinib improves survival in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic head and neck cancer. Furthermore, patients whose tumors have specific mutations derive the greatest benefit from therapy. The investigation of axitinib alone or in combination with immunotherapy in a genomic biomarker-selected population is warranted.","output":"Efficacy of axitinib in metastatic head and neck cancer with novel radiographic response criteria."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be completely understood, and detailed SARS-CoV-2 cellular cytopathic effects requires definition.

However, the impact of product development on competitive advantage varies depending on the capability of the firms to deal with the information technological turbulence. Research limitations/implications: This study adopted the concept of trust at the organisational level and did not cover the concept of trust at the family and community levels. Secondly, this study focusses on small and medium-sized enterprises as unit analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results depend on the subject of study, which could be different from the normal condition. Practical implications: This study provides four scenarios of foresight innovation strategy, which allow the firms to deal with various plausible futures. The proposed model devise strategies to prepare a strategy in the face of uncertainty. The findings encourage the firms to cultivate trust from their business partners to create innovation. Originality/value: This study extends the discussion on how innovativeness leads to firm competitive advantage by examining the role of trust and risk-taking behaviour in product development under information technological turbulence. The results confirm the integration between social capital theory and the contingency approach. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Innovation strategy beyond the COVID-19 pandemic: the role of trust under disruptive technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Since the first report of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in December of 2019, it has become rapidly prevalent and been declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization.

The safety profile of mRNA-based vaccines in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) is unknown. The objective of this report is to raise awareness to reactivation of herpes zoster (HZ) following the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in patients with AIIRD. METHODS: The safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination was assessed in an observational study monitoring post-vaccination adverse effects in patients with AIIRD (n = 491) and controls (n = 99), conducted in two Rheumatology Departments in Israel. RESULTS: The prevalence of HZ was 1.2% (n = 6) in patients with AIIRD compared with none in controls. Six female patients aged 49  11 years with stable AIIRD: rheumatoid arthritis (n = 4), Sjogren's syndrome (n = 1), and undifferentiated connective disease (n = 1), developed the first in a lifetime event of HZ within a short time after the first vaccine dose in 5 cases and after the second vaccine dose in one case. In the majority of cases, HZ infection was mild, except a case of HZ ophthalmicus, without corneal involvement, in RA patient treated with tofacitinib. There were no cases of disseminated HZ disease or postherpetic neuralgia. All but one patient received antiviral treatment with a resolution of HZ-related symptoms up to 6 weeks.

There is an urgent need for effective rescue therapies. Our aim is to evaluate the role of inhaled nitric oxide 160 ppm as a possible rescue therapy in nonintubated coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Design: Retrospective evaluation of coronavirus disease 2019 patients in respiratory distress receiving nitric oxide gas as rescue therapy. Setting: Massachusetts General Hospital, between March 18, 2020, and May 20, 2020, during the local coronavirus disease 2019 surge. Patients: Coronavirus disease 2019 patients at high risk for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with worsening symptoms despite use of supplemental oxygen and/or awake proning. Interventions: Patients received nitric oxide at concentrations of 160 ppm for 30 minutes twice per day via a face mask until resolution of symptoms, discharge, intubation, or the transition to comfort measures only. Measurements and Main Results: Between March 18, 2020, and May 20, 2020, five patients received nitric oxide inhalation as a rescue therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 at Massachusetts General Hospital. All received at least one dosage. The three patients that received multiple treatments (ranging from five to nine) survived and were discharged home. Maximum methemoglobin concentration after 30 minutes of breathing nitric oxide was 2.0% (1.7-2.3%). Nitrogen dioxide was below 2 ppm. No changes in mean arterial pressure or heart rate were observed during or after nitric oxide treatment. Oxygenation and the respiratory rate remained stable during and after nitric oxide treatments.

The absence of the dystrophin protein leads to a complex cascade of pathogenic events in myofibres, including chronic inflammation and oxidative stress as well as altered metabolism. The attention towards dietary supplements in DMD is rapidly increasing, with the aim to counteract pathology-related alteration in nutrient intake, the consequences of catabolic distress or to enhance the immunological response of patients as nowadays for the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. By definition, supplements do not exert therapeutic actions, although a great confusion may arise in daily life by the improper distinction between supplements and therapeutic compounds. For most supplements, little research has been done and little evidence is available concerning their effects in DMD as well as their preventing actions against infections. Often these are not prescribed by clinicians and patients/caregivers do not discuss the use with their clinical team. Then, little is known about the real extent of supplement use in DMD patients. It is mistakenly assumed that, since compounds are of natural origin, if a supplement is not effective, it will also do no harm. However, supplements can have serious side effects and also have harmful interactions, in terms of reducing efficacy or leading to toxicity, with other therapies. It is therefore pivotal to shed light on this unclear scenario for the sake of patients. This review discusses the supplements mostly used by DMD patients, focusing on their potential toxicity, due to a variety of mechanisms including pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions and contaminations, as well as on reports of adverse events. This overview underlines the need for caution in uncontrolled use of dietary supplements in fragile populations such as DMD patients.

It is well documented that troponin predicts the prognosis of patients. Myoglobin is not only an important marker of myocardial injury, but it indicates systemic muscle damage. However, its relationship with COVID-19 was rarely reported. The present study compared the predictive value of troponin and myoglobin on the final prognosis of COVID-19 patients by analyzing the clinical characteristics and serum levels of myoglobin and troponin in severe/critical COVID-19 patients. Methods: We enrolled 499 consecutive eligible hospitalized patients with severe/critical COVID-19 from February 14 to March 24, 2020 at Leishenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China. Clinical characteristics and laboratory data were collected and compared between the patients who died and survived. We analyzed the receiver operating characteristic curves of myoglobin and troponin. Then, the patients were divided into myo+ group, myo- group, tro+ group, and tro- group, and survival curves were analyzed. The prognostic predictable values of myoglobin and troponin were further analyzed using Cox multifactorial analysis. Results: Myoglobin and troponin were significantly elevated in the death group (134.4 [Interquartile range (IQR) 24.80, 605] vs 38.02 [IQR 3.87, 11.73] ng/ml, p<0.001), and troponin was also significantly elevated in the death group (0.01 [IQR 0.01, 0.01] vs 0.04 [IQR 0.02, 0.15] ng/ml, p<0.001). The ROC curves demonstrated that the area under the curve when using myoglobin to predict patient death was 0.911, with a threshold of 1.17, which was equivalent to troponin. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significantly lower survival curve in the myo+ group than the myo-group. Multifactor Cox survival analysis showed that troponin was no longer significant (HR = 0.98, 95%CI 0.921.03, p=0.507), but elevated myoglobin was an independent predictor of death in COVID-19 patients (HR = 1.001, 95%CI 1.0011.002, p<0.001). The analysis of the Cox model for predicting patient death and plotting decision curves suggested that the single factor myoglobin model was superior to troponin, and the predictive value of the multifactor model was superior to the single-factor analyses. Conclusions: In severe/critical COVID-19 patients, myoglobin and troponin were predictors of mortality and the probability of conversion to critical illness, and myoglobin may be superior to troponin for predictive value.","output":"Myoglobin and Troponin as Prognosis factors in Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions triggered a rapid alteration in the interview process for fellowships this spring.

STUDY DESIGN: Twenty candidates were interviewed via Zoom teleconferencing March-April 2020 using combined group and breakout rooms. An anonymous post-interview Likert and free text survey was sent to candidates with questions regarding feasibility, appropriateness, and acceptability of this method. RESULTS: Seventeen of 20 candidates (85%) responded to the survey. The candidates rated ease of interaction with the program director, faculty surgeons, and the current fellow highly: 94%, 83%, and 89%, respectively. The majority (53%) stated the virtual interviews exceeded or met expectations. Only a minority, 12%, reported the virtual platform was short of expectations. Approximately 70% noted little to no impact of not being able to conduct these interviews in-person and not being able to physically see the program institution. Overall, 94% were satisfied with their experience, and only 6% were neutral with no respondents reporting dissatisfaction. Finally, 76% would recommend a virtual interview in the future. Most negative open response comments were secondary to issues with software rather than the lack of the in-person traditional interviews.

We focus here on data obtained in intestinal cells that argue for another scheme of rotavirus assembly, where the final steps seem to take place outside the ER with an apically polarized release of rotavirus without significant cell lysis. One of the key observations made by different groups is that VP4 and other structural proteins interact substantially with specialized membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids termed rafts. In addition, recent data point to the fact that VP4 does not localize within the ER or the Golgi apparatus in infected intestinal cells. The mechanisms by which VP4, a cytosolic protein, may be targeted to the apical membrane in these cells and assembles with the other structural proteins are discussed.

In this context, the so-called hyperinflammation syndrome characterized by a cytokine storm accompanied by a massive increase in inflammatory markers such as interleukin(IL)-6, represents such a situation. This case report describes the therapeutic approach of using the IL-6-specific antibody tocilizumab in combination with hemoadsorption therapy (CytoSorb) in a 58-year-old male patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient suffered a massive clinical deterioration with concomitant Horovitz index of 127ammHg that occurred on the 6th day of ventilation. After combined application of the above-mentioned therapeutic approaches, the patient stabilized rapidly paralleled by a significant increase in the Horovitz index, and the possibility of de-escalating the ventilation regimen, which ultimately enabled successful extubation after only 13 days of ventilation. Moreover, the combined treatment was associated with significant hemodynamic stabilization and a consecutive reduction in vasopressor doses, while hyperinflammation could be kept well under control. The incorporation of the hemoadsorber into the therapeutic regimen proved to be safe and straightforward. In conclusion, the combination of CytoSorb therapy and IL-6 blockade by tocilizumab appeared, at least in this case, to be an effective measure to modulate an overshooting immune response in COVID-19 pneumonia with a concomitant clinical improvement in both respiratory and hemodynamic function, and thus could be used as a potential therapeutic option in this clinical picture.","output":"[Treatment of a Patient with a Pronounced Cytokine Storm in Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia using a Hemoadsorption in Combination with the Administration of tocilizumab]./ Die Behandlung eines Patienten mit ausgepr?gtem Zytokinsturm bei schwerer COVID-19-Pneumonie unter Einsatz von H?moadsorption in Kombination mit der Gabe von Tocilizumab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unions have criticised proposals for nurses and other staff in care homes for older people in England to be required to have a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of employment.","output":"Staff vaccines: persuade, dont compel, unions urge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: China is a country that is most seriously affected by hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) with 90% of HFRS cases reported globally. At present, HFRS is getting worse with increasing cases and natural foci in China. Therefore, there is an urgent need for monitoring and predicting HFRS incidence to make the control of HFRS more effective. In this study, we applied a stochastic autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model with the objective of monitoring and short-term forecasting HFRS incidence in China. METHODS: Chinese HFRS data from 1975 to 2008 were used to fit ARIMA model. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Ljung-Box test were used to evaluate the constructed models. Subsequently, the fitted ARIMA model was applied to obtain the fitted HFRS incidence from 1978 to 2008 and contrast with corresponding observed values. To assess the validity of the proposed model, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the observed and fitted HFRS incidence (1978-2008) was calculated. Finally, the fitted ARIMA model was used to forecast the incidence of HFRS of the years 2009 to 2011. All analyses were performed using SAS9.1 with a significant level of p < 0.05. RESULTS: The goodness-of-fit test of the optimum ARIMA (0,3,1) model showed non-significant autocorrelations in the residuals of the model (Ljung-Box Q statistic = 5.95,P = 0.3113). The fitted values made by ARIMA (0,3,1) model for years 1978-2008 closely followed the observed values for the same years, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 12.20%.

The role and importance of these transformations are also recognized by the EU which has been promoting and supporting the development of an innovative digital economy for many years. However, individual EU countries differ in terms of digital business maturity due to the implementation of Industry 4.0 technology. The article addresses this problem by presenting the results of a comprehensive study of the implementation of Industry 4.0 digital technologies in enterprises in the EU-27 countries and by assessing similarities between these countries in terms of these technologies. The similarity analysis was carried out using the k-means method. The Gini coefficient and Lorenz curves were utilized to determine the unevenness of the implementation of these technologies in individual countries, and the Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment method was used to assess the level of digital maturity. The research was based on eight selected determinants (indicators) that characterize the most important technologies related to Industry 4.0. The results showed high diversity among EU countries in terms of digital maturity. Scandinavian countries (Finland and Denmark) and Malta were found to be leaders in this area, while the weakest results were reported for Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Latvia.

Most (68.2%) currently prefer in-person visits, and 80.4% prefer in-person visits following pandemic resolution. More than half (52.2%) of patients preferring virtual visits do so because of convenience. Most (63.1%) patients with cancer are comfortable with a complete physical examination. Surgical patients are more likely to prefer a complete examination (P = .0476). Physicians prefer in-person visits (64.2%) and believe that virtual visits maybe or probably do not provide comparable care (64.2%). 71.4% believe that virtual visits help prevent the spread of infectious disease. CONCLUSION: Given preferences for in-person visits, cancer care teams should be prepared to continue providing in-person visits for many of their patients. The discrepancy between patient and provider concern for spread of infectious disease represents an area where patients may benefit from increased education. Providers should feel comfortable performing physical examinations at their own discretion.","output":"Patient and Physician Attitudes Toward Telemedicine in Cancer Clinics Following the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein mediates viral entry into cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein engages ACE2 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), an independently folded 197-amino-acid fragment of the 1,273-amino-acid S-protein protomer. The RBD is the primary SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing epitope and a critical target of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Here, we show that this RBD conjugated to each of two carrier proteins elicited more potent neutralizing responses in immunized rodents than did a similarly conjugated proline-stabilized S-protein ectodomain. Nonetheless, the native RBD is expressed inefficiently, limiting its usefulness as a vaccine antigen. However, we show that an RBD engineered with four novel glycosylation sites (gRBD) is expressed markedly more efficiently and generates a more potent neutralizing responses as a DNA vaccine antigen than the wild-type RBD or the full-length S protein, especially when fused to multivalent carriers, such as a Helicobacter pylori ferritin 24-mer. Further, gRBD is more immunogenic than the wild-type RBD when administered as a subunit protein vaccine. Our data suggest that multivalent gRBD antigens can reduce costs and doses, and improve the immunogenicity, of all major classes of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.IMPORTANCE All available vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) express or deliver the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. We show that this antigen is not optimal, consistent with observations that the vast majority of the neutralizing response to the virus is focused on the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, this RBD is not expressed well as an independent domain, especially when expressed as a fusion protein with a multivalent scaffold. We therefore engineered a more highly expressed form of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD by introducing four glycosylation sites into a face of the RBD normally occluded in the full S protein. We show that this engineered protein, gRBD, is more immunogenic than the wild-type RBD or the full-length S protein in both genetic and protein-delivered vaccines.","output":"An Engineered Receptor-Binding Domain Improves the Immunogenicity of Multivalent SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Veneto is one of the first Italian regions where the COVID-19 outbreak started spreading. Containment measures were approved soon thereafter. The present study aims at providing a first look at the impact of the containment measures on the outbreak progression in the Veneto region, Italy. METHODS: A Bayesian changepoint analysis was used to identify the changing speed of the epidemic curve. Then, a piecewise polynomial model was considered to fit the data in the first period before the detected changepoint. In this time interval, that is, the weeks from 27 February to 12 March, a quadratic growth was identified by a generalised additive model (GAM). Finally, the model was used to generate the projection of the expected number of hospitalisations at 2 weeks based on the epidemic speed before the changepoint. Such estimates were then compared with the actual outbreak behaviour. RESULTS: The comparison between the observed and predicted hospitalisation curves highlights a slowdown on the total COVID-19 hospitalisations after the onset of containment measures. The estimated daily slowdown effect of the epidemic growth is estimated as 78 hospitalisations per day as of 27 March (95% CI 75 to 81).

Since most test sets are constructed as an i.i.d. sample from the overall data, this approach overly simplifies the complexity of language and encourages overfitting to the head of the data distribution. As such, rare language phenomena or text about underrepresented groups are not equally included in the evaluation. To encourage more in-depth model analyses, researchers have proposed the use of multiple test sets, also called challenge sets, that assess specific capabilities of a model. In this paper, we develop a framework based on this idea which is able to generate controlled perturbations and identify subsets in text-to-scalar, text-to-text, or data-to-text settings. By applying this framework to the GEM generation benchmark, we propose an evaluation suite made of 80 challenge sets, demonstrate the kinds of analyses that it enables and shed light onto the limits of current generation models.","output":"Automatic Construction of Evaluation Suites for Natural Language Generation Datasets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic brings unprecedented uncertainty and stress. This study aimed to characterize general sleep status among Chinese residents during the early stage of the outbreak and to explore the network relationship among COVID-19 uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, perceived stress, and sleep status. METHODS: A cross-sectional correlational survey was conducted online. A total of 2534 Chinese residents were surveyed from 30 provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions of China and regions abroad during the period from February 7 to 14, 2020, the third week of lockdown. Final valid data from 2215 participants were analyzed. Self-report measures assessed uncertainty about COVID-19, intolerance of uncertainty, perceived stress, and general sleep status. Serial mediation analysis using the bootstrapping method and path analysis were applied to test the mediation role of intolerance of uncertainty and perceived stress in the relationship between uncertainty about COVID-19 and sleep status. RESULTS: The total score of sleep status was 4.82 (SD = 2.72). Age, place of residence, ethnicity, marital status, infection, and quarantine status were all significantly associated with general sleep status. Approximately half of participants (47.1%) reported going to bed after 12:00 am, 23.0% took 30 min or longer to fall asleep, and 30.3% slept a total of 7 h or less. Higher uncertainty about COVID-19 was significantly positively correlated with higher intolerance of uncertainty (r = 0.506, p < 0.001). The mediation analysis found a mediating role of perceived stress in the relationship between COVID-19 uncertainty and general sleep status (? = 0.015, 95%C.I. = 0.009-0.021). However, IU was not a significant mediator of the relationship between COVID-19 uncertainty and sleep (? = 0.009, 95%C.I. = - 0.002-0.020). Moreover, results from the path analysis further showed uncertainty about COVID-19 had a weak direct effect on poor sleep (? = 0.043, p < 0.05); however, there was a robust indirect effect on poor sleep through intolerance of uncertainty and perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that intolerance of uncertainty and perceived stress are critical factors in the relationship between COVID-19 uncertainty and sleep outcomes.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the Registry of Senior Australians. Individuals aged 65 years who entered permanent residential aged care facilities between 2008 and 2015 were included. The prevalence (95% confidence interval [CI]) of eye diseases by year, eye health care services, and ophthalmic medication use within a year of entry into the service were evaluated. Poisson regression models estimated adjusted rate of change using prevalence ratio (PR) by age, sex, state, and frailty scores. RESULTS: Of the 409,186 people studied, 43.6% (N = 178,367) had an eye condition. Of the total cohort, 32.9% (N = 134,566) had chronic eye conditions and 19.7% (N = 80,661) had an acute eye condition. Common chronic eye conditions were glaucoma (13.6%, N = 55,830), cataract (8%, (N = 32,779), blindness (4.5%, N = 18,856), and poor vision (10.3%, N = 42,245). Prevalence of any eye condition (2008: 42.7%, 95% CI = 42.2%C43.2% and 2015: 41.2%, 95% CI = 40.8C41.6%, PR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.99C0.99, P < 0.001), acute eye conditions (2008: 19.8%, 95% CI = 19.4%C20.2% and 2015: 17.4%, 95% CI = 17.1%C17.6%, PR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.97C0.98, P < 0.001), and blindness (2008: 5.2%, 95% CI = 5.0%C5.4% and 2015: 3.7%, 95% CI = 3.5%C3.9%, PR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.93C0.94, p < 0.001). decreased over the study period. The prevalence of glaucoma (2008: 13.5%, 95% CI = 13.2%C13.8% and 2015: 13.8%, 95% CI = 13.5%C13.7%; PR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.99C1.10, P < 0.001) and cataract (2008: 7.4%, 95% CI = 7.2%C7.7% and 2015: 8.5%, 95% CI = 8.3%C8.7%, PR = 1.00, 95% CI = 1.00C1.01, P < 0.001) remained stable or slightly increased. Overall, 46.4% (N = 82,769) of individuals with eye conditions, accessed at least one eye health service within the first year of entering residential care and 70.5% (N = 125,673) used at least one ophthalmic medication. Optometric services (41.7%, N = 74,358) were the most used eye health care services and anti-infective eye drops (37.2%, N = 66,331) were the most commonly dispensed medications. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of blindness among older Australian using residential aged care services decreased over the study period. However, the burden of eye diseases remained high between 2008 and 2015, whereas the use of eye health care services was disproportionately low. This study provides evidence of a significant need for eye health care services for older people with an eye disease in residential aged care facilities. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Four in ten long term aged care residents in Australia had at least one eye condition over the study period, indicating potential for a high eye health care needs in aged care settings.","output":"Prevalence of Eye Conditions, Utilization of Eye Health Care Services, and Ophthalmic Medications After Entering Residential Aged Care in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Epidemiologically, in China, locally advanced rectal cancer is a more common form of rectal cancer. Preoperative neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy can effectively reduce the size of locally invasive tumors and improve disease-free survival (DFS) and pathologic response after surgery. At present, this modality has become the standard protocol for the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer in many centers, but the optimal time for surgery after neoadjuvant therapy is still controversial. AIM: To investigate the impact of time interval between neoadjuvant therapy and surgery on DFS and pathologic response in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. METHODS: A total of 231 patients who were classified as having clinical stage II or III advanced rectal cancer and underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery at the National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College from November 2014 to August 2017 were involved in this retrospective cohort study. The patients were divided into two groups based on the different time intervals between neoadjuvant therapy and surgery: 139 (60.2%) patients were in group A (&#8804; 9 wk), and 92 (39.2%) patients were in group B (> 9 wk). DFS and pathologic response were analyzed as the primary endpoints. The secondary endpoints were postoperative complications and sphincter preservation. RESULTS: For the 231 patients included, surgery was performed at &#8804; 9 wk in 139 (60.2%) patients and at > 9 wk in 92 (39.8%). The patients' clinical characteristics, surgical results, and tumor outcomes were analyzed through univariate analysis combined with multivariate regression analysis. The overall pathologic complete response (pCR) rate was 27.2% (n = 25) in the longer time interval group (> 9 wk) and 10.8% (n = 15) in the shorter time interval group (&#8804; 9 wk, P = 0.001). The postoperative complications did not differ between the groups (group A, 5% vs group B, 5.4%; P = 0.894). Surgical procedures for sphincter preservation were performed in 113 (48.9%) patients, which were not significantly different between the groups (group A, 52.5% vs group B, 43.5%; P = 0.179). The pCR rate was an independent factor affected by time interval (P = 0.009; odds ratio [OR] = 2.668; 95%CI: 1.276-5.578). Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis showed that the longer time interval (> 9 wk) was a significant independent prognostic factor for DFS (P = 0.032; OR = 2.295; 95%CI: 1.074-4.905), but the time interval was not an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: A longer time interval to surgery after neoadjuvant therapy may improve the pCR rate and DFS but has little impact on postoperative complications and sphincter preservation.","output":"Impact of interval between neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery in rectal cancer patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Functional imaging of intact taste cells in response to various tastant solutions poses a technical challenge since the refractive index of the immersion medium dynamically changes during tastant delivery.

PIDs are present at the crossroad between infections, immune dysregulation, and cancers. A panel encompassing 42 genes involved in both PIDs and cancer has been investigated for the genes compositional properties, codon usage patterns, various forces affecting codon choice, protein properties, and gene expression profiles. In the present study, the codon choice of genes was found to be dependent upon the richness of the nucleotide; the viz AT nucleotide rich genome preferred AT ending codons. The dinucleotide TpA adversely affected protein expression, while CpG did not. The CTG codon was the most overrepresented codon in 80.95% of genes. Analysis of various protein properties, including GRAVY, AROMA, isoelectric point, aliphatic index, hydrophobicity, instability index, and numbers of acidic, basic, and neutral amino acid residues revealed that the hydrophobicity index, instability index, and numbers of acidic and basic amino acid residues are the factors affecting gene expression. Based on neutrality analysis, parity analysis, ENc-GC3 analysis, and regression analysis of nucleotides present at the first and third positions of the codon, it was determined that selection pressure, mutation pressure, and compositional constraints all participated in shaping codon usage. The study will help determine the various evolutionary forces acting on genes common to both PIDs and cancer. Codon usage analysis might be helpful in the future to augment both diseases simultaneously. The research also indicates a peculiar pattern adapted by a set of genes involved in any disease.","output":"Genes Common in Primary Immunodeficiencies and Cancer Display Overrepresentation of Codon CTG and Dominant Role of Selection Pressure in Shaping Codon Usage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The BI was chartered in 1994 by Utah State University's (USU) Board of Trustees and given the mission of improving human-wildlife interactions by reducing humanwildlife conflicts through research, teaching, outreach, and education.

(2) Purpose: We assessed a methodological criticism on the quality of previous published meta-analyses and the risk of misleading conclusions with important therapeutic consequences. We also examined the evidence of the efficacy of corticosteroids in reducing mortality in SARS, MERS and COVID-19. (3) Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were used to identify studies published until 25 April 2020, that reported associations between steroid use and mortality in treating SARS/MERS/COVID-19. Two investigators screened and extracted data independently. Searches were restricted to studies on humans, and articles that did not report the exact number of patients in each group or data on mortality were excluded. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) under the fixed-and random-effect model. (4) Results: Eight articles (4051 patients) were eligible for inclusion. Among these selected studies, 3416 patients were diagnosed with SARS, 360 patients with MERS, and 275 with COVID-19; 60.3% patients were administered steroids. The meta-analyses including all studies showed no differences overall in terms of mortality (OR 1.152, 95% CI 0.631C2.101 in the random effects model, p = 0.645). However, this conclusion might be biased, because, in some studies, the patients in the steroid group had more severe symptoms than those in the control group.

Diabetes camps are designed to help those with T1D learn diabetes management skills while experiencing summer camp. Psychological aspects are not addressed explicitly in diabetes camps located in Kansas. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychological state of past campers and camp counselors from one diabetes camp in Kansas. METHODS: Campers and counselors, all of whom had T1D, and attended diabetes camp from 2015 to 2019 in Kansas were recruited to complete a survey about diabetes-related stress, diabetes management self-efficacy, and symptoms of depression. A link to the online survey was distributed to previous campers and counselors by email and through Facebook. RESULTS: A total of 24 camp counselors and 10 campers were surveyed, 100% of whom reported having T1D and attending camp at least once.

However, empirical data are limited on factors that promote or are barriers to the sustainability of NPHIs. This evaluation explored stakeholders perceptions about enabling factors and barriers to the success and sustainability of NPHIs in seven countries where the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has supported NPHI development and strengthening. DESIGN: Qualitative study. SETTING: Cambodia, Colombia, Liberia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda and Zambia. PARTICIPANTS: NPHI staff, non-NPHI government staff, and non-governmental and international organisation staff. METHODS: We conducted semistructured, in-person interviews at a location chosen by the participants in the seven countries. We analysed data using a directed content analysis approach. RESULTS: We interviewed 43 NPHI staff, 29 non-NPHI government staff and 24 staff from non-governmental and international organisations. Participants identified five enabling factors critical to the success and sustainability of NPHIs: (1) strong leadership, (2) financial autonomy, (3) political commitment and country ownership, (4) strengthening capacity of NPHI staff and (5) forming strategic partnerships. Three themes emerged related to major barriers or threats to the sustainability of NPHIs: (1) reliance on partner funding to maintain key activities, (2) changes in NPHI leadership and (3) staff attrition and turnover. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings contribute to the scant literature on sustainability of NPHIs in LMICs by identifying essential components of sustainability and types of support needed from various stakeholders. Integrating these components into each step of NPHI development and ensuring sufficient support will be critical to strengthening public health systems and safeguarding their continuity.

The study aimed to explore the relationship between night shift work with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), and the modification effect of circadian dysfunction on it. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among Chinese workers. Exposure was measured by night work history and duration. Circadian dysfunction was characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). The diagnosis of CSU was made by dermatologists who were investigating on the spot. The effect size was expressed as odds ratios (ORs). Results: A total of 8,057 participants were recruited, and 7,411 (92%) with complete information were included in the final analyses. The prevalence rates of CSU for workers without night shift and those with night shift history were 0.73 and 1.28%, respectively. Compared with workers who never worked night shifts, the risk of CSU increased with the length of night shift work: OR = 1.55 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.78C3.06) for duration <5 years and OR = 1.91 (95% CI: 1.12C3.26) for duration 5 years. EDS s EDS has been shown to modify this combination. Among workers without EDS, there was no association between night shift and CSU (OR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.49C1.79). Whereas, in participants with EDS, the correlation was significant (OR = 3.58; 95% CI: 1.14C11.20). However, the effect modification by sleep disturbance was not observed. Conclusions: Night shift work is a risk factor for CSU, and there is a dose-response relationship between night shift work hours and the risk of CSU. This connection may be modified by circadian dysfunction.","output":"Association of Night Shift Work With Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria and Effect Modification by Circadian Dysfunction Among Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV2 has caused the current pandemic of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 illness range broadly from asymptotic and mild to a life-threatening situation. This casts uncertainties for defining host determinants underlying the disease severity. Recent genetic analyses based on extensive clinical sample cohorts using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and high throughput sequencing curation revealed genetic errors and gene loci associated with about 20% of life-threatening COVID-19 cases. Significantly, most of these critical genetic loci are enriched in two immune signaling pathways, i.e., interferon-mediated antiviral signaling and chemokine-mediated/inflammatory signaling. In line with these genetic profiling studies, the broad spectrum of COVID-19 illness could be explained by immuno-pathological regulation of these critical immunogenetic pathways through various epigenetic mechanisms, which further interconnect to other vital components such as those in the reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system (RAAS) because of its direct interaction with the virus causing COVID-19. Together, key genes unraveled by genetic profiling may provide targets for precisely early risk diagnosis and prophylactic design to relieve severe COVID-19.

We analyzed death and nasopharyngeal viral kinetics in 655 hospitalized patients from the prospective French COVID cohort. The model predicted a median peak viral load that coincided with symptom onset. Patients with age &#8805;65 y had a smaller loss rate of infected cells, leading to a delayed median time to viral clearance occurring 16 d after symptom onset as compared to 13 d in younger patients (P < 10-4). In multivariate analysis, the risk factors associated with mortality were age &#8805;65 y, male gender, and presence of chronic pulmonary disease (hazard ratio [HR] > 2.0). Using a joint model, viral dynamics after hospital admission was an independent predictor of mortality (HR = 1.31, P < 10-3). Finally, we used our model to simulate the effects of effective pharmacological interventions on time to viral clearance and mortality. A treatment able to reduce viral production by 90% upon hospital admission would shorten the time to viral clearance by 2.0 and 2.9 d in patients of age <65 y and &#8805;65 y, respectively. Assuming that the association between viral dynamics and mortality would remain similar to that observed in our population, this could translate into a reduction of mortality from 19 to 14% in patients of age &#8805;65 y with risk factors.

MethodsWe coupled a simulated data set incorporating actual community prevalence and test performance characteristics to a susceptible, infectious, removed (SIR) compartmental model, modeling the impact of base and tunable variables including test sensitivity, testing frequency, results lag, sample pooling, disease prevalence, externally-acquired infections, and test cost on outcomes case reduction. ResultsIncreasing testing frequency was associated with a non-linear positive effect on cases averted over 100 days. While precise reductions in cumulative number of infections depended on community disease prevalence, testing every 3 days versus every 14 days (even with a lower sensitivity test) reduces the disease burden substantially.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between clinical course and inhospital mortality with parenteral administration of high-dose vitamin D(3) within the first 24 h of admission to patients who were hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) because of COVID-19 with vitamin D deficiency. METHODS: This study included 175 COVID-19 patients with vitamin D deficiency [25(OH) D <12 ng/mL] who were hospitalized in the ICU. Vitamin D(3) group (n = 113) included patients who received a single dose of 300,000 IU vitamin D3 intramuscularly. Vitamin D(3) was not administered to the control group (n = 62). RESULTS: Median C-reactive protein level was 10.8 mg/dL in the vitamin D(3) group and 10.6 mg/dL in the control group (p = 0.465). Thirty-nine percent (n = 44) of the patients in the vitamin D(3) group were intubated endotracheally, and 50% (n = 31) of the patients in the control group were intubated endotracheally (p = 0.157).

However, nervous system involvement and its effect on disease outcome are poorly characterized. The objective of this study was to determine whether neurologic syndromes are associated with increased risk of inpatient mortality. METHODS: A total of 581 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, neurologic involvement, and brain imaging were compared to hospitalized non-neurologic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Four patterns of neurologic manifestations were identified: acute stroke, new or recrudescent seizures, altered mentation with normal imaging, and neuro-COVID-19 complex. Factors present on admission were analyzed as potential predictors of in-hospital mortality, including sociodemographic variables, preexisting comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory values, and pattern of neurologic manifestations. Significant predictors were incorporated into a disease severity score. Patients with neurologic manifestations were matched with patients of the same age and disease severity to assess the risk of death. RESULTS: A total of 4,711 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted to one medical system in New York City during a 6-week period. Of these, 581 (12%) had neurologic issues of sufficient concern to warrant neuroimaging. These patients were compared to 1,743 non-neurologic patients with COVID-19 matched for age and disease severity admitted during the same period. Patients with altered mentation (n = 258, p = 0.04, odds ratio [OR] 1.39, confidence interval [CI] 1.04C1.86) or radiologically confirmed stroke (n = 55, p = 0.001, OR 3.1, CI 1.65C5.92) had a higher risk of mortality than age- and severity-matched controls.

Methods: Eligible studies analysed biopsychosocial functioning following lockdown measures secondary to infectious outbreaks. Studies exclusively researching outcomes during lockdown, review articles, or those analysing lockdown measures not pertaining to an infectious outbreak were excluded. Data was extracted from published reports with further information requested where necessary. The mixed methods appraisal tool assessed study quality, a protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020181134), and narrative synthesis was applied.

At the molecular level, breast cancer is heterogeneous, where the cancer-initiating stem-like cells (bCSCs) comprise a small yet distinct population of cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) that can differentiate into cells of multiple lineages, displaying varying degrees of cellular differentiation, enhanced metastatic potential, invasiveness, and resistance to radio- and chemotherapy. Based on the expression of estrogen and progesterone hormone receptors, expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and/or BRCA mutations, the breast cancer molecular subtypes are identified as TNBC, HER2 enriched, luminal A, and luminal B. Management of breast cancer primarily involves resection of the tumor, followed by radiotherapy, and systemic therapies including endocrine therapies for hormone-responsive breast cancers; HER2-targeted therapy for HER2-enriched breast cancers; chemotherapy and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for TNBC, and the recent development of immunotherapy. However, the complex crosstalk between the malignant cells and stromal cells in the breast TME, rewiring of the many different signaling networks, and bCSC-mediated processes, all contribute to overall drug resistance in breast cancer. However, strategically targeting bCSCs to reverse chemoresistance and increase drug sensitivity is an underexplored stream in breast cancer research. The recent identification of dysregulated miRNAs/ncRNAs/mRNAs signatures in bCSCs and their crosstalk with many cellular signaling pathways has uncovered promising molecular leads to be used as potential therapeutic targets in drug-resistant situations. Moreover, therapies that can induce alternate forms of regulated cell death including ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and immunotherapy; drugs targeting bCSC metabolism; and nanoparticle therapy are the upcoming approaches to target the bCSCs overcome drug resistance. Thus, individualizing treatment strategies will eliminate the minimal residual disease, resulting in better pathological and complete response in drug-resistant scenarios.

In current scenario pooled sample testingstrategy advocated by ICMR, New Delhiis a new approach which is very promising in resource limited settings. In this study we have evaluated pooled strategy in terms of accurate testing results, utilization of consumables and identification of border line positive cases. MATERIALS & METHODS Between April-June 2020 we performed COVID-19 testing by RTPCR from areas with varying prevalence of population referred to COVID laboratory, Dr RMLIMS, Lucknow. In a first step the samples are collated into pools of 5 or 10.These pools are tested by RT-PCR. Negative Pools were reported as negative whereas positive pools of 5 and 10 are then deconvoluted and each sample is tested individually. RESULTS In the present study, we tested 4620 samples in 462 pools of 10 and 14940 samples in 2990 pools of 5. Among 10 samples pool 61 (13%) pools flagged positive in first step. In second step among 61 pools (610 samples) deconvoluted strategy was followed in which 72 individual samples came positive. Pooled-sample testing strategy helps saves substantial resources and time during surge testing and enhanced pandemic surveillance. This approach requires around 76% to 93% less tests done in low to moderate prevalence settings and group sizes up to 5-10 in a population, compared to individual testing. CONCLUSIONS Pooled-sample PCR analysis strategies can save substantial resources and time for COVID-19 mass testing in comparison to individual testing without compromising the result outcome of test. In particular, pooled-sample approach can facilitate mass screening in early coming stages of COVID-19 outbreaks, especially in low- and middle-income settings and control the spread by meticulous testing of all risk groups.

It was characterized and tested for its textile dye decolorization potential. LB medium was found to be the most promising growth medium with addition of glucose (1-2%), yeast extract (0.1%), FeCl3 (0.01 mM) and MnCl2 (0.001 mM). The optimum spore laccase production was at pH 8, 30 C, 1:5 medium to air ratio, 2% inoculum size and 7 days incubation. The characterization study of the enzyme showed the maximum activity at 60 C and pH 6-7.5. It was induced by Ca+2, Mg+2, Fe+3, Zn+2, Cu+2 and Na+ at 1 mM concentration. Also, it was stable in the presence of methanol, ethanol, acetone and chloroform. In addition, it enhanced about 34% by 5 mM H2O2 and it was nearly stable at 10-20 mM H2O2. Furthermore, mediators such as ABTS, syrengaldazine and 2, 6 dimethyl phenol enhanced the spore laccase activity. The spore laccase enzyme efficiently decolorized direct red 81 and acid black 24 after 24 h. Phytotoxicity of the direct red 81 solution after decolorization by tested spore laccase was lower than that of the untreated dye solution. Finally, this study added a promising spore laccase candidate for ecofriendly and cost-effective dye wastewater bio-decolorization.","output":"Optimization of spore laccase production by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens isolated from wastewater and its potential in green biodecolorization of synthetic textile dyes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to present design principles for holistic design of online degree programmes (ODPs) in higher education (HE).

Xenogeneic DNA immunization against gp75/TRP-1 generates antibody-dependent tumor immunity and autoimmune depigmentation. In contrast xenogeneic TRP-2 DNA immunization induces immunity mediated by CD8+ T-cells. The role of IFN-gamma in the generation of tumor immunity and autoimmune depigmentation in these two models was investigated. No tumor protection and minimal depigmentation was observed after immunization with human TRP-2 DNA in mice deficient in IFN-gamma ligand. Repletion with recombinant murine IFN-gamma restored tumor immunity. Experiments using IL4 deficient mice demonstrated that tumor immunity was unaffected but that autoimmune depigmentation was potentially accelerated, consistent with down-modulation of autoimmunity against TRP-2 by IL4. In contrast, IFN-gamma was not required for the generation of immunity to gp75/TRP-1. In fact, exogenous IFN-gamma ablated autoantibody responses against gp75/TRP-1 after xenogeneic DNA immunization, consistent with a down-regulatory effect of IFN-gamma. These results show that immunity to TRP-2 following DNA immunization uses an IFN-gamma-dependent Th1 pathway, but immunity to gp75/TRP-1 is down-regulated by IFN-gamma.","output":"Alternative roles for interferon-gamma in the immune response to DNA vaccines encoding related melanosomal antigens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We read the letter of Arana Fernandez et al. regarding our paper entitled \\"Prevalence and 6-month recovery of olfactory dysfunction: a multicentre study of 1363 COVID-19 patients.\\" The authors highlighted the fact that psychophysical olfactory evaluations (Sniffin'Sticks test) are not objective but subjective testing.

Self-reported adolescent appraisals of the parent-child relationship and depressive symptoms were obtained from a convenience sample of impoverished, predominantly Latino urban youth (n = 44). Exposure to environmental pyrethroids was obtained from wipe samples using a standardized protocol. Parent-adolescent conflict was higher in households with bifenthrin than those without, and adolescent depressive symptoms were elevated in homes where cypermethrin was detected. In addition, the presence of bifenthrin in the home attenuated the protective effects of parental involvement on adolescent depressive symptoms.

Even after a full year of research and study, the most effective way to control the spread of this infection is early diagnosis and isolation of the cases. Real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the standard test all over the world for the diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. All the sample collection guidelines have recommended stringent maintenance of the cold chain for the sample transport. However, it is not possible for the resource constrained developing countries with inadequate infrastructure to comply with these guidelines all the time. Aim: To determine necessity of these stringent transport criteria and the effect of temperature on the clinical sensitivity of a RT-PCR assay for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and Methods: In this prospective experimental study conducted in November 2020, 49 positive samples were kept at ambient room temperature and were tested everyday with RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA). The samples were also kept under refrigeration at the 4C and were also tested by RT-PCR and the results were compared with their respective counterparts kept at room temperature till nine days. Python Jupiter notebook SciPy and Anaconda software was used for statistical analysis. Results: It was observed that the positivity of the RT-PCR results were not deteriorated till five days and there was no significant deterioration even after nine days of samples being stored at room temperature suggesting that even if the viral RNA itself is not stable outside strict temperature control but small fragment or target genetic sequences are enough for detection of virus by RT-PCR. Conclusion: It is possible to keep samples at this ambient temperature for five days without any loss of positivity in RT-PCR.","output":"A study on requirement of cold chain maintenance for reliable testing of SARS-CoV-2 samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The abscopal effect was described as early as the 1950s, when untreated tumors demonstrated a response after radiation therapy was delivered to an untreated, distant site.

The impact of surgical training on the wellness of loved ones who support trainees has not been previously studied. METHODS This qualitative study employs semi-structured interviews of 32 support persons of surgical trainees at a single tertiary care center with multiple surgical specialty training programs. Interviews focused on perceptions about supporting a surgical trainee. Transcripts underwent thematic analysis with semantic and conceptual coding. Key themes regarding the effects that caring for a trainee has on support persons are reported. RESULTS Three key themes were identified: (1) Sacrifices-support persons report significant tangible and intangible sacrifices, (2) Delaying life-life is placed on hold to prioritize training, and (3) A disconnect-there is a disconnect and a lack of recognition of support person needs that require greater awareness and targeted interventions. CONCLUSIONS The impact of surgical training can extend beyond trainees and can affect the wellness of their support persons who endure the effects of training alongside trainees.

Recently, however, the economic environment in China has begun to change, including changes in both employment and wages. We identify recent employment/wage trends throughout Chinas economy and postulate the sources of these trends as well as possible future consequences if they continue. We use official, nationally aggregated data to examine employment and wages in multiple sectors and industries. Our findings indicate that China may have entered a new phase of economic development in the mid-2010s. According to the data, in recent years, wage growth has begun to polarize: Rising for professionals employed in formal skill-intensive industries; and falling for workers in the informal labor-intensive service sector. We attribute this increase in skill-intensive wages to an increase in demand for skill-intensive employment, due to the emergence of a large middle class in China, for whom the demand for high technology, finance, banking, health, and higher education industries is increasing while, at least in the recent short term, the supply of experienced, high-skilled professionals has not kept up. The employment/wage trend in the informal (low-wage) service sector, however, is following a different pattern. While there is a rising demand for services in Chinas economy, the growth, due to a number of factors (e.g., large shares of GDP targeted by policymakers to investment; high rates of savings by consumers), is relatively slow. In contrast, due to a number of economic forces, including globalization and automation, the supply of labor into the service sector of the informal economy is being fueled by the flow of labor out of manufacturing and construction (two industries that that have experienced employment declines since 2013). These supply and demand trends, in turn, are leading to the fall in the growth rate of wages in the informal service sector. We conclude by discussing the possible longer-term consequences of these emerging polarization trends based on an examination of recent experience with wage polarization occurring in both middle- and high-income countries, as well as its consequences. We also present policy recommendations for greater investment in education and human capital, as well as for the development of a more comprehensive set of social safety nets for different segments of Chinas population.","output":"Moving Beyond Lewis: Employment and Wage Trends in Chinas High- and Low-Skilled Industries and the Emergence of an Era of Polarization: Presidential Address for the 2020 Association for Comparative Economic Studies Meetings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gambling is a popular leisure activity but also a significant public health issue in Australia.

A structure-based virtual screen was performed with 10,761 small molecules retrieved from DrugBank, using the GRP78 nucleotide binding domain and substrate binding domain as molecular targets. Results indicated that GRP78 mRNA levels were approximately four times higher in the blood of SARS-CoV-2 (+) versus SARS-CoV-2 (?) pneumonia patients, further suggesting that GRP78 might be a good molecular target to treat Covid-19. In addition, a total of 409 compounds were identified with potential as GRP78 inhibitors. In conclusion, we found preliminary evidence that further proposes GRP78 as a possible molecular target to treat Covid-19 and that many clinically approved drugs bind GRP78 as an off-target effect. We suggest that further work should be urgently carried out to confirm if GRP78 is indeed a good molecular target and if some of those drugs have potential to be repurposed for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity.","output":"Preliminary Virtual Screening Studies to Identify GRP78 Inhibitors Which May Interfere with SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus has spread rapidly around the world.

We utilize an age-structured compartmental SEIR model that takes into account SARS-CoV-2 waning immunity, vaccination, and increased transmissibility from variants of concern, to estimate if barrier gestures can be relaxed without causing a resurgence of severe infections. This model assumes that susceptibility to infection is a function of immunity status, which depends on initial infection severity and vaccination status. It is calibrated on confirmed COVID-19 cases from the French surveillance database, and accounts for changes in contact behaviors due to implementation of nation-wide public health policies. We study partial and full relaxation of barrier gestures occurring from August to December 2021 under various immunity duration assumptions. Maintaining application of barrier gestures appears essential to avoid a resurgence of severe infections that would exceed health care capacities, while surmounting vaccine hesitancy represents the key to consider their relaxation.

There are also several groups of organisms which accumulate vanadium, employing it in their biological processes. Vanadium being a biological relevant element, it is not surprising that many vanadium based therapeutic drugs have been proposed for the treatment of several types of diseases. Namely, vanadium compounds, in particular organic derivatives, have been proposed for the treatment of diabetes, of cancer and of diseases caused by parasites. In this work we review the medicinal applications proposed for vanadium compounds with particular emphasis on the more recent publications. In cells, partly due to the similarity of vanadate and phosphate, vanadium compounds activate numerous signaling pathways and transcription factors; this by itself potentiates application of vanadium-based therapeutics. Nevertheless, this non-specific bio-activity may also introduce several deleterious side effects as in addition, due to Fenton's type reactions or of the reaction with atmospheric O(2), VCs may also generate reactive oxygen species, thereby introducing oxidative stress with consequences presently not well evaluated, particularly for long-term administration of vanadium to humans.

This strain was evaluated for altered growth rate and macrophage survival using a cell model of infection. In addition, the comparative analysis was conducted to determine the association between Rv3737 mRNA expression and disease severity in active pulmonary TB patients. RESULTS: The H37RvRv3737 strain exhibited significantly slow growth rate compared to H37Rv-WT strain in standard culture medium. Additionally, the survival rate of H37Rv-WT strain in macrophages was 2 folds higher than that of H37RvRv3737 at 72 h. A significantly higher level of TNF- and IL-6 mRNA expression was observed in macrophages infected with H37RvRv3737 as compared to H37Rv-WT. Of note, Rv3737 expression was significantly increased in clinical Mtb isolates than H37Rv-WT.

A 'cytokine storm';, which is a phenomenon associated with uncontrolled production of large amounts of cytokines, very often affects patients with COVID-19. Elevated activity of chemotactic cytokines, called chemokines, can lead to serious consequences. CXCL10 has an ability to activate its receptor CXCR3, predominantly expressed on macrophages, T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and B cells. So, it has been suggested that the chemokine CXCL10, through CXCR3, is associated with inflammatory diseases and may be involved in the development of COVID-19. Therefore, in this review paper, we focus on the role of CXCL10 overactivity in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. We performed an extensive literature search for our investigation using the MEDLINE/PubMed database. Increased concentrations of CXCL10 were observed in COVID-19. Elevated levels of CXCL10 were reported to be associated with a severe course and disease progression. Published studies revealed that CXCL10 may be a very good predictive biomarker of patient outcome in COVID-19, and that markedly elevated CXCL10 levels are connected with ARDS and neurological complications. It has been observed that an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 leads to inhibition of 'cytokine storm';, as well as reduction of CXCL10 concentrations. It seems that modulation of the CXCL10CCXCR3 axis may be an effective therapeutic target of COVID-19.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks have become mandatory in many situations. Acoustic attenuation of sound pressure by the mask tissue reduces speech perception ability, especially in noisy situations. Masks also can impede the process of speech comprehension by concealing the movements of the mouth, interfering with lip reading. In this prospective observational, cross-sectional study including 17 participants with normal hearing, we measured the influence of acoustic attenuation caused by medical face masks (mouth and nose protection) according to EN 14683 and of N95 masks according to EN 1149 (EN 14683) on the speech recognition threshold and listening effort in various types of background noise. Averaged over all noise signals, a surgical mask significantly reduced the speech perception threshold in noise was by 1.6 dB (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0, 2.1) and an N95 mask reduced it significantly by 2.7 dB (95% CI, 2.2, 3.2). Use of a surgical mask did not significantly increase the 50% listening effort signal-to-noise ratio (increase of 0.58 dB; 95% CI, 0.4, 1.5), but use of an N95 mask did so significantly, by 2.2 dB (95% CI, 1.2, 3.1). In acoustic measures, mask tissue reduced amplitudes by up to 8 dB at frequencies above 1 kHz, whereas no reduction was observed below 1 kHz.

The objective was to report the postoperative mortality after elective digestive resections in a nationwide cohort during the lockdown period. METHODS: This analytic study was performed using a national billing database (the Programme de Mdicalisation des Systmes d'Informations). Patients who underwent elective digestive resections were divided in 2 groups: the lockdown group defined by hospital admissions between March 17 and May 11, 2020; and the control group, defined by hospital admissions during the corresponding period in 2019. Groups were matched on propensity score, geographical region, and surgical procedure. The primary outcome was the postoperative mortality. RESULTS: The overall population included 15,217 patients: 9,325 patients in the control group and 5,892 in the lockdown group. The overall surgical activity was decreased by 37% during the lockdown period. The overall in-hospital mortality during the hospital stay was 2.7%. After matching and adjustment, no difference in mortality between groups was reported (OR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.83-1.34; P = .669). An asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was a risk factor for a 2-fold increased mortality, whereas a symptomatic COVID-19 infection was associated with a 10-fold increased mortality. CONCLUSION: Despite a considerable reduction in the surgical activity for elective digestive resections during the lockdown period, mortality remained stable on a nationwide scale in COVID-free patients. These findings support that systematic COVID-19 screening should be advocated before elective gastrointestinal surgery and that all efforts should be made to maintain elective surgical resection for cancer during the second wave in COVID-free patients.","output":"Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown on in-hospital mortality and surgical activity in elective digestive resections: A nationwide cohort analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the COVID-19 disease caused by the respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has resulted in unpredicted measures restricting daily flights.

Unlike the original model, we now also account for the different dynamics seen in the different organs. The new model also incorporates the central impact of blood flow on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Each new improvement is clear upon visual inspection, and they are also supported by statistical tests. The final multi-level model describes >300 data points in >40 time-series and dose-response curves, resulting from a large variety of perturbations, describing both intra-cellular processes, organ fluxes, and whole-body meal responses. We hope that this model will serve as an improved basis for future data integration, useful for research and drug developments within diabetes.","output":"An Updated Organ-Based Multi-Level Model for Glucose Homeostasis: Organ Distributions, Timing, and Impact of Blood Flow"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to the effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), most malaria-endemic countries resort to free distributions in the population with particular attention to pregnant women, a more vulnerable group. However, the mere issuance of ITNs does not usually translate to proper utilization. This study aimed to examine the utilization of ITNs and its associated factors among pregnant women in Myanmar. METHODS: The data analyzed in this cross-sectional study were extracted from available survey datasets of the 2015C16 Myanmar Demographic Health Survey. The secondary data were presented using a chart, descriptive statistics and inferential statistics including simple and multiple logistic regression models. All analyses were performed using STATA, Version 15. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of 466 currently pregnant women, the majority (96%) possessed bed nets for sleeping. Among them, 15.9% slept without a bed net the night before the survey, while 65.7% slept with untreated nets. Only about 1 in 5 (18.4%) slept under ITNs. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, pregnant women residing in delta and lowland regions [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 7.70, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.62, 16.38], plains (aOR = 7.09, 95%CI: 3.09, 16.25) or hilly areas (aOR = 4.26, 95%CI: 1.91, 9.52) were more likely to report non-utilization of ITNs than those residing in coastal regions. CONCLUSION: Relatively poor ITN utilization was observed among pregnant women in Myanmar. Health promotion activities for ITN utilization should be implemented especially for pregnant women residing in the delta, lowland, plain and hilly regions. Other social-behavioral factors including perceived susceptibility to malaria, knowledge of ITNs, and attitude towards ITN that might favor the non-utilization of ITNs need to be further explored.","output":"Utilization of insecticide-treated bed nets among pregnant women in MyanmarCanalysis of the 2015C2016 Demographic and Health Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human Parainfluenzaviruses (PIVs) account for a significant proportion of viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in children, and are also associated with morbidity and mortality in adults, including nosocomial infections. This work aims to describe PIV genotypes and their clinical and epidemiological distribution. Between December 2016 and December 2017, 6121 samples were collected, and submitted to viral culture and genomic quantification, specifically Parainfluenza 1C4 (PIV1C4), Influenza A and B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) A and B, Adenovirus, Metapneumovirus, Coronavirus, Rhinovirus, and Enterovirus. Normalized viral load, as (log10) copies/10(3) cells, was calculated as virus Ct, determined by multiple qRT-PCR, as a function of the Ct of -globin. PIV was confirmed in 268 cases (4.37%), and linked to both upper and lower respiratory tract disease, being more frequent in children than in adults (5.23 and 2.43%, respectively). PIV1 and PIV3 were most common (31 and 32.5%, of total PIV positive samples, respectively), with distribution being similar in children and adults, as was viral load. PIV type was correlated with seasonality: PIV3 being more frequent in winter and spring, PIV1 in summer, and PIV 4 in fall. No correlation between vial load and clinical severity was found. Novel findings were that PIV viral load was higher in fall than in other seasons, and PIV4, classically linked to mild respiratory symptoms, was circulating, in children and adults, at all levels of symptoms throughout the year.","output":"New clinical and seasonal evidence of infections by Human Parainfluenzavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious diseases kill millions of people each year, and they are the major public health problem in the world.

With the declaration of COVID-19 a global pandemic, and later the appearance of first confirmed cases in Yemen, there is an urgent need to assess the preparedness of healthcare facilities (HCFs) and their capacities to tackle a looming COVID-19 outbreak. Herein, we present an assessment of the current state of preparedness and capabilities of HCFs in Yemen to prevent and manage the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: An online survey for HCFs was developed, validated, and distributed. The questionnaire is divided into five main sections: (1) Demographic variables for participants. (2) HCFs capabilities for COVID-19 outbreak. (3) Support received to face the emergence and spread of COVID-19. (4). Current practices of infection prevention and control measures in the HCFs. The last section focused on the recommendations to ensure effective and timely response to this outbreak in Yemen. Descriptive analysis was used to analyze data using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS), version 23. Results: Responses were received from healthcare workers (HCWs) from 18 out of 22 governorates in Yemen. Out of the 296 HCWs who participated in the study, the vast majority (93.9%) believed that the healthcare system in Yemen does not have the resources and capabilities to face and manage a COVID-19 outbreak. Approximately 82.4% of participants rated the general preparedness level of their HCFs as very poor or poor. More specifically, the majority of HCWs rated their HCFs as very poor or poor in term of availability of the following: an adequate number of mechanical ventilators (88.8%), diagnostic devices (88.2%), ICU rooms and beds (81.4%), and isolation rooms (79.7%). Conclusions: The healthcare facilities in Yemen are unprepared and lack the most basic resources and capabilities to cope with or tackle a COVID-19 outbreak. With the current state of a fragile healthcare system, a widespread outbreak of COVID-19 in Yemen could result in devastating consequences.

Yet, many still struggle to attain their weight loss goals in such programmes. Little is understood about the factors which impact success in these programmes. Synthesising this data will allow for theory to be developed on how to improve success in such programmes. The main aim of this review will be to extract and synthesise the barriers and facilitators of successful weight loss during participation of behavioural weight loss programmes in adults living with overweight and obesity. METHODS A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library and CINAHL will be performed from inception onwards. Studies will also be sought by contacting experts in the field, reference and website searching. Studies will be eligible if the participants are adults living with obesity (population) undertaking or recently completed behavioural weight loss programmes (intervention) with the primary focus of weight loss (outcome). The primary outcomes will be amount of weight lost and information on barriers and/or facilitators to success. The secondary outcomes will be reasons or factors related to attrition and adherence and behaviour change techniques used in programmes. Two reviewers will screen citations and full-text data. Reviewer 1 will screen all, and reviewer 2 will screen a random 50% of articles. Data extraction will be completed by reviewer 1, and 10% will be checked by the research team. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion. Data will be synthesised and described narratively to show the characteristics of each study, levels of success and barriers and facilitators during programme participation. A thematic approach will be taken, and themes will be coded against the levels of the socioecological model. Quantitative data will be extracted and categorised according to these themes and presented alongside the qualitative data. DISCUSSION Our findings can be used to inform how weight loss programmes can be improved to facilitate success in those at risk of failure. Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The aim of this study was to examine how personality traits were associated with adjustment to the COVID pandemic in college students. The sample included 484 first-year university students (76% female) attending a northeastern university who completed the Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality assessment at the beginning of a semester that was disrupted by the COVID pandemic. Using a phone-based app, students completed daily ratings of mood, perceived stress levels, and engagement in a number of health promotion activities (exercise, mindfulness, adequate sleep, etc.) throughout the semester both before and after the onset of the pandemic (e.g., a within-person longitudinal design). Results, as expected, showed that mood and wellness indices generally declined during the COVID period, although stress levels actually decreased. Further, irrespective of COVID, improved mood, less perceived stress and greater participation in health promotion activities were significantly associated with a number of personality traits including neuroticism (lower), extraversion (higher), agreeableness (higher), and conscientiousness (higher). Of primary interest, mixed-effects models were used to test how major personality traits interacted with any changes in daily ratings from the pre-COVID to COVID period. Significant interactions terms were found suggesting differential impacts of the COVID epidemic for students with low versus high levels of particular traits. Higher levels of extraversion, for example, were found to be related to decreases in mood as the pandemic progressed in contrast to those with lower extraversion, for whom there was a slight increase in mood over time. These data support the conclusion that personality traits are related to mental health and can play a role in a persons ability to cope with major stressful events. Different traits may also be more adaptive to different types of stressors.","output":"Personality trait predictors of adjustment during the COVID pandemic among college students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel pathogenic coronaviruses - such as SARS-CoV and probably SARS-CoV-2 - arise by homologous recombination between co-infecting viruses in a single cell.

Lung injury/fibrosis was evaluated by observation of hydroxyproline concentrations, lung indexes, and histopathology on days 7, 14, and 30 postinoculation. RESULTS: H5N1-inoculated mice presented two stages of pulmonary disease over a 30-d period after infection. At acute stage, infected-mice showed typical diffuse pneumonia with inflammatory cellular infiltration, alveolar and interstitial edema and hemorrhage on day 7 postinoculation. At restoration stage, most infected-mice developed PF of different severities on day 30 postinoculation, and 18% of the survived mice underwent severe interstitial and intra-alveolar fibrosis with thickened alveolar walls, collapsed alveoli and large fibrotic areas. The dramatically elevated hydroxyproline levels in H5N1-infected mice showed deposition of collagen in lungs, and confirmed fibrosis of lungs. The dry lung-to-body weight ratio was significantly increased in infected group, which might be associated with the formation of PF in H5N1-infected mice.

Due to inequalities from residential segregation, Hispanic and Black populations have challenges in meeting health expectations. However, segregated neighborhoods also support the formation of social bonds that relate to healthy behaviors. We evaluate the question of non-White distancing using social mobility data from Google on three sites: workplaces, grocery stores, and recreational locations. Employing hierarchical linear modeling and geographically weighted regression, we find the relation of race/ethnicity to COVID-19 distancing is varied across the United States. The HLM models show that compared to Black populations, Hispanic populations overall more effectively distance from recreation sites and grocery stores: each point increase in percent Hispanic was related to residents being 0.092 percent less likely (p< 0.05) to visit recreational sites and 0.127 percent less likely (p< 0.01) to visit grocery stores since the onset of COVID-19. However, the GWR models show there are places where the percent Black is locally related to recreation distancing while percent Hispanic is not. Further, these models show the association of percent Black to recreation and grocery distancing can be locally as strong as 1.057 percent (p< 0.05) and 0.989 percent (p< 0.05), respectively.

Single-cell transcriptional profiling of human AEC2s from fibrotic lungs revealed a hypoxic subpopulation with activated Notch, suppressed surfactant protein C (SPC), and transdifferentiation toward a Krt5(pos) basal-like state. Activated murine Krt5(pos) LNEPs and diseased human AEC2s upregulate strikingly similar core pathways underlying migration and squamous metaplasia. While robust, HIF1-driven metaplasia is ultimately inferior to AEC2 reconstitution in restoring normal lung function. HIF1 deletion or enhanced Wnt/-catenin activity in Sox2(pos) LNEPs blocks Notch and Krt5 activation, instead promoting rapid AEC2 differentiation and migration and improving the quality of alveolar repair.

In the recent decade, nanotechnological research has made a gigantic shift in order to include the natural resources to produce biogenic NPs. Within this approach, researchers have utilized marine resources such as macroalgae and microalgae, land plants, bacteria, fungi, yeast, actinomycetes, and viruses to synthesize NPs. Marine macroalgae (brown, red, and green) are rich in polysaccharides including alginates, fucose-containing sulfated polysaccharides (FCSPs), galactans, agars or carrageenans, semicrystalline cellulose, ulvans, and hemicelluloses. Phytochemicals are abundant in phenols, tannins, alkaloids, terpenoids, and vitamins. However, microorganisms have an abundance of active compounds ranging from sugar molecules, enzymes, canonical membrane proteins, reductase enzymes (NADH and NADPH), membrane proteins to many more. The prime reason for using the aforesaid entities in the metallic NPs synthesis is based on their intrinsic properties to act as bioreductants, having the capability to reduce and cap the metal ions into stabilized NPs. Several green NPs have been verified for their biocompatibility in human cells. Bioactive constituents from the above resources have been found on the green metallic NPs, which has demonstrated their efficacies as prospective antibiotics and anti-cancer agents against a range of human pathogens and cancer cells. Moreover, these NPs can be characterized for the size, shapes, functional groups, surface properties, porosity, hydrodynamic stability, and surface charge using different characterization techniques. The novelty and originality of this review is that we provide recent research compilations on green synthesis of NPs by marine macroalgae and other biological sources (plant, bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, yeast, and virus). Besides, we elaborated on the detailed intra- and extracellular mechanisms of NPs synthesis by marine macroalgae. The application of green NPs as anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, and popular methods of NPs characterization techniques has also been critically reviewed.","output":"Marine Macroalgae Display Bioreductant Efficacy for Fabricating Metallic Nanoparticles: Intra/Extracellular Mechanism and Potential Biomedical Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An autopsy of a patient in Japan with coronavirus disease indicated pneumonia lung pathology, manifested as diffuse alveolar damage.

However, why CoVs have chosen the IC as their intracellular site of assembly and how progeny viruses are delivered from this compartment to the extracellular space has remained unclear. Here we address these enigmatic late events of the CoV life cycle in light of recently described properties of the IC. Of particular interest are the emerging spatial and functional connections between IC elements and recycling endosomes (REs), defined by the GTPases Rab1 and Rab11, respectively. The establishment of IC-RE links at the cell periphery, around the centrosome and evidently also at the noncompact zones of the Golgi ribbon indicates that-besides traditional ER-Golgi communication-the IC also promotes a secretory process that bypasses the Golgi stacks, but involves its direct connection with the endocytic recycling system. The initial confinement of CoVs to the lumen of IC-derived large transport carriers and their preferential absence from Golgi stacks is consistent with the idea that they exit cells following such an unconventional route. In fact, CoVs may share this pathway with other intracellularly budding viruses, lipoproteins, procollagen, and/or protein aggregates experimentally introduced into the IC lumen.","output":"Assembly and Cellular Exit of Coronaviruses: Hijacking an Unconventional Secretory Pathway from the Pre-Golgi Intermediate Compartment via the Golgi Ribbon to the Extracellular Space"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background A pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the globe Although many articles have established the clinical characteristics of adult COVID-19 patients so far, limited data are available for children The aim of this study was to reveal the clinical features, laboratory findings and nucleic acid test results of ten pediatric cases Material and methods In this retrospective single-center cohort study, pediatric cases with COVID-19 infection were consecutively enrolled in one hospital in Huangshi, China from January 1 to March 11, 2020 Results A total of 10 children with COVID-19 were recruited Of them, four were the asymptomatic type, one was the mild type, and five were the moderate type (including two subclinical ones) All patients were from family clusters Only fever, nasal discharge and nasal congestion were observed Lymphopenia and leukopenia were uncommon in our sample but elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (-HBDH) were observed frequently Of these laboratory test variables, no statistical difference was identified between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients Abnormalities in radiological data were detected in five patients, and representative findings of chest CT images were patchy shadows and ground-glass opacities There were two cases whose oropharyngeal nucleic acid tests reversed to positive after one negative result, and two patients whose oropharyngeal swabs tested negative but rectal swabs showed positive Conclusions Clinical symptoms were mild in children with COVID-19 Increased levels of LDH and -HBDH were potential clinical biomarkers for pediatric cases More attention should be paid to the SARS-CoV-2 viral assessment of rectal swabs before patients are discharged","output":"Clinical features, laboratory findings and persistence of virus in 10 children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of very diverse viruses that cause a broad spectrum of diseases from mild to severe enteric, respiratory, systemic diseases, and common cold or pneumonia among humans and animals.

In December 2019, researchers identified a novel coronavirus type, called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), which was associated with symptoms of high fever, dry cough, headache, diarrhea, and reduction of White Blood Cells (WBC). Coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease was named Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). No proven treatment has been discovered for COVID-19 so far, but researchers are trying to find the best effective way to treat this disease. Therefore, therapeutic strategies that facilitate the recovery of COVID-19 patients and reduce life-threatening complications are urgently needed now. Today, Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) and their secretion are utilized as one of the most applied tools to treat various diseases such as inflammation and cancer. MSC-derived vesicles are rich in various growth factors, cytokines, and interleukins that are produced and secreted under different physiological or pathological conditions. These vesicles were considered a suitable and effective tool in regeneration medicine because of their high power in repairing damaged tissues and modulating immune responses. Recently, evidence has shown MSC-derived vesicles through reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines could improve damaged tissues in COVID-19 patients. In addition to MSCs and MSC-derived exosomes, Natural Killer (NK) cells, T cells, and platelet lysates were used against viral infection.

These symptoms are also known as a behavioral risk marker in predicting pediatric mood disorders. The underlying neural mechanism of emotional dysregulation, however, remains unclear. This study used the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique to identify anatomically specific variation in white-matter microstructure that is associated with pediatric emotional dysregulation severity. Thirty-two children (mean age 9.53 years) with varying levels of emotional dysregulation symptoms were recruited by the Massachusetts General Hospital and underwent the DTI scans at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Emotional dysregulation severity was measured by the empirically-derived Child Behavior Checklist Emotional Dysregulation Profile that includes the Attention, Aggression, and Anxiety/Depression subscales. Whole-brain voxel-wise regression tests revealed significantly increased radial diffusivity (RD) and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the cingulum-callosal regions linked to greater emotional dysregulation in the children. The results suggest that microstructural differences in cingulum-callosal white-matter pathways may manifest as a neurodevelopmental vulnerability for pediatric mood disorders as implicated in the clinical phenotype of pediatric emotional dysregulation.

Simulator training sessions were carried out in 11 centers in France. A questionnaire assessing the simulator was administered at the end of the sessions. The study population included both healthcare workers (HCW) and volunteers from the general population. Results. Out of 589 participants, overall satisfaction was scored 9.0 [8.9-9.1] on a scale of 0 to 10 with excellent results in the 16 evaluation items of each category (HCWs and general population, NPS novices and experienced). The simulator was considered very realistic (95%), easy to use (97%), useful to understand the anatomy (89%) and NPS sampling technique (93%). This educational tool was considered essential (93%). Participants felt their future NPS would be more reliable (72%), less painful (70%), easier to perform (88%) and that they would be carried out more serenely (90%). The mean number of NPS conducted on the simulator to feel at ease was two; technical fluency with the simulator can thus be acquired quickly. Conclusion.

Therefore, the development of a non-invasive and real-time method which can measure muscle tension capabilities in immobile patients is highly anticipated. Our aim was to introduce and evaluate a special ultrasound measurement technique to estimate a maximal muscle tension characteristic which can be used in medicine and also in sports diagnostics.

Vampire bats are the primary reservoir of rabies in Latin America, where the disease remains among the most important viral zoonoses affecting humans and livestock. Unpredictable spatiotemporal dynamics of rabies within bat populations have precluded anticipation of outbreaks and undermined widespread bat culling programs. By analysing 1146 vampire bat-transmitted rabies (VBR) outbreaks in livestock across 12 years in Peru, we demonstrate that viral expansions into historically uninfected zones have doubled the recent burden of VBR. Viral expansions are geographically widespread, but severely constrained by high elevation peaks in the Andes mountains. Within Andean valleys, invasions form wavefronts that are advancing towards large, unvaccinated livestock populations that are heavily bitten by bats, which together will fuel high transmission and mortality. Using spatial models, we forecast the pathways of ongoing VBR epizootics across heterogeneous landscapes. These results directly inform vaccination strategies to mitigate impending viral emergence, reveal VBR as an emerging rather than an enzootic disease and create opportunities to test novel interventions to manage viruses in bat reservoirs.","output":"Spatial expansions and travelling waves of rabies in vampire bats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a potentially life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome that occurs after primary SARS-CoV-2 infection. The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains undefined, and whether specific inflammatory biomarker patterns can distinguish MIS-C from other hyperinflammatory syndromes, including Kawasaki disease and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), is unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether inflammatory biomarkers could be used to distinguish between these conditions. METHODS: We studied a prospective cohort of patients with MIS-C and Kawasaki disease and an established cohort of patients with new-onset systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and MAS associated with systemic JIA (JIA-MAS), diagnosed according to established guidelines. The study was done at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (Cincinnati, OH, USA). Clinical and laboratory features as well as S100A8/A9, S100A12, interleukin (IL)-18, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9), and IL-6 concentrations were assessed by ELISA and compared using parametric and non-parametric tests and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. FINDINGS: Between April 30, 2019, and Dec 14, 2020, we enrolled 19 patients with MIS-C (median age 90 years [IQR 45C150]; eight [42%] girls and 11 [58%] boys) and nine patients with Kawasaki disease (median age 20 years [20C40]); seven [78%] girls and two [22%] boys). Patients with MIS-C and Kawasaki disease had similar S100 proteins and IL-18 concentrations but patients with MIS-C were distinguished by significantly higher median concentrations of the IFN-induced CXCL9 (1730 pg/mL [IQR 604C6300] vs 278 pg/mL [54C477]; p=0038). Stratifying patients with MIS-C by CXCL9 concentrations (high vs low) revealed differential severity of clinical and laboratory presentation. Compared with patients with MIS-C and low CXCL9 concentrations, more patients with high CXCL9 concentrations had acute kidney injury (six [60%] of ten vs none [0%] of five), altered mental status (four [40%] of ten vs none [0%] of five), shock (nine [90%] of ten vs two [40%] of five), and myocardial dysfunction (five [50%] of ten vs one [20%] of five); these patients also had higher concentrations of systemic inflammatory markers and increased severity of cytopenia and coagulopathy. By contrast, patients with MIS-C and low CXCL9 concentrations resembled patients with Kawasaki disease, including the frequency of coronary involvement. Elevated concentrations of S100A8/A9, S100A12, and IL-18 were also useful in distinguishing systemic JIA from Kawasaki disease with high sensitivity and specificity. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show MIS-C is distinguishable from Kawasaki disease primarily by elevated CXCL9 concentrations. The stratification of patients with MIS-C by high or low CXCL9 concentrations provides support for MAS-like pathophysiology in patients with severe MIS-C, suggesting new approaches for diagnosis and management.

This study was setup to investigate the Omicron RBDs interaction with ACE2 (host receptor) and a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb). MethodsIn-silico mutagenesis was used to generate the Om-RBD in complex with ACE2 or mAb from the wildtype. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories were analyzed for interaction. ResultsMD trajectories showed that Omicron RBD has evolved into an efficient ACE2 binder, via pi-pi (Om-RBD-Y501/ACE2-Y41) and salt-bridge (Om-RBD-K493/ACE2-Y41) interactions. Conversely, in binding mAb, it has become less efficient (Center of mass distance of RBD from mAb complex, wildtype {approx} 30 [A], Omicron {approx} 41 [A]). Disruption of Om-RBD/mAb complex resulted from loose interaction between Om-RBD and the light chain complementarity-determining region residues.

To our knowledge, there are no studies exploring experiences after second-degree tear. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the experiences of a second-degree vaginal tear regarding aspects of the recovery and need for healthcare and rehabilitation. METHODS: Individual semi-structured interviews were performed and analysed with a qualitative, inductive descriptive approach. RESULTS: A group of 18 women with a second-degree vaginal tear after delivery were included. Four main categories with associated subcategories were found: (1) feeling uncertainty, with subcategories: not knowing what is normal, concern, confusion and uncertainty regarding pelvic floor muscle training; (2) feeling of security, with subcategories: I have no/I can handle the symptoms, trust in the healthcare system and I have sufficient knowledge; (3) not prioritizing myself, with the subcategories: I cannot find time and others have bigger problems; (4) lack of trust in healthcare providers, with the subcategories: feeling forgotten, not being taken seriously, distrust of the competence of the healthcare providers and resignation. CONCLUSION: Women who suffer from a second-degree vaginal tear after pregnancy can feel safe when needs are met but uncertainty is also common when available healthcare and information are perceived as insufficient. The women also feel uncertainty about what is normal after the tear and how to perform pelvic floor exercises.

Artificial intelligence-based forecasting models play an important role in the forecasting of medical equipment demand during infectious disease periods. In this study, a deep model approach is presented, which is based on a multilayer long short-term memory network for forecasting of medical equipment demand and outbreak spreading, during the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19). The proposed model consists of stages: normalization, deep LSTM networks and dropout-dense-regression layers, in order of process. Firstly, the daily input data were subjected to a normalization process. Afterward, the multilayer LSTM network model, which was a deep learning approach, was created and then fed into a dropout layer and a fully connected layer. Finally, the weights of the trained model were used to predict medical equipment demand and outbreak spreading in the following days. In experimental studies, 77-day COVID-19 data collected from the statistics data put together in Turkey were used. In order to test the proposed system, the data belonging to last 9 days of this data set were used and the performance of the proposed system was calculated using statistical algorithms, MAPE and R 2.

By utilizing a SARS-CoV-2 microarray with 21 proteins and 197 peptides that fully cover the spike protein, antibody response profiles of 59 serum samples collected from 32 volunteers immunized with the inactivated virus vaccine BBIBP-CorV were generated. For this set of samples, the microarray results correlated with the neutralization titers of the authentic virus, and two peptides (S1-5 and S2-22) were identified as potential biomarkers for assessing the effectiveness of vaccination. Moreover, by comparing immunized volunteers to convalescent and hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the N protein, NSP7, and S2-78 were identified as potential biomarkers for differentiating COVID-19 patients from individuals vaccinated with the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

The most effective anti-inflammatory drugs employed so far in severe COVID-19 belong to the cytokine-directed biological agents, widely used in the management of many autoimmune diseases. In this paper we analyze the efficacy of epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant ingredient in green tea leaves and a well-known antioxidant, in counteracting autoimmune diseases, which are dominated by a massive cytokines production. Indeed, many studies registered that EGCG inhibits signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1/3 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) transcription factors, whose activities are crucial in a multiplicity of downstream pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Importantly, the safety of EGCG/green tea extract supplementation is well documented in many clinical trials, as discussed in this review. Since EGCG can restore the natural immunological homeostasis in many different autoimmune diseases, we propose here a supplementation therapy with EGCG in COVID-19 patients. Besides some antiviral and anti-sepsis actions, the major EGCG benefits lie in its anti-fibrotic effect and in the ability to simultaneously downregulate expression and signaling of many inflammatory mediators. In conclusion, EGCG can be considered a potential safe natural supplement to counteract hyper-inflammation growing in COVID-19.","output":"Protective Effect of Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (EGCG) in Diseases with Uncontrolled Immune Activation: Could Such a Scenario Be Helpful to Counteract COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding a visualization is a multi-level process.

However, frequent use of nanomaterials remains challenging due to specific limitations like non-targeted distribution causing low signal-to-noise ratio for diagnostics, complex fabrication, reduced-biocompatibility, decreased photostability, and systemic toxicity of nanomaterials within the body. Thus, better nanomaterial-systems with controlled physicochemical and biological properties, form the need of the hour. In this context, smart nanomaterials serve as promising solution, as they can be activated under specific exogenous or endogenous stimuli such as pH, temperature, enzymes, or a particular biological molecule. The properties of smart nanomaterials make them ideal candidates for various applications like biosensors, controlled drug release, and treatment of various diseases. Recently, smart nanomaterial-based cancer theranostic approaches have been developed, and they are displaying better selectivity and sensitivity with reduced side-effects in comparison to conventional methods. In cancer therapy, the smart nanomaterials-system only activates in response to tumor microenvironment (TME) and remains in deactivated state in normal cells, which further reduces the side-effects and systemic toxicities.

Patients with underlying comorbidities have a high risk of contracting COVID-19. Therefore, serological assays are urgently needed to diagnose asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2, to estimate the prevalence of infection, and for disease prevention and control. This study aimed to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in humans. METHODS: An ELISA test was designed and established to detect antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples from 41 quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) - positive hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Forty-two convalescent patients' sera served as positive controls, while 117 pre-pandemic serum samples were used as negative controls. RESULTS: A comparison between different SARS-CoV-2 proteins was performed, which included the full-length spike (S) protein and the S1 and S2 subunits. The full-length S protein showed the strongest reactivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in patients' serum samples. Additionally, since antibodies could be detected at very low concentrations, the assay was found to be sensitive. CONCLUSION: The current assay was specific, since cross-reactions with other SARS coronaviruses and respiratory viruses such as influenza were not found. Additionally, it was highly sensitive, since the test was able to identify antibodies even at very low concentrations. Therefore, this assay has promise as a screening method at the population level and may be used for in future seroepidemiological studies.","output":"A serological assay to detect human SARS-CoV-2 antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wide applications of cannabidiol (CBD) in the food and pharmaceutical industries are limited due to its low bioavailability, sensitivity to environmental pressures and low water solubility.

It is of crucial importance to model an integrated/combined package of non-pharmaceutical (physical/social distancing) and pharmaceutical (immunization) public health control measures. Methods: A modified epidemiological, compartmental SIR model was utilized and fit to the cumulative COVID-19 case data for the province of Ontario, Canada, from September 8, 2020 to December 8, 2020. Different vaccine roll-out strategies were simulated until 75 percent of the population is vaccinated, including a no-vaccination scenario. We compete these vaccination strategies with relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Non-pharmaceutical interventions were supposed to remain enforced and began to be relaxed on either January 31, March 31, or May 1, 2021. Results: Based on projections from the data and long-term extrapolation of scenarios, relaxing the public health measures implemented by re-opening too early would cause any benefits of vaccination to be lost by increasing case numbers, increasing the effective reproduction number above 1 and thus increasing the risk of localized outbreaks. If relaxation is, instead, delayed and 75 percent of the Ontarian population gets vaccinated by the end of the year, re-opening can occur with very little risk. Interpretation: Relaxing non-pharmaceutical interventions by re-opening and vaccine deployment is a careful balancing act. Our combination of model projections from data and simulation of different strategies and scenarios, can equip local public health decision- and policy-makers with projections concerning the COVID-19 epidemiological trend, helping them in the decision-making process.","output":"Integrated Vaccination and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions based Strategies in Ontario, Canada, as a Case Study: a Mathematical Modeling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aging influences an organisms entire physiology, affecting functions at the molecular, cellular, and systemic levels and increasing susceptibility to many major chronic diseases. The changes in the immune system that accompany human aging are very complex and are generally referred to as immunosenescence. The factors and mechanisms of immunosenescence are multiple and include, among others, defects in the bone marrow, thymic involution, and intrinsic defects in the formation, maturation, homeostasis, and migration of peripheral lymphocytes. Aging affects both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The process of aging is commonly accompanied by low-grade inflammation thought to contribute to neuroinflammation and to many age-related diseases. Numerous attempts to define the role of chronic inflammation in aging have implicated chronic oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, immunosenescence, epigenetic modifications, and other phenomena. Several lifestyle strategies, such as intervening to provide an adequate diet and physical and mental activity, have been shown to result in improved immune and neuroprotective functions, a decrease in oxidative stress and inflammation, and a potential increase in individual longevity. The studies published thus far describe a critical role for nutrition in maintaining the immune response of the aged, but they also indicate the need for a more in-depth, holistic approach to determining the optimal nutritional and behavioral strategies that would maintain immune and other physiological systems in elderly people. In this chapter, we focus first on the age-related changes of the immune system. Further, we discuss possible deleterious influences of immunosenescence and low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) on neurodegenerative processes in the normally aging brain.

She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and chest radiography revealed moderate patchy bilateral airspace opacities. Serology markers for cytokine storm were significantly elevated with a serum D-dimer level of 8180 ng/mL (normal <230 ng/mL). Computer tomography (CT) of the chest with IV contrast was positive for bilateral ground glass opacities, scattered filling defects within the bilateral segmental and sub segmental pulmonary arteries, and a large thrombus was present at the aortic arch. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and successfully treated with unfractionated heparin, alteplase 50 mg, and argatroban 2 mcg/kg/min.

An alternative strategy that has been tentatively proposed is to shield the elderly and others at high risk of severe disease, while allowing immunity to build up in those at low risk until the entire population is protected. We examine the performance required from a classifier that uses information from medical records to assign risk status for a such a stratify-and-shield policy to be effective in limiting mortality when social distancing is relaxed. We show that under plausible assumptions about the level of immunity required for population-level immunity, the proportion shielded is constrained to be no more than 15% of the population. Under varying assumptions about the infection fatality ratio (from 0.1% to 0.4%) and the performance of the classifier (3 to 4.5 bits of information for discrimination), we calculate the expected number of deaths in the unshielded group. We show that with likely values of the performance of a classifier that uses information from age, sex and medical records, at least 80% of those who would die if unshielded would be allocated to the high-risk shielded group comprising 15% of the population. Although the proportion of deaths that would be prevented by effective shielding does not vary much with the infection fatality ratio, the absolute number of deaths in the unshielded varies from less than 10,000 if the infection fatality rate is 0.1% to more than 50,000 if the infection fatality rate is as high as 0.4%. For projecting the effect of an optimally applied stratify-and-shield policy, studies now under way should help to resolve key uncertainties: the extent to which infection confers immunity, the prevalence of immunity, the infection fatality ratio, and the performance of a classifier constructed using information from medical records. It is time to give serious consideration to a stratify-and-shield policy that could bring the COVID-19 epidemic to an end in a matter of months while restoring economic activity, avoiding overload of critical care services and limiting mortality.","output":"Evaluation of \\"stratify and shield\\" as a policy option for ending the COVID-19 lockdown in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A second epidemic has appeared among some patients infected with COVID-19 persistent disorders, commonly called \\"long COVID syndrome.\\" Our study sought to identify the proportion of French GPs dealing with patients with potential long COVID syndrome and their symptoms in an online cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey among a representative national panel of GPs.

In addition, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China have the potential to provide evidence to support other metropolitan areas and large cities outside China with emerging cases. We used data reported from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020, to fit a model of infection, estimate the likely number of infections in four high-risk metropolitan areas based on the number of cases reported, and increase the understanding of the COVID-19 spread pattern. Considering the effect of the official quarantine regulations and travel restrictions for China, which began January 23~24, 2020, we used the daily travel intensity index from the Baidu Maps app to roughly simulate the level of restrictions and estimate the proportion of the quarantined population. A group of SEIR model statistical parameters were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and fitting on the basis of reported data. As a result, we estimated that the basic reproductive number, R0, was 2.91 in Beijing, 2.78 in Shanghai, 2.02 in Guangzhou, and 1.75 in Shenzhen based on the data from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020. In addition, we inferred the prediction results and compared the results of different levels of parameters. For example, in Beijing, the predicted peak number of cases was approximately 466 with a peak time of February 29, 2020; however, if the city were to implement different levels (strict, mild, or weak) of travel restrictions or regulation measures, the estimation results showed that the transmission dynamics would change and that the peak number of cases would differ by between 56% and ~159%. We concluded that public health interventions would reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and that more rigorous control and prevention measures would effectively contain its further spread but that the risk will increase when businesses and social activities return to normal before the end of the epidemic.

We aimed to examine gender differences of social harms from drinking as reported by drinkers. METHODS 2,200 young adults at age 30 with complete data on social harms from drinking were drawn from the 30-year follow-up of the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy. Measures included percentages of 11 past-year drinkers' self-reported social harms stratified by gender. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between gender and each social harm, accounting for relevant confounding. RESULTS More than one in five young adults (22%) reported at least one social harm in the past year. Among binge drinkers, 44% reported at least one social harm. After adjustments for social roles and binge drinking, we found no gender differences on several self-reported social harms: friendship problems, people criticizing drinking, non-marital family problems, employment problems, and alcohol-fuelled fights. However, men were more likely to report spousal threats to leave, drink-driving legal problems and financial problems. CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate that young adults are still vulnerable to risky drinking at age 30 and the social harm resulting from drinking. Thus, alcohol prevention campaigns should target this age group and include women in their focus. Strategies aiming to reduce alcohol-related harms, such as screening in clinical settings for risky drinking and alcohol-related harms, followed by motivational behavior interventions, could be beneficial among these vulnerable groups.","output":"Gender differences in social harms from drinking among young Australians: findings from the Mater University Study of Pregnancy and its Outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The Paediatric Asthma Team previously ran faceto- face group clinics and when the Covid-19 meant that outpatient appointments moved to telephone and we wanted to see if Video Group Clinics were more time efficient for the clinicians and provided positive learning opportunities to parents managing wheeze.

Over the last decade, however, powerful experimental approaches have emerged to characterize variant effects orders of magnitude faster than before. Fueled by improved DNA synthesis and sequencing and, more recently, by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, multiplex functional assays provide a means of generating variant effect data in wide-ranging experimental systems.

Recent studies identified several antiviral drugs that are effective against FIPV. Drug combination is one of the important strategies in the development of novel treatments for viral infections. GS-441524, a nucleoside analog, and itraconazole, a triazole antifungal drug, have been reported that have antiviral effect against FIPV. This study aims to investigate whether the combination of GS-441524 and itraconazole has synergic antiviral effect against FIPV. The antiviral effect was measured by plaque reduction assay using felis catus whole fatus-4 cell. The plaque reduction of GS-441524 against type I FIPVs increased as the concentration of itraconazole increased. The similar result was obtained for type II FIPV. In addition, the calculated combination index (CI) demonstrated that there was a strong synergy between GS-441524 and itraconazole. It is concluded that the combination of GS-441524 and itraconazole may enhance the individual effect of each drug against replication of type I FIPVs and may contribute to development more effective treatment strategy for FIP.","output":"In vitro antiviral effects of GS-441524 and itraconazole combination against feline infectious peritonitis virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many studies cited the importance of social factors as protective and risk factors for suicide.

We aimed to examine the impact of different scenarios of lockdown-accumulated backlog in cancer referrals on cancer survival, and the impact on survival per referred patient due to delayed referral versus risk of death from nosocomial infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. METHODS: In this modelling study, we used age-stratified and stage-stratified 10-year cancer survival estimates for patients in England, UK, for 20 common tumour types diagnosed in 2008-17 at age 30 years and older from Public Health England. We also used data for cancer diagnoses made via the 2-week-wait referral pathway in 2013-16 from the Cancer Waiting Times system from NHS Digital. We applied per-day hazard ratios (HRs) for cancer progression that we generated from observational studies of delay to treatment. We quantified the annual numbers of cancers at stage I-III diagnosed via the 2-week-wait pathway using 2-week-wait age-specific and stage-specific breakdowns. From these numbers, we estimated the aggregate number of lives and life-years lost in England for per-patient delays of 1-6 months in presentation, diagnosis, or cancer treatment, or a combination of these. We assessed three scenarios of a 3-month period of lockdown during which 25%, 50%, and 75% of the normal monthly volumes of symptomatic patients delayed their presentation until after lockdown. Using referral-to-diagnosis conversion rates and COVID-19 case-fatality rates, we also estimated the survival increment per patient referred. FINDINGS: Across England in 2013-16, an average of 6281 patients with stage I-III cancer were diagnosed via the 2-week-wait pathway per month, of whom 1691 (27%) would be predicted to die within 10 years from their disease. Delays in presentation via the 2-week-wait pathway over a 3-month lockdown period (with an average presentational delay of 2 months per patient) would result in 181 additional lives and 3316 life-years lost as a result of a backlog of referrals of 25%, 361 additional lives and 6632 life-years lost for a 50% backlog of referrals, and 542 additional lives and 9948 life-years lost for a 75% backlog in referrals. Compared with all diagnostics for the backlog being done in month 1 after lockdown, additional capacity across months 1-3 would result in 90 additional lives and 1662 live-years lost due to diagnostic delays for the 25% backlog scenario, 183 additional lives and 3362 life-years lost under the 50% backlog scenario, and 276 additional lives and 5075 life-years lost under the 75% backlog scenario. However, a delay in additional diagnostic capacity with provision spread across months 3-8 after lockdown would result in 401 additional lives and 7332 life-years lost due to diagnostic delays under the 25% backlog scenario, 811 additional lives and 14a873 life-years lost under the 50% backlog scenario, and 1231 additional lives and 22a635 life-years lost under the 75% backlog scenario. A 2-month delay in 2-week-wait investigatory referrals results in an estimated loss of between 00 and 07 life-years per referred patient, depending on age and tumour type. INTERPRETATION: Prompt provision of additional capacity to address the backlog of diagnostics will minimise deaths as a result of diagnostic delays that could add to those predicted due to expected presentational delays. Prioritisation of patient groups for whom delay would result in most life-years lost warrants consideration as an option for mitigating the aggregate burden of mortality in patients with cancer.

Clinical trials investigating the role of remdesivir in coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) reported conflicting results. This study aimed to systematically review the best available evidence and synthesize the results. Several electronic databases were searched for candidate studies up to 12 October 2020. Studies eligible for meta-analysis were selected based on the inclusion criteria. Primary outcomes are the recovery and mortality rates, while secondary outcomes are the safety profile of remdesivir. The main effective measures are the rate ratio (RR) and rate difference (RD). Four clinical trials and one observational study were included. Remdesivir treatment for 10 days increased the recovery rate on day 14 by 50% among severe Covid-19 patients (RR = 1.5, 95%CI = 1.33-1.7), while on day 28 it was increased by 14% among moderate and severe Covid-19 patients (RR = 1.14, 95%CI = 1.06-1.22). Additionally, remdesivir decreased the mortality rate on day 14 by 36% among all patients (RR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.45-0.92) but not on day 28 (RR = 1.05, 95%CI = 0.56-1.97). Nonmechanically ventilated Covid-19 patients showed better response to remdesivir in the recovery (RR = 0.3, 95%CI = 0.13-0.7) and mortality (RR = 2.33, 95%CI = 1.24-4.4) rates on day 14. Remdesivir reduced serious adverse effects by absolute 6% and no significant Grade 3 or 4 adverse effects were reported.

We conducted a rigorous qualitative study to identify relevant barriers and facilitators from the perspectives of both perinatal participants and treatment providers, We also present two case studies where BA was used and adapted to provide patient-centered care. METHODS: Within the ongoing SUMMIT non-inferiority randomized controlled trial in Canada and US, we interviewed a random selection of perinatal participants (n=23) and all treatment providers (n=28). A content analysis framework was developed to identify relevant barriers and facilitators and frequencies were calculated for each emergent theme within and across respondent groups. RESULTS: Key facilitators reported by participants receiving BA were that BA helped with support and social connection (73.9%), creative problem solving (26.1%) and attending to pandemic-related symptoms (21.7%). Key facilitators endorsed by providers to deliver BA were the use of telemedicine (35.7%) and loosening of government restrictions (21.4%). Both participant groups reported similar barriers to BA during the pandemic such as a lack of privacy and limited activities due to pandemic restrictions. However, providers were more likely to endorse pandemic-related life stressors as a barrier to treatment delivery compared to participants (64.3% vs. 34.8%). Both participant groups experienced explicit discussion of race and the racial justice movements during sessions as beneficial and reported harms of not doing so to the therapeutic alliance.

The survey took place in the beginning of 2021 in Germany, during which time pandemic-related restrictions and a soft lock-down were in place. Our final sample comprised 222 mostly empirically working doctoral researchers in an international and diverse science context of the wider Berlin area. Our results show that satisfaction with the PhD training and overall well-being decreased during the pandemic, as compared to the self-reported retrospective evaluations of these aspects before the onset of the pandemic. Additionally, more than a fifth of the sample was found to show clinically meaningful levels of depressive symptoms. Almost 25% experienced severe loneliness and the whole sample exhibited high levels of personal and work-related burnout. Finally, we explored predictors of the quantified levels of depression, anxiety, and burnout. The most prominent predictor for poor mental health was low satisfaction with PhD training, strongly suggesting a link between the doctoral work of ECRs and their mental health. Females vs. males as well as ECRs in individual PhD trainings vs. structured PhD programs reported higher symptoms of burnout. Taken together, our study replicates previous findings of poor mental health in ECRs and shows that problems related to PhD training increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The recent discovery of MERS-related coronaviruses (CoVs) in hedgehogs from Germany, France, the UK, China, and Italy suggests that hedgehogs may represent a wild reservoir of betacoronaviruses. This study reports the first detection and characterization of novel betacoronovirus, subgenus Merbecovirus in wild hedgehogs in Poland. The CoV RNA was detected in 10 out of 40 hedgehogs rectal swabs and in 1 out of 18 samples of the lung. No viral RNA was identified in the duodenum and kidney. There was no significant relationship between clinical status, gender, hedgehogs' age, and coronaviral RNA detection. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CoVs detected in our study grouped together with other representatives of Hedgehog coronavirus 1 species identified in Western Europe. Our findings provide further evidence that hedgehogs are a natural reservoir of Merbecovirus. Considering the high mutation rate of CoVs and their potential for crossing interspecies barriers, the proper management of hedgehogs admitted to wildlife rehabilitation centres is needed.

When a switch occurs, the optimal strategy is to delay the control action some amount of time and then apply the control at the maximum rate for the remainder of the outbreak. This result is in contrast with previous findings on the unconstrained problems of minimizing the total infectious burden over an outbreak, where the optimal strategy is to use the maximal control for the entire epidemic. Then, the critical consequence of our results is that, in a wide range of epidemiological circumstances, it may be impossible to minimize the total infectious burden while minimizing the epidemic duration, and vice versa. Moreover, numerical simulations highlighted additional unexpected results, showing that the optimal control can be delayed also when the control reproduction number is lower than one and that the switching time from no control to maximum control can even occur after the peak of infection has been reached.

It has been suggested that this is less pronounced for objective (ie, not subject to interpretation) outcome measures, including mortality. This may not apply in the intensive care unit (ICU), as most deaths are preceded by decisions to withhold or withdraw treatments. Lack of blinding of physicians in RCTs of ICU interventions may potentially influence the decision towards a higher threshold for discontinuing treatment in patients who receive the investigational treatment and/or a lower threshold for discontinuing treatment in patients who receive the comparator (control). This may have important implications for patients, caregivers, researchers and society. Accordingly, we aim to assess whether lack of blinding affects mortality effect estimates in RCTs of ICU interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review with meta-analyses and assess the effect of blinding versus no blinding on mortality effect estimates in RCTs of interventions used in adult ICU patients.We will systematically search the Cochrane Library for systematic reviews reporting mortality effect estimates of any intervention used in adult ICU patients which includes at least one RCT with 'low risk of bias' in the bias domains 'blinding of participants and personnel' and/or 'blinding of outcome assessment' and one RCT with 'unclear' or 'high risk of bias' in the same bias domain(s). For each intervention, we will compare summary mortality effect estimates in blinded versus unblinded trials.

Antibody levels and pseudo-neutralization of the ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein/human ACE-2 receptor interaction were analyzed with native, B.1.351, B.1.617.2 and P.1 variant spike proteins. Despite a lower response observed for the variant spike proteins, we report evidence of a sustained humoral response against native, B.1.351, B.1.617.2 and P.1 variant spike proteins among non-hospitalized Canadian adults. Furthermore, this response inhibited the interaction between the spike proteins from the different VOCs and ACE-2 receptor for  16 weeks post-diagnosis, except for individuals aged 18C49 years who showed no inhibition of the interaction between B.1.617.1 or B.1.617.2 spike and ACE-2. Interestingly, the affinity (K(D)) measured between the spike proteins (native, B.1.351, B.1.617.2 and P.1) and antibodies elicited in sera of infected and vaccinated (BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) individuals was invariant. Relative to sera from vaccine-na?ve (and previously infected) individuals, sera from vaccinated individuals had higher antibody levels (as measured with label-free SPR) and more efficiently inhibited the spikeCACE-2 interactions, even among individuals aged 18C49 years, showing the effectiveness of vaccination.","output":"Cross-reactivity of antibodies from non-hospitalized COVID-19 positive individuals against the native, B.1.351, B.1.617.2, and P.1 SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Carefully conducted, community-based, longitudinal studies are required to gain further understanding of the nature and timing of respiratory viruses causing infections in the population. However, such studies pose unique challenges for field specimen collection, including as we have observed the appearance of mould in some nasal swab specimens. We therefore investigated the impact of sample collection quality and the presence of visible mould in samples upon respiratory virus detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. METHODS: Anterior nasal swab samples were collected from infants participating in an ongoing community-based, longitudinal, dynamic birth cohort study. The samples were first collected from each infant shortly after birth and weekly thereafter. They were then mailed to the laboratory where they were catalogued, stored at -80C and later screened by PCR for 17 respiratory viruses. The quality of specimen collection was assessed by screening for human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using endogenous retrovirus 3 (ERV3). The impact of ERV3 load upon respiratory virus detection and the impact of visible mould observed in a subset of swabs reaching the laboratory upon both ERV3 loads and respiratory virus detection was determined. RESULTS: In total, 4933 nasal swabs were received in the laboratory. ERV3 load in nasal swabs was associated with respiratory virus detection. Reduced respiratory virus detection (odds ratio 0.35; 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.44) was observed in samples where the ERV3 could not be identified. Mould was associated with increased time of samples reaching the laboratory and reduced ERV3 loads and respiratory virus detection. CONCLUSION: Suboptimal sample collection and high levels of visible mould can impact negatively upon sample quality. Quality control measures, including monitoring human DNA loads using ERV3 as a marker for epithelial cell components in samples should be undertaken to optimize the validity of real-time PCR results for respiratory virus investigations in community-based studies.","output":"Nasal swab samples and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays in community-based, longitudinal studies of respiratory viruses: the importance of sample integrity and quality control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease-2019 is an emerging disease that threatens the world.

However, this does not consider demographic changes and temporal trends in mortality. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the excess mortality in 2020 in Italy considering demographic changes and temporal trends in mortality. METHODS: We used daily mortality and population data for the 2011-2019 period to estimate the expected deaths in 2020. Expected deaths were estimated, separately by sex, through an over-dispersed Poisson regression model including calendar year and age group as covariates, a smooth function of the year's week, and the logarithm of the population as offset. The difference between observed and expected deaths was considered a measure of excess mortality. RESULTS: In 2020, 746,146 deaths occurred in Italy. We estimated an excess mortality of 90,725 deaths (95% CI: 86,503-94,914), which became 99,289 deaths after excluding January and February, when mortality was lower than expected. The excess was higher among men (49,422 deaths) than women (41,303 deaths) and it was mostly detected at ages &#8805;80 (60,224 deaths) and ages 65-79 (25,791 deaths), while among the population aged 25-49 and 50-64 we estimated an excess of 281 and 4764 deaths, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: After considering demographic changes and temporal improvement in mortality the excess deaths in 2020 still remains above 90,000 deaths.

The tsunami reached first the coast of Tonga, and later many coasts around the world. The shock wave went around the globe, causing sea perturbations as far as the Caribbean and the Mediterranean seas. We present the effects of the January 15, 2022 Tonga tsunami on the Mexican Pacific Coast, Gulf of Mexico, and Mexican Caribbean coast, and discuss the underrated hazard caused by great volcanic explosions, and the role of early tsunami warning systems, in particular in Mexico. The shock wave took about 7.5 h to reach the coast of Mexico, located about 9000 km away from the volcano, and the signal lasted several hours, about 133 h (5.13 days). The shock wave was the only cause for sea alterations on the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, while at the Mexican Pacific coast both shock wave and the triggered tsunami by the volcano eruption and collapse affected this coast. The first tsunami waves recorded on the Mexican Pacific coast arrived around 12:35 on January 15, at the Lzaro Crdenas, Michoacn tide gauge station. The maximum tsunami height exceeded 2 m at the Ensenada, Baja California, and Manzanillo, Colima, tide gauge stations.

Our aim is to assess whether patients receiving chronic statin treatment who are hospitalized with COVID-19 have reduced in-hospital mortality if statin therapy is maintained during hospitalization. METHODS: This work is a cross-sectional, observational, retrospective multicenter study that analyzed 2921 patients who required hospital admission at 150 Spanish centers included in the nationwide SEMI-COVID-19 Network. We compared the clinical characteristics and COVID-19 disease outcomes between patients receiving chronic statin therapy who maintained this therapy during hospitalization versus those who did not. Propensity score matching was used to match each statin user whose therapy was maintained during hospitalization to a statin user whose therapy was withdrawn during hospitalization. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, continuation of statin therapy was associated with lower all-cause mortality (OR 0.67, 0.54-0.83, p < 0.001); lower incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 0.76,0.6-0.97, p = 0.025), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR 0.78, 0.69- 0.89, p < 0.001), and sepsis (4.82% vs 9.85%, p = 0.008); and less need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (5.35% vs 8.57, p < 0.001) compared to patients whose statin therapy was withdrawn during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Patients previously treated with statins who are hospitalized for COVID-19 and maintain statin therapy during hospitalization have a lower mortality rate than those in whom therapy is withdrawn.

In general, self-regulated learners are actively engaged in constructing their own understanding also including the regulation of contextual features in the environment. Within the contextual features, the regulation of peer interaction is necessary, because college courses increasingly require peer learning. This goes along with the increasing interest for online learning settings, due in no small part to the recent COVID-19 pandemic. In the present study we explore how social presence (i.e., the degree to which the other person is perceived as physical real), social space (i.e., trust building between peers) and sociability (i.e., the degree to which the virtual learning environment supports social presence and social space) are essential elements in the regulation of online peer interaction. To shed light in this matter, higher education students were qualitatively followed for 1 year in an online academic writing course by using retrospective interviews (n = 7) and reflective questions (n = 62). Additionally, for social presence, students perceptions were quantitatively measured with a validated questionnaire (n = 41). The results show that the planning phase is the most important phase for supporting students social presence because that is where the regulation of peer interaction becomes important. The sociability has an important role here as well becoming less prominent further on in the self-regulation process. In the SRL follow-up phases, students look for other ways to increase their social presence and social space in order to shape the regulation of peer interaction from a position of trust. In the evaluation phase, students are aware of the importance of social presence but less of social space for the regulation of peer interaction.

Early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment in order to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system. The standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan. Although CT scan is the gold standard, CXR are still useful because it is cheaper, faster and more widespread. This study aims to identify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types and also healthy lungs using only CXR images. METHODS: In order to achieve the objectives, we have proposed a classification schema considering the following perspectives: i) a multi-class classification; ii) hierarchical classification, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy. Given the natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling algorithms in the schema in order to re-balance the classes distribution. We observed that, texture is one of the main visual attributes of CXR images, our classification schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also using a pre-trained CNN model. We also explored early and late fusion techniques in the schema in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors and base classifiers at once. To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs. The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others. RESULTS: The proposed approach tested in RYDLS-20 achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario. CONCLUSIONS: As far as we know, the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes. We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here.","output":"COVID-19 identification in chest X-ray images on flat and hierarchical classification scenarios"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eranthis longistipitata Regel is an endemic plant of Central Asia.

Mass spectrometry revealed 18 flavonoid compounds. Flavonols featured the highest diversity, and 10 such substances were identified: 2 free aglycones (quercetin and kaempferol), 6 quercetin glycosides (peltatoside, hyperoside, reynoutrin, quercetin 3-sambubioside, rutin, and isoquercitrin), and 2 kaempferol glycosides (juglalin and trifolin). Two flavans (cianidanol and auriculoside), two hydroxyflavanones (6-methoxytaxifolin and aromadendrin), and one C-glycoside flavonecarlinosidewere identified. Dihydroxychalcones aspalathin, phloridzin, and phloretin were found too. Levels of rutin, quercetin, kaempferol, and hyperoside were confirmed by means of standards and high-performance liquid chromatography.

During the process of sensor development, laboratory potentiostats are mainly used to realize the EIS. However, those devices are normally not applicable for real use-cases outside the laboratory, so miniaturized and optimized instrumentations are needed. Various integrated circuits (IC) are available that provide EIS, but these make developed systems highly dependent on semiconductor manufacturers, including component availability. In addition, these generally do not meet the instrumentation requirements for FET-based biosensors, thus external circuitry is necessary as well. In this work, an instrumentation is presented that performs EIS between 10 Hz and 100 kHz for FET-based biosensors. The instrumentation includes the generation of the excitation signal, the configuration of the semiconductor and the readout circuit. The readout circuit consists of a transimpedance amplifier with automatic gain adjustment, filter stages, a magnitude and a phase detection circuit. Since magnitude and phase are converted to a DC signal, digitization of the results is trivial without further signal processing steps, minimizing the computational load on the microcontroller. The transmission behavior of the magnitude and phase measurement circuits shows a high linearity for sinusoidal signals. Furthermore, the overall system was tested with resistors, whereby the magnitude measurement error (1.7%) and the phase shift error (1.6) were determined within the working range of the instrumentation. The functionality of the instrumentation is demonstrated using pH-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFET) in various solutions.Clinical relevance- Based on the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of FET-based biosensors such as ImmunoFETs, new point-of-care testing (POCT) devices can be developed that e.g. quantitatively detect the concentration of biomarkers with very low detection limits in body fluids.

Conducting such evaluations of systems which require complex domain knowledge is often impossible, as disabled users do not exist or are very rare. This paper presents a user evaluation method to address this problem, consigliere evaluation. A consigliere evaluation has the disabled user as the main participant, but they are assisted by an advisor, or consigliere, who understands the complex domain; the consigliere is in turn, monitored by an accessibility expert, who acts as an enforcer. As in all user evaluations, the disabled participant undertakes a series of tasks. But in a consigliere evaluation, if the task requires some particular domain knowledge or skill, the role of the consigliere is to provide appropriate information. However, it is easy for the consigliere, who usually does not have knowledge of the accessibility domain, to provide information not specifically about the domain, but about how to do the task in general. So the role of the enforcer, who is an accessibility expert, is to ensure this does not happen, and also to provide assistance and explanation if accessibility issues arise that the disabled participant cannot solve. The paper illustrates the consigliere method with a case study, the evaluation of Skillsforge, an online system used by a number of universities to manage progress of postgraduate students. This system requires considerable domain knowledge of the terminology and progression requirements for these students. It is used by university administrative staff, academic staff who supervise postgraduate students or are involved in monitoring students and the students themselves. The case study illustrates how the consigliere evaluation method works and some of the things which need to be considered in conducting the evaluation appropriately.","output":"Consigliere Evaluation: Evaluating Complex Interactive Systems with Users with Disabilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gold nanotriangles (AuNTs) functionalized with dithiolated oligonucleotides have been employed to develop an amplification-free electrochemical biosensor for SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples. Gold nanotriangles, prepared through a seed-mediated growth method and exhaustively characterized by different techniques, serve as an improved electrochemical platform and for DNA probe immobilization. Azure A is used as an electrochemical indicator of the hybridization event. The biosensor detects either single stranded DNA or RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 of different lengths, with a low detection limit of 22.2 fM. In addition, it allows to detect point mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome with the aim to detect more infective SARS-CoV-2 variants such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron. Results obtained with the biosensor in nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 patients show the possibility to clearly discriminate between non-infected and infected patient samples as well as patient samples with different viral load. Furthermore, the results correlate well with those obtained by the gold standard technique RT-qPCR, with the advantage of avoiding the amplification process and the need of sophisticated equipment.

The much talked about green economy nowadays seeks to achieve sustainable economic growth and development without compromising environmental quality. The relationship between environmental degradation and economic growth is largely explained by the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. By employing the basic postulation of the baseline EKC framework, this study proposes and tests the existence of a dualistic approach of the EKC hypothesis. Geometry is used to illustrate the proposed dualistic model. Meanwhile, the novel dynamic common correlation effect econometric technique is employed to test the existence of the dualistic EKC within a panel of 109 countries from 1995 to 2016. The outcome from the estimated models shows that, in the global sample, the existence of the dualistic U-shaped and N-shaped EKC hypothesis is validated. When the sample is split into subsamples based on income levels, the U-shaped EKC hypothesis is validated for lower-income and high-income economies meanwhile, the N-shaped dualistic EKC is mostly associated with high-income economies.","output":"PrimalCdual approach to environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis: A demand and supply side analyses of environmental degradation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is a frequently used antibiotic for the treatment of urinary tract, respiratory, and intestinal infections and as a supplement in livestock or fishery farming to boost production. The release of SMX into the environment can lead to the development of antibiotic resistance among the microbial community, which can lead to frequent clinical infections. SMX removal from water is usually done through advanced treatment processes, such as adsorption, photocatalytic oxidation, and biodegradation. Among them, the advanced oxidation process using TiO(2) and its composites is being widely used. TiO(2) is a widely used photocatalyst; however, it has certain limitations, such as low visible light response and quick recombination of e(?)/h(+) pairs. Integrating the biochar with TiO(2) nanoparticles can overcome such limitations. The biochar-supported TiO(2) composites showed a significant increase in the photocatalytic activities in the UV-visible range, which resulted in a substantial increase in the degradation of SMX in water. The present review has critically reviewed the methods of biochar TiO(2) composite synthesis, the effect of biochar integration with the TiO(2) on its physicochemical properties, and the chemical pathways through which the biochar/TiO(2) composite degrades the SMX in water or aqueous solution. The degradation of SMX using photocatalysis can be considered a useful model, and the research studies presented in this review will allow extending this area of research on other types of similar pharmaceuticals or pollutants in general in the future.","output":"Biochar-Supported TiO(2)-Based Nanocomposites for the Photocatalytic Degradation of Sulfamethoxazole in WaterA Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Optimal dosing of bone-targeted agents (BTAs), in patients with bone metastases remains an important clinical question. This trial compared 4-weekly versus 12-weekly therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with bone metastases from breast or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), who were going to start or already on BTAs, were randomised 1:1 to 4-weekly or 12-weekly BTA treatment for one year. Primary end point was change in health-related quality of life (HRQoL)-physical function European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-QLQ-C30). Secondary end points included pain (EORTC-QLQ-BM22), global health status (EORTC-QLQ-C30), symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs) rates and time to SSEs. Primary analysis was per protocol and a non-inferiority margin of 5 points was used. RESULTS: Of 263 patients (160 breast cancer, 103 CRPC), 133 (50.6%) and 130 (49.4%) were randomised to the 4- and 12-weekly groups, respectively. BTAs included denosumab (56.3%), zoledronate (24.0%) and pamidronate (19.8%). Using repeated-measures analysis, across all time points, patients in the 4-weekly arm had a mean HRQL-physical subdomain score which was 1.2 (95% confidence interval: -1.6 to 4.0) higher than the 12-weekly arm. The study met the definition of non-inferiority for our primary outcome. Secondary outcomes showed no significant difference in scores for pain, global health status, SSE rates and SSE-free survival between arms. Subgroup analyses for cancer type, prior BTA use or BTA type showed no significant difference between arms. CONCLUSION: These results in addition to those previously reported for de-escalating zoledronate and systematic reviews in both breast and prostate cancers, would support that de-escalation of commonly used BTAs is a reasonable treatment option.","output":"A randomised trial of 4- versus 12-weekly administration of bone-targeted agents in patients with bone metastases from breast or castration-resistant prostate cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The alarming trend of paediatric obesity deserves our greatest awareness to hinder the early onset of metabolic complications impacting growth and functionality. Presently, insight into molecular mechanisms of childhood obesity and associated metabolic comorbidities is limited. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: This systematic review aimed at scrutinising what has been reported on putative metabolites distinctive for metabolic abnormalities manifesting at young age by searching three literature databases (Web of Science, Pubmed and EMBASE) during the last 6 years (January 2015CJanuary 2021). Global metabolomic profiling of paediatric obesity was performed (multiple biological matrices: blood, urine, saliva and adipose tissue) to enable overarching pathway analysis and network mapping. Among 2792 screened Q1 articles, 40 met the eligibility criteria and were included to build a database on metabolite markers involved in the spectrum of childhood obesity. Differential alterations in multiple pathways linked to lipid, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolisms were observed. High levels of lactate, pyruvate, alanine and acetate marked a pronounced shift towards hypoxic conditions in children with obesity, and, together with distinct alterations in lipid metabolism, pointed towards dysbiosis and immunometabolism occurring early in life. Additionally, aberrant levels of several amino acids, most notably belonging to tryptophan metabolism including the kynurenine pathway and its relation to histidine, phenylalanine and purine metabolism were displayed. Moreover, branched-chain amino acids were linked to lipid, carbohydrate, amino acid and microbial metabolism, inferring a key role in obesity-associated insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review revealed that the main metabolites at the crossroad of dysregulated metabolic pathways underlying childhood obesity could be tracked down to one central disturbance, i.e. impending insulin resistance for which reference values and standardised measures still are lacking. In essence, glycolytic metabolism was evinced as driving energy source, coupled to impaired Krebs cycle flux and ?-oxidation. Applying metabolomics enabled to retrieve distinct metabolite alterations in childhood obesity(-related insulin resistance) and associated pathways at early age and thus could provide a timely indication of risk by elucidating early-stage biomarkers as hallmarks of future metabolically unhealthy phenotypes.

OBJECTIVES: To produce a critical review and summary of the pathway which led to the repurposing of tocilizumab for COVID-19 treatment, from in vitro observations to guidelines recommendations. SOURCES: All studies evaluating the effectiveness of tocilizumab to treat COVID-19 disease published over July 2020-July 2021. CONTENT: Two large methodologically well conducted observational studies, the TESEO and the STOP COVID cohorts, showed a reduction in the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death in patients treated with tocilizumab as compared to standard of care in 2020. Concomitantly and up to February 2021 a number of small sample size randomized trials (RCTs) were showing discrepant results. These RCTs had a number of issues: small sample size, various designs and inclusion criteria and different dosages of tocilizumab used. The confidence interval of the meta-analytic estimate for the RCT results was consistent with the hypothesis of no efficacy of tocilizumab. In our opinion, this was mainly because the meta-analysis included small and heterogeneous studies. These results led to a delay in the inclusion of tocilizumab in guidelines which occurred only in the summer of 2021. IMPLICATIONS: Although observational studies are unable to control for unmeasured confounding, they can be put together quickly during a pandemic and promptly provide important information. The large sample size allows us to investigate effect measure modifiers and better target interventions. It is key that the effect size is somewhat large (RR>2), all sources of bias are properly accounted for and the direct evidence is weighted against these factors. It appears to us that for tocilizumab, not having dismissed the results of carefully designed and analysed observational studies in 2020 could have prevented many deaths over those months.","output":"Signals were broadly positive for months, but never definitive: the tocilizumab story"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent work, we proposed that effective therapeutic drugs aimed at treating the SARS-CoV-2 infection could be developed based on interdicting in the early steps of the folding pathway of key viral proteins, including the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. In order to provide for a drug target on the protein, the earliest contact-formation event along the dominant folding pathway of the RBD spike protein was predicted employing the Sequential Collapse Model (SCM). The segments involved in the predicted earliest contact were suggested to provide optimal folding interdiction target regions (FITRs) for potential therapeutic drugs, with a focus on folding interdicting peptides (FIPs). In this paper, we extend our analysis to include 13 known single mutations of the RBD spike protein as well as the triple mutation B1.351 and the recent double mutation B1.617.2. The results show that the location of the FITR does not change in any of the 15 studied mutations, providing for a mutation-resistant drug design strategy for the RBD-spike protein.","output":"The Promise of Mutation Resistant Drugs for SARS-CoV-2 that Interdict in the Folding of the Spike Protein Receptor Binding Domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Injections of insulin are the main treatment for diabetes, but in the long run this therapy can induce serious drawbacks. This has inspired new drugs able to decrease insulin requirements. For instance, human amylin (hIAPP) is a small hormone cosecreted by pancreatic ?-cells with insulin to which is a synergistic partner. However, the high amyloidogenicity of hIAPP precluded it as a therapeutics and led to the design of pramlintide (sIAPP), a chimeric analogue with substitutions (A25P, S28P, and S29P) inherited from the aggregation-resistant rat isoform (rIAPP). Despite sIAPP advantages, it still shares with hIAPP a poorly soluble profile at physiological pH that hampers its mixture with insulin. Recent improvements, as charge-enhanced mutants, have been proposed. For instance, sIAPP+ was screened in silico by purely microcanonical thermostatistical methods and adds to sIAPP an S20R mutation to uplift its solubility. This suggests that such physically inspired computational approach may also be auspicious on devising effective coformulations of insulin with amylin analogues. In this seminal attempt, we make comparative multicanonical simulations of regular acting human insulin coformulated with hIAPP, sIAPP, or sIAPP+. To assess the respective physicochemical stabilities against aggregation, we characterize the structural-phase transitions through the microcanonical thermodynamic formalism and evaluate their time lags using the classical nucleation theory. These results are then correlated with estimates of solvation free energies, modeled by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, and structural propensities. Experimental essays are compared to our simulations and support our methodology.","output":"Microcanonical insights into the physicochemical stability of the coformulation of insulin with amylin analogues"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Covid-19 is a pandemic of unprecedented proportion, whose understanding and management is still under way.

RESULTS: Vitamin D proved to interact both with the innate immune system, by activating Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or increasing the levels of cathelicidins and -defensins, and adaptive immune system, by reducing immunoglobulin secretion by plasma cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines production, thus modulating T cells function. Promising results have been extensively described as regards the supplementation of vitamin D in respiratory tract infections, autoimmune diseases and even pulmonary fibrosis.

As of February 2021, there were 107 million COVID-19 cases worldwide. As a comparison, there are approximately 38 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) worldwide. The coexistence of both epidemics, and the syndemic effect of both viruses could lead to a delirious impact both at individual and community levels. Many intersecting points were found between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, and HIV; among which, gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are the most notable. GI manifestations represent a common clinical presentation in both HIV and SARS-CoV-2. The emergence of GI symptoms as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection provides a new dynamic to COVID-19 diagnosis, management, and infection control measures, and adds an additional diagnostic challenge in case of coinfection with HIV. The presence of GI manifestations in PLHIV during the COVID-19 pandemic could be referred to HIV enteropathy, presence of opportunistic infection, adverse effect of antiretrovirals, or coinfection with COVID-19. Thus, it is important to exclude SARS-CoV-2 in patients who present with new-onset GI manifestations, especially in PLHIV, to avoid the risk of disease transmission during endoscopic interventions. Structural similarities between both viruses adds a valuable intersecting point, which has mutual benefits in the management of both viruses. These similarities led to the hypothesis that antiretrovirals such as lopinavir/Rironavir have a role in the management of COVID-19, which was the target of our search strategy using the available evidence. These similarities may also facilitate the development of an efficient HIV vaccine in the future using the advances in COVID-19 vaccine development.","output":"Gastrointestinal manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus and coronavirus disease 2019: Understanding the intersecting regions between the two epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging human coronavirus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a predominantly respiratory disease that has become a global pandemic Millions of people worldwide are suffering from COVID-19, and hundreds of thousands of those infected have died Nevertheless, many more people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or suffer a mild disease characterized by dry cough and mild fever This new pandemic poses a threat to public health on a global scale, and an intervention to prevent continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus is of the utmost importance To assess preventive and therapeutic strategies, it is imperative to understand the pathogenesis and immune response against SARS-CoV-2 In this review, we concentrate on the protective adaptive immune response elicited by this novel coronavirus as well as requirements for a successful vaccine inducing optimal protection","output":"Protective Adaptive Immunity Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Implications for Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the outbreak of COVID-19, maintaining the healthcare system is a crucial issue.

Vector, RNA, subunit, and inactivated vaccines, as well as DNA vaccines, have been approved for human use. Vector vaccines have been well studied prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, their long-term efficacy and approaches to scaling up their production remain questionable. The main challenge for RNA vaccines is to improve their stability during production, storage, and transportation. For inactivated vaccines, the key issue is to improve their immunogenicity and effectiveness. To date, it has been shown that the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines directly correlates with their clinical efficacy. In view of the constant mutation, the emerging new SARS-CoV-2 variants have been shown to be able to partially escape post-vaccination immune response; however, most vaccines remain sufficiently effective regardless of the variant of the virus.

The target participants were HCPs working in any healthcare setting across Iraq. The survey was distributed via two professional Facebook groups between 7 April and 7 May 2020. The survey items were adopted with modifications from three previous studies of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Avian Influenza Outbreak. Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to determine the difference in the pandemic impact according to the dealing with COVID-19 cases. KEY FINDINGS: The authors received 430 surveys from HCPs representing 14 provinces. Approximately 60% of the participants were dealing with diagnosis or treatment of COVID-19 cases. More than 80% perceived high risk of infection and stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, 85.9% of the HCPs had concerns of putting family and close friends at risk due to their job during the COVID-19 crisis. HCPs working in a setting dealing with diagnosis/treatment of COVID-19 cases experienced significantly higher concerns about personal and family safety compared with other HCPs. CONCLUSIONS: Working during COVID-19 pandemic has several negative impacts on HCPs including mental and physical health and an overwhelming work environment.

Reports revealed variants L452R, T478K, and E484Q harbours in enhancement with hACE2 binding while P681R situated in furin cleavage site resulting in better transmissibility. To gain a deeper understanding of the impact of these variants (L452R, T478K and E484Q) binding with hACE2, structural dynamics at the interface between S-RBD protein and hACE2 were studied. We performed our dynamics studies with both single mutant complex (L452R, T478K and E484Q) and in the combination of triple mutants (L452R + T478K + E484Q) at 100ns in contrast with the wild type. Interfacial docking interactions and Molecular Mechanics approach exhibited that the spike mutants ?L452R, T478K and E484Q harbour with higher binding affinity on hACE2 in contrast with its native spike protein. The presence of interfacial residue, intermolecular contacts such as hydrogen bonding, salt bridge and non-hydrogen bonded interactions might be the reason for its higher binding affinity. Hence the findings from our study unravelled plausible mechanism for the increase in affinities of mutants to hACE2 thus leading to higher transmissibility and infection of emerging variants. Further, the conformational alterations in the course of dynamics at the RBD motif led to enhancement of hACE2 binding and immune escape. These results suggest that the structural changes introduced by these variants enhance the binding affinities of the S protein with the hACE2 that could form the basis to further aid in designing therapeutics that could inhibit at the interface of S protein and hACE2 receptor.","output":"Molecular Dynamics Simulations Studies On The Effects Of Mutations On The Binding Affinities Between SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD And Human ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: COVID-19 disproportionately affects those with comorbidities and the elderly. Hypertension is the most common pre-existing condition amongst COVID-19 patients. Upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is common in hypertensive patients and may promote inflammation and ensuing cytokine storm in COVID-19. It is unknown whether RAAS inhibition with ACE1 inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) can be harmful or beneficial. Methods: Within Hackensack Meridian Health network, the largest healthcare provider in New Jersey, we performed a retrospective, multicenter, convenience sampling study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Demographics, clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were manually abstracted. Fishers exact tests, and logistic regression were performed. Results: Among 3017 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 1584 (52.5%) carried a diagnosis of hypertension. In the discharged or deceased cohort, the overall mortality was significantly increased at 35% vs 13% among COVID-19 patients with hypertension. However, when adjusted for age, the effect of hypertension on mortality was greatly diminished, with a reduction in odds-ratio by over half; and completely disappeared when adjusted for other major covariates. The mortality rates were lower for hypertensive patients prescribed ACE1 (27%, p=0.001) or ARBs (33%, p=0.12) compared to other anti-hypertensive agents (39%) in the unadjusted analyses. RAAS inhibitor therapy appeared protective compared to other anti-hypertensive agents (p=0.001).

The measure of deferral, installment payment of tax liability, is certainly the most important and most popular measure among taxpayers. It is explained how tax measures during a pandemic should look according to the recommendations of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). We explain other measures that have been introduced to facilitate business. These are the extension of the deadline for filing income tax, the exemption from VAT, the enforcement procedure and the payment of the annual tax rate. Despite the measures taken so far, it is important to emphasize that the Covid-19 pandemic is still ongoing, and that according to some experts, a real crisis with visible consequences of the pandemic is still to be expected. Accordingly, it is to be expected that the current measures are very likely to be further changed, upgraded and adjusted as the situation changes. We consider it important to note that the framework of this paper does not allow a detailed analysis and that we are forced to limit ourselves exclusively to some aspects of the issue at hand.","output":"The Impact of Covid-19 on Tax Administration in the Republic of Croatia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March 2020. In 2021, several vaccines were provisionally approved to reduce the risk of transmission and hospitalisation of COVID-19 infection. A surge in COVID-19 vaccination was seen between August and October 2021 in Victoria, Australia. We hypothesised this led to an increase in ED presentations. METHODS: Patients in the present study were adults who presented to the ED within 21 days of receiving a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine between 11 August 2021 and 14 November 2021. All cases underwent chart reviews to extract epidemiological features, clinical presentations, ED assessments, investigations and disposition. RESULTS: Notably, 968 patients were included in the study, comprising 6.1% of all ED presentations during the study period. The median age was 31 years. 82.9% of patients were younger than 45 years. 20.1% of patients arrived by ambulance. Chest pain was the most common presenting complaint (43.6%), followed by headache (10.3%) and palpitations (8.2%). The most common investigations were a full blood examination (73.5%), an ECG (63.8%) and serum troponin (49.1%). 64.8% of patients were directly discharged home and 22.1% were sent home after a short stay admission. Only 2.2% of patients were admitted to the hospital. CONCLUSION: A majority of patients who presented to the ED after their COVID vaccinations were young and discharged home after the initial assessment. These presentations have significantly increased the workload in prehospital settings and EDs, contributing to increased investigation usage, ED treatment space occupancy, and increased costs to the health system.","output":"Epidemiology, clinical presentations and outcome of patients presenting to the emergency department after a COVID-19 vaccination: An observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveTo quantify the introduction of new, temporary telehealth Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items delivered by allied mental health professionals (AMHPs) through the Better Access initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia.MethodsMBS-item service data for clinical psychologists, registered psychologists, social workers, and occupational therapists were extracted for existing face-to-face, remote videoconferencing and new, temporary telehealth items for the study period April-December 2020. The total number of services in Australia were compared with the baseline period of 2019. Given the second wave of increased COVID-19 infections and prolonged lockdowns in the state of Victoria, we compared the per capita rate of services for Victoria versus other states and territories.ResultsDuring the study period, there was an overall 11% increase in all allied mental health consultations. Telehealth use was substantial with 37% of all sessions conducted by videoconferencing or telephone consultations. The peak month was April 2020, during the first wave of increasing COVID-19 cases, when 53% of consultations were via telehealth. In terms of Victoria, there was an overall 15% increase in all consultations compared with the same period in 2019.ConclusionsAllied mental health services via MBS-subsidised telehealth items greatly increased during 2020.

Multimodal advances in single cell sequencing have enabled the simultaneous quantification of cell surface protein expression alongside unbiased transcriptional profiling. Here we present LinQ-View, a toolkit designed for multimodal single cell data visualization and analysis that links transcriptional and cell surface protein expression profiling data. Further, we propose a quantitative metric for cluster purity of CITE-seq data, enabling effective determination of clustering algorithms and their parameters, and finally demonstrate the utility of our toolkit through seamless integration with standard single cell analysis workflows on several public datasets. Through comparison to existing multimodal methods, we demonstrate that LinQ-View generates more accurate cell clusters and is highly efficient, even with massive datasets. LinQ-View is specialized in handling CITE-seq data with routine numbers of surface protein features (e.g. less than 50), by preventing variations in a single surface protein feature from affecting results. Finally, we utilized this method to integrate single cell transcriptional and protein expression data from COVID-19-infected patients and influenza-immunized subjects, revealing antigen-specific B cell subsets and previously unknown T cell subsets post-infection and vaccination.","output":"Integration of Transcriptome and Cell Surface Protein Expression by LinQ-View Identifies Unique Immune Subpopulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: About two million people annually travel to Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj.

METHODS: We used PubMed and Scopus to search international medical databases. The key words were as follows: Hajj, Haj, vaccine, vaccination, and immunization. The time interval of the search was from the beginning of 2010 to May 23, 2016. One hundred and thirty papers were extracted, and their contents were subsequently reviewed after title and abstract screenings. The original articles were included in the study and non-English articles were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Considering the extracted papers, almost all pilgrims were vaccinated against meningococcal diseases. Using of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine rates were different among the pilgrims. The other vaccines have been taking according to specific conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings regarding influenza vaccine effectiveness are contradictory. A few studies confirmed the flu vaccine effectiveness while some others rejected its usefulness. Meningococcal immunization is an effective preventive tool with high compliance for Hajj pilgrims.

We enrolled 181 patients admitted to Huoshenshan Hospital (Wuhan, China) with confirmed COVID-19 between January 2020 and February 2020. Ninety-two patients were treated with tocilizumab, and 89 patients were treated conventionally. We analyzed the clinical manifestations, changes in CT scan images, and laboratory tests before and after tocilizumab treatment, and compared these results with the conventionally treated group. A significant reduction in the level of C-reactive protein was observed 1 week after tocilizumab administration. In some cases this meant the end of the IL-6-related cytokine storm. In addition, tocilizumab relieved fever, cough, and shortness of breath with no reported adverse drug reactions. These findings suggest tocilizumab improves clinical outcomes and is effective for treatment of patients with critical or severe COVID-19.

At the beginning of lockdown (wave 1), participants (N = 470) completed self-assessment questionnaires to document their initial level of well-being and state of nine different well-established psychological resources, measured as traits: optimism, hope, self-efficacy, gratitude toward the world, self-transcendence, wisdom, gratitude of being, peaceful disengagement, and acceptance. Three weeks later, a weekly follow-up was started to record changes in well-being and reported threats for a duration of 5 weeks (waves 2C6). Results show that psychological resources efficiently protected well-being in a variety of ways: they buffered the adverse effects of reported threats to health and wealth, increased the well-being averages, and reduced the decline in well-being over time. More specifically, emotional well-being was positively predicted by hope, gratitude of being, and, to a lesser level, by acceptance; psychological well-being by self-efficacy, personal wisdom, and gratitude of being; social well-being only by gratitude toward the world; and inner well-being by optimism, gratitude of being, and acceptance.

The strengths and weakness of e-learning have long been discussed in the literature. Most of the claimed strengths depend on an appropriate pedagogy approach with a combination of relevant technologies. At the same time the limitations are mainly associated with the technological issues arising in the context of e-learning. Teachers' perspectives on the benefits and limitations of e-learning are seriously affected by a number of factors, such as their digital competences and experience in e-learning. The study of these factors and their effect on teachers' perspectives could support the increase of the objectivity of teachers' evaluation and attitudes towards e-learning in general. Thus this research aimed to identify the impact of experience of Sofia University (SU) academic staff in forced introduction of online education on their views and perspectives about e-learning and its strengths and limitations in particular. The research method was an online survey, conducted at the end of the academic 2019/2020 with 383 teachers from all 16 SU faculties. The paper focused on three main aspects - 1) teachers' experience in online education before and during pandemic;2) teachers' views on strengths and weaknesses of e-learning;and 3) the impact of their experience on their views. Findings from data analysis revealed the existence of statistical dependencies between the experience in e-learning and the digital competencies of teachers before the pandemic, on the one hand, and different aspects of the online teaching during the pandemic, such as: the choice of e-learning environment;the ratio of synchronous / asynchronous forms of online learning;the frequency and variety of using e-resources in teaching and in supporting students' self-preparation;the tools and forms of e-assessment, on the other hand. It appeared that far more negative attitudes are formed in inexperienced teachers, which in turn has affected their assessments of benefits and limitations that quality e-learning provides for students - they did not recognize the strengths of e-learning proven in theory and practice and exaggerated its negative aspects. Thus conclusions imposed that the forced introduction of online education has enriched the experience of teachers in this form of education, but also has discredited its quality from their perspective. ? 2021 ACM.","output":"The effect of the teachers' experience in online education during the pandemic on their views of strengths and weaknesses of e-learning (SU case)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infections are a major global health threat.

These bacteria are not easily cultured and isolated and often cannot even found from infected sites. Delayed or inappropriate treatment of these microorganisms can lead to failure in eradicating these infections. The purpose of this study was to determine the diversity of anaerobic bacteria at present and their pattern of sensitivity to several antibiotics. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted over a period of two years on various specimens. Specimens derived from body fluids are inoculated on a BacT/Alert (bioMrieux). Anaerobic isolates were identified by Gram staining and continued identification using Vitek 2? automated system. Antibiotic sensitivity examination was carried out using ATBTM ANA (bioMrieux). Results: A total of 440 specimens were received in microbiology laboratory for anaerobic culture from patients with multiple infections from 13 hospitals in Jakarta. Our research was able to identify 18 species on anaerobic bacteria, consisting 52.5% Gram positive and 47.5% Gram negative bacteria. The most common bacteria found were Clostridium perfringens (15%) from Gram positive and Provetella bivia (10%) from Gram negative. The sensitivity pattern shows that antibiotic piperacilline-tazobactam is 100% effective against anaerobic bacteria, while metronidazole as the drug of choice is only 75% effective. Against Gram positive, several antibiotics such as piperacilline-tazobactam, ticarcilin-clavunic acid, cefoxitin, cefotetan, imipenem and chloramphenicol were 100% effective, however metronidazole occupied the lowest position (61.9%). Meanwhile against Gram negative antibiotics piperacilline-tazobactam is 100% effective and chloramphenicol in the second position (94.75%). Conclusion: Clostridium perfringens and Provetella bivia are the most common bacteria found. The antibiotics piperacilline-tazobactam is 100% effective against both Gram positive and negative.

There is no study related to the patients' preference for systemic therapy during this pandemic. We have conducted a prospective study to analyze that aspect. METHODS: All consecutive patients who visited during the lockdown period from April 1-10, 2020, for systemic chemotherapy were included in the study for a questionnaire-based survey to evaluate the willingness to continue chemotherapy during this pandemic and factors influencing the decisions. RESULTS: A total of 302 patients were included (median age, 56 years; range, 21-77 years). Most common sites of cancer were breast (n = 114), lung (n = 44), ovary (n = 34), and colon (n = 20).

The present study investigated the mediating role of problematic video gaming (PVG) and problematic Facebook use (PFU) in the relationship between impulsivity dimensions and life satisfaction as well as the relationship between impulsivity dimensions and problematic behaviors. Additionally, the potential impact of gender differences was also examined. The study comprised 673 gamers (391 females) aged 17C38 years (M = 21.25 years, SD = 2.67) selected from 1365 individuals who completed an offline survey. PFU was assessed using the Facebook Intrusion Scale, and PVG was assessed using the nine-item Internet Gaming Disorder ScaleCShort-Form (IGDS9-SF). Impulsivity dimensions such as attention, cognitive instability, motor, perseverance, self-control, and cognitive complexity were assessed using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), and life satisfaction was assessed using the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Depending on the specific impulsivity dimension, findings showed both positive and negative relationships between impulsivity and life satisfaction. Attention and perseverance subtypes of impulsivity were primarily associated with problematic behaviors. Additionally, cognitive complexity was associated with PFU among female gamers, whereas cognitive instability was associated with PVG among male gamers. Additionally, PVG was primarily associated with lower life satisfaction. However, there was no mediation effects between impulsivity dimensions and life satisfaction via PFU or PVG. These findings provide a better understanding of the relationship between problematic behaviors, life satisfaction, and impulsivity among gamers and the differences between male and female gamers.","output":"Problematic Facebook use and problematic video gaming as mediators of relationship between impulsivity and life satisfaction among female and male gamers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The end of the year 2019 was marked by novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in China that rapidly spread to the rest of the world While the involvement of the lower respiratory system causing pneumonia is identified as the primary target of the virus, extra-pulmonary manifestations, especially of the central nervous system, are also being increasingly reported Previous research on Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and SARS-CoV have shown neurological involvement in human coronavirus infections While several cases of seizures have been reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, there is no specific data to suggest an association of COVID-19 with epilepsy Epilepsy patients on immunosuppressive medications may have a higher risk of contracting the viral infection There can be an indirect relation of COVID-19 to epilepsy as the viral infection is associated with fever in most COVID-19 cases, which can lower seizure threshold Additionally, inadequate sleep and stress due to ongoing pandemic of coronavirus can be another trigger for seizure precipitation in epilepsy patients Drug compliance, availability of antiepileptic drugs, and drug interactions with COVID-19 experimental drugs are major concerns in epilepsy patients Adopting telemedicine services and the use of epilepsy helplines may be important in assisting epilepsy patients and ensuring that treatment continues uninterrupted","output":"Seizures and Epilepsy in Times of Corona Virus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) has infected 189 000 people in Italy, with more than 25 000 deaths.

Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain this including issues of genetics, physiology, nutrition and management, and these factors have been investigated at the animal, organ and cellular level at critical time points of the productive life of dairy cows. This paper reviews the physiological events and their causes and consequences affecting fertility in dairy cows and summarises these in a downloadable poster. We consider the following points to have the greatest negative impact on fertility and that they need to be prioritised in efforts to ameliorate the problem (others have been included in the review). Firstly, minimise negative energy balance and resolve any infection of the post partum uterus. Secondly, expression and detection of oestrus followed by insemination with high quality semen (day 0). Thirdly, ovulation and fertilisation of a high quality oocyte (day 1). Fourthly, an early increase in progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum (days 3C7). Fifthly, the uterine endometrium must produce an early and appropriate environment to stimulate embryo development (days 6C13). This leads to sixthly, a large embryo producing adequate quantities of interferon tau (days 14C18) that alters uterine prostaglandin secretion and signals maternal recognition of pregnancy (days 16C18). Future strategies to improve dairy cow fertility are needed for the benefit of the dairy industry and for cow welfare and should be based upon an integrative approach of these events.","output":"A review of the causes of poor fertility in high milk producing dairy cows"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adult Day Service (ADS) centers play an important role in community services that help families keep a person living with dementia (PLWD) at home.

Comprehensive reports from other countries are needed. We dissect the pattern, evolution and predictive value of such abnormalities in a cohort from Madrid, Spain. METHODS: Retrospective study with prospective 14-day follow-up of 373 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in five Madrid hospitals, including 50 outpatients. COVID-19 severe course was defined as need of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 33.1% hospitalised patients showed baseline AST elevation and 28.5% showed ALT elevation, contrasting with 12% and 8% of outpatients (P&#8804;0.001). Baseline AST, ALT and GGT levels correlated with LDH and C-reactive protein levels (CRP) (r&#8804;0.598, P<0.005). AST elevation was associated with other severity markers such as male sex, lymphopenia and pneumonia on X-ray (P<0.05 all). ALP and Bilirubin levels were rarely increased. Patients with elevated baseline AST displayed progressive normalization of this enzyme and increase in ALT and GGT levels. Patients with normal baseline AST showed a flattened evolution pattern with levels in range. Patients with a severe course of COVID-19 showed more frequently elevated baseline AST than those with a milder evolution (54.2% vs. 25.4%, P<0.001). Age, AST and CRP were independent risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Mild liver enzyme elevation is associated with COVID-19 severity.

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was transmitted to 6\\\\day\\\\old piglets by dosing with homogenates of muscle and lymph node collected from 500 clinically normal pigs at the time of slaughter. All piglets in 2 separately housed litters showed clinical signs of TGE with 5 piglets dying within 10 d of oral dosing with homogenates. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was isolated from 2 of these piglets and all piglets developed TGE antibody. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was not isolated in tissue culture from muscle and lymph node homogenates, but was isolated from 4 (0.8%) of 500 tonsil samples collected from the same pigs. A survey of 250 serum samples provided an estimate of the prevalence of slaughtered pigs with TGE antibody of 34.8% in the sample population. The results indicate that carcases of some pigs from TGE endemic areas contain viable TGE virus, and that there would be a substantial risk of introducing TGE virus into Australia by the importation of uncooked pig meat from these areas.","output":"Oral transmission of transmissible gastroenteritis virus by muscle and lymph node from slaughtered pigs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Sepsis is life-threatening and frequently a final common pathway to death for many infectious diseases worldwide and may lead to death if left untreated.

Currently no consensus exists regarding the ideal location for this unique aesthetic unit of the abdomen. To their interest, the authors noted that the intraoperative distance from the pubic symphysis to midumbilical stalk measured 15 cm for several consecutive patients. They believe the umbilicopubic distance is another clinically useful and reliable anatomic landmark for the plastic surgeon relocating the umbilicus during an abdominoplasty. METHODS A retrospective chart review analysis was performed for 40 consecutive patients who underwent abdominoplasty or panniculectomy between July 2009 and May 2010 at the authors' institution. The intraoperative measurement of the umbilicopubic distance (pubic symphysis to midumbilical stalk) was available for 32 of these patients. The average umbilicopubic distance was calculated. Two separate graphs were generated to evaluate the relationship of the umbilicopubic distance to the patients' height and body mass index (BMI). The data were saved and analyzed using Microsoft Office Excel. RESULTS In the study population, the average intraoperative umbilicopubic distance was found to be 15.05 cm. The results validate the mean umbilicopubic distance of 15.04 cm reported by Dubou and colleagues in 1978. For patients whose stature fell between 145 and 178 cm, the umbilicopubic distance was consistently 15 cm. A tendency toward a higher umbilicus was noted as the patients became taller. The BMI did not seem to influence the location of the umbilicus as measured intraoperatively. CONCLUSION Translocation of the umbilicus to 15 cm from the pubic symphysis in patients with a stature of 145-178 cm is another clinically useful, safe, and expeditious method for relocation of the umbilicus during an abdominoplasty.","output":"Intraoperative assessment of the umbilicopubic distance: a reliable anatomic landmark for transposition of the umbilicus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Significant concerns have arisen over the past 3 y from the increased global spread of the mosquito-borne flavivirus, Zika. Accompanying this spread has been an increase in cases of the devastating birth defect microcephaly as well as of GuillainCBarr syndrome in adults in many affected countries. Currently there is no vaccine or therapy for this infection; however, we sought to develop a combination approach that provides more rapid and durable protection than traditional vaccination alone. A novel immune-based prophylaxis/therapy strategy entailing the facilitated delivery of a synthetic DNA consensus prME vaccine along with DNA-encoded anti-ZIKV envelope monoclonal antibodies (dMAb) were developed and evaluated for antiviral efficacy. This immediate and persistent protection strategy confers the ability to overcome shortcomings inherent with conventional active vaccination or passive immunotherapy. A collection of novel dMAbs were developed which were potent against ZIKV and could be expressed in serum within 24C48 h of in vivo administration. The DNA vaccine, from a previous development, was potent after adaptive immunity was developed, protecting against infection, brain and testes pathology in relevant mouse challenge models and in an NHP challenge. Delivery of potent dMAbs protected mice from the same murine viral challenge within days of delivery. Combined injection of dMAb and the DNA vaccine afforded rapid and long-lived protection in this challenge model, providing an important demonstration of the advantage of this synergistic approach to pandemic outbreaks.","output":"Synthetic nucleic acid antibody prophylaxis confers rapid and durable protective immunity against Zika virus challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To evaluate if COVID-19 apps address risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, race, gender, sexual orientation, language.

RESULTS: Using existing knowledge of surgical smoke, a theoretical risk of virus transmission exists. Best practice should consider the operating room set-up, patient movement and operating theatre equipment when producing a COVID-19 operating protocol. The choice of energy device can affect the smoke produced, and surgeons should manage the pneumoperitoneum meticulously during laparoscopic surgery. Devices to remove surgical smoke, including extractors, filters and non-filter devices, are discussed in detail.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, from March 7 to March 11, 2020, all heads of ED departments in France were contacted to answer an electronic survey, including 23 questions. Quality, Organization, Training, Resources, Management, Interoperability, and Responsiveness were evaluated by calculating scores (10 points). Multivariate analysis of variance was used to compare scores. Spearman's correlation coefficient and multifaceted regression analysis were performed between Responsiveness and dimensions scores. RESULTS: A total of 287 of 636 French EDs were included (45.1%). Calculated scores showed (median): Quality 5.38; Organization 6.4; Training 4.6; Resources 4.13; Management 2.38; Interoperability 4.0; Responsiveness 6.25; seasonal influenza score was 5.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions adopted by Sweden have been milder compared to those implemented in Denmark. Moreover, Sweden might have started the pandemic with a large proportion of vulnerable elderly with a high mortality risk. This study aimed to clarify whether excess mortality in Sweden can be explained by a large stock of dry tinder instead of being attributed to faulty lockdown policies. METHODS: We analysed weekly death counts in Sweden and Denmark from July 2007 to June 2020. We used a novel method for short-term mortality forecasting to estimate expected and excess deaths during the first COVID-19 wave in Sweden and Denmark. RESULTS: In the first part of the epiyear 2019C2020, deaths were low in both Sweden and Denmark. In the absence of COVID-19, a relatively low level of death would be expected for the later part of the epiyear. The registered deaths were, however, way above the upper bound of the prediction interval in Sweden and within the range in Denmark. CONCLUSIONS: Dry tinder can only account for a modest fraction of excess Swedish mortality. The risk of death during the first COVID-19 wave rose significantly for Swedish women aged >85 but only slightly for Danish women aged >85. The risk discrepancy seems more likely to result from differences between Sweden and Denmark in how care and housing for the elderly are organised, coupled with a less successful Swedish strategy of shielding the elderly.","output":"High excess deaths in Sweden during the first wave of COVID-19: Policy deficiencies or dry tinder?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Disadvantaged families experience many barriers to accessing health and social care. The Healthy Homes and Neighbourhoods (HHAN) Integrated Care Initiative was developed to address these barriers, and ensure families have their complex needs met and are kept safe and connected to society. DESCRIPTION: A spatial epidemiology approach was taken, as part of the HHAN feasibility phase, to identify the geographical distribution of the most vulnerable families in Sydney Local Health District (SLHD). A literature review was conducted to identify indicators of family stress and disadvantage, and cluster and hotspot analyses were undertaken. Hotspots of family stress and disadvantage were mapped for SLHD and used to identify areas for HHAN place-based delivery, and for collaborative co-design. DISCUSSION: The HHAN initiative called for consideration of context and the undertaking of collaborative design with communities. The spatial analysis provided a more accurate picture of family stress and disadvantage than previously available and provided a tool that could be used during consultation and planning activities. CONCLUSION: When planning place-based integrated care initiatives, spatial analysis of small geographic scales can allow identification of areas of concentrated or complex disadvantage that may be masked when analysis is performed on larger areas, allowing for targeted, place-based delivery of programs to those most in need.","output":"Using Geospatial Analysis to Inform Development of a Place-Based Integrated Care Initiative: The Healthy Homes and Neighbourhoods Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"LibGuides have been used by librarians at Cape Peninsula University of Technology since 2012 as a means of providing subject-based information to students, with quick links to selected resources and information supplementing information literacy training.

As we move through this pandemic and look into the future of medical education, anatomic virtual models have the potential to be a key educational tool in learning the unique engineering of the human body. In this project, we look into the making of an anatomical structure, the cerebellum, which is located at the base of the skull in the posterior cranial fossa. The cerebellum largely controls the coordination of voluntary movement sequences of the body. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) data and surface and volume rendering technology found in the Amira 5.6 software was used in the creation of a three-dimensional (3D) stereoscopic virtual model of the cerebellum. An outlining process was used for each CTA image that comprised the cerebellum;a total of 73 slices of CTA data were outlined. Each outline was made using the paintbrush, blow, and lasso tools found in Amira 5.6. To refine the selected areas, the paintbrush tool along with the coronal and sagittal views were employed. Each segmented slice was then stacked to create the surface of the cerebellum, generating the 3D stereoscopic model. A smoothing filter was also applied to correct human error. End results show a 3D stereoscopic cerebellum model that can be integrated at various angles and magnifications with orthoslice CTA data and project as a 3D stereoscopic presentation in a virtual environment with a dim light background. We find that the cerebellum stereoscopic model can serve as a virtual learning tool in a classroom setting and allow students to view the cerebellum in a 3D stereoscopic presentation in order to better grasp the spatial relationship of the cerebellum with other structures in the cranial vault.

Drawing on stories shared through solicited diaries followed by in-depth interviews with seven people with sex variations and two parents in the UK, I show how accounts of loneliness help to illuminate the violence of abandonment, silencing and marginalisation that often goes unheard, together with hidden or normalised systems of harm. Building on concepts of ethical loneliness and ontological loneliness, I show how structural violations operate to injure trust and self-worth, leading to social unease. I argue for the importance of people with sex variations finding sites of comfort and acceptance, but note the ways that some forms of medicalisation can inhibit alliances and community formation, despite diagnoses also carrying the potential to facilitate informal support structures and collective identities. By bringing together intersex studies with discourses of loneliness, I develop a better understanding of loneliness as a product of social and systemic violence, and the ways in which medical discourses tie in with larger structures of oppression, coercion and control. This article concludes by underlining the need for structural change in our approach to and understanding of sex variations, and with a call for us to become more attentive to these stories of medical harm, to ensure that they are heard and to seek necessary justice.","output":"The harms of medicalisation: intersex, loneliness and abandonment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The p53/p21 pathway is activated in response to cell stress. However, its role in acute lung injury has not been elucidated. Acute lung injury is associated with disruption of the alveolo-capillary barrier leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support gas exchange in patients with ARDS, however, high positive airway pressures can cause regional overdistension of alveolar units and aggravate lung injury. Here, we report that acute lung injury and alveolar overstretching activate the p53/p21 pathway to maintain homeostasis and avoid massive cell apoptosis. A systematic pooling of transcriptomic data from animal models of lung injury demonstrates the enrichment of specific p53- and p21-dependent gene signatures and a validated senescence profile. In a clinically relevant, murine model of acid aspiration and mechanical ventilation, we observed changes in the nuclear envelope and the underlying chromatin, DNA damage and activation of the Tp53/p21 pathway. Absence of Cdkn1a decreased the senescent response, but worsened lung injury due to increased cell apoptosis. Conversely, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir led to Cdkn1a overexpression and ameliorated cell apoptosis and lung injury. The activation of these mechanisms was associated with early markers of senescence, including expression of senescence-related genes and increases in senescence-associated heterochromatin foci in alveolar cells. Autopsy samples from lungs of patients with ARDS revealed increased senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. Collectively, these results suggest that acute lung injury activates p53/p21 as an anti-apoptotic mechanism to ameliorate damage, but with the side effect of induction of senescence.","output":"Activation of p21 limits acute lung injury and induces early senescence after acid aspiration and mechanical ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As of August 11, 2020, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected 19,936,210 persons and led to 732,499 deaths worldwide. The impact has been immense, and with no vaccine currently available, the best way to protect our communities is health education. We developed a brief COVID-19 knowledge test for health educators that can be used to assess deficits in clients' understanding of the disease. Methods: COVID-19 Knowledge Test items were developed by the research team and administered to participants. An alternate-choice item format was selected for the knowledge test, and data analysis was based on an American sample of 273 respondents. A detailed analysis of the data was conducted with classical test theory and Rasch analysis. Findings: The final instrument was found to be a unidimensional measure of COVID-19 knowledge. Results provided evidence for absolute model fit and model fit for individual items. All items included on the scale were monotonically increasing and split-half reliability was considered acceptable. Total test information revealed that the test is suitable for individuals with low to average knowledge of COVID-19. Interpretation: Rasch analysis provides support for the COVID-19 Knowledge Test to be used as an assessment tool for health educators. The final version of the test consists of 34 high-quality test items that can be administered in <10 min.

This qualitative study assessed the implementation of a co-located dental clinic in a rural community during the pre-implementation phase. Additionally, we sought to determine the needs and expectations of community members living in this rural Washington county. METHODS This study took place in Jefferson County, Washington, a Dental Health Professional Shortage Area. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 42 participants, consisting of administrators (n = 9), health providers (n = 9) and community members (n = 24). Administrators and health providers were interviewed by phone. Community members were interviewed in-person at Jefferson Healthcare primary care clinics or by phone. Interview data were deductively coded, and thematic analysis with a hybrid inductive-deductive approach was used to analyse coded data. RESULTS Five themes were identified regarding local needs and expectations: dental care as a major need in the community, persisting barriers to dental care access, expecting more than a 'Medicaid experience', visions for a clinic that serves the community, and solutions outside the clinic to improve community oral health. CONCLUSIONS By improving access to dental care, a co-located dental clinic is helping to address general dental care needs in rural communities. Policy-level solutions that address housing and food insecurity, improve public transportation, and retain and expand low-income adult Medicaid dental benefits may be needed to overcome persisting barriers to oral health.","output":"Qualitative evaluation of the pre-implementation phase of a rural dental clinic co-located within a health center in the Pacific Northwest of the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work we demonstrate that an impedance derived capacitance method is able to cleanly resolve the resonant conductance characteristics of an electrode-confined polymer film.

Telemedicine is emerging as a cost effective way to enhance patient's care. With the COVID19 pandemic, vitualconsultation had been became more widely used. The effectiveness and safety of tele-health intervention in cardiovascular condition in the UK remains unclear. Aim To describe our early experience and outcomes setting up virtual teleconsultation for stable follow up cardiology patients in a district general hospital. Method Since April 2019, a single cardiologist (AF) started enrolling selected stable cardiology follow up patients onto the virtual follow-up. Following the initial standard consultation, the results of the investigations would be reviewed by the attending cardiologist and subsequent consultation would be carried out via pre-arranged telephone appointment if patients are agreeable. Patient's outcomes and satisfaction survey were collated, sustainability and social benefits and environmental impact of the pilot were analysed. Result A total of 116 patients were enrolled into the pilot. Fifty eight percent were males with an average age of 67 years (range 26-93). Conditions enrolled were: stable ischaemic heart disease (put numbers and percentage 42%), Stable valvular heart disease (26%), arrhythmias (13%), heart failure (9%) and others (9%). Sixty patients (52%) were discharged and 42% (49) patients had further routine tele-clinic follow-up. There were 6% (7) patients failed to attend the telephone consultation. Patients feedback was overwhelmingly positive with the main themes being: Convenience, avoiding car parking congestion, avoiding traffic / transportation issues as well as avoiding overall visit costs. The main concerns raised in patients using tele-consultation were related: 1) Mobile phone connectivity 2) Privacy issues and 3) Logistic of completing pre-requisite investigation prior appointment. Figure 1 demonstrates the clinic's sustainability benefits. The did not attend (DNA) rates were significantly less compared to standard clinic (5.8% vs 8.2%). This pilot saved the trust c.a 3000 on consumables and logistics support and maximised outpatient clinic capacity utilisation. Conclusion Telemedicine had been shown to be a safe and effective method in the care of stable cardiology patients. The social, economic and environmental benefit of tele-consultation raised exciting opportunity for future service designs. Collaboration between hospital specialist, management team, community health providers and communication service suppliers are vital to ensure the sustainable implementation of telemedicine in cardiology.","output":"Out of sight but not out of mind. a district hospital cardiology teleclinic setup? patients', sustainability and environmental benefits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus (CoV) and cause of COVID-19, which is much more lethal in older people and those with comorbid conditions for unknown reasons. Innate immune responses to CoVs are initiated by recognition of double-stranded RNA and induction of interferon, which turns on a gene expression program that inhibits viral replication. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, ferrets and a person strikingly dysregulates the NAD gene set by inducing a set of PARP family members that includes enzymes required for the innate immune response to CoVs. CoV infection also induces a severe attack on host cell NAD. Overexpression of one induced enzyme, PARP10, is sufficient to depress host NAD. Gene expression and pharmacological data suggest that boosting NAD through the nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside kinase pathways may restore antiviral PARP functions to support innate immunity to CoVs, whereas PARP1,2 inhibition does not restore PARP10 activity.","output":"Coronavirus and PARP expression dysregulate the NAD Metabolome: a potentially actionable component of innate immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper provides insights into the mental health consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from the Central, Eastern, Nordic, Southern, and Western subregions of Europe, represented by five member countries of the European Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ESTSS). On the basis of the existing national research and experiences in these countries, we propose five lessons learned. (1) There is no evidence of a mental health pandemic so far in the countries in focus. No increase in severe mental disorders but some increase in the symptoms of common mental health disorders are observable. More high-quality longitudinal studies are needed to understand the mental health burden of the pandemic. (2) The pandemic affects countries (including the mental health situation) differently, depending on the level of the exposure, management policies, pre-pandemic structural characteristics, and healthcare resources. (3) The pandemic affects people differently: the exposure severity to pandemic-related stressors differs between individuals, as well as individual resources to cope with these stressors. There are winners and losers as well as identifiable at-risk groups that need particular attention. (4) Besides the negative consequences, the pandemic has had a positive impact. The rapidly applied innovations within the system of healthcare responses provide a window of opportunity for positive changes in mental healthcare policies, strategies, and practices. The increased focus on mental health during the pandemic may contribute to the prioritization of mental health issues at policy-making and organizational levels and may reduce stigma. (5) A stress- and trauma-informed response to COVID-19 is required. The European community of psychotraumatologists under the leadership of ESTSS plays an important role in promoting stress- and trauma-informed healthcare and policies of pandemic management. Based on the lessons learned, we propose a stepped-care public mental health model for the prevention of adverse mental health outcomes during pandemics.

TAGs consider promising biotechnological importance to produce biodiesel; thus, LD is considered a tremendous scientific concern in the modern era. As such, the LD assembly through microorganisms becomes an evident alternative against animal and plant-derived sources for economic reasons.

Thus, to enhance the LD concentration, novel research was designed to induce alternate high and low sound frequency at a regular interval on a yeast model organism. The control and treated yeast samples further investigated using biochemical, biophysical, and computational tools to conclude that cells increase lipid droplet production under noise exposure. Further, it regulates cell proliferation and maintains the ROS level; hence, persistent noise exposure acts as an inducer of LD accumulation with maintaining cell toxicity.

Affected patients have severe clinical symptoms, worsened quality of life, and do not respond to steroid, a mainstay steroid treatment of asthma. Thus, effective therapies are urgently needed. Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cell (MSC-Exo) has become attractive candidates for the lung inflammatory diseases through its immunomodulatory effects. In this study, we explored the therapeutic effects of MSC-Exo in SSRA and identified the therapeutic mechanism of MSC-Exo. METHOD: Exosomes from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (hUCMSC) were isolated and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and flow cytometry analysis. Effects of MSC-Exo on airway hyper responsiveness (AHR), inflammation, histopathology, and macrophage polarization in SSRA in mice were evaluated. Systematic depletion of macrophages determined the role of macrophages in the therapeutic effect of SSRA in mice. LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cell model was constructed to determine the underlying mechanism of MSC-Exo on macrophage polarization. qRT-PCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry were performed to evaluate the expression of M1 or M2 markers. Tandem mass tags (TMT)-labeled quantitative proteomics were applied to explore the central protein during the regulation effect of MSC-Exo on macrophage polarization. Knockdown and overexpression of TRAF1 were used to further clarify the role of the central protein on macrophage polarization. RESULT: We successfully isolated and characterized exosomes from hUCMSCs. We verified that the intratracheal administration of MSC-Exo reversed AHR, histopathology changes, and inflammation in SSRA mice. Systematic depletion of macrophages weakened the therapeutic effect of MSC-Exo. We found that MSC-Exo treatment inhibited M1 polarization and promoted M2 polarization in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Subsequently, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) was determined as the central protein which may be closely related to the regulation of macrophage polarization from TMT-labeled quantitative proteomics analysis. Knockdown and overexpression of TRAF1 demonstrated that the effect of MSC-Exo treatment on macrophage polarization, NF-B and PI3K/AKT signaling was dependent on TRAF1. CONCLUSION: MSC-Exo can ameliorate SSRA by moderating inflammation, which is achieved by reshaping macrophage polarization via inhibition of TRAF1.","output":"Exosomes from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells attenuate the inflammation of severe steroid-resistant asthma by reshaping macrophage polarization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has, among other aspects of society, affected education worldwide Estonian schools moved to e-learning on March 16 Estonia had a pre-existing high level of technology integration in education, and teachers already felt confident using technology in the teaching process before the emergency situation This paper outlines the observed activity in the Facebook community 'Homeschooling with technology', which has around 8,000 members in the period March 6 to April 25, 2020 912 messages were posted during this period The materials shared in the group mostly included web-based tools and methodological recommendations on using these tools to support less experienced teachers For the study, 10% of the most popular messages, based on comments and reactions, were selected and coded by two independent researchers The paper describes the content of these messages and the roles of the members who posted them Based on our results, we suggest that social network groups offer teachers both professional and emotional support during school closure periods It would be advisable for this group to include other stakeholders in addition to teachers in order to keep all parties concerned up to date with each other's problems, thus allowing them to make the necessary changes and receive support where needed ? 2020 Academic Conferences Limited All rights reserved","output":"Activity of estonian facebook group during transition to e-learning due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has changed our lives and continues to have a drastic impact It forces us to impose restrictive social distancing measures and leads us to rely more on the Internet Mobile networks become one of the major means to access the Internet for most of us We investigate the performance of 9 mobile networks in Europe around the time when restrictions were imposed, considering web QoE, throughput, RTT, and signal coverage Our results show countries' mobile networks are impacted by COVID-19 (as high as 46 % increase in page load time) at different times based on the outbreak timelines in these countries Moreover, we find that operators responded properly and the network performance is back to the pre-COVID-19 times ? 2020 ACM","output":"Mobile Network Performance during the COVID-19 Outbreak from a Testbed Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS\\\\CoV) is a novel Coronavirus which was responsible of the first case of human acute respiratory syndrome in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), 2012.

However, there is a lack of evidence specific to the low/lower-middle-income country (L-LMIC) health systems on how IHSD is used during disease outbreaks. This scoping review aimed to synthesise the emerging evidence on IHSD approaches adopted in L-LMIC during the COVID-19 pandemic and systematically collate their operational features. METHODS: A systematic scoping review of peer-reviewed literature, published in English between 1 December 2019 and 12 June 2020, from seven electronic databases was conducted to explore the evidence of IHSD implemented in L-LMICs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were systematically charted, and key features of IHSD systems were presented according to the postulated research questions of the review. RESULTS: The literature search retrieved 1487 published articles from which 18 articles met the inclusion criteria and included in this review. Service delivery, health workforce, medicine and technologies were the three most frequently integrated health system building blocks during the COVID-19 pandemic. While responding to COVID-19, the L-LMICs principally implemented the IHSD system via systematic horizontal integration, led by specific policy measures. The governments stewardship, along with the decentralised decision-making capacity of local institutions and multisectoral collaboration, was the critical facilitator for IHSD. Simultaneously, fragmented service delivery structures, fragile supply chain, inadequate diagnostic capacity and insufficient workforce were key barriers towards integration. CONCLUSION: A wide array of context-specific IHSD approaches were operationalised in L-LMICs during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging recommendations emphasise the importance of coordination and integration across building blocks and levels of the health system, supported by a responsive governance structure and stakeholder engagement strategies. Future reviews can revisit this emerging evidence base at subsequent phases of COVID-19 response and recovery in L-LMICs to understand how the approaches highlighted here evolve.","output":"Integrated health service delivery during COVID-19: a scoping review of published evidence from low-income and lower-middle-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most frequent and severe complication after thoracic surgery is pneumonia. Hypoventilation due to pain and insufficient cough is the reason for postoperative pneumonia after thoracic surgery. There is a risk index developed from preoperative patients and operation-specific risk factors. The risk index may be useful for high-risk patients; therefore giving these patient groups more attention in the perioperative period and taking preventive measures may reduce the incidence of pneumonia. Postoperative period composed of pulmonary rehabilitation and analgesia includes breathing exercise, cough training, self-management education, and psychosocial support, and they have been shown to decrease complications. According to some new studies, paravertebral block has similar analgesic effects with thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA). Although paravertebral block has fewer adverse effects, TEA is still the gold standard for pain relief after thoracotomies. The incidence of pneumonia varies in the literature because there is no gold standard for the diagnosis of postoperative pneumonia.

Most commonly employed technologies for this purpose are transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), homing-endonucleases or meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) associated protein 9 (Cas9). Among these tools, CRISPR/Cas9 is most preferred because it's easy to use, has a small mutation rate, has great effectiveness, low cost of development, and decreased rate of advancement. CRISPR/Cas9 has a lot of applications in plants, animals, humans, and microbes. It also has applications in many fields such as horticulture, cancer, food biotechnology, and targeted human genome treatments. CRISPR technology has shown great potential for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic to provide early and easy detection methods, possible treatment, and vaccine development. In the present review, genome-editing tools with their basic assembly and features have been discussed.

We evaluate the costs and benefits of testing strategies to reduce the infection risks of full-time in-person K-8 education at different levels of community incidence. METHODS: We used an agent-based network model to simulate transmission in elementary and middle school communities, parameterized to a US school structure and assuming dominance of the delta COVID-19 variant. We assess the value of different strategies for testing students and faculty/staff, including expanded diagnostic testing (test to stay policies that take the place of isolation for symptomatic students or quarantine for exposed classrooms); screening (routinely testing asymptomatic individuals to identify infections and contain transmission); and surveillance (testing a random sample of students to signaling undetected transmission and trigger additional investigation or interventions). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We project 30-day cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection; proportion of cases detected; proportion of planned and unplanned days out of school; and the cost of testing programs and of childcare costs associated with different strategies. For screening policies, we further estimate cost per SARS-CoV-2 infection averted in students and staff, and for surveillance, probability of correctly or falsely triggering an outbreak response at different incidence and attack rates. RESULTS: Accounting for programmatic and childcare costs, test to stay policies achieve similar model-projected transmission to quarantine policies, with reduced overall costs. Weekly universal screening prevents approximately 50% of in-school transmission, with a lower projected societal cost than hybrid or remote schooling. The cost per infection averted in students and staff by weekly screening is lower for older students and schools with higher mitigation and declines as community transmission rises. In settings where local student incidence is unknown or rapidly changing, surveillance may trigger detection of moderate-to-large in-school outbreaks with fewer resources compared to screening. CONCLUSIONS: Test to stay policies and/or screening tests can facilitate consistent in-person school attendance with low transmission risk across a range of community incidence. Surveillance may be a useful reduced-cost option for detecting outbreaks and identifying school environments that may benefit from increased mitigation.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies to contain school-associated transmission: model-based analysis of impact and cost of diagnostic testing, screening, and surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of self-reported financial conflict-of-interest (COI) disclosures in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) within the requisite disclosure period prior to article submission. DESIGN: Cross-sectional investigation. DATA SOURCES: Original clinical-trial research articles published in NEJM (n=206) or JAMA (n=188) from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017; self-reported COI disclosure forms submitted to NEJM or JAMA with the authors published articles; Open Payments website (from database inception; latest search: August 2019). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Financial data reported to Open Payments from 2014 to 2016 (a time period that included all subjects requisite disclosure windows) were compared with self-reported disclosure forms submitted to the journals. Payments selected for analysis were defined by Open Payments as general payments. Payment types were categorised as disclosed, undisclosed, indeterminate or unrelated. RESULTS: Thirty-one articles from NEJM and 31 articles from JAMA met inclusion criteria. The physician-authors (n=118) received a combined total of US$7.48 million. Of the 106 authors (89.8%) who received payments, 86 (81.1%) received undisclosed payments.

Survivorship care plans should address five key areas that include surveillance and screening for new/reoccurring cancer; management of long-term effects of cancer treatment; health promotion; and care coordination/practice implications. To maximize the benefit of survivorship care for rural BCS, it is necessary to better understand their experiences and preferences. METHODS A systematic review of the extant literature addressing the survivorship needs and interventions for rural BCS was conducted. The following databases were searched for reports published between January, 2007, and December, 2018: PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, PsycINFO (EBSCO), CAB Direct, and Sociological Abstracts. Reports published after 2007 with samples including and comprised of rural BCS in the United States were included. Screening of the search results followed PRISMA guidelines using Covidence systematic review software. RESULTS Findings were extracted from 30 reports disseminating findings of 14 research studies. The five areas of a survivorship care were counted/accounted for during data extraction. The included reports concentrated on health promotion (e.g., weight loss and exercise) and the management of long-term effects of cancer treatment as key outcomes. There is a gap in the literature addressing care coordination, surveillance, and screening. CONCLUSION Additional research including interventions for rural BCS that address more survivorship care areas would benefit this population and improve survivorship quality of life for rural BCS.","output":"Breast cancer survivorship in rural settings: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fewer ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) presentations and increased delays in care occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in urban areas. Whether these associations occurred in a more rural population has not been previously reported. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on time-to-presentation for STEMI in rural locations. Patients presenting to a large STEMI network spanning 27 facilities and 13 predominantly rural counties between January 1, 2016 and April 30, 2020 were included. Presentation delays, defined as time from symptom onset to arrival at the first medical facility, classified as 12 and 24 hours from symptom onset were compared among patients in the preCCOVID-19 and the early COVID-19 eras. To account for patient-level differences, 2:1 propensity score matching was performed using binary logistic regression. Among 1,286 patients with STEMI, 1,245 patients presented in the preCCOVID-19 era and 41 presented during the early COVID-19 era. Presentation delays 12 hours (19.5% vs 4.0%) and 24 hours (14.6% and 0.2%) were more common in COVID-19 than preCCOVID-19 cohorts (p <0.001 for both), despite a low COVID-19 prevalence. Similar results were seen in propensity-matched comparisons (12 hours: 19.5% vs 2.4%, p = 0.002; 24 hours 14.6% vs 0.0%, p = 0.001). In a predominantly rural STEMI population, delays in seeking medical care after symptom onset were markedly more frequent during the COVID-19 era, despite low COVID-19 prevalence. Considering delays in reperfusion have multiple adverse downstream consequences, these findings may have important implications in rural communities during future pandemic resurgences.","output":"Pandemic-Associated Delays in Myocardial Infarction Presentation in Predominantly Rural Counties With Low COVID-19 Prevalence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Permacol? collagen paste (Permacol? paste) is an acellular cross-linked porcine dermal collagen matrix suspension for use in soft tissue repair. The use of Permacol? paste in the filling of anorectal fistula tract is a new sphincter-preserving method for fistula repair. The MASERATI100 study was a prospective, observational clinical study with the objective to assess the efficacy of Permacol? collagen paste for anal fistula repair in 100 patients. METHOD Patients (N=100) with anal fistula were treated at ten European surgical sites with a sphincter-preserving technique using Permacol? paste. Fistula healing was assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, with the primary endpoint being healing at 6 months. Faecal continence and patient satisfaction were surveyed at each follow-up; adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the follow-up. RESULTS At 6 months post-surgery, 56.7% of patients were healed, and the percentage healed was largely maintained, with 53.5% healed at 12 months. 29.0% of patients had at least one AE, and 16.0% of patients had one or more procedure-related AE. Most AEs reported were minor and similar to those commonly observed after fistula treatment, and the incidence of serious adverse events was low (4.0% of patients).

From a meta-strategy perspective, these four policies cover the full spectrum of anti-pandemic policies. We argue that, among numerous factors influencing strategic policy-making, the competence of advisory body such as CDC chief-scientist (say, Cindy) and politics in decision-making body such as president (David), and their cooperation/communication can be critical. Here we investigate anti-pandemic policy-making by harnessing the power of evolutionary game theory in modeling competition/cooperation/communication (three critical processes underlying biological and social evolutions). Specifically, we apply the Sir Philip Sydney (SPS) game, a 4x4 signaler-responder evolutionary game with 16 strategic interactions, which was devised to investigate the reliability of communication that can modulate competition and cooperation, to capture rich idiosyncrasies surrounding today's anti-pandemic policies.

A total of 121 couples completed a 10-minute discussion about an area of disagreement in their relationship and a 5-minute discussion in which they planned an event together. We used a dynamical model of heart rate changes to estimate coregulation. We found that (a) increases in state attachment avoidance were associated with contrarian coregulation (heart rate becoming misaligned with the partner's physiology) and (b) conversely, increases in state attachment anxiety were associated with dependent coregulation (heart rate becoming aligned with the partners' physiology). Dispositional attachment insecurity moderated the effects of state attachment insecurity on physiological coregulation.

MethodsThis is a retrospective analysis of patients with primary and/or secondary immunodeficiency-associated antibody disorders who received casirivimab and imdevimab (REGEN-COV(R)) under emergency compassionate use. The objectives were to describe safety and response to REGEN-COV, with a focus on the subset of patients who had COVID-19 duration []21 days prior to treatment. Quantitative (change in oxygenation status and/or viral load) and/or qualitative (physician-reported clinical status) patient outcomes data are reported. ResultsOutcome data are available from 64 patients who received REGEN-COV. Improvement in []1 outcome measure was observed in 90.6% of the overall patient group. Thirty-seven of these patients had COVID-19 duration []21 days prior to treatment, with a median time from RT-PCR diagnosis to REGEN-COV administration of 60.5 days. Of the 29 patients with COVID-19 duration []21 days prior to treatment who had available outcome data, 96.6% showed improvement in []1 outcome measure evaluated following use of REGEN-COV. In the 14 patients who had post-treatment RT-PCR results available, 11 (78.6%) reported a negative RT-PCR following treatment with REGEN-COV, with 5 patients (45.5%) reporting a negative RT-PCR within 5 days of treatment and 8 (72.7%) reporting a negative RT-PCR within 21 days of treatment.

Some studies found that COVID-19 appears to be more lethal in patients with lung cancer than in other cancer patients. In order to take appropriate measures to balance a delay in lung cancer treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure, we first need to know whether patients with lung cancer have special risks. We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine differences in terms of presentation and outcomes between patients with lung cancer as opposed to other solid organ cancer after infection with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A comprehensive search of published original research studies will be performed in Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, WangFangData, CQVIP, COMPENDEX and CNKI. The medRxiv preprint server will also be searched for applicable studies (grey literature). Original research studies will be included if they include patients with: (A) laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and (B) confirmed solid cancer, and (C) measurable clinical presentation or outcome, such as mortality rate, intensive care unit admission rate, incidence of pneumonia. One author will conduct the electronic database searches, two authors will independently screen studies, two will extract data and two will assess study quality. If I2 exceeds 60% for the pooled analysis, we will explore sources of heterogeneity in subgroups of studies. We will use fixed-effect, random-effects or mixed-effects models to estimate the relative risk or OR. If the data reporting allows, a subgroup analysis between non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer patients will be performed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The proposed study will not collect individual-level data and, therefore, does not require ethical approval. We will submit our findings to a peer-reviewed scientific journal and will disseminate results through presentations at international scientific conferences.

The internet and social media have become important sources of health-related information on COVID-19 and on protective behaviors. In addition, the COVID-19 infodemic is spreading faster than the coronavirus itself, which interferes with governmental health-related communication efforts. This jeopardizes national public health containment strategies. Therefore, digital health literacy is a key competence to navigate web-based COVID-19-related information and service environments. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate university students' digital health literacy and web-based information-seeking behaviors during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. METHODS: A cross-sectional study among 14,916 university students aged &#8805;18 years from 130 universities across all 16 federal states of Germany was conducted using a web-based survey. Along with sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, subjective social status), the measures included five subscales from the Digital Health Literacy Instrument (DHLI), which was adapted to the specific context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Web-based information-seeking behavior was investigated by examining the web-based sources used by university students and the topics that the students searched for in connection with COVID-19. Data were analyzed using univariate and bivariate analyses. RESULTS: Across digital health literacy dimensions, the greatest difficulties could be found for assessing the reliability of health-related information (5964/14,103, 42.3%) and the ability to determine whether the information was written with a commercial interest (5489/14,097, 38.9%). Moreover, the respondents indicated that they most frequently have problems finding the information they are looking for (4282/14,098, 30.4%). When stratified according to sociodemographic characteristics, significant differences were found, with female university students reporting a lower DHLI for the dimensions of \\"information searching\\" and \\"evaluating reliability.\\" Search engines, news portals, and websites of public bodies were most often used by the respondents as sources to search for information on COVID-19 and related issues. Female students were found to use social media and health portals more frequently, while male students used Wikipedia and other web-based encyclopedias as well as YouTube more often. The use of social media was associated with a low ability to critically evaluate information, while the opposite was observed for the use of public websites. CONCLUSIONS: Although digital health literacy is well developed in university students, a significant proportion of students still face difficulties with certain abilities to evaluate information. There is a need to strengthen the digital health literacy capacities of university students using tailored interventions. Improving the quality of health-related information on the internet is also key.","output":"Digital Health Literacy and Web-Based Information-Seeking Behaviors of University Students in Germany During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Transgastric NOTES(?) procedures remain without a simple method to close the gastrotomy.

Toxic elements, hydrocarbons, shell deformities, presence of tumors, imposex, and morphological relationships were analyzed. Two years after the stranding occurred, high cyanide concentrations (0.0363 mg/l) and Ni concentrations above permissible limits (3.35 mg/l) were found in surface seawater.

Within an already under-funded public health sector, it is imperative that the costs and effects of potential interventions to care are assessed and weighed against the opportunity costs of their required investment. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of ICU management for admitted COVID-19 patients across the public and private health sector in South Africa. Methods: Using a Markov modelling framework and a health system perspective, the costs and health outcomes of inpatient management of severe and critical COVID-19 patients in (1) general ward and intensive care (GW+ICU) and (2) general ward only were assessed. Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were evaluated as health outcomes, and the cost per admission from public and private sectors was determined. The models made use of four variables: mortality rates, utilisation of inpatient days for each management approach, disability weights associated to the severity of the disease, and the unit cost per general ward day and per ICU day in public and private hospitals. The unit costs were multiplied by utilisation estimates to determine the cost per admission. DALYs were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD). An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) - representing the difference in costs and health outcomes of the two management strategies - was calculated and compared to a cost-effectiveness threshold to determine the value for money of ICU management. Results: A cost per admission of ZAR 75,127 was estimated for inpatient management of severe and critical COVID-19 patients in general wards only as opposed to ZAR 103,030 in GW+ICU. DALYs were 1.48 and 1.10 in the general ward only and GW+ICU, respectively. The ratio of difference in costs and health outcomes between the two management strategies produced an ICER equal to ZAR 73 091 per DALY averted, a value above the cost-effectiveness threshold of ZAR 38 465. Conclusions: This study indicated that purchasing additional ICU capacity from the private sector may not be a cost-effective use of limited health resources. The real time, rapid, pragmatic, and transparent nature of this analysis demonstrates a potential approach for further evidence generation for decision making relating to the COVID-19 pandemic response and the wider priority setting agenda in South Africa.","output":"Cost-effectiveness of intensive care for hospitalized Covid-19 patients: experience from South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, the medical community continues to report a variety of clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 in the pediatric population.

We discuss the first case of delayed presentation of pericarditis following recovery from COVID-19 infection in the pediatric population. A 15-year-old male adolescent presented to the emergency department (ED) with a two-day history of left-sided, sub-sternal chest pain that worsened during inspiration and a low-grade fever. Twenty days prior to this presentation, the patient experienced fever and was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. His family history was remarkable for Hashimoto thyroiditis and rheumatoid arthritis, with his mother having experienced 18 episodes of pericarditis during the exacerbations of her disease. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative on this occasion and the serology assay identified positive IgG antibodies against the virus. The ECG was suggestive for pericarditis and the diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of pericardial effusion on ECHO. The rest of the aetiological investigations for pericarditis were negative. In view of the strong family history of autoimmunity, questions were raised in the medical team of our hospital regarding the etiology of his pericarditis and on whether it represented a postinflammatory immune-mediated presentation of SARS-CoV-2 or a new-onset autoimmune disease.","output":"Pericarditis Following Recovery From COVID-19 Infection in a 15-Year-Old Boy: A Postinflammatory Immune-Mediated Presentation or a New-Onset Autoimmune Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sex differences in immune responses are well known.

In this study, we identified coupling between the brain and the heart along the continuum of sedation levels, but not in discrete sedation levels (e. g., wakefulness, conscious sedation, and deep sedation). To identify coupling between the brain and the heart during sedation, we induced several depths of sedation using patient-controlled sedation with propofol and midazolam. We performed electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analysis and extracted the instantaneous heart rate (HR) from the electrocardiogram (ECG). EEG spectral power dynamics and mean HR were compared along the continuum of sedation levels. We found that EEG sigma power was the parameter most sensitive to changes in the sedation level and was correlated with the mean HR under the effect of sedative agents. Moreover, we calculated the Granger causality (GC) value to quantify brain-heart coupling at each sedation level. Additionally, the GC analysis revealed noticeably different strengths and directions of causality among different sedation levels. In all the sedation levels, GC values from the brain to the heart (GCbh) were higher than GC values from the heart to the brain (GChb). Moreover, the mean GCbh increased as the sedation became deeper, resulting in higher GCbh values in deep sedation (1.97  0.18 in propofol, 2.02  0.15 in midazolam) than in pre-sedation (1.71  0.13 in propofol, 1.75  0.11 in midazolam; p < 0.001). These results show that coupling between brain and heart activities becomes stronger as sedation becomes deeper, and that this coupling is more attributable to the brain-heart direction than to the heart-brain direction.

This project investigates interpersonal and community-level factors of the social ecological model that affect food choices, self-efficacy, and coping mechanisms among food insecure college students during the pandemic. Describe facilitators and barriers to food security among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. After IRB approval was obtained, participants (n = 18) were interviewed via a video-conferencing platform to investigate interpersonal coping mechanisms related to food security. Inclusion criteria encompassed current enrollment, participation in the on-campus food pantry, and age less than 30 years. Interviews focused on students' food acquisition and utilization, experiences with food insecurity before and during the pandemic, and feelings of stress. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and themed using a 2-coder method. Students identified lack of knowledge about food assistance programs, confusion over food assistance qualification, and lack of transportation to food assistance sites as perceived barriers to improving food security during the pandemic. Primary coping mechanisms and facilitators to obtaining food were food pantry utilization, social support through food sharing, participation in the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and engagement with community support programs. COVID-19 has further exacerbated college students' vulnerability to food insecurity. College students have limited access to SNAP and rely on interpersonal relationships and community resources to maintain food security. Findings describe unique coping strategies to access food and identify strategies to improve college student food security during the pandemic. United Way for Greater Austin.

Given this backdrop, this paper analyses the drivers of corporate tax rates during the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., in 2020 and 2021). The results from 113 advanced and developing economies show that a higher level of the COVID-19-related uncertainty is positively associated with the corporate tax rates. Similarly, the country size (measured by total population) increases the corporate tax rates. Per capita income is negatively related to the corporate tax rates, but this evidence is insufficient to consider different estimation techniques. The paper also discusses potential fiscal policy implications for the driving mechanism of corporate tax rates for the post-COVID-19 era.","output":"What Determine the Corporate Tax Rates During the COVID-19?

MicroRNAs play essential roles in regulating the cell's biological processes, such as apoptosis, migration, lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, and adipocyte differentiation, by controlling the posttranscriptional gene expression level. The impact of current NAFLD pharmacological management, including drug and biological therapies, is uncertain. In this context, various dietary fruits or medicinal herbal sources have received worldwide attention versus NAFLD development.

METHODS A cross-sectional study design was used to estimate the point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a rapid immunoglobulin (Ig)M-IgG combined point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay among frontline firefighters/paramedics collected over a 2-day period, 16-17 April 2020. Fire department personnel were emailed a survey link assessing COVID-19 symptoms and work exposures the day prior to the scheduled drive-through antibody testing at a designated fire station. Off-duty and on-duty firefighter/paramedic personnel drove through the fire station/training facility in their personal vehicles or on-duty engine/rescue trucks for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. RESULTS Among the 203 firefighters/paramedics that make up the fire department workforce, 18 firefighters/paramedics (8.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, of which 8 firefighters/paramedics (3.9%) were IgG positive only, 8 (3.9%) were IgM positive only and 2 (0.1%) were IgG/IgM positive. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the serological test is estimated to be 33.2% and the negative predictive value is 99.3%. The average number of COVID-19 case contacts (ie, within 6 feet of an infected person (laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19 patient) for 15 min) experienced by firefighters/paramedics was higher for those with positive serology compared with those with negative (13.3 cases vs 7.31 cases; p=0.022). None of the antibody positive firefighters/paramedics reported receipt of the annual influenza vaccine compared with firefighters/paramedics who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (0.0% vs 21.0%; p=0.027). CONCLUSION Rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgM-IgG antibody testing documented early-stage and late-stage infection in a firefighter workforce providing insight to a broader medical surveillance project on return to work for firefighters/paramedics. Given the relatively low PPV of the serological test used in this study back in April 2020, caution should be used in interpreting test results.","output":"Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among firefighters/paramedics of a US fire department: a cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A doctor-patient relationship built on the concept of empathy is so essential to attain the best clinical outcomes in medicine. Since empathy has a positive role in interpersonal relationships and medical outcomes, its assessment is highly crucial. The aim of this study was to assess the empathy in last-year medical students using the Persian version of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) and correlate empathy scores with demographic features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, last-year medical students at Shiraz Medical School, Shiraz, Iran, were recruited for this study. In this research, we used the Persian version of JSPE. The validity and reliability of the Persian version of this tool were confirmed in the previous research. For the analysis of data, we employed descriptive statistics and the independent sample t-test. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-five final-year medical students were included in this study. The maximum score of the questionnaire was 140, and the total mean score of empathy was 98.15  13.29. The females' total mean score (102.05  11.89) was higher than the males' score (93.57  13.46). The difference between the mean score of gender and empathy was significant (P value <.001), but there was no significant difference between empathy and the two other demographic factors (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although physicians would gain the essential characteristics of empathy during their career, attending professors and other responsible policymakers in medical education should focus more on the factors related to physicians' empathy to train better and more professional physicians.","output":"Assessing empathy in final-year medical students using the Persian version of the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Democracy in Indonesia is under attack from within.

However, there has been limited investigation into the experiences of adolescents in undertaking this treatment. This qualitative study explored adolescents experiences of being treated for an anxiety disorder, using an online intervention with therapist support, as part of a randomised controlled trial. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirteen adolescents aged between 13 and 17 years, who had received the online intervention. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Two cross-cutting themes were identified: (i) Usability of the program, and (ii) Putting techniques into practice. Although the convenience of online sessions was recognised as positive, many of the adolescents expressed a preference for face-to-face sessions. The length of sessions and the large amount of reading involved was highlighted by most participants. The transdiagnostic nature of the content meant some elements of the programme were seen as less relevant. While many participants appreciated the fun aspect of the program, others felt that certain aspects of the program were not suitable for their age group. Exposure, psychoeducation and cognitive restructuring were generally received positively, whereas responses to the use of relaxation and rewards were much more mixed. Our findings highlight the potential utility for online treatments delivered with therapist support. However, they also highlight how issues with both the format and treatment components can impact the acceptability of a program. As such, further work is warranted to improve the acceptability of online treatments for adolescents with anxiety disorders.

METHODS Searches were conducted in Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Embase, and Web of Science. Identified papers were assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool. Data were extracted into NVivo12 and analyzed by qualitative description and, where appropriate, thematic analysis. RESULTS The search yielded 628 papers, of which 40 (33 studies) were eligible (6%). Although the methodological quality of the papers was low, we identified concerns that were consistently reported over time and from different perspectives. Individual family members had varying psychosocial needs to be addressed within healthcare, schooling, and public policy. These include for survivor's mental health (particularly for body image), and to the disproportionate biopsychosocial burden faced by mother-caregivers.

In addition, the prevalence of obesity, high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke and depression is calculated for diabetes and non-diabetes patients, and the prevalence ratio (PR) is determined as a quotient. The approach used was a case-control design, which assigns a control person without diabetes to each diabetes patient who is similar in terms of age, region and sex. In diabetes patients, a PR greater than 1 was observed for all examined diseases across all age groups, thus demonstrating a higher prevalence compared to persons without diabetes. The highest PR across all age groups for women (3.8) and men (3.7) was found for obesity. In a comparison over time, documented prevalence figures of diabetes in Germany stagnate.

We first performed a retrospective chart review of 129 pediatric patients referred to the free Yale Pediatric Winchester Chest Tuberculosis Clinic from 2016C2019. Associations between demographic/clinical variables and missed appointments/failure to complete therapy were analyzed using univariate and bivariate chi-square tests.

Based on satellite and in-situ measurements for the years 2005-2019 over 50 cities in eastern China, we find that the atmospheric NO2 pollution dropped by ~40% during the SF week, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) decreased by ~30% in the following week, reflecting the effectiveness of precursor emission controls on the mitigation of secondary PM2.5 formation. However, although human activity and emissions are at the lowest level, air pollution over eastern China during the SF still far exceeds that over other worldwide pollution hotspots.

Although most patients present a mild infection, effective strategies are required for patients who develop the severe disease. Anti-inflammatory treatment with JAK inhibitors has been considered in SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this study, we presented our experience in a group of severe SARS-CoV-2 Chilean patients. This prospective study was performed on consecutive patients presenting severe respiratory failure owing to COVID-19 or high-risk clinical condition associated with SARS-CoV-2, and who were treated with ruxolitinib for management of associated inflammation. Overall, 18 patients presenting SARS-CoV-2 viral-induced hyperinflammation were treated with ruxolitinib, with 16 patients previously treated with steroids, 4 with tocilizumab, and 3 with both treatments. RESULTS: Ten patients evolved with favorable response, including 7 patients admitted with severe respiratory failure (PaFi less than 200 mm Hg in high-flow nasal cannula), presenting complete regression of hyperinflammation, regression of the lung lesions, and subsequent discharge. In the remaining 8 patients, 25% showed reduced inflammation, but early discharge was not achieved owing to the slow evolution of respiratory failure. Unfortunately, 3 patients demonstrated a severe respiratory failure. The early initiation of ruxolitinib was found to be associated with better clinical evolution (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: In this study, ruxolitinib resolved hyperinflammatory state in 55% of the patients, regardless of the previous steroid or tocilizumab therapy. Unfortunately, few patients demonstrated severe evolution despite ruxolitinib therapy. Notably, the treatment starting time appears to play an important role in achieving good outcomes.

Variations in climatic and economic conditions significantly impact the economic feasibility and productivity of such fuel systems, requiring harmonized technoeconomic assessments to identify important conditions required for commercial scale up. METHODS: Here, our previously validated Techno-economic and Lifecycle Analysis (TELCA) platform was extended to provide a direct performance comparison of microalgae diesel production at 12 international locations with variable climatic and economic settings. For each location, historical weather data, and jurisdiction-specific policy and economic inputs were used to simulate algal productivity, evaporation rates, harvest regime, CapEx and OpEx, interest and tax under location-specific operational parameters optimized for Minimum Diesel Selling Price (MDSP, US$ L(?1)). The economic feasibility, production capacity and CO(2-eq) emissions of a defined 500 ha algae-based diesel production facility is reported for each. RESULTS: Under a for-profit business model, 10 of the 12 locations achieved a minimum diesel selling price (MDSP) under US$ 1.85 L(?1) / US$ 6.99 gal(?1). At a fixed theoretical MDSP of US$ 2 L(?1) (US$ 7.57 gal(?1)) these locations could achieve a profitable Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 9.5C22.1%. Under a public utility model (0% profit, 0% tax) eight locations delivered cost-competitive renewable diesel at an MDSP of < US$ 1.24 L(?1) (US$ 4.69 gal(?1)). The CO(2-eq) emissions of microalgae diesel were about one-third of fossil-based diesel. CONCLUSIONS: The public utility approach could reduce the fuel price toward cost-competitiveness, providing a key step on the path to a profitable fully commercial renewable fuel industry by attracting the investment needed to advance technology and commercial biorefinery co-production options. Governments adoption of such an approach could accelerate decarbonization, improve fuel security, and help support a local COVID-19 economic recovery.

Person Re-Identification (Re-ID), as one of elementary learning tasks for video surveillance, is to track and identify a given pedestrian in a multi-camera scene. In general, most existing methods has firstly adopted a CNN based detector to obtain the cropped pedestrian image, it then aims to learn a specific distance metric for retrieval. However, unlabeled gallery images are generally overlooked and not utilized in the training. On the other hands, Manifold Embedding (ME) has well been applied to Person Re-ID as it is good to characterize the geometry of database associated with the query data. However, ME has its limitation to be scalable to large-scale data due to the huge computational complexity for graph construction and ranking. To handle this problem, we in this paper propose a novel scalable manifold embedding approach for Person Re-ID task. The new method is to incorporate both graph weight construction and manifold regularized term in the same framework. The graph we developed is discriminative and doubly-stochastic so that the side information has been considered so that it can enhance the clustering performances. The doubly-stochastic property can also guarantee the graph is highly robust and less sensitive to the parameters. Meriting from such a graph, we then incorporate the graph construction, the subspace learning method in the unified loss term. Therefore, the subspace results can be utilized into the graph construction, and the updated graph can in turn incorporate discriminative information for graph embedding. Extensive simulations is conducted based on three benchmark Person Re-ID datasets and the results verify that the proposed method can achieve better ranking performance compared with other state-of-the-art graph-based methods.","output":"Person re-identification via semi-supervised adaptive graph embedding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has been cause for alarm for nations around the globe.

Herein, we demonstrate both energy harvesting and storage devices such as piezoelectric nanogenerator (PNG) and piezo-supercapacitor (PSC) by enforcing coconut husk (CH) as a filler into the polymer separator. To begin with, the CH powder was immobilized into the polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) matrix to improve its piezoelectric performance. Remarkably, the poled PNG with a 7 wt% of CH powder/ PVDF composition delivers an output of voltage of 14 V, a current of 50 nA, and a power density of 0.35 W/cm2 at 100 M. This output performance is significant enough not only to charge commercial capacitors but also to power electronic devices. Further, the PVDF/CH piezoelectric separator was sandwiched between graphene electrodes to develop a supercapacitor.

The Spike proteins of coronaviruses, responsible for cell receptor binding and viral internalization, possess multiple and frequently conserved disulfide bonds raising the question about their role in these proteins. Here, we present a detailed structural and functional investigation of the disulfide bonds of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). Molecular dynamics simulations of the RBD predict increased flexibility of the surface loops when the four disulfide bonds of the domain are reduced. This flexibility is particularly prominent for the disulfide bond-containing surface loop (residues 456-490) that participates in the formation of the interaction surface with the Spike cell receptor ACE2. In vitro, disulfide bond reducing agents affect the RBD secondary structure, lower its melting temperature from 52C to 36-39C and decrease its binding affinity to ACE2 by two orders of magnitude at 37C. Consistent with these in vitro findings, the reducing agents tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and dithiothreitol (DTT) were able to inhibit viral replication at low millimolar levels in cell-based assays. Our research demonstrates the mechanism by which the disulfide bonds contribute to the molecular structure of the RBD of the Spike protein, allowing the RBD to execute its viral function.","output":"Disulfide bonds play a critical role in the structure and function of the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Post\\\\traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious mental health condition that is triggered by a terrifying event.

Anosmia and dysgeusia are highly prevalent in the early stage of infection. Cerebrovascular events in patients with COVID-19 have also been documented with increasing frequency. Some cases of parainfectious autoimmune neurologic manifestations concurrent with active SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described, including hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy, Guillain-Barr and Miller-Fisher syndromes. There are also a few reports documenting encephalitis and acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in the course of COVID-19. There is also a growing number of cases of patients after recovery from COVID-19 with psychosomatic disorders, manifesting with memory disfunction, cognitive functions disorders, depression or other affective disorders, which may lead to a decrease of intellectual functions. Many of these neurological manifestations of the infection are possible to distinguish using radiological imaging techniques. It plays a very important role in evaluating the course of COVID-19 as well as diagnosing respiratory complications and choosing a proper management of infected patients. Similarly, radiological techniques play crucial role in identifying the cause of neurological symptoms connected to SARS-CoV-2 infection, being one of the most important elements of diagnostics. Especially in case of the presence of nervous system implication, using radiological imaging techniques to monitor the emerging onset of various symptoms is crucial to assess the severity and scope of involvement.

Here, we established a protocol to purify these membranous replication complexes (RCs) from cells infected with Semliki Forest virus (SFV). We isolated SFV spherules located on the plasma membrane and further purified them using two consecutive density gradients. This revealed that SFV infection strongly modifies cellular membranes. We removed soluble proteins, the Golgi membranes, and most of the mitochondria, but plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and late endosome markers were retained in the membrane fraction that contained viral RNA synthesizing activity, replicase proteins, and minus- and plus-strand RNA. Electron microscopy revealed that the purified membranes displayed spherule-like structures with a narrow neck. This membrane enrichment was specific to viral replication, as such a distribution of membrane markers was only observed after infection. Besides the plasma membrane, SFV infection remodeled the ER, and the cofractionation of the RC-carrying plasma membrane and ER suggests that SFV recruits ER proteins or membrane to the site of replication. The purified RCs were highly active in synthesizing both genomic and subgenomic RNA. Detergent solubilization destroyed the replication activity, demonstrating that the membrane association of the complex is essential. Most of the newly made RNA was in double-stranded replicative molecules, but the purified complexes also produced single-stranded RNA as well as released newly made RNA. This indicates that the purification established here maintained the functionality of RCs and thus enables further structural and functional studies of active RCs.IMPORTANCE Similar to all positive-strand RNA viruses, the arthropod-borne alphaviruses induce membranous genome factories, but little is known about the arrangement of viral replicase proteins and the presence of host proteins in these replication complexes. To improve our knowledge of alphavirus RNA-synthesizing complexes, we isolated and purified them from infected mammalian cells. Detection of viral RNA and in vitro replication assays revealed that these complexes are abundant and highly active when located on the plasma membrane. After multiple purification steps, they remain functional in synthesizing and releasing viral RNA. Besides the plasma membrane, markers for the endoplasmic reticulum and late endosomes were enriched with the replication complexes, demonstrating that alphavirus infection modified cellular membranes beyond inducing replication spherules on the plasma membrane. We have developed here a gentle purification method to obtain large quantities of highly active replication complexes, and similar methods can be applied to other positive-strand RNA viruses.","output":"Purification of Highly Active Alphavirus Replication Complexes Demonstrates Altered Fractionation of Multiple Cellular Membranes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rotavirus infection is the leading cause of acute diarrhea in children and is preventable with a vaccine.

Our goal was to identify risk factors associated with admission and disease severity in patients with SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN: This was an observational, retrospective study based on real-world data for 7,995 patients with SARS-CoV-2 from a clinical data repository. SETTING: Yale New Haven Health (YNHH) is a five-hospital academic health system serving a diverse patient population with community and teaching facilities in both urban and suburban areas. POPULATIONS: The study included adult patients who had SARS-CoV-2 testing at YNHH between March 1 and April 30, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES: Primary outcomes were admission and in-hospital mortality for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by RT-PCR testing. We also assessed features associated with the need for respiratory support. RESULTS: Of the 28605 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, 7995 patients (27.9%) had an infection (median age 52.3 years) and 2154 (26.9%) of these had an associated admission (median age 66.2 years). Of admitted patients, 2152 (99.9%) had a discharge disposition at the end of the study period. Of these, 329 (15.3%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and 305 (14.2%) expired. Increased age and male sex were positively associated with admission and in-hospital mortality (median age 80.7 years), while comorbidities had a much weaker association with the risk of admission or mortality. Black race (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.14C1.78) and Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.81, 95%CI 1.50C2.18) were identified as risk factors for admission, but, among discharged patients, age-adjusted in-hospital mortality was not significantly different among racial and ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study identified, among people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, older age and male sex as the most strongly associated risks for admission and in-hospital mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. While minority racial and ethnic groups had increased burden of disease and risk of admission, age-adjusted in-hospital mortality for discharged patients was not significantly different among racial and ethnic groups.

METHODS: The patients with nAMD having IVI appointments between March 16 and June 1, 2020 (RP in Turkey) were included in this retrospective study. For adherence analysis, the patients who attended (Group 1, n = 44) and who did not attend (Group 2, n = 60) their IVI appointment visits during the RP (VRP) were evaluated according to their last visit before the RP (V0). For outcome analysis, the patients who attend VRP and have follow-up (Group 1a, 46 eyes) and who did not attend VRP but later attended for follow-up (Group 2a, 33 eyes) were evaluated for functional (best-corrected visual acuity, BCVA [logMAR]) and anatomical (optical coherence tomography [OCT] disease activity) outcomes at the first visit after RP (V1) and last visit within six months after RP (V2). Patients received a complete ophthalmologic evaluation with anti-VEGF (Aflibercept) IVI administration at all visits. RESULTS: The adherence rate of the patients to VRP was 42.3% (44/104).

All of these changes occurred after only 48 hours of treatment.

Individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) experience varying degrees of dependence, distinct from age\\\\related physical deterioration. Using the CFS for triage in crisis situations could potentially unjustifiably exclude individuals with ID from IC treatment. Our objective was to compare the classification of individuals with ID into different frailty categories based on the CFS and the well\\\\studied ID\\\\frailty index and to determine suitability of CFS for evaluation of frailty in individuals with ID during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective analysis of the observational healthy aging and intellectual disabilities (HA\\\\ID) study included 982 individuals with ID of 50 years, who were classified according to the CFS and the ID\\\\frailty index. RESULTS: Of the cohort of 982 older adults with ID, 626 (63.7%) would be classified as moderately frail (CFS score 6), but 92% of this group is not moderately frail according to the ID\\\\frailty index. Furthermore, 199 (20.3%) would be classified as at least severely frail (CFS score 7C9), but 74.9% of this group is not severely frail according to the ID\\\\frailty index.

A detailed physical map of this phage genome has been constructed and is being extensively studied at the molecular level. Here, we demonstrate the expression of two late proteins of bacteriophage MB78 derived from the same gene as a result of possible ribosomal frameshifting. In vitro transcription-translation yields a major protein that migrates as 28kDa, whereas in vivo expression using pET expression vectors yields two equally expressed proteins of molecular sizes 28 and 26kDa. A putative slippery sequence TTTAAAG and a pseudoknot structure, two essential cis elements required for the classical ribosomal frameshifting, are identified in the reading frame. Mutations created at the slippery sequence resulted in a single 28kDa protein and completely abolished the expression of 26kDa protein. Thus, we have produced the first evidence that ribosomal frameshifting occurs in bacteriophage MB78 of Salmonella typhimurium.","output":"Synthesis of a bacteriophage MB78 late protein by novel ribosomal frameshifting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a considerable psychological stressor that has a significant impact on every facet of people's life Since 2002 that the first Coronavirus epidemic has emerged, many pieces of researches have indicated several psychological problems during this period In circumstances such as COVID-19, researchers could deploy previous resources to identify the most prevalent psychological effects of Coronavirus diseases We aim to systematically review and quantitatively assess the psychological problems during Coronavirus epidemics to identify the most prevalent psychological problems Method: A systematic review of the literature will be conducted on psychological problems during previous and the new Coronavirus epidemics Electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO/ProQuest, Scopus, and Google Scholar will be systematically searched using predefined search terms to identify relevant articles published from January 1, 2002 to June 20, 2020 Two authors independently identify papers that reported the prevalence rates of the psychological problems during Coronavirus outbreaks The outcomes will include the most prevalent psychological problems during Coronavirus outbreaks To ensure we have gathered all the evidence, we will conduct another search on the specific psychological problems revealed in the previous search Study selection will follow the Cochrane library guideline Afterward, data synthesis will be performed via the meta-analysis of the prevalence rates using the random effect model Conclusion: The findings can allow identifying the most prevalent psychological problems since the first Coronavirus epidemic in 2002 This can help health policymakers and clinicians to be informed of the priorities of the psychological problems related to COVID-19","output":"The most psychological impacts of Coronavirus epidemics: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the importance of rapid and versatile development of emergency medical countermeasures such as vaccines We discuss the role of platform vaccines and prototype pathogen research in modern vaccine development, and outline how previous pathogen-specific funding approaches can be improved to adequately promote vaccine R&D for emerging pandemics We present a more comprehensive approach to financing vaccine R&D, which maximises biomedical pandemic preparedness by promoting flexible vaccine platforms and translatable research into prototype pathogens As the numerous platform-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines show, funders can accelerate pandemic vaccine development by proactively investing in versatile platform technologies For certain emerging infectious diseases, where vaccine research can translate to other related pathogens with pandemic potential, investment decisions should reflect the full social value of increasing overall preparedness, rather than just the value of bringing a vaccine to market for individual pathogens","output":"Promoting versatile vaccine development for emerging pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a rapid shift to remote instruction. This may have caused particular challenges for students with disabilities. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the availability of remote instruction and counseling resources on the disability/accessibility websites of colleges and universities in the greater New York City area. At the time this study was conducted, this region was the global COVID-19 epicenter. METHODS: All colleges/universities in the New York City metropolitan area were identified using Petersen's online search guide. Descriptive information (institution's name, size, and location) was recorded. The disability/accessibility pages of websites were located and examined for remote instructional resources for both educators and for students, a way to make an appointment with the counseling center (phone number and/or email address), and a link to the counseling center. Descriptive statistics were recorded (percentages of small, medium, large size institutions, mean, median, range and standard deviations of enrollments, and number and percentage of institutions that provided online accessibility resources) and one-sided Chi square tests were conducted to test the relationship between school size and the availability of resources. RESULTS: 17% of the colleges/universities had no link to disability/accessibility services on their websites. Of the remaining 127 institutions, few made the aforementioned resources available on the disability/accessibility page. The most prevalent resource observed was providing students with remote instruction assistance. The association between school size and the aforementioned resources was not statistically significant.

METHODS Fabrication is based on raw fabric soaking in PEDOT PSS using a second dopant, squeezing and annealing. The electrodes have been tested on human volunteers, in terms of both skin contact impedance and quality of the ECG signals recorded at rest and during physical activity (power spectral density, baseline wandering, QRS detectability, and broadband noise). RESULTS The electrodes are able to operate in both wet and dry conditions. Dry electrodes are more prone to noise artifacts, especially during physical exercise and mainly due to the unstable contact between the electrode and the skin. Wet (saline) electrodes present a stable and reproducible behavior, which is comparable or better than that of traditional disposable gelled Ag/AgCl electrodes. CONCLUSION The achieved results reveal the capability of this kind of electrodes to work without the electrolyte, providing a valuable interface with the skin, due to mixed electronic and ionic conductivity of PEDOT PSS. These electrodes can be effectively used for acquiring ECG signals.

This study attempted to verify this observation by comparing predictions against actual data on the spread and burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in SSA. Methods Focused on the period from March 1 st to September 30 th , 2020, we compared (1) the predicted interval dates when each SSA country would report 1 000 and 10 000 COVID-19 cases, to the actual dates when these numbers were attained, as well as (2) the daily number of predicted versus actual COVID-19 cases. Further, we calculated the case fatality ratio of the COVID-19 infection in SSA, and the correlation coefficient between the weekly average number of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by each country and the weekly average stringency index of its anti-COVID-19 policy measures. Results 84.61% (33) and 100% (39) of the 39 SSA countries for which predictions were made did not reach a total of 1 000 and 10 000 confirmed COVID-19 cases at the predicted interval dates. The daily number of confirmed COVID-19 cases was lower than the one projected for all SSA countries. The case fatality ratio of the COVID-19 infection in SSA was 3.42%. Among the 44 SSA countries for which the correlation could be estimated, it was negative for 17 (38.6%) of them.

While people appropriately avoided social interactions, many also avoided essential medical care for acute and chronic conditions. This delay in seeking care has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in several conditions, including life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients that presented to the University of Vermont Medical Center for necrotizing fasciitis during the 1-year period following the declaration of a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. We subsequently compared this data with that of the previous 4 years. RESULTS: During the period of March 12, 2020 to March 12, 2021, there were 17 cases of newly diagnosed necrotizing fasciitis. Compared with an average per year of 8 cases over the previous 4 years, this represents a 113% percent increase in cases of necrotizing fasciitis during the study period (P = .071861). Out of the 17 cases, 4 patients died during their admission, producing a case-fatality rate of 23.5%. This represents a statistically significant increase from previous years (P = .003248), where the average case-fatality rate was 6.3%. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates a substantial increase in cases of necrotizing fasciitis following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. A significant increase in the case-fatality rate was also observed. Given the growing body of literature describing the negative impact of the pandemic on non-COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, our study posits necrotizing fasciitis as one of many affected pathologies.

While preventive vaccination and monoclonal antibody therapies have been rapidly developed and deployed, early in the pandemic the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) was a common means of passive immunization, with the theoretical risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection remaining undetermined. Though vaccines elicit a strong and protective immune response, and transfusion of CCP with high titers of neutralization activity are correlated with better clinical outcomes, the question of whether antibodies in CCP can enhance infection of SARS-CoV2 has not been directly addressed. In this study, we analyzed for and observed passive transfer of neutralization activity with CCP transfusion. Furthermore, to specifically understand if antibodies against the spike protein (S) enhance infection, we measured the anti-S IgG, IgA, and IgM responses and adapted retroviral-pseudotypes to measure virus neutralization with target cells expressing the ACE2 virus receptor and the Fc alpha receptor (FcR) or Fc gamma receptor IIA (Fc{gamma}RIIA). Whereas neutralizing activity of CCP correlated best with higher titers of anti-S IgG antibodies, the neutralizing titer was not affected when Fc receptors were present on target cells. These observations support the absence of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) by IgG and IgA isotypes found in CCP. The results presented, therefore, support the clinical use of currently available antibody-based treatment including the continued study of CCP transfusion strategies.","output":"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent plasma do not facilitate antibody-dependent enhance of viral infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Optimal control of these conditions is a constant challenge for both physicians and patients. Poor inhaler practice is widespread and is a substantial contributing factor to the suboptimal clinical control of both conditions. The practicality, dependability, and acceptability of different inhalers influence the overall effectiveness and success of inhalation therapy. In this paper, experts from various European countries (Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Spain, and Sweden) address inhaler selection with special focus on the Easyhaler(?) device, a high- or mediumChigh resistance dry-powder inhaler (DPI). The evidence examined indicates that use of the Easyhaler is associated with effective control of asthma or COPD, as shown by the generally accepted indicators of treatment success. Moreover, the Easyhaler is widely accepted by patients, is reported to be easy to learn and teach, and is associated with patient adherence. These advantages help patient education regarding correct inhaler use and the rational selection of drugs and devices. We conclude that switching inhaler device to the Easyhaler may improve asthma and COPD control without causing any additional risks. In an era of climate change, switching from pressurized metered-dose inhalers to DPIs is also a cost-effective way to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.

IFITM3 appears to act early in the infection, but its mechanism of action and potential interactions with incoming IAV structures are not yet defined. Here, we visualized endogenous IFITM3 interactions with IAV in the human lung epithelial cell line A549 and in primary human airway epithelial cells employing stimulated emission depletion super-resolution microscopy. By applying an iterative approach for the cluster definition and computational cluster analysis, we found that IFITM3 reorganizes into clusters as IAV infection progresses. IFITM3 cluster formation started at 2-3 h post infection and increased over time to finally coat IAV-containing endosomal vesicles. This IAV-induced phenotype was due to the endosomal recruitment of IFITM3 rather than to an overall increase in the IFITM3 abundance. While the IAV-induced IFITM3 clustering and localization to endosomal vesicles was comparable in primary human airway epithelial cells and the human lung epithelial cell line A549, the endogenous IFITM3 signal was higher in primary cells.

Disparities in sensitivity to home country rates also exist by bank size, as large banks exhibited more responsiveness to home country policy rate levels, but were less responsive to negative policy rates. Easier home country policy rates are also found to impact negatively on growth in capital ratios and bank income, in keeping with expanded foreign subsidiary activity.

Methods: Fifteen off-medication state pwPD (9 women and 6 men), 67.7  7.3 years old, diagnosed PD since 5.4  3.4 years, only Hoehn and Yahr state 2 and fifteen young control adults (7 women and 8 men) aged 24.9  4.9 years, performed semi-tandem task under four randomized experimental conditions: eyes opened single-task, eyes closed single-task, eyes opened dual-task and eyes closed dual-task. The center of pressure (COP) was measured using a force plate and electromyography signals (EMG) of the ankle/hip muscles were recorded. Traditional parameters, including COP pathway length, ellipse area, mediolateral/anteroposterior root-mean-square and non-linear measurements were computed. The effect of vision privation, cognitive task, and vision X cognitive was investigated by a 2 (eyes opened/eyes closed)  2 (postural task alone/with cognitive task) repeated-measures ANOVA after application of a Bonferroni pairwise correction for multiple comparisons. Significant interactions were further analyzed using post-hoc tests. Results: In pwPD, both COP pathway length (p < 0.01), ellipse area (p < 0.01) and mediolateral/anteroposterior root-mean-square (p < 0.01) were increased with the eyes closed, while the dual-task had no significant effect when compared to the single-task condition. Comparable results were observed in the control group for who COP pathway was longer in all conditions compared to eyes opened single-task (p < 0.01) and longer in conditions with eyes closed compared to eyes opened dual-task (p < 0.01). Similarly, all differences in EMG activity of pwPD were exclusively observed between eyes opened vs. eyes closed conditions, and especially for the forward legs soleus (p < 0.01) and backward tibialis anterior (p < 0.01). Conclusions: These results in pwPD without noticeable impairment of static balance encourage the assessment of both visual occlusion and dual-task conditions when the appearance of significant alteration during the dual-task could reveal the subtle worsening onset of the balance control.","output":"Effect of a Concurrent Cognitive Task, with Stabilizing Visual Information and Withdrawal, on Body Sway Adaptation of Parkinsonians Patients in an Off-Medication State: A Controlled Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Famotidine is of interest as a possible treatment for COVID-19, with effects on disease-related symptoms and survival reported in observational and retrospective studies, as well as in silico predictions of binding to potential SARS-CoV-2 drug targets. Published studies of famotidine for COVID-19 have focused on acute illness, and none have reported on neuropsychiatric symptoms. This case study reports on an 18-year-old man who sought psychiatric treatment for depression and anxiety, disruptive interpersonal conflicts, and impairments in attention and motivation following mildly symptomatic illness with COVID-19. The neuropsychiatric symptoms, which had been present for 16 weeks at the time of the initial evaluation represented a significant departure from the patient's previous behavioral baseline. The patient had no prior psychiatric history preceding his illness with COVID-19, and no history of any prior treatment with psychopharmacological medications. Famotidine 20 mg twice daily administered orally was begun without any additional medications. At 1-week follow-up the patient was much improved. Improvement was sustained through 12 weeks of follow-up during which the patient continued to take famotidine without apparent side effects. With progression of the COVID-19 pandemic it has become evident that persistent disease-related symptoms may follow acute COVID-19 and may include neuropsychiatric symptoms.

John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH) is a tertiary care hospital within the safety-net system for Cook County in Chicago, Illinois. In this study we report demographics, clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted with COVID-19 in our hospital during the spring surge of 2020. Methods A retrospective study was done including patients > 18 years of age admitted to JSH with positive PCR for SARS-CoV2 from March 18 to May 30th, 2020. Outcomes, clinical and demographic characteristics were extracted from the electronic medical record. Moderate and severe disease were defined as radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates and SpO2 > 94% on room air or SpO2< 94% on room air, respectively. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were performed to assess for risk factors for admission to the intensive care unit and mortality. Results 625 patients were included, 424 (68%) were male. Median age was 44 years (44,63). 364 (58%) were Hispanic and 222 (36%) non-Hispanic Blacks. 113 (18%) of patients presented with mild disease, 204 (33%) with moderate disease, 298 (48%) with severe disease. 73 patients (12%) died. 153 (24%) required ICU admission, 84 (13%) required intubation [Table 1]. In bivariate analysis, increasing age and diabetes (DM) were associated with increased mortality and ICU admission (p=0.001, Tables 2 and 3). Race/ethnicity was not associated with increased mortality or ICU admission. In the multivariate analysis, elevated glucose on admission regardless of DM and CKD were associated with mortality (p < 0.001). Conclusion JSH is a safety net hospital that provides care for the most vulnerable population of Chicago. The proportion of Hispanic patients increased in the later weeks of the pandemic until they represented most of the inpatient population and presented with more severe disease (Figure 1). Although race was not associated with mortality or ICU admission, the high prevalence of chronic diseases such as hypertension and DM in our population may explain the higher rate of admissions. Strengthening of preventive medicine and social engagement with minorities must be a crucial effort to decrease the burden of COVID-19 in this population.

Home infusions are convenient and incur lower costs but may be associated with more adverse events; the safety of receiving biologic infusions for immune-mediated diseases at home remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patients receiving home biologic infusions have increased adverse events requiring emergency department (ED) or hospital admission compared with patients receiving facility infusions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used administrative claims data from a large national insurer for adult patients who received biologic infusions for immune-mediated disease between January 2007 and December 2017. Patients with hematologic malignant neoplasms or bone marrow transplantation were excluded. Data were analyzed from August 2019 to October 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: ED or hospital admission on the same or next day after administration of a biologic infusion at home vs at a facility; secondary outcomes included discontinuation of the biologic after an ED or hospital admission and postinfusion mortality. RESULTS: Of a total of 57 220 patients (mean [SD] age, 50.1 [14.8] years; 512 314 [68.1%] women) who received 752 150 biologic infusions (34 078 home infusions [4.5%] to 3954 patients and 718 072 facility infusions [95.5%] to 54 770 patients), patients who received home infusions were younger (mean [SD] age, 43.2 [13.2] vs 51.3 [14.8] years), more likely to be men (14 031 [41.2%] vs 225 668 [31.4%]), and had a lower Charlson comorbidity score compared with patients who received facility infusions (mean [SD] score, 0.5 [1.0] vs 1.1 [1.3]). Home infusions were associated with 25% increased odds of ED or hospital admission on the same or next day after the infusion (odds ratio [OR], 1.25; 95% CI, 1.09-1.44; P = .002) and 28% increased odds of discontinuation of the biologic after the ED or hospital admission (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.08-1.51; P = .005). There was no difference in postinfusion mortality between home or facility infusions. The rates of adverse events were highest with home infusions of tocilizumab (48 of 481 infusions [10.0%]), vedolizumab (150 of 2681 infusions [5.6%]), and infliximab (1085 of 20 653 infusions [5.3%]), although the number of tocilizumab and vedolizumab infusions was low. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, biologic infusions administered at home, compared with those administered at a facility, were associated with increased adverse events requiring escalation of care. Because the number of home infusions has increased and is expected to continue to rise, the safety implications of administering biologic infusions at home needs to be further assessed.","output":"Comparison of Adverse Events Among Home- vs Facility-Administered Biologic Infusions, 2007-2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"M?nsson and Shukur (Econ Model 28:1475C1481, 2011) proposed a Poisson ridge regression estimator (PRRE) to reduce the negative effects of multicollinearity.

Therefore, as a remedy, Trkan and ?zel (J Appl Stat 43:1892C1905, 2016) examined the performance of almost unbiased ridge estimators for the Poisson regression model. These estimators will not only reduce the consequences of multicollinearity but also decrease the bias of PRRE and thus perform more efficiently. The aim of this paper is twofold.

The graphene structured thin film is endowed with favourable adaptive and morphable features, which can conformally adhere to the structural surface and transform to a bulged state driven by water pressure. Owing to the introduction of the graphene-based layer, the integrated sensing system can actively detect the water depth with a wide range of 0.3-1.8 m. Furthermore, similar to the fish, the mechanical stimuli from land (e.g. knocking, stomping) and water (e.g. wind blowing, raining, fishing) can also be sensitively captured in real time.

We describe the epidemiology of respiratory viruses and infection prevention and control interventions aimed to reduce acquisition and transmission of respiratory viruses in our NICU. METHODS: From May 2012 to December 2016, we tracked respiratory viruses detected by a multiplex reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR assay (FilmArray, Biofire, Inc.) in our 58-bed level IV NICU (~1,000 annual admissions). Testing was ordered by treating clinicians for symptomatic infants. Infants with positive RT-PCR tests generally remained on contact/ droplet precautions throughout their NICU stay. HCP were instructed not to work sick and report to Workforce Health and Safety if they became ill at work. Ill visitors were not permitted in the NICU, as enforced by written educational materials and signage, but formal screening was not performed. Starting in January 2015, asymptomatic infants exposed to RT-PCR-positive index cases were screened by RT-PCR, put on contact/ droplet precautions for the incubation period (IP) of the index cases virus, and screened again at IP end. Starting in December 2015, visitors <12 years old were banned year-round. We assessed dyad transmission events (2 infants), clusters (3 infants), and outbreaks (>3 infants); all were defined as detecting geographically related cases within the relevant IP. We determined screened infants who had positive RT-PCR tests. RESULTS: During the 56 month observation period, 79 infants had 83 viruses detected (~1.8% of admissions). Rhino/ enterovirus (RV/EV) were most common (n = 59) and caused 1 outbreak of 7 infants, 4 clusters, and 5 dyad transmissions. Adenovirus caused 1 outbreak of 5 infants. Two dyad transmissions occurred for parainfluenza. Sporadic cases of RSV (n = 5), coronavirus (n = 5), and influenza (n = 2) occurred. Ill household contacts were identified for 10 infants. No HCPs were identified with respiratory illnesses. Since January 2015, 8 screened infants had positive RT-PCR tests. Since December 2015, only 1 transmission dyad (RV/EV) occurred.

AIM: To evaluate whether preadmission Palliative Performance Scale predicts mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study of patients admitted with COVID-19. Palliative Performance Scale was calculated from the chart. Using logistic regression, Palliative Performance Scale was assessed as a predictor of mortality controlling for demographics, comorbidities, palliative care measures and socioeconomic status. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Patients older than 18 years of age admitted with COVID-19 to a single urban public hospital in New Jersey, USA. RESULTS: Of 443 admitted patients, we determined the Palliative Performance Scale score for 374. Overall mortality was 31% and 81% in intubated patients.

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation and collected serial samples, the first within 72 h of ARDS diagnosis (day 0) and the second 48-96 h later (day 3). We analyzed immune cell populations and cytokines in BAL, tracheal aspirates and peripheral blood, as well as cytokines in plasma, obtained at the time of bronchoscopy. The study cohort was divided into fast resolvers (FR; n = 8) and slow resolvers (SR; n = 5), based on the median number of days until first extubation for all participants (n = 13).

Objective: We report on efficacy and safety of PEG and results from a post hoc time-aligned analysis based on start of PEG dosing. Design: Eighty PNH patients (18 years, hemoglobin levels <10.5 g/dL despite stable ECU treatment [3 months]) were enrolled. Following a 4-week run-in, patients were randomized (1:1) to PEG or ECU monotherapy for the randomized controlled period (RCP) through week 16, before initiating an open-label period (OLP) through week 48, where ECU patients completed a second run-in before switching to PEG monotherapy (ECU-to-PEG), and PEG patients continued PEG monotherapy (PEG-to-PEG). Key endpoints included change from baseline (CFB) in hemoglobin levels and incidence of adverse events (AEs). Timepoints were manually aligned based on start of PEG dosing (PEG-to-PEG: day 1;ECU-to-PEG: week 20) to compare changes in hemoglobin levels between groups. Results: PEG-to-PEG patients achieved sustained improvements in hemoglobin levels at week 16 through the OLP (week 48 mean hemoglobin level: 11.3 g/dL;CFB: 2.5 g/dL). ECU-to-PEG patients displayed improved hemoglobin levels during the OLP (week 48 mean hemoglobin level: 11.6 g/dL;CFB: 2.9 g/dL). Timepoint alignment demonstrated no significant difference (p=0.64) between improvements in hemoglobin levels at 28 and 48 weeks among PEG-to-PEG and ECU-to-PEG groups, respectively. Thirty percent of patients reported a serious AE, 6% possibly PEG-related. Common AEs for PEG-treated patients were injection site reactions (36%), hemolysis (24%), and diarrhea (21%). Twelve patients (15%) discontinued PEG due to AEs: 3 in RCP, 8 in OLP, 1 during follow-up, including one death due to COVID-19, unrelated to PEG. Conclusions: PEG-treated patients experienced sustained improvements in hemoglobin levels at week 48, and the safety profile of PEG was consistent with previously reported data.

The data of 554 (52%) patients discharged per death were compared with the data of 510 (48%) patients discharged per recovery. The ROC curve showed that the best cut-off point of the magnesium-to-calcium ratio for identifying individuals at high risk of mortality from COVID-19 was 0.20. The sensitivity and specificity were 83% and 24%. The adjusted multivariate regression model showed that the odds ratio between the magnesium-to-calcium ratio 0.20 and discharge per death from COVID-19 was 6.93 ((95%)CI 1.6C29.1) in the whole population, 4.93 ((95%)CI 1.4C19.1, p = 0.003) in men, and 3.93 ((95%)CI 1.6C9.3) in women. In conclusion, our results show that a magnesium-to-calcium ratio 0.20 is strongly associated with mortality in patients with severe COVID-19.","output":"Magnesium-to-Calcium Ratio and Mortality from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 fundamentally altered education in the United States. A variety of in-person, hybrid, and online instruction formats took hold in Fall 2020 as schools reopened. The Nationwide Education and School in TEens During COVID (NESTED) study assessed how these changes impacted sleep. Here we examined how instruction format was associated with sleep disruption and learning outcomes. METHODS: Data from 4148 grade 6-12 students were included in the current analyses (61% non-male; 34% non-white; 13% middle-school). Each students instructional format was categorized as: (i) in-person; (ii) hybrid [1 day/week in-person]; (iii) online/synchronous (scheduled classes); (iv) online/asynchronous (unscheduled classes); (v) online-mixed; or (vi) no-school. Sleep disturbances (i.e., difficulty falling/staying asleep) were measured with validated PROMIS t-scores. A bootstrapped structural equation model examined how instructional format and sleep disturbances predict school/learning success (SLS), a latent variable loading onto 3 outcomes: (i) school engagement (ii) likert-rated school stress; and (iii) cognitive function (PROMIS t-scores). The model covaried for gender, race-ethnicity, and school-level RESULTS: Our model fit well (RMSEA=.041). Examining total effects (direct + indirect), online and hybrid instruction were associated with lower SLS (bs:-.06 to -.26; ps<.01). The three online groups had the strongest effects (synchronous: b=-.15; 95%CI: [-.20, -.11]; asynchronous: b=-.17; [-.23, -.11]; mixed: b=-.14; [-.19, -.098]; ps<.001). Sleep disturbance was also negatively associated with SLS (b=-.02; [-.02, -.02], p<.001). Monte-carlo simulations confirmed sleep disturbance mediated online instructions influence on SLS. The strongest effect was found for asynchronous instruction, with sleep disturbance mediating 24% of its effect (b = -.042; [-0.065, -.019]; p<.001). This sleep-mediated influence of asynchronous instruction propagated down to each SLS measure (ps<.001), including a near 3-point difference on PROMIS cognitive scores (b = -2.86; [-3.73, -2.00]). CONCLUSION: These analyses from the NESTED study indicate that sleep disruption may be one mechanism through which online instruction impacted learning during the pandemic. Sleep disturbances were unexpectedly influential for unscheduled instruction (i.e., asynchronous). Future analyses will examine specific sleep parameters (e.g., timing) and whether sleeps influence differs in teens who self-report learning/behavior problems (e.g., ADHD). These nationwide data further underscore the importance of considering sleep as educators and policy makers determine school schedules.

The APKIII is of particular interest as its density takes various symmetric and asymmetric possible shapes. In addition, the APKIII hazard function is attractive as it exhibits a wide range of asymmetrical forms, including decreasing, increasing, approximate-symmetrical, and reversed J-shaped. The theoretical features of APKIII are derived, focusing on those that may be of general relevance in probability and statistics. The performance of the APKIII in modeling data is evaluated through its application to two real-world data of current interest: the daily COVID-19 infected and recovered cases of Saudi Arabia.

One particular example of the increased role of analytics is in the positioning of outfielders, who are tasked with tracking down balls hit to the outfield to record outs and minimize potential offensive damage. This paper explores the potential of location analytics to enhance the strategic positioning of players, enabling improved response and performance. We implement a location optimization model to analyze collegiate ball-tracking data, seeking outfielder locations that simultaneously minimize the average distance to a batted ball and maximize the weighted importance of batted ball coverage within a response standard. Trade-off outfielder configurations are compared to observed fielder positioning, finding that location models and spatial optimization can lead to performance improvements ranging from 1 to 3%, offering a significant strategic advantage over the course of a season.","output":"Enhancing strategic defensive positioning and performance in the outfield"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The question of the secularity of society still remains open, since scientists have proposed only cautious speculative answers, while every scientist understands that in the social sciences it is a sad experience of predictions, that history is random and therefore unpredictable and the future always remains fundamentally open. The process of transformation of postmodern society, the development of which is actively influenced by the current pandemy of COVID-19, entailed the revival of religious values and the formation of a qualitatively new religious consciousness. In connection with the rise in the social status of religious consciousness and the widespread dissemination of religious ideas, primarily at the everyday level, the analysis of individual religious consciousness as one of the ways to comprehend the world is of particular importance. The social nature of religious consciousness is manifested not only in the fact that religious values are perceived as a kind of khanism of social regulation, but also in the fact that they serve as epistemological guidelines and often compete with scientific values. This determines the growing philosophical interest in the analysis of the epistemological functions of religion and secular reality, as well as the cognitive capabilities of religious consciousness, which is impossible without a consistent study of the methodological basis of religious knowledge.","output":"Religious-Secular Reality of Individual Consciousness In The Context of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Perceived partner responsiveness (PPR; Reis & Shaver, Handbook of personal relationships, 1988, Wiley)-the belief that one's partner will attend to core concerns-is a construct in basic relationship research that can help evaluate intimacy in couple therapy. However, research into PPR is hampered by a lack of standardized measurement. Three studies were undertaken to develop and evaluate an optimized self-report PPR measure. In Study 1, n = 2,334 respondents completed 246 candidate items derived from 19 PPR measures. Exploratory factor analyses identified two underlying dimensions, Responsiveness and Insensitivity. Item response theory was used to develop two 8-item subscales for the Perceived Responsiveness and Insensitivity scale (PRI), both of which showed incremental prediction over global satisfaction. In Study 2, n = 173 respondents completed the brief PRI along with measures of global relationship evaluations and concrete relationship behaviors every other week for 8 weeks. Random intercept cross-lagged panel models found the PRI subscales were more sensitive than global evaluations to fluctuations in support and conflict. In Study 3, n = 161 heterosexual couples completed the brief PRI along with self-reports of responsive and insensitive behaviors. Actor-partner interdependence models demonstrated the PRI subscales were associated with partners' self-reported behaviors even after controlling for own behaviors. Thus, the PRI offers a PPR measure that demonstrates desirable properties for treatment research including (a) incremental validity over global satisfaction, (b) ability to detect meaningful change over time, and (c) sensitivity to partners' behaviors in the relationship.

Technological advances in computing have led to the introduction of novel physiological biosignals that can increase the frequency at which abnormalities in cardiovascular parameters can be detected, making expert-level, automated diagnosis a reality. However, use of these biosignals for diagnosis also raises numerous concerns related to accuracy and actionability within clinical guidelines, in addition to medico-legal and ethical issues. Analytical methods such as machine learning can potentially increase the accuracy and improve the actionability of device-based diagnoses. Coupled with interoperability of data to widen access to all stakeholders, seamless connectivity (an internet of things) and maintenance of anonymity, this approach could ultimately facilitate near-real-time diagnosis and therapy.

The etiology and clinical impact of HCoVs in Chinese adults with acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) needs to be characterized systematically by molecular detection with excellent sensitivity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we detected 4 non-SARS related HCoV species by real-time RT-PCR in 981 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from March 2009 to February 2011. All specimens were also tested for the presence of other common respiratory viruses and newly identified viruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV). 157 of the 981 (16.0%) nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for HCoVs. The species detected were 229E (96 cases, 9.8%), OC43 (42 cases, 4.3%), HKU1 (16 cases, 1.6%) and NL63 (11 cases, 1.1%). HCoV-229E was circulated in 21 of the 24 months of surveillance. The detection rates for both OC43 and NL63 were showed significantly year-to-year variation between 2009/10 and 2010/11, respectively (P<0.001 and P = 0.003), and there was a higher detection frequency of HKU1 in patients aged over 60 years (P = 0.03). 48 of 157(30.57%) HCoV positive patients were co-infected. Undifferentiated human rhinoviruses and influenza (Flu) A were the most common viruses detected (more than 35%) in HCoV co-infections. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV) and HBoV were detected in very low rate (less than 1%) among adult patients with URTI. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: All 4 non-SARS-associated HCoVs were more frequently detected by real-time RT-PCR assay in adults with URTI in Beijing and HCoV-229E led to the most prevalent infection.

METHODS Between April 2009 and December 2012, 16 consecutive patients with gastric GISTs underwent SPLGR. The patients undergoing the SPLGR were case-matched for age, sex, body mass index and tumor location with those undergoing MPLGR. The demographic and surgical outcomes were analyzed and compared from the review of a prospectively collected database of 16 patients who underwent MPLGR. RESULTS All 16 patients underwent complete SPLGR without any intraoperative complications. No significant differences were observed in the mean length of the operation (91.4 vs. 94.1 min), blood loss (6.3 vs. 10.1 ml) and length of postoperative hospital stay (4.7 vs. 5.4 days) between the SPLGR and MPLGR groups. The tumor size was similar (37.8 vs. 32.1 mm) and negative surgical margins were achieved in all patients. At a mean follow-up of 27 months, all 16 SPLGR patients were disease-free. CONCLUSIONS Our initial comparison demonstrated that SPLGR, when performed by experienced surgeons, is a safe and feasible procedure for patients with gastric GISTs, resulting in good surgical and oncological outcomes.","output":"Single-port versus multiport laparoscopic resection for gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors: a case-matched comparison."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context: Notwithstanding the recognizable impact on public health, knowledge regarding this virus remains inadequate Aims: This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of medical and allied health students regarding COVID-19 and its relationship to their demographic information Setting and Design: This study was conducted at the University of Hail, Hail region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia This study used a quantitative comparative-correlational design Materials and Methods: There were 232 students recruited as respondents resulting from convenience sampling A Google Forms survey was used to collect the data from March 2, 2020, until April 15, 2020 Statistical Analysis Used: One-way ANOVA, t-test, and Pearson's correlation test were used to analyze the data Results: The participants had good knowledge, positive attitudes, and good practices on COVID-19 Of all the variables tested, only gender (P 0 5), knowledge and practices (P &gt; 0 5), or attitudes and practices (P &gt; 0 5) Conclusion: With the good knowledge, positive attitudes, and good practices of the participants about COVID-19, it is inferred that they can help to do information dissemination needed by the community As females found to be more knowledgeable than males, female involvement in prevention and information of COVID-19 in the family dynamics of the Saudi context is worth considering Moreover, male participants' knowledge should be improved through health education ? 2021 Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Sciences ;Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow","output":"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding COVID-19 among medical and allied health students in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A functional mutual aid system allows the effective cost sharing of resources and the swift mitigation of loss of life and property.

OBJECTIVE Utilize a new instrument derived from published PC competencies to assess baseline Internal Medicine (IM) resident knowledge and self-efficacy in PC to identify educational gaps and create new PC curricula. DESIGN We created a 2-part instrument including a Knowledge Test (KT) and a Self-Efficacy Inventory (SEI) addressing 18 PC resident competencies across 5 domains: Pain and Symptom Management (PSM), Communication (COMM), Psychosocial, Spiritual, and Cultural Aspects of Care (PSC), Terminal Care and Bereavement (TCB), and Palliative Care Principles and Practice (PCPP). SETTING/SUBJECTS The instrument was emailed to IM residents at our institution during academic years 2015-2016 and 2016-2017. MEASUREMENTS Basic descriptive statistics were performed for the KT and SEI. Mean Rank Analysis and One-way ANOVA were utilized for the KT and SEI, respectively. Congruence was calculated between knowledge and self-efficacy. RESULTS The mean score on the KT was 73% (range 33-80%). There was no significant difference in knowledge among post-graduate year cohorts. Self-efficacy scores were lower for interns overall and in PCPP, TCB, and COMM domains.

Detrimental outcome of antioxidant enzyme deficiency and synergism between SARS-CoV-2 virus and a bacterial pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most likely cause of COVID-19-associated mortalities. As we age, production of the antioxidant catalase enzyme, which catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to water and oxygen, tails off;as a result, H2O2 starts to accumulate in body. Additional production of H2O2 by the bacteria increases H2O2 concentration up to a critical level in respiratory tract. The elevated H2O2 causes damages in lungs and oxidizes key components of the innate immune system, halts inflammasome activation process, and eventually suppresses it. Having suppressed innate immune response along with substantial lung injuries, synergic viral-bacterial co-infection leads to fast colonization of pathogens at the respiratory tract. The adaptive immune system kicks in too early and overreacts, and which results in overwhelming local and systemic cytokines release and hyperinflammations in the lungs. We have tested the validity of our proposal by analyzing recent clinical data on COVID-19, age- and gender-dependent COVID-19 death rates, H2O2 accumulation and antioxidant enzyme activities in cells, and the correlation between antioxidant-rich intake and COVID-19 death rate in various countries. Based on our analysis, it might be possible to explain COVID-19 peculiarities including why and how the immune system fails, why some infected people do not develop severe respiratory illness, why older people are affected the most, why male death rate is significantly higher than female death rate, why certain comorbidities are related with COVID-19 mortality, and why some Asian countries have very low death rates. We anticipate that the proposed mechanism might uncover the mystery of COVID-19 and may pave the way for finding a cure and vaccine for the coronavirus pandemic, and for understanding the viral-bacterial co-pathogenesis and related respiratory tract diseases.","output":"Synergic Viral-Bacterial Co-Infection in Catalase-Deficient COVID-19 Patients Causes Suppressed Innate Immunity and Lung Damages Due to Detrimental Elevation of Hydrogen Peroxide Concentration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 outbreak created numerous multidimensional stressors, to which people show different levels of vulnerability.

Participants completed scales probing adaptation indicators: financial status, adherence to preventive measures, mental health, and COVID-19 related perceptions. Background measures, including the level of symptoms of ADHD, were collected. RESULTS: Adaptation indicators negatively correlated with the level of symptoms of ADHD. Financial decline explained a small portion of the link between ADHD and decreased mental health. Background risk-taking, anti-social, and pro-social behavior partially explained the link between ADHD and non-adherence to preventive measures. COVID-19 related perceptions also partially explained that link. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that people with ADHD are more vulnerable to the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore deserve special attention and care.","output":"Symptoms of ADHD Predict Lower Adaptation to the COVID-19 Outbreak: Financial Decline, Low Adherence to Preventive Measures, Psychological Distress, and Illness-Related Negative Perceptions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Disadvantaged neighborhood-level and individual-level socioeconomic status (SES) have each been associated with suboptimal cancer care and inferior outcomes. However, independent or synergistic associations between neighborhood and individual socioeconomic disadvantage have not been fully examined, and prior studies using simplistic neighborhood SES measures may not comprehensively assess multiple aspects of neighborhood SES. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations of neighborhood SES (using a validated comprehensive composite measure) and individual SES with survival among patients with nonmetastatic common cancers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, population-based cohort study was derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End ResultsCMedicare database from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2011, with follow-up ending on December 31, 2017. Participants included older patients (65 years) with breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer. EXPOSURES: Neighborhood SES was measured using the area deprivation index (ADI; quintiles), a validated comprehensive composite measure of neighborhood SES. Individual SES was assessed by Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility (yes vs no), a reliable indicator for patient-level low income. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was overall mortality, and the secondary outcome was cancer-specific mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the associations of ADI and dual eligibility with overall and cancer-specific mortality were estimated via Cox proportional hazards regression. Statistical analyses were conducted from January 23 to April 15, 2021. RESULTS: A total of 96 978 patients were analyzed, including 25 968 with breast, 35 150 with prostate, 16 684 with lung, and 19 176 with colorectal cancer. Median age at diagnosis was 76 years (IQR, 71-81 years) for breast cancer, 73 years (IQR, 70-77 years) for prostate cancer, 76 years (IQR, 71-81 years) for lung cancer, and 78 years (IQR, 72-84 years) for colorectal cancer. Among lung and colorectal cancer patients, 8412 (50.4%) and 10 486 (54.7%), respectively, were female. The proportion of non-Hispanic White individuals among breast cancer patients was 83.7% (n = 21 725); prostate cancer, 76.8% (n = 27 001); lung cancer, 83.5% (n = 13 926); and colorectal cancer, 81.1% (n = 15 557). Neighborhood-level and individual-level SES were independently associated with overall mortality, and no interactions were detected. Compared with the most affluent neighborhoods (ADI quintile 1), living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods (ADI quintile 5) was associated with higher risk of overall mortality (breast: HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.26-1.43; prostate: HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.42-1.62; lung: HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.28; and colorectal: HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.17-1.32). Individual socioeconomic disadvantage (dual eligibility) was associated with higher risk of overall mortality (breast: HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.15-1.29; prostate: HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.21-1.38; lung: HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.20; and colorectal: HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.29). A similar pattern was observed for cancer-specific mortality. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, neighborhood-level deprivation was associated with worse survival among patients with nonmetastatic breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer, even after accounting for individual SES. These findings suggest that, in order to improve cancer outcomes and reduce health disparities, policies for ongoing investments in low-resource neighborhoods and low-income households are needed.","output":"Neighborhood and Individual Socioeconomic Disadvantage and Survival Among Patients With Nonmetastatic Common Cancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper compares the degree of cryptocurrency market efficiency during the pre- and post COVID-19 pandemic with the bubble and non-bubble periods of cryptocurrency markets.

The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently based on the detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs by means of molecular-based assays, such as real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, serological assays aimed at detecting different classes of antibodies constitute the best surveillance strategy for gathering information on the humoral immune response to infection and the spread of the virus through the population, in order to evaluate the immunogenicity of novel future vaccines and medicines for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this study was to determine SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in human serum samples by means of different commercial and in-house ELISA kits, in order to evaluate and compare their results first with one another and then with those yielded by functional assays using wild-type virus.

In addition, in a small sub-group of samples, we performed a subtyping Immunoglobulin G ELISA. Our data showed an excellent statistical correlation between the neutralization titer and the IgG, IgM and IgA ELISA response against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, confirming that antibodies against this portion of the virus spike protein are highly neutralizing and that the ELISA Receptor-Binding Domain-based assay can be used as a valid surrogate for the neutralization assay in laboratories which do not have Biosecurity level-3 facilities.","output":"Comparative analyses of SARS-CoV-2 binding (IgG, IgM, IgA) and neutralizing antibodies from human serum samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected and killed millions of people globally, resulting in a pandemic with enormous global impact. This disease affects the respiratory system, and the viral agent that causes it, SARS-CoV-2, spreads through droplets of saliva, as well as through coughing and sneezing. As an extremely transmissible viral infection, COVID-19 is causing significant damage to the economies of both developed and lower- and middle-income countries because of its direct impact on the health of citizens and the containment measures taken to curtail the virus. Methods to reduce or control the spread of the virus and protect the global population are needed to avoid further deaths, long-term health issues, and prolonged economic impact. The most effective approach to reduce viral spread and avoid a substantial collapse of the health system, in the absence of vaccines, is nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) such as enforcing social containment restrictions, monitoring overall population mobility, implementing widespread viral testing, and increasing hygiene measures. Our approach consists of combining network analytics with machine learning models by using a combination of anonymized health and telecommunications data to better understand the correlation between population movements and virus spread. This approach, called location network analysis (LNA), allows for accurate prediction of possible new outbreaks. It gives governments and health authorities a crucial tool that can help define more accurate public health metrics and can be used either to intensify social containment policies to avoid further spread or to ease them to reopen the economy.

These are compared against projected water supply increases from ocean desalination and water recycling by 2035, to determine whether new, drought-proof water sources can substitute for currently unsustainable groundwater consumption. Results show that the maximum projected supply of new water, 2.47 million acre-feet per year (MAF/yr), is sufficient to meet low depletion estimates of 2.02 MAF/yr, but fails to come near the high depletion estimate of 3.44 MAF/yr. This does not necessarily indicate physical limitations of substitutability, but more so socio-economic limitations influenced by high comparative costs. By including capacities in demand-substitutability via urban water conservation, maximum predicted capacities reach 5.57 MAF/yr, indicating wide room for substitution.

PURPOSE: This report describes a health-system pharmacys response to a natural disaster while staff members simultaneously prepared for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. By detailing our experience, we hope to help other institutions that are current facing or could encounter similar crises. SUMMARY: In early March 2020, a tornado destroyed the health systems warehouse for storage of most clinical supplies, including personal protective equipment and fluids. The pharmacy purchasing team collaborated with suppliers and manufacturers to recover losses and establish alternative storage areas. Days later, the pharmacy department was forced to address the impending COVID-19 pandemic. Key elements of the COVID-19 response included reducing the potential for patient and staff virus exposure; overcoming challenges in sourcing of staff, personal protective equipment, and medications; and changing care delivery practices to maintain high-quality patient care while maximizing social distancing. The pharmacy department also created distance learning opportunities for 70 pharmacy students on rotations. After an initial plan, ongoing needs include adjustment in patient care activities if significant staff losses occur, when and how to resume clinical activities, and how to best utilize the resources accumulated. Elements of practice changes implemented to reduce COVID-19 threats to patients and pharmacy personnel have proven beneficial and will be further evaluated for potential continuation. CONCLUSION: The pharmacy departments efforts to respond to a natural disaster and unprecedented pandemic have proven successful to this point and have illuminated several lessons, including the necessity of cohesive department communication, staff flexibility, prioritization of teamwork, and external collaboration.","output":"From natural disaster to pandemic: A health-system pharmacy rises to the challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Scientists and healthcare workers have expressed their concerns on the impacts of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on vaccination coverage in children and adolescents.

The data of the included studies were summarized into a table and the findings were analyzed in a systematic approach. RESULTS: From 26 eligible studies, 21 studies demonstrated decreased vaccination rates in the children during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, while three studies found increased or no significant changes only in influenza vaccination. The two remaining studies from Brazil and Sweden also showed no significant changes in vaccination rates in the children during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Most of the reports worldwide reported a decline or delay in vaccination at the time of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. A sustained catch\\\\up program seems to be necessary, especially in low\\\\income countries, to avoid any vaccine dose missing. Facilitating the vaccination process is recommended, such as decreasing the waiting time for vaccination at the health center, addressing the fear and concerns related to COVID infection for parents, and enhancing vaccine availability, and promoting access in remote areas. Countries should ensure proper vaccination to prevent future pandemics related to vaccine\\\\preventable diseases.","output":"Impact of COVID\\\\19 pandemic on routine vaccination coverage of children and adolescents: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the course of March 2020, the Netherlands, Flanders, and a large part of Europe were affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 virus. For four months, the population was in lockdown, and many issues had to be handled online. Social media became important to keep in touch with and to air opinions. Two folktale genres, namely the joke and the modern legend, were used to express frustrations, malicious pleasures, fears, and feelings of distrust. During the first wave, Theo Meder and Mathijs Kroon did some intensive collecting of jokes, memes, fake news, and conspiracy theories. It was expected by folktale researchers like Giselinde Kuipers and Theo Meder that, just like in former crises, jokes would contain plenty of morbid disaster humor, but that did not happen. Contemporary legends, on the other hand, were polarizing and toxic, and mistrust was mainly directed against the elite of politicians, scientists, doctors, and journalists. The corona crisis was seen as some kind of hoax in many ways, while most of the sheeple refused to wake up.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter study in patients with HF hospitalized for COVID-19 in 150 Spanish hospitals (SEMI-COVID-19 Registry). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify admission factors associated with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1718 patients were analyzed (56.5% men; median age 81.4 years). The overall case fatality rate was 47.6% (n = 819). The independent risk factors at admission for in-hospital mortality were: age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.03; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.02C1.05; p < .001); severe dependence (AOR: 1.62; 95%CI: 1.19C2.20; p = .002); tachycardia (AOR: 1.01; 95%CI: 1.00C1.01; p = .004); and high C-reactive protein (AOR: 1.004; 95%CI:1.002?1.004; p < .001), LDH (AOR: 1.001; 95%CI: 1.001?1.002; p < .001), and serum creatinine levels (AOR: 1.35; 95%CI: 1.18?1.54; p < .001).

Infected individuals exhibit variable severity, with no relation between the number of cases and mortality, suggesting the involvement of the populational genetic constitution and previous cross-reactive immune contacts in the individuals' disease outcome. Methods: A clustering approach was conducted to investigate the involvement of human MHC alleles with individuals' outcomes. HLA frequencies from affected countries were used to fuel the Hierarchical Clusterization Analysis. The formed groups were compared regarding their death rates. To prospect the T cell targets in SARS-CoV-2, and by consequence, the epitopes that are conferring cross-protection in the current pandemic, we modeled 3D structures of HLA-A*02:01 presenting immunogenic epitopes from SAR-CoV-1, recovered from Immune Epitope Database. These pMHC structures were also compared with models containing the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 epitope, with alphacoronavirus sequences, and with a panel of immunogenic pMHC structures contained in CrossTope. Findings: The combined use of HLA-B*07, HLA-B*44, HLA-DRB1*03, and HLADRB1*04 allowed the clustering of affected countries presenting similar death rates, based only on their allele frequencies. SARS-CoV HLA-A*02:01 epitopes were structurally investigated. It reveals molecular conservation between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 peptides, enabling the use of formerly SARS-CoV-1 experimental epitopes to inspect actual targets that are conferring cross-protection. Alpha-CoVs and, impressively, viruses involved in human infections share fingerprints of immunogenicity with SARS-CoV peptides.

Existing mechanistic models nicely capture the disease dynamics. However, to forecast the future, they require the transmission rate to be known, limiting their prediction power. Typically, a hypothesis is made on the form of the transmission rate with respect to time. Yet the real form is too complex to be mechanistically modeled due to the unknown dynamics of many influential factors. We tackle this problem by using a hypothesis-free machine-learning algorithm to estimate the transmission rate from data on non-pharmaceutical policies, and in turn forecast the confirmed cases using a mechanistic disease model. More specifically, we build a hybrid model consisting of a mechanistic ordinary differential equation (ODE) model and a generalized boosting model (GBM). To calibrate the parameters, we develop an \\"inverse method\\" that obtains the transmission rate inversely in time from the other variables in the ODE model and then feed it into the GBM to connect with the policy data. The resulting model forecasted the number of daily confirmed cases up to 35 days in the future in the United States with an averaged mean absolute percentage error of 27%. Being partly data-driven, the method is more accurate than typical mechanistic models and meanwhile more intuitive, and possibly reliable, than purely data-based machine learning models.

Relatively little is known, however, about the organisation's evolving relationship with health-related personal beliefs, 'faith-based organisations' (FBOs), religious leaders and religious communities ('religious actors'). This article presents findings from a 4-year research project on the 'spiritual dimension' of health and WHO conducted at the University of Zrich. Drawing on archival research in Geneva and interviews with current and former WHO staff, consultants and programme partners, we identify three stages in this relationship. Although since its founding individuals within WHO occasionally engaged with religious actors, it was not until the 1970s, when the primary healthcare strategy was developed in consultation with the Christian Medical Commission, that their concerns began to influence WHO policies. By the early 1990s, the failure to roll out primary healthcare globally was accompanied by a loss of interest in religion within WHO. With the spread of HIV/AIDS however, health-related religious beliefs were increasingly recognised in the development of a major quality of life instrument by the Division of Mental Health, and the work of a WHO expert committee on cancer pain relief and the subsequent establishment of palliative care. While the 1990s saw a cooling off of activities, in the years since, the HIV/AIDS, Ebola and COVID-19 crises have periodically brought religious actors to the attention of the organisation. This study focusses on what we suggest may be understood as a trend towards a closer association between the activities of WHO and religious actors, which has occurred in fits and starts and is marked by attempts at institutional translation and periods of forgetting and remembering.","output":"Religion and the World Health Organization: an evolving relationship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The population-based serosurveys are essential for estimating Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) burden and monitoring the progression of this pandemic. We aimed to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and potential predictors of seropositivity in the Pakistani population. METHODOLOGY: This population-based seroprevalence study includes consenting subjects from the workplaces (factories, corporates, restaurants, media houses, schools, banks, and hospitals) located in the urban areas of Karachi, Lahore, Multan, Peshawar, and Quetta. We analyzed each subject's serum sample for SARS-CoV-2-IgM and/or IgG antibodies using UNIPER IgG/IgM Rapid COVID-19 Testing Kit. The subject's demographics, exposure history, and symptoms experienced (in last 7 days) were also obtained. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS version 22.0. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 16.0% (2810/17,764). The total antibody seropositivity was higher in males than females (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.110C1.340). The symptomatic subjects had 2.18 times higher odds of IgG seropositivity while 1.2 times for IgM seropositivity than the asymptomatic subjects. The multivariable logistic regression model showed that the odds of SARS-CoV-2 total antibody seroprevalence were affected by the number of dependents (OR = 1.077; 95% CI 1.054C1.099), apparent symptomology (OR = 1.288; 95% CI 1.011C1.643), close unprotected contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19 (OR 2.470; 95% CI 2.164C2.819), traveling history (last 14 days) (OR = 1.537; 95% CI 1.234C1.914) and proximity with someone who traveled (OR = 1.534; 95% CI 1.241C1.896).

Due to the high priority of QDs in contacting the circulatory system, understanding the hemocompatibility of QDs is one of the most important aspects for their biosafety evaluation. Thus far, the effect of QDs on coagulation balance havent been fully understood, and limited studies also have yet elucidated the potential mechanism from the perspective of interaction of QDs with coagulation-related proteins. RESULTS: QDs induced the derangement of coagulation balance by prolonging the activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time as well as changing the expression levels of coagulation and fibrinolytic factors. The contact of QDs with PTM (prothrombin), PLG (plasminogen) and FIB (fibrinogen) which are primary coagulation-related proteins in the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems formed QDs-protein conjugates through hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interaction. The affinity of proteins with QDs followed the order of PTM > PLG > FIB, and was larger with CdTe/ZnS QDs than CdTe QDs. Binding with QDs not only induced static fluorescence quenching of PTM, PLG and FIB, but also altered their conformational structures. The binding of QDs to the active sites of PTM, PLG and FIB may promote the activation of proteins, thus interfering the hemostasis and fibrinolysis processes. CONCLUSIONS: The interactions of QDs with PTM, PLG and FIB may be key contributors for interference of coagulation balance, that is helpful to achieve a reliable and comprehensive evaluation on the potential biological influence of QDs from the molecular level.

We defined 3 workflow metrics: time from symptom onset to reperfusion (OTR), time from symptom onset to computed tomography, and time from computed tomography (CT) to reperfusion. Clinical characteristics, core laboratory-evaluated Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Scores (ASPECTS) and 90-day outcome data were analyzed. The effect of time on favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale, 0-2) was described via adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for every 30-minute delay. RESULTS Median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 17.0 (14.0-20.0), reperfusion rate was 66%, and rate of favorable outcome was 43.7%. Mean (SD) workflow times were as follows: OTR: 342 (107) minute, onset to CT: 204 (93) minute, and CT to reperfusion: 138 (56) minute. Longer OTR time was associated with a reduced likelihood of good outcome (OR for 30-minute delay, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.93). The onset to CT time did not show a significant association with clinical outcome (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.67-1.12), whereas the CT to reperfusion interval showed a negative association with favorable outcome (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54-0.95).

The primary focus of this study is to predict PPIs between virus and its targeted host, which are involved in viral infection. We developed a general method that predicts interactions between virus and host proteins using the repeat patterns and composition of amino acids. In independent testing of the method with PPIs of new viruses and hosts, it showed a high performance comparable to the best performance of other methods for single virus-host PPIs. In comparison of our method with others using same datasets, our method outperformed the others. The repeat patterns and composition of amino acids are simple, yet powerful features for predicting virus-host PPIs.

While Oshima 5-10 was cleared from the brain, Sofjin-HO was not cleared despite a similar level of expression of the intact Oas1b gene. Necrotic neurons with viral antigens and inflammatory reactions were observed in the brain infected with Sofjin-HO.

The aim of this study was to describe lung ultrasound findings and their prognostic value in patients with COVID-19 admitted to internal medicine ward. METHOD: This prospective observational study consecutively enrolled 105 hospitalized participants with COVID-19 at 2 tertiary care centers. Ultrasound was performed in 12 lung zones within 24 hours of admission. Findings were assessed relative to 4 outcomes: intensive care unit (ICU) need, need for intensive respiratory support, length of stay, and death. RESULTS: We detected abnormalities in 92% (97/105) of participants. The common findings were confluent B-lines (92%), non-homogenous pleural lines (78%), and consolidations (54%). Large confluent B-lines, consolidations, bilateral involvement, and any abnormality in &#8805; 6 areas were associated with a longer hospitalization and need for intensive respiratory support. Large confluent B-lines and bilateral involvement were also associated with ICU stay. A total lung ultrasound score <5 had a negative predictive value of 100% for the need of intensive respiratory support. A higher total lung ultrasound score was associated with ICU need (median total 18 in the ICU group vs. 11 non-ICU, p = 0.004), a hospitalization &#8805; 9d (15 vs 10, p = 0.016) and need for intensive respiratory support (18 vs. 8.5, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had lung ultrasound abnormalities on admission and a higher lung ultrasound score was associated with worse clinical outcomes except death. A low total lung ultrasound score (<5) had a negative predictive value of 100% for the need of intensive respiratory support.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this outbreak a global health emergency and as on April 24, 2020, it has spread to 213 countries, with 25,91,015 confirmed cases and 742,855 cases have been recovered from COVID-19. In this dreadful situation our team has already published an article in the Science of the Total Environment, which elaborates the various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this situation, it is imperative to understand the possible outcome of COVID-19 recovered patients and determine if they have any other detrimental illnesses by longitudinal analysis to safeguard their life in future. It is necessary to follow-up these recovered patients and performs comprehensive assessments for detection and appropriate management towards their psychological, physical, and social realm. This urges us to suggest that it is highly important to provide counselling, moral support as well as a few recommended guidelines to the recovered patients and society to restore to normalcy. Epidemiological, clinical and immunological studies from COVID-19 recovered patients are particularly important to understand the disease and to prepare better for potential outbreaks in the future. Longitudinal studies on a larger cohort would help us to understand the in-depth prognosis as well as the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Also, follow-up studies will help us provide more information for the development of vaccines and drugs for these kinds of pandemics in the future. Hence, we recommend more studies are required to unravel the possible mechanism of COVID-19 infection and the after-effects of it to understand the characteristics of the virus and to develop the necessary precautionary measures to prevent it.","output":"Follow-up studies in COVID-19 recovered patients - is it mandatory?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Graphical Image, graphical Background The cytokine storm (CS) triggered by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused serious harm to health of Humanity and huge economic burden to the world, and there is a lack of effective methods to treat this complication. Purpose In this research, we used network pharmacology and molecular docking to reveal the interaction mechanism in the glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) for the treatment of CS, and validated the effect of GA intervention CS by experiments. Study design First, we screened corresponding target of GA and CS from online databases, and obtained the action target genes through the Venn diagram. Then, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, Gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment of the action target genes were acquired by R language to predict its mechanism. Next, molecular docking was performed on core targets. Finally, experiments in which GA intervened in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced CS were implemented. Results 84 action target genes were obtained from online database. The PPI network of target genes showed that TNF, IL6, MAPK3, PTGS2, ESR1 and PPARG were considered as the core genes. The results of GO and KEGG showed that action target genes were closely related to inflammatory and immune related signaling pathways, such as TNF signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, Human cytomegalovirus infection, PPAR signaling pathway and so on. Molecule docking results prompted that GA had fine affinity with IL-6 and TNF- proteins. Finally, in vivo and in vitro experimental results showed that GA could significantly inhibit LPS-induced CS.

The present study examined whether training in emotional intelligence (EI) skills, provided before the pandemic, would serve as a protective factor for sustaining mental health during the COVID\\\\19 crisis. METHODS: Data came from a longitudinal study (N = 89) that was initially designed to test the effectiveness of an EI training program versus a non\\\\emotion\\\\focused placebo program. The design and timing of the study were such that baseline and posttraining assessments of depression and anxiety had been completed before the pandemic, and planned 6\\\\month follow\\\\ups were serendipitously scheduled to occur after the onset of the COVID\\\\19 crisis. This provided us with an unexpected real\\\\world opportunity to investigate whether EI training would bolster emotional resilience to the challenges posed by the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. RESULTS: Although mental health concerns generally increased after the start of the pandemic, individuals who completed the EI training program scored lower on depression, suicidal ideation, and state anxiety relative to individuals who had been assigned to the placebo training program.

METHODOLOGY: In this cross-sectional observational study, matched saliva and oral swabs were collected from a total of 115 subjects: 70 immunocompetent subjects with no mucosal abnormalities, 22 with mucosal abnormalities and 23 therapeutically immunocompromised individuals. Extracted DNA was analysed by multiplex qPCR for detection and quantification of HHVs 1-6. RESULTS: At least one human herpes virus was detected in 77.1% of immunocompetent individuals with no mucosal abnormalities, with EBV the most commonly detected at 61.4%. HHV-6 was detected in 17.1%, HSV-1 in 4.3% and CMV in 1.1%. Detection was higher in saliva than in oral swabs. There was no detection of HSV-2 or VZV. Neither presence of oral mucosal abnormality nor therapeutic immunocompromise was related to increased detection of human herpes virus. CONCLUSION: Commensal detection rates of EBV are high, and caution in clinical correlation of positive detection is warranted.

Two different variants of female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. The two variants differed in daily weight gain (0.38 g/day vs. 1.41 g/day during 28 days), and were designated slowly and rapidly growing rats (SGR and RGR) respectively. Oxytocin 1 mg/kg given s.c. to SGR for a five-day period increased weight gain significantly in comparison to a previous five-day period with NaCl-treatment (18.0 g/5 days versus 5.0 g/5 days; p<0.01). In a separate study, oxytocin 1 mg/kg given for four days increased weight gain significantly in SGR versus saline-treated controls (7.5 g/4 days versus 1.6 g/4 days; p<0.05). The weight-difference persisted six days later (p<0.001). The weight increase of oxytocin occurred only during estrus (p<0.05) and was not accompanied by any measurable increase in food intake. In RGR, oxytocin-treatment decreased food intake significantly (p<0.001) and tended to decrease weight gain, although not significantly. The SGR and RGR also had different endocrine profiles with, for example, twice as high oxytocin (p<0.01) and insulin levels (p<0.01) in RGR compared to the SGR. These data suggest that oxytocin influences weight gain and food intake differently in the two variants of Sprague-Dawley rats, perhaps depending on factors such as endocrine profile and oxytocin sensitivity.","output":"Dissociation of oxytocin effects on body weight in two variants of female Sprague-Dawley rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Airway management is an important component of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Recent guidelines recommend keeping any interruptions of chest compressions as short as possible and not lasting more than 10 seconds. Endotracheal intubation seems to be the ideal method for establishing a secure airway by experienced providers, but emergency medical technicians (EMT) often lack training and practice. For the EMTs supraglottic devices might serve as alternatives. METHODS 40 EMTs were trained in a 1-hour standardised audio-visual lesson to handle six different airway devices including endotracheal intubation, Combitube, EasyTube, I-Gel, Laryngeal Mask Airway and Laryngeal tube. EMTs performances were evaluated immediately after a brief practical demonstration, as well as after 1 and 3 months without any practice in between, in a randomised order. Hands-off time was pair-wise compared between airway devices using a repeated-measures mixed-effects model. RESULTS Overall mean hands-off time was significantly (p<0.01) lower for Laryngeal tube (6.1s; confidence interval 5.2-6.9s), Combitube (7.9s; 95% CI 6.9-9.0s), EasyTube (8.8s; CI 7.3-10.3s), LMA (10.2s; CI 8.6-11.7s), and I-Gel (11.9s; CI 10.2-13.7s) compared to endotracheal intubation (39.4s; CI 34.0-44.9s). Hands-off time was within the recommended limit of 10s for Combitube, EasyTube and Laryngeal tube after 1 month and for all supraglottic devices after 3 months without any training, but far beyond recommended limits in all three evaluations for endotracheal intubation. CONCLUSION Using supraglottic airway devices, EMTs achieved a hands-off time within the recommended time limit of 10s, even after three months without any training or practice. Supraglottic airway devices are recommended tools for EMTs with lack of experience in advanced airway management.","output":"Evaluation of airway management associated hands-off time during cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a randomised manikin follow-up study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) causes acute and severe watery diarrhoea and dehydration, as well as 50C100 per cent mortality in piglets.

We performed a secondary subgroup analysis to verify the effects of comprehensive cancer treatment classification on vaccine immunogenicity. METHODS: The Vax-On prospectively enrolled patients who started two-dose mRNA-BNT162b2 vaccine schedule from March 9 to April 12, 2021 (timepoint-1). Those on active treatment within previous 28 days accounted for the exposed cases. Patients who had discontinued such treatment by at least 28 days or received intravesical therapy represented the control cases. Quantification of IgG antibodies against receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was performed before the second dose (timepoint-2) and 8 weeks thereafter (timepoint-3). Seroconversion response was defined at 50 AU/mL IgG titer. Classification of antineoplastic agents was based on their pharmacodynamic properties. RESULTS: 366 patients were enrolled (86 and 260 as control and exposed cases, respectively). Univariate analysis revealed significantly lower IgG titer after both doses of vaccine in subgroups treated with TKIs, multiple cytotoxic agents, alkylating agents, and topoisomerase inhibitors. At timepoint-3, seroconversion response was significantly impaired in topoisomerase inhibitors and mTOR inhibitor subgroup. After multivariate testing, treatment with alkylating agents and TKIs were significantly associated with reduced change in IgG titer at timepoint-2. Treatment with mTOR inhibitors resulted in a similar interaction at each timepoint. CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment was independently correlated with an incremental variation in IgG titer at timepoint-3. Specific subgroups (TKIs, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, and multiple-agent chemotherapy) predicted lack of seroconversion at timepoint-2, but their effect was not retained at timepoint-3. ECOG-PS2, immunosuppressive corticosteroid dosing and G-CSF use independently linked to lower IgG titer after either dose of vaccine.

The virus is endemic in the Middle East but can be transmitted to other countries by travel activity. The introduction of MERS-CoV into the Republic of Korea by an infected traveler resulted in a hospital outbreak of MERS that entailed 186 cases and 38 deaths. The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein binds to the cellular protein DPP4 via its receptor binding domain (RBD) and mediates viral entry into target cells. During the MERS outbreak in Korea, emergence and spread of viral variants that harbored mutations in the RBD, D510G and I529T, was observed. Counterintuitively, these mutations were found to reduce DPP4 binding and viral entry into target cells. In this study, we investigated whether they also exerted proviral effects. We confirm that changes D510G and I529T reduce S protein binding to DPP4 but show that this reduction only translates into diminished viral entry when expression of DPP4 on target cells is low. Neither mutation modulated S protein binding to sialic acids, S protein activation by host cell proteases, or inhibition of S protein-driven entry by interferon-induced transmembrane proteins. In contrast, changes D510G and I529T increased resistance of S protein-driven entry to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and sera from MERS patients. These findings indicate that MERS-CoV variants with reduced neutralization sensitivity were transmitted during the Korean outbreak and that the responsible mutations were compatible with robust infection of cells expressing high levels of DPP4. IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV has pandemic potential, and it is important to identify mutations in viral proteins that might augment viral spread. In the course of a large hospital outbreak of MERS in the Republic of Korea in 2015, the spread of a viral variant that contained mutations in the viral spike protein was observed. These mutations were found to reduce receptor binding and viral infectivity. However, it remained unclear whether they also exerted proviral effects.

Confocal imaging identified NSP9 to be largely localized in close proximity to the endoplasmic reticulum. In agreement with the subcellular distribution of NSP9, association of NSP9 with NUP62 was observed in cytoplasm. Furthermore, the overexpression of NSP9 correlated with a reduction of NUP62 expression on the nuclear envelope, suggesting that attenuating NUP62 expression might have contributed to defective NPC formation. Importantly, the loss of NUP62 impaired translocation of p65, a subunit of NF-B, upon TNF- stimulation. Concordantly, NSP9 over-expression blocked p65 nuclear transport.

PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched and records were independently screened by two authors, initially on title and abstract and subsequently on full-text basis. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. Results Of 2.882 records screened, 18 studies were included. The median survival was 23 months. One-year survival was median 95% and 3-year survival was median 58%. Complete ablation response and adjuvant chemotherapy produce considerably improved survival and low local recurrence rate outcomes. Conclusion Percutaneous ultrasound-guided ablation technique for colorectal liver metastases provides impressive survival rates for patients not suited for surgical resection.

It has long been recognized that type I IFNs can potently block HIV-1 replication in vitro; as such, HIV-1 has been used as a system to identify and characterize IFN-induced antiviral proteins responsible for this block. IFN-induced HERC5 contains an amino-terminal Regulator of Chromosome Condensation 1 (RCC1)-like domain and a carboxyl-terminal Homologous to the E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus (HECT) domain. HERC5 is the main cellular E3 ligase that conjugates the IFN-induced protein ISG15 to proteins. This E3 ligase activity was previously shown to inhibit the replication of evolutionarily diverse viruses, including HIV-1. The contribution of the RCC1-like domain to the antiviral activity of HERC5 was previously unknown. RESULTS: In this study, we showed that HERC5 inhibits HIV-1 particle production by a second distinct mechanism that targets the nuclear export of Rev/RRE-dependent RNA. Unexpectedly, the E3 ligase activity of HERC5 was not required for this inhibition. Instead, this activity required the amino-terminal RCC1-like domain of HERC5. Inhibition correlated with a reduction in intracellular RanGTP protein levels and/or the ability of RanGTP to interact with RanBP1. Inhibition also correlated with altered subcellular localization of HIV-1 Rev. In addition, we demonstrated that positive evolutionary selection is operating on HERC5. We identified a region in the RCC1-like domain that exhibits an exceptionally high probability of having evolved under positive selection and showed that this region is required for HERC5-mediated inhibition of nuclear export. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a second distinct mechanism by which HERC5 inhibits HIV-1 replication and demonstrate that HERC5 is evolving under strong positive selection. Together, our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that HERC5 is a novel host restriction factor.","output":"Interferon-induced HERC5 is evolving under positive selection and inhibits HIV-1 particle production by a novel mechanism targeting Rev/RRE-dependent RNA nuclear export"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Associations between vaccine breakthrough cases and infection by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have remained largely unexplored. Here we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences and viral loads from 1,373 persons with COVID-19 from the San Francisco Bay Area from February 1 to June 30, 2021, of which 125 (9.1%) were vaccine breakthrough infections. Fully vaccinated were more likely than unvaccinated persons to be infected by variants carrying mutations associated with decreased antibody neutralization (L452R, L452Q, E484K, and/or F490S) (78% versus 48%, p = 1.96e-08), but not by those associated with increased infectivity only (N501Y) (85% versus 77%, p = 0.092). Differences in viral loads were non-significant between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated persons overall (p = 0.99) and according to lineage (p = 0.09 - 0.78). Viral loads were significantly higher in symptomatic as compared to asymptomatic vaccine breakthrough cases (p < 0.0001), and symptomatic vaccine breakthrough infections had similar viral loads to unvaccinated infections (p = 0.64). In 5 cases with available longitudinal samples for serologic analyses, vaccine breakthrough infections were found to be associated with low or undetectable neutralizing antibody levels attributable to immunocompromised state or infection by an antibody-resistant lineage.

There is a need to identify better biomarkers to detect NSCLC at an early stage as this will improve therapeutic effect and patient survival rates. METHODS Two lectins (AAL/AAGL and AAL2/AANL), which specifically bind to tumour-related glycan antigens, were first used to enrich serum glycoproteins from the serum of early NSCLC patients, benign lung diseases subjects and healthy individuals. The samples were investigated by using iTRAQ labelling and LC-MS/MS. RESULTS A total of 53 differentially expressed proteins were identified by quantitative proteomics and four glycoproteins (AACT, AGP1, CFB and HPX) were selected for further verification by western blotting. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed AACT was the best candidate for early NSCLC diagnosis of the four proteins, with 94.1% sensitivity in distinguishing early tumour Stage (IA+IB) from tumour-free samples (healthy and benign samples, HB). The GlcNAcylated AACT was further detected by lectin-based ELISA and has better advantage in clinical application than total AACT. The GlcNAcylated AACT can effectively differentiate Stage I from HB samples with an AUC of 0.908 and 90.9% sensitivity at a specificity of 86.2%. A combination of GlcNAcylated AACT and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was able to effectively differing Stage I from HB samples (AUC=0.914), which significantly improve the specificity of CEA. The combination application also has the better clinical diagnostic efficacy in distinguishing cancer (NSCLC) from HB samples than CEA or GlcNAcylated AACT used alone, and yielded an AUC of 0.817 with 93.1% specificity.

DATA SOURCES We reviewed the relevant literature complied from available sources, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and otolaryngology journals providing electronic manuscripts ahead of indexing or publication. REVIEW METHODS Incorporating available evidence and the projected infection control and resource limitations at our institution, we collectively authored a dynamic set of protocols guiding (1) case stratification, (2) preoperative assessment, (3) operative setup, and (4) postoperative care of patients with sinus or skull base presentations. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19 publications, lack of rigorous data, and urgent necessity of standardized protocols, strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were not employed. CONCLUSIONS As scarce hospital resources are diverted to COVID-19 care and staff are redeployed to forward-facing roles, endonasal procedures have largely ceased, leaving patients with ongoing sinonasal and skull base complaints untreated. Skull base teams now weigh the urgency of surgery in this population with the regional availability of resources. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE The COVID-19 pandemic will have an enduring and unpredictable impact on hospital operations and surgical skull base practices and will require a dynamic set of management protocols responsive to new evidence and changing resources.

Case Presentation. We present two patients with latent herpetic keratitis who experienced reactivation of keratitis within weeks of COVID-19 vaccination despite prolonged periods of prior latency. A 52-year-old healthy male with no herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis recurrences in two years developed visual decline and patchy stromal haze within 24-48 hours of receiving the second Pfizer-BioNTech (COVID-19 BNT162b2) vaccine.

Specifically, this paper calls for a review of work readiness skills developed in psychological courses to ensure industry needs are met. Beyond such a review, it is suggested that tertiary centres need to facilitate students in capturing and reflecting upon the transferable skills that they develop; and build assessments that allow students to demonstrate transferable skills in a meaningful way.

A qualitative analysis of the reasons for choosing specific allocation schemes supplements our results. RESULTS: Presence of the factor information about the population-level effects of the allocation scheme substantially increased the probability of choosing a resource allocation system that minimized overall harm among the population, while prognosis did not affect allocation choices. The main reasons for choosing an allocation scheme differed among schemes, but did not differ among those who received additional model-based information on expected population-level effects and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Providing information on the expected population-level effects from dynamic infectious disease modelling studies resulted in a substantially different choice of allocation schemes. This finding supports the importance of incorporating model-based information in decision-making processes and communication strategies.

CDTI is often hampered by coendemicity with loiasis (another filariasis caused by Loa loa) in some areas. Strong epidemiological evidence suggests that O. volvulus infection increases the risk for onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy (OAE) among Cameroonian children. This highlights the urgent need to strengthen onchocerciasis elimination programmes in mesoendemic/hyperendemic areas. Novel alternative strategies, such as the slash and clear (S&C) vector control method, may be required to complement ongoing CDTI to accelerate elimination of transmission. The short-term impact of S&C on the biting rates of the blackfly vectors has been demonstrated in other settings. However, its long-term effectiveness and impact on parasitological and serological markers of onchocerciasis transmission as well as on OAE are still unknown. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We aim to assess the effectiveness of annual S&C interventions combined with CDTI in reducing onchocerciasis transmission and epilepsy incidence. Eight onchocerciasis-endemic villages located <5 km from the Mbam or Sanaga rivers will be randomised to two arms: four villages will receive yearly CDTI only for two consecutive years (Arm 1), while the other four villages will receive CDTI plus annual S&C for 2 years (Arm 2). Study outcomes (blackfly biting rates, infectivity rates and seroprevalence of onchocerciasis antibodies (Ov16 antibodies) in children, prevalence of microfilaridermia and epilepsy incidence) will be monitored prospectively and compared across study arms. We expect that S&C will have an added benefit over CDTI alone. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has received ethical approval from the institutional review board of the Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Board (reference number: IRB2021-03) and has been registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry. Findings will be disseminated at national and international levels via meetings and peer-reviewed publications.

As medical systems continue to develop vaccines and treatments, it is crucial for the public health community to establish nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that can effectively mitigate the rate of SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread across highly populated residential areas, especially among individuals who have close contact with confirmed cases. A community-driven preparedness strategy has been implemented in metropolitan areas in China. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) has required that all COVID-19 confirmed cases be recorded and documented in a national notifiable disease surveillance system (NDSS). After receiving reports of newly confirmed cases, an epidemiological services team at the CCDC or trained medical professionals at local clinical facilities start a case-contact investigation. A task force performs home visits to infected individuals. Persons under investigation (PUIs) can stay in designated quarantine facilities for 14 days or in special circumstances can be quarantined at home.

We describe a new imaging platform that permits automated, simultaneous quantification of each of the main C. elegans motor programs over hours or days. Analysis of these whole-organism behavioral profiles shows that the motor programs coordinately change as animals switch behavioral states. Utilizing genetics, optogenetics, and calcium imaging, we identify a new role for dopamine in coupling locomotion and egg-laying together across states.

Deaths caused by COVID-19 are still increasing day by day and early diagnosis has become crucial. Since current diagnostic methods have many disadvantages, new investigations are needed to improve the performance of diagnosis. METHODS: A novel method is proposed to automatically diagnose COVID-19 by using Electrocardiogram (ECG) data with deep learning for the first time. Moreover, a new and effective method called hexaxial feature mapping is proposed to represent 12-lead ECG to 2D colorful images. Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method is used to extract features and generate hexaxial mapping images. These generated images are then fed into a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to diagnose COVID-19. RESULTS: Two different classification scenarios are conducted on a publicly available paper-based ECG image dataset to reveal the diagnostic capability and performance of the proposed approach. In the first scenario, ECG data labeled as COVID-19 and No-Findings (normal) are classified to evaluate COVID-19 classification ability. According to results, the proposed approach provides encouraging COVID-19 detection performance with an accuracy of 96.20% and F1-Score of 96.30%. In the second scenario, ECG data labeled as Negative (normal, abnormal, and myocardial infarction) and Positive (COVID-19) are classified to evaluate COVID-19 diagnostic ability. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach provides satisfactory COVID-19 prediction performance with an accuracy of 93.00% and F1-Score of 93.20%. Furthermore, different experimental studies are conducted to evaluate the robustness of the proposed approach. CONCLUSION: Automatic detection of cardiovascular changes caused by COVID-19 can be possible with a deep learning framework through ECG data. This not only proves the presence of cardiovascular changes caused by COVID-19 but also reveals that ECG can potentially be used in the diagnosis of COVID-19. We believe the proposed study may provide a crucial decision-making system for healthcare professionals.

We report on an opioid overdose reversal and naloxone distribution program that was instituted at the first safe consumption site in Latin America. Methods A cross-sectional analysis of witnessed drug overdoses and naloxone distribution between 1 June 2019 and 31 May 2021 in Mexicali, Mexico. Case report forms were entered in an electronic database. Trends in overdose and naloxone distribution were described. Comparisons were made before and after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared in the city. Maps were created to represent the geographic distribution of overdose in the city. Results During the study period 1,534 doses of naloxone were distributed throughout the community. In addition, there were 464 overdoses reported during this period, of which 4 were fatal. There was a 30% increase in reported overdoses from the period before the COVID-19 pandemic to the period after the pandemic was declared (p = 0.03). Most common substance reported included heroin (93%), sedatives (21%), methamphetamine (16%) and fentanyl (14%). Naloxone was given in 96% of cases (median 1 dose, IQR 1-2 doses) and emergency services were called in 20% of cases. Conclusions An opioid overdose reversal program in Mexicali, Mexico was able to distribute naloxone and register drug overdoses between 2019 and 2021 as a harm reduction strategy.

In the current epidemiological context, CRD have received much interest when considering their correlation with greater susceptibility to SARS-Cov-2 and severe disease (COVID-19). Increasingly more studies have investigated pathophysiological interactions between CRD and COVID-19. AREA COVERED: Animal experimentation has decisively contributed to advancing our knowledge of CRD. Considering the increase in ethical restrictions in animal experimentation, researchers must focus on new experimental alternatives. Two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures have complemented animal models and significantly contributed to advancing research in the life sciences. However, 2D cell cultures have several limitations in studies of cellular interactions. Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures represent a new and robust platform for studying complex biological processes and are a promising alternative in regenerative and translational medicine. EXPERT OPINION: Three-dimensional cell cultures are obtained by combining several types of cells in integrated and self-organized systems in a 3D structure. These 3D cell culture systems represent an efficient methodological approach in studies of pathophysiology and lung therapy. More recently, complex 3D culture systems, such as lung-on-a-chip, seek to mimic the physiology of a lung in vivo through a microsystem that simulates alveolar-capillary interactions and exposure to air.

With IL-1-stimulated human neutrophils, each RvT dose- and time-dependently decreased NETosis giving ~50% potencies at 10 nM, compared to the known NETosis inhibitors [10 M].

Three kinds of characterization systems were developed namely (a) Block imaging for COVID-19 severity index (CSI); (b) Bispectrum analysis; and (c) Block Entropy. A cohort of Italian patients with 30 controls (990 slices) and 30 COVID-19 patients (705 slices) was used to test the performance of three types of classifiers. Using K10 protocol (90% training and 10% testing), the best accuracy and AUC was for DCNN and RF pairs were 99.41  5.12%, 0.991 (p < 0.0001), and 99.41  0.62%, 0.988 (p < 0.0001), respectively, followed by other ML and TL classifiers.

METHOD: Structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of IPV survivors, 93% of whom identified as women, living in a rural parish (county) in Louisiana (n = 41). Interviews included COVID-19-related stressors (e.g., rent stress due to the pandemic) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5) and resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 10) validated scales. Data were analyzed using independent t tests to determine differences across race with respect to PTSD and resilience and logistic regression to predict group membership in the probable PTSD group. RESULTS: Results indicate 72.5% and 56.2% of rural IPV survivors interviewed reported experiencing rent/mortgage stress and nutritional stress, respectively, due to the pandemic. No statistically significant differences by race for probable PTSD or resilience were found. Rent or mortgage stress due to COVID-19 was a significant predictor of probable PTSD in the regression model.

The present study assessed this relationship among healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in the care of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: An online survey was conducted in a municipal hospital with 195 nationally designated negative pressure isolation units in Korea. Anxiety level was measured using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and changes in anxiety levels were assessed based on the time when COVID-19 vaccine was introduced in March 2021 in Korea. Monthly PPE usage between June 2020 and May 2021 was investigated. RESULTS: The mean SAS score (33.25  5.97) was within normal range and was lower than those reported in previous studies conducted before COVID-19 vaccination became available. Among the 93 HCWs who participated, 64 (68.8%) answered that their fear of contracting COVID-19 decreased after vaccination. The number of coveralls used per patient decreased from 33.6 to 0. However, a demand for more PPE than necessary was observed in situations where HCWs were exposed to body fluids and secretions (n = 38, 40.9%). Excessive demand for PPE was not related to age, working experience, or SAS score.

Our aim was to provide a comprehensive account of all hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in England during the early phase of the pandemic and to identify the factors that influenced mortality as the pandemic evolved. METHODS: This was a retrospective exploratory analysis using the Hospital Episode Statistics administrative dataset. All patients aged 18 years or older in England who completed a hospital stay (were discharged alive or died) between March 1 and May 31, 2020, and had a diagnosis of COVID-19 on admission or during their stay were included. In-hospital death was the primary outcome of interest. Multilevel logistic regression was used to model the relationship between death and several covariates: age, sex, deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation), ethnicity, frailty (Hospital Frailty Risk Score), presence of comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index items), and date of discharge (whether alive or deceased). FINDINGS: 91a541 adult patients with COVID-19 were discharged during the study period, among which 28a200 (308%) in-hospital deaths occurred. The final multilevel logistic regression model accounted for age, deprivation score, and date of discharge as continuous variables, and sex, ethnicity, and Charlson Comorbidity Index items as categorical variables. In this model, significant predictors of in-hospital death included older age (modelled using restricted cubic splines), male sex (1457 [1408-1509]), greater deprivation (1002 [1001-1003]), Asian (1211 [1128-1299]) or mixed ethnicity (1317 [1080-1605]; vs White ethnicity), and most of the assessed comorbidities, including moderate or severe liver disease (5433 [4618-6392]). Later date of discharge was associated with a lower odds of death (0977 [0976-0978]); adjusted in-hospital mortality improved significantly in a broadly linear fashion, from 522% in the first week of March to 168% in the last week of May. INTERPRETATION: Reductions in the adjusted probability of in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients over time might reflect the impact of changes in hospital strategy and clinical processes. The reasons for the observed improvements in mortality should be thoroughly investigated to inform the response to future outbreaks. The higher mortality rate reported for certain ethnic minority groups in community-based studies compared with our hospital-based analysis might partly reflect differential infection rates in those at greatest risk, propensity to become severely ill once infected, and health-seeking behaviours.

Elevated IL-6 levels are also observed in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Our study aimed to describe the association between circulating IL-6 levels and MAFLD at hospital admission with risk of severe COVID-19. Methods: A total of 167 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from three Chinese hospitals were enrolled. Circulating levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;, and interferon (IFN)-?3 were measured at admission. All patients were screened for fatty liver by computed tomography. Forty-six patients were diagnosed as MAFLD. Results: Patients with MAFLD (n = 46) had higher serum IL-6 levels (median 7.1 [interquartile range, 4.3-20.0] vs. 4.8 [2.6-11.6] pg/mL, p = 0.030) compared to their counterparts without MAFLD (n = 121). After adjustment for age and sex, patients with MAFLD had a ~2.6-fold higher risk of having severe COVID-19 than those without MAFLD. After adjustment for age, sex and metabolic co-morbidities, increased serum IL-6 levels remained associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19, especially among infected patients with MAFLD (adjusted-odds ratio 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.23; p = 0.002).

In addition, more recently, it is used as a potential prophylactic and treatment for COVID-19 infection. This can lead to toxicity from overingestion. While rare, it has been reported in the literature. In this case report, we present a 75-year-old man with severe hypercalcemia secondary to vitamin D toxicity managed with peritoneal dialysis. He presented with biochemical evidence of hypercalcemia, acute kidney injury, and pancreatitis. Workup for his hypercalcemia led to the diagnosis of vitamin D toxicity as shown by a level greater than 200 ng/dL (Ref: 20C50 ng/mL) was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Cornerstone medical management of hypercalcemia was provided which included aggressive intravenous fluid hydration, intravenous diuretics, calcitonin, bisphosphonate, and corticosteroid therapy. At every interruption of therapy, calcium levels trended upward. A thorough literature review yielded the finding of a sole case report from 1966 presented at the Third International Congress of Nephrology, in which peritoneal dialysis was used in the management of vitamin D toxicity and hypercalcemia. This modality is established to cause vitamin D deficiency.

In this study we have developed an easy and reliable method for closing Petersen's defect in the Roux-en-Y reconstruction after a laparoscopic distal gastrectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed intracorporeal Roux-en-Y reconstruction after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with antiperistaltic gastrojejunostomy. The greater omentum is placed on the cranial side of the transverse colon through the defect between the elevated jejunum and the transverse mesocolon. Anastomosis is performed of the transverse mesocolon attached to the transverse colon, the greater omentum is passed through the Petersen's defect, and the stump of the mesojejunum is attached to the elevated jejunum by an interrupted suture. Petersen's defect is spread and straightened to stabilize the visual field. The thread is inserted first at the base of the stump of the elevated mesojejunum, next to the greater omentum, which has passed through Petersen's defect, and then to the transverse mesocolon to set the starting point of continuous suture. The stitches of continuous suture are sewn toward the transverse colon. Petersen's defect is closed completely. RESULTS We performed this technique in 37 patients. All procedures were completed without intraoperative complication or conversion to laparotomy.

The purpose of this review is to describe the mechanisms through which inhaled environmental exposures accelerate lung aging and cause overt lung disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Environmental exposures related to fossil fuel and tobacco combustion and occupational exposures related to silica and coal mining generate oxidative stress and inflammation in the lungs. Sustained oxidative stress causes DNA damage, epigenetic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell cycle arrest in key progenitor cells in the lung. As a result, critical repair mechanisms are impaired, leading to premature destruction of the lung parenchyma.

We analysed questionnaire data on symptom duration from 10 longitudinal study (LS) samples and electronic healthcare records (EHR) to investigate sociodemographic and health risk factors associated with long COVID, as part of the UK National Core Study for Longitudinal Health and Wellbeing. Methods Analysis was conducted on 6,899 adults self-reporting COVID-19 from 45,096 participants of the UK LS, and on 3,327 cases assigned a long COVID code in primary care EHR out of 1,199,812 adults diagnosed with acute COVID-19. In LS, we derived two outcomes: symptoms lasting 4+ weeks and symptoms lasting 12+ weeks. Associations of potential risk factors (age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, smoking, general and mental health, overweight/obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and asthma) with these two outcomes were assessed, using logistic regression, with meta-analyses of findings presented alongside equivalent results from EHR analyses. Results Functionally limiting long COVID for 12+ weeks affected between 1.2% (age 20), and 4.8% (age 63) of people reporting COVID-19 in LS. The proportion reporting symptoms overall for 12+ weeks ranged from 7.8 (mean age 28) to 17% (mean age 58) and for 4+ weeks 4.2% (age 20) to 33.1% (age 56).

To raise the clinical standard of care for patients who are suicidal and seeking psychiatric crisis services in the ED, we developed Jaspr Health, a tablet-based app for direct use by such patients, which enables the delivery of 4 evidence-based practices. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of Jaspr Health among suicidal adults in EDs. METHODS: Patients who were acutely suicidal and seeking psychiatric crisis services participated in an unblinded pilot randomized controlled trial while in the ED. Participants were randomly assigned to Jaspr Health (n=14) or care as usual (control; n=17) groups. Participants were assessed at baseline, and a 2-hour posttest using self-report measures and a semistructured interview were conducted. RESULTS: Conditions differed significantly at baseline with regard to age but not other demographic variables or baseline measures. On average, participants had been in the ED for 17 hours before enrolling in the study. Over their lifetime, 84% (26/31) of the sample had made a suicide attempt (mean 3.4, SD 6.4) and 61% (19/31) had engaged in nonsuicidal self-injurious behaviors, with an average rate of 8.8 times in the past 3 months. All established feasibility and acceptability criteria were met: no adverse events occurred, participants app use was high, Jaspr Health app user satisfaction ratings were high, and all participants using Jaspr Health recommended its use for other suicidal ED patients. Comparisons between study conditions provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of the app: participants using Jaspr Health reported a statistically significant increase in receiving 4 evidence-based suicide prevention interventions and overall satisfaction ratings with their ED experience. In addition, significant decreases in distress and agitation, along with significant increases in learning to cope more effectively with current and future suicidal thoughts, were observed among participants using Jaspr Health compared with those receiving care as usual. CONCLUSIONS: Even with limited statistical power, the results showed that Jaspr Health is feasible, acceptable, and clinically effective for use by ED patients who are acutely suicidal and seeking ED-based psychiatric crisis services.

We investigated the degree to which adiposity modified the association between dietary inflammatory potential and incident T2DM. Methods: Data from 6,016 US men in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study who completed a 3-day diet record were used. The inflammatory potential of diet was characterized by the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII?), and adiposity was assessed with body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage (BF) and waist-to-height ratio. Inverse probability weights were used in modified Poisson regression models to examine whether adiposity modifies the relationship between the DII and T2DM, while accounting for selection bias from participants who were lost to follow-up. Results: There were 336 incident cases of T2DM after a mean follow-up of 6.5 years. DII scores were not significantly associated with T2DM incidence in multivariable models, but point estimates were consistently elevated across increasing DII quartiles compared to the most anti-inflammatory DII quartile. In the model that evaluated BF, the term for overall effect modification was significant (p = 0.02), but there was no evidence of effect modification on the multiplicative and additive scales when examined further. Effect modification was not present for any other adiposity measures. Conclusions: We did not observe evidence that a pro-inflammatory diet, as measured by the DII, is associated with incidence of T2DM, nor evidence that adiposity modifies a potential relationship.

However, it is possible that even with an optimal use of the increased resources, these will not suffice for all patients in need. Therefore, recommendations for the allocation of intensive care resources in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have been developed by a multidisciplinary group of authors with the support of eight scientific medical societies. The recommendations for procedures and criteria for prioritisations in case of resource scarcity are based on scientific evidence, ethicolegal considerations and practical experience. Medical decisions must always be based on the need and the treatment preferences of the individual patient. In addition to this patient-centred approach, prioritisations in case of resource scarcity require a supraindividual perspective. In such situations, prioritisations should be based on the criterion of clinical prospect of success in order to minimize the number of preventable deaths due to resource scarcity and to avoid discrimination based on age, disabilities or social factors. The assessment of the clinical prospect of success should take into account the severity of the current illness, severe comorbidities and the patient's general health status prior to the current illness.","output":"Decisions on the allocation of intensive care resources in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic : Clinical and ethical recommendations of DIVI, DGINA, DGAI, DGIIN, DGNI, DGP, DGP and AEM"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Work life balance is a central issue affecting wellbeing as family and work are the most important element of every individual's life Work life balance is always challenging for all working personnel Work from home scenario changed balance between work life and personal life Many previous studies have explored the nature of work life balance but rarely any study could cover pandemic affected working scenario This study attempted to investigate various other factors affecting work life balance when employees are obligated to mandatorily work from home The study intended to study the current work life balance situation and identified that work life responsibilities has an impact on personal life of employees The study collected data from 60 employees working from home during pandemic Data were analysed and found that there is negative impact in the work life balance of the employees Accordingly the employees are the one who determines the company's growth should be given the desired environment to enhance their job satisfaction ? 2020","output":"A Study on Impact of Covid in Work Life Balance of Employees in Chennai"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interindividual variability in susceptibility to HIV\\\\1 infection, its transmission, disease progression, and response to antiviral therapy has been attributed to host determinants and variability in multiple genes.

Despite its primary effect on the respiratory system, the virus does not solely impact those with underlying lung conditions as initially predicted. Indeed, prognosis is worsened (often fatal) in patients with pre-existing hyperinflammatory responses (e.g., hypertension, obesity and diabetes), yet the mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. A number of psychological conditions are associated with inflammation, suggesting that these may also be significant risk factors for negative outcomes of COVID-19. In this review, we evaluate preclinical and clinical literature suggesting that chronic stress-induced hyperinflammation interacts synergistically with COVID-19-related inflammation, contributing to a potentially fatal cytokine storm syndrome. In particular, we hypothesize that both chronic stress and COVID-19-related hyperinflammation are a product of glucocorticoid insufficiency. We discuss the devastating effects of SARS-CoV-2 on structural and functional aspects of the biological stress response and how these induce exaggerated inflammatory responses, particularly interleukin (IL)-6 hypersecretion. We postulate that chronic stress should be considered a significant risk factor for adverse COVID-19-related health outcomes, given overlapping peripheral and central immune dysregulation in both conditions. We conclude by discussing how people with a history of chronic stress could mitigate their risk for COVID-19 complications, identifying specific strategies that can be implemented during self-isolation.","output":"Does inflammation link stress to poor COVID-19 outcome?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted the practice of endoscopy, but characteristics of COVID patients undergoing endoscopy have not been adequately described. AIMS: To compare findings, clinical outcomes, and patient characteristics of endoscopies performed during the pandemic in patients with and without COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter study of adult endoscopies at six academic hospitals in New York between March 16 and April 30, 2020. Patient and procedure characteristics including age, sex, indication, findings, interventions, and outcomes were compared in patients testing positive, negative, or untested for COVID-19. RESULTS: Six hundred and five endoscopies were performed on 545 patients during the study period. There were 84 (13.9%), 255 (42.2%), and 266 (44.0%) procedures on COVID-positive, negative, and untested patients, respectively. COVID patients were more likely to undergo endoscopy for gastrointestinal bleeding or gastrostomy tube placement, and COVID patients with gastrointestinal bleeding more often required hemostatic interventions on multivariable logistic regression. COVID patients had increased length of stay, intensive care unit admission, and intubation rate. Twenty-seven of 521 patients (5.2%) with no or negative COVID testing prior to endoscopy later tested positive, a median of 13.5 days post-procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopies in COVID patients were more likely to require interventions, due either to more severe illness or a higher threshold to perform endoscopy. A significant number of patients endoscoped without testing were subsequently found to be COVID-positive. Gastroenterologists in areas affected by the pandemic must adapt to changing patterns of endoscopy practice and ensure pre-endoscopy COVID testing.","output":"Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients Undergoing Endoscopy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicenter Study from New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose To examine outcomes in COVID-19 positive acute care patients and the differential impact of the presence of COVID-19 Variants of Concern (VOCs). Methods & Materials This study was a cross-sectional analysis using patient data from the patient's electronic medical records. Inclusion criteria were COVID-19-positive patients hospitalized within acute care sites in Fraser Health (British Columbia) between January 1 and April 30, 2021. Data analysis was conducted using SAS Studio 3.8 and STATA 17.0. Results Of the patients included in the study, 934 (33%) were classified as having a VOC. The proportion of VOC-related COVID-19 cases steadily increased from 0.6% of all COVID-19 admissions in January 2021 to 67.2% in April 2021. Males were more likely to have VOCs than females (36% vs. 30%). The age groups with the highest proportion of VOCs were 40-49 (51%), 50-59 (44%), and 60-69 (40%). After controlling for sex and age, it was shown that patients with VOCs were more than twice as likely to require critical care admission than those without VOCs (OR=2.04, 95%CI:1.67, 2.48; p<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in overall length of stay (p=0.502) or length of stay in critical care (p=0.237) for those with VOCs after controlling for age and sex. While patients with VOCs were more than twice as likely to require critical care, there was no difference in mortality (OR=1.03, 95%CI:0.75,1.41), p=0.877). Conclusion VOCs were more likely to be present in middle-aged hospitalized patients than in older patients, and were more prevalent in males. Patients with VOCs were more likely to require critical care; however, there was no difference in length of stay in critical care, or in overall mortality. This is important to understand, as VOCs make up a larger proportion of COVID-19 cases, and will likely place significant burden on critical care resources. Limitations of this study are that other factors such as co-morbidities and socioeconomic status have not been controlled for, and the findings may not be generalizable to other health regions with different populations and health care systems. This study provides groundwork for future research on this evolving topic.","output":"COVID-19 Variants of Concern: An Analysis of Critical Care Admission in Hospitalized Patients in a Canadian Health Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Much uncertainty persists about how the coronavirus (COVID-19) and its derived crisis effects will impact both the economy and forests. Here we conceptualize a recursive model where an initial COVID-19 supply-side shock hits first the Global North that, mediated by country-specific epidemic management strategies and other (fiscal, monetary, trade) policy responses feeds through to financial markets and the real economy. Analytically we distinguish two stylized scenarios: an optimistic V-shaped recovery where effective policy responses render most economic damages transitory, versus a pessimistic pathway of economic depression, where short-run pandemic impacts are dwarfed by the subsequent economic breakdown. Economic impacts are transitioned from the global North to the South through trade, tourism, remittances and investment/capital flows. As for impacts on tropical forests, we compare the effects of past economic crises to early indicators for incipient trends. We find national income and commodity price effects to be torn between three forces: a contractive-inflationary supply-side shock, deflationary pandemic demand-side effects, and expansive-inflationary monetary and fiscal policy responses. We discuss how global forest outcomes will depend on how these macroeconomic battles are resolved, but also on geographical differences in deforestation dynamics. Reviewing recent fire and deforestation alerts data, as well as annual tree-cover loss data, we find that deforestation-curbing and -enhancing factors so far just about neutralized each other.

Proper setting of flow boundary conditions in computational hemodynamic models of coronary arteries is one of the sources of uncertainty weakening the findings of in silico experiments, in consequence of the challenging task of obtaining in vivo 3D flow measurements within the clinical framework. Accordingly, in this study we evaluated the influence of assumptions on inflow velocity profile shape on coronary artery hemodynamics. To do that, (1) ten left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) geometries were reconstructed from clinical angiography, and (2) eleven velocity profiles with realistic 3D features such as eccentricity and differently shaped (single- and double-vortex) secondary flows were generated analytically and imposed as inflow boundary conditions. Wall shear stress and helicity-based descriptors obtained prescribing the commonly used parabolic velocity profile were compared with those obtained with the other velocity profiles. Our findings indicated that the imposition of idealized velocity profiles as inflow boundary condition is acceptable as long the results of the proximal vessel segment are not considered, in LAD coronary arteries. As a pragmatic rule of thumb, a conservative estimation of the length of influence of the shape of the inflow velocity profile on LAD local hemodynamics can be given by the theoretical entrance length for cylindrical conduits in laminar flow conditions.","output":"Does the inflow velocity profile influence physiologically relevant flow patterns in computational hemodynamic models of left anterior descending coronary artery?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To summarize information about possible effects of covid-19 on intrauterine fetal death and present three cases of intrauterine fetal death in women with recent covid-19 infection.

Registry data show that patients with cirrhosis may be at high risk. However, outcome comparisons among patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 versus patients with COVID-19 alone and cirrhosis alone are lacking. The aim of this study was to perform these comparisons. DESIGN: A multicentre study of inpatients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 compared with age/gender-matched patients with COVID-19 alone and cirrhosis alone was performed. COVID-19 and cirrhosis characteristics, development of organ failures and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and mortality (inpatient death+hospice) were compared. RESULTS: 37 patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 were matched with 108 patients with COVID-19 and 127 patients with cirrhosis from seven sites. Race/ethnicity were similar. Patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 had higher mortality compared with patients with COVID-19 (30% vs 13%, p=0.03) but not between patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 and patients with cirrhosis (30% vs 20%, p=0.16). Patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 versus patients with COVID-19 alone had equivalent respiratory symptoms, chest findings and rates of intensive care unit transfer and ventilation. However, patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 had worse Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI 6.53.1 vs 3.32.5, p<0.001), lower presenting GI symptoms and higher lactate. Patients with cirrhosis alone had higher cirrhosis-related complications, maximum model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and lower BiPAP/ventilation requirement compared with patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19, but CCI and ACLF rates were similar.

We previously demonstrated that the endothelial surface glycocalyx has a critical role in maintenance of vascular integrity. Here we hypothesised that serum factors of severe COVID-19 patients affect the glycocalyx and result into endothelial dysfunction. We included blood samples of 32 COVID-19 hospitalised patients at the Leiden University Medical Center: of which 26 from intensive care unit (ICU), 6 non-ICU, 18 convalescent samples 6 weeks after hospital discharge, and of 12 age-matched healthy donors (control) during the first period of the outbreak. First, we determined endothelial (angiopoietin 2, ANG2) and glycocalyx degradation (soluble thrombomodulin, sTM and syndecan-1, sSDC1) markers in plasma. In plasma of COVID-19 patients, circulating ANG2 and sTM were elevated in patients on the ICU. Primary lung microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) and human glomerular microvascular ECs (GEnCs) cultures in the presence of these sera led to EC glycocalyx degradation, barrier disruption, inflammation and increased coagulation on the endothelial surface, significantly different compared to healthy control and non-ICU patient sera. These changes all could be restored in the presence of fucoidan. In conclusion, our data highlight the link between endothelial glycocalyx degradation, barrier failure and induction of a procoagulant surface in COVID-19 patients on ICU which could be targeted earlier in disease by the presence of heparan sulfate (HS) mimetics.","output":"Heparan sulfate mimetic fucoidan restores the endothelial glycocalyx and protects against dysfunction induced by serum of COVID-19 patients on ICU"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El nuevo coronavirus del si?ndrome respiratorio agudo severo (SARS-CoV-2), es la causa de una enfermedad de ra?pida propagacio?n.

Though the SARS-CoV-2 mediated disease COVID-19 has first been characterized by an infection of the upper airways and the lung, recent evidence suggests a complex disease including gastrointestinal symptoms. Even if a direct viral tropism of intestinal cells has recently been demonstrated, it remains unclear, whether gastrointestinal symptoms are caused by direct infection of the gastrointestinal tract by SARS-CoV-2 or whether they are a consequence of a systemic immune activation and subsequent modulation of the mucosal immune system. To better understand the cause of intestinal symptoms we analyzed biopsies of the small intestine from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Applying qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA and nucleocapsid protein in duodenal mucosa. In addition, applying imaging mass cytometry and immunohistochemistry, we identified histomorphological changes of the epithelium, which were characterized by an accumulation of activated intraepithelial CD8(+) T cells as well as epithelial apoptosis and subsequent regenerative proliferation in the small intestine of COVID-19 patients. In summary, our findings indicate that intraepithelial CD8(+) T cells are activated upon infection of intestinal epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2, providing one possible explanation for gastrointestinal symptoms associated with COVID-19.","output":"Human small intestinal infection by SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a mucosal infiltration with activated CD8(+) T cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global health organizations recommend the use of cloth face coverings to slow the spread of COVID-19.

These measures aim to limit the COVID-19 infection rate and reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19. Given we are likely to see local lockdowns until a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is available, and their effectiveness depends on public acceptability, it is important to understand public preference for government responses. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE), this study will investigate the public's preferences for pandemic responses in the UK. Attributes (and levels) are based on: (1) lockdown measures described in policy documents; (2) literature on preferences for lockdown measures and (3) a social media analysis. Attributes include: lockdown type; lockdown length; postponement of usual non-urgent medical care; number of excess deaths; number of infections; impact on household spending and job losses. We will prepilot the DCE using virtual think aloud interviews with respondents recruited via Facebook. We will collect preference data using an online survey of 4000 individuals from across the four UK countries (1000 per country). We will estimate the relative importance of the attributes, and the trade-offs individuals are willing to make between attributes. We will test if respondents' preferences differ based on moral attitudes (using the Moral Foundation Questionnaire), socioeconomic circumstances (age, education, economic insecurity, health status), country of residence and experience of COVID-19. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The University of Aberdeen's College Ethics Research Board (CERB) has approved the study (reference: CERB/2020/6/1974). We will seek CERB approval for major changes from the developmental and pilot work. Peer-reviewed papers will be submitted, and results will be presented at public health and health economic conferences nationally and internationally.

The world governments have adopted restrictive measures to reduce the spread of infection. These measures could affect the sexual function and quality of life of women living with their partner. AIM: The aim is to assess the impact of the social distancing measures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual function and quality of life of noninfected reproductive-age women, living with their sexual partner. METHODS: Observational analysis on sexually active women, living with their partner, and without COVID-19 infection was performed. The population previously answered FSFI, FSDS, and SF-36 questionnaires. 4 weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures, these women were invited to complete the same questionnaires by e-mail for an evaluation during the COVID-19 outbreak. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint was the assessment of the women's sex function change during the social restriction period, by analyzing the FSFI and FSDS questionnaires. The secondary endpoint was the evaluation of the impact on the quality of life calculated by the SF-36 questionnaire. RESULTS: 89 patients were considered. The median age was 39 (28-50) years. Mean sexual intercourses/month decreased from 6.3  1.9 to 2.3  1.8, mean difference: -3.9  1.2. FSFI decreased significantly (29.2  4.2 vs 19.2  3.3, mean difference: -9.7  2.6) and FSDS increased significantly (9.3  5.5 vs 20.1  5.2, mean difference: 10.8  3.4). The SF-36 showed a significant change from 82.2  10.2 to 64.2  11.8 4 weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures; mean difference: -17.8  6.7. The univariable analysis identified working outside the home, university educational level, and parity &#8805;1 as predictive factors of lower FSFI. In multivariable analysis, working outside the home and combination of working outside the home + university educational level + parity &#8805;1 were the independent factors of a lower FSFI. CLINICAL IMPLICATION: The negative impact of the COVID-19 epidemic period on sexual function and quality of life in women shows how acute stress might affect the psychological state. Thus, psychological or sexual support could be useful. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: To our knowledge, this study is the first that analyzes the change in sexual activity in women during the COVID-19 outbreak period. The limitations were the low number of the analyzed participants, psychological tests were not included, and no data were collected on masturbation, self-heroism, solitary, and nonpenetrative sex. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 epidemic and the restrictive social distancing measures have negatively influenced the sexual function and quality of life in not-infected reproductive-age women who live with their sexual partners.

The Deeper, Wider, Faster (DWF) program is a survey focused on the identification of fast evolving transients, such as fast radio bursts, gamma-ray bursts, and supernova shock breakouts. It employs a multi-frequency simultaneous coverage of the same part of the sky over several orders of magnitude.

However, like hardness, yield strength, fatigue life, and other material properties, wear data exhibit varying degrees of repeatability and reproducibility (R/R). Repeatability concerns the replication of experiments within the same laboratory using the same equipment and materials. Reproducibility concerns testing on different equipment, usually at a different location, but using the same lot of specimens and procedures. An important question is: How many replicate measurements are needed to validate trends in wear behavior or to relatively rank materials, surface treatments, or lubricants? Without repeatability information, it is virtually impossible to establish whether reported material rankings or the effects of variables are real or fall within normal data scatter. The purpose of this paper is to characterize and analyze the R/R of wear data that result from a variety of sources, including material homogeneity, choice of units of measure, and choice of experimental variables. Case studies compare R/R for different forms of wear and their test methods, including ASTM standards. Lessons learned are presented for five forms of wear: (1) cavitation erosion, (2) three-body abrasion, (3) solid particle erosion, (4) dry sliding wear, and (5) fuel lubricity using the ball-on-cylinder (BOCLE) test. Wear transitions can also affect R/R. These examples provide insights for validating wear models, deciding how many repeated tests to make, and when ranking wear-resistance.","output":"Lessons learned from the test-to-test variability of different types of wear data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Multiple long-term care (LTC) reports have issued similar recommendations for improvement across Canadian LTC homes. Our primary objective was to identify the most common recommendations made over the past 10 years. Our secondary objective was to estimate the total cost of studying LTC issues repeatedly from 1998 to 2020. Methods: The qualitative and cost analyses were conducted in Canada from July to October 2020. Using a list of reports, inquiries and commissions from The Royal Society of Canada Working Group on Long-Term Care, we coded recurrent recommendations in LTC reports. We contacted the sponsoring organizations for a cost estimate, including direct and indirect costs. All costs were adjusted to 2020 Canadian dollar values. Results: Of the 80 Canadian LTC reports spanning the years of 1998 to 2020, 24 (30%) were based on a national level and 56 (70%) were focused on provinces or municipalities. Report length ranged from 4 to 1491 pages and the median number of contributors was 14 (interquartile range, IQR, 5-26) per report. The most common recommendation was to increase funding to LTC to improve staffing, direct care and capacity (67% of reports). A median of 8 (IQR 3.25-18) recommendations were made per report. The total cost for all 80 reports was estimated to be $23,626,442.78. Conclusions: Problems in Canadian LTC homes and their solutions have been known for decades.

METHODS: We performed systematic searches through electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify potential articles reporting adjusted effect estimates on the association of stroke with COVID-19-related mortality. To estimate pooled effects, the random-effects model was applied. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed to explore the possible sources of heterogeneity. The stability of the results was assessed by sensitivity analysis. Publication bias was evaluated by Beggs test and Eggers test. RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 47 studies involving 7,267,055 patients. The stroke was associated with higher COVID-19 mortality (pooled effect = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16C1.44; I(2) = 89%, P < 0.01; random-effects model). Subgroup analyses yielded consistent results among area, age, proportion of males, setting, cases, effect type, and proportion of severe COVID-19 cases. Statistical heterogeneity might result from the different effect type according to the meta-regression (P = 0.0105). Sensitivity analysis suggested that our results were stable and robust.

The perceived personal risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 after the vaccination was significantly higher among males, in those having a higher perceived personal risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 before the vaccination, and in those who were more concerned about the efficacy of the vaccination. The fear of getting the disease as reason to have the COVID-19 vaccination was reported more frequently in younger participants, in those with at least one chronic medical condition, in those with a higher concern about the severity of COVID-19, in those with a higher level of trust in the information received, and in those who acquired information from scientific journals. Overall, 21.3% were willing to engage the three main public health measures (wearing a mask, careful hand washing, physical distancing) after receiving the second dose of the vaccination compared to the behavior before the pandemic began.

OBJECTIVES/GOALS: The COVID-19 pandemic prevented domestic and international undergraduate students from attending in-person Mayo Clinic Summer Undergraduate Research Programs. Mayo decided to redesign this program as a virtual, 4-week Summer Foundations in Research (SFIR) program. The goal of this program was to give students a scientific research experience. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The SFIR included an Introduction to Experimental Design, Dialogue methodology for communicating science, scientific mentoring, asynchronous online modules and a Resiliency component. Evaluations of the program were undertaken to gather feedback for program improvement and to assess the educational and mental health impact on participants. These evaluations asked student to rate each section of the program. Additionally, students were encouraged to provide their own comments and feedback. Statistical analysis of quantitative data was performed using excel. The qualitative data was studied using the identification, analysis and interpretation of patterns method per the students comments on each of the questions addressed in the survey. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: These evaluations revealed positive outcomes across program components: 66% of the participants found the Resiliency component extremely worthwhile, 80% of participants liked the experimental design and 70% liked the educational courses. Qualitative data showed that mentor/mentee interactions were highly valued, and both participants and faculty suggested increasing the amount of time devoted to these interactions. Small group discussions gave students the opportunity to get to know other peers and encouraged further discussions about science and the community. Participants suggested minor improvements to the program, such as re-creating the online modules specific for undergraduate students, increasing 1-to-1 and small groups discussion, and increasing the length of the program.

Quantitative data were processed in descriptive statistics, and a thematic analysis was performed to analyze the qualitative data. Results: The highest stigma score of 118 respondents was 37, and the lowest score was zero. The stigma score had a mean of 12.28 (SD  7.9). The higher the score obtained leads to a higher level of stigma received. From a total of 11 participants interviewed, four main themes emerged: rejection, feeling down and afraid, sources of support, and professional vigilance. Conclusion: The social stigma experienced by nurses comes from colleagues and society and impacts psychological distress. Support from families and colleagues strengthens nurses in facing social stigma. Nevertheless, nurses uphold the values to remain grateful and carry out professional responsibilities in taking care of patients. Nurses should be provided with psychological support and be prepared for disasters to provide excellent health services and reduce adverse mental health.

This is why increasingly in developed countries the first trimester anomaly scan is being offered as part of standard care. We have developed a Virtual Reality (VR) approach to improve the diagnostic abilities of 2D ultrasound. Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound datasets are used in VR assessment, enabling real depth perception and unique interaction. The aim of this study is to investigate whether first trimester 3D VR ultrasound is of additional value in terms of diagnostic accuracy for the detection of fetal anomalies. Health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness and also the perspective of both patient and ultrasonographer on the 3D VR modality will be studied. METHODS: Women in the first trimester of a high risk pregnancy for a fetus with a congenital anomaly are eligible for inclusion. This is a randomized controlled trial with two intervention arms. The control group receives 'care as usual': a second trimester 2D advanced ultrasound examination. The intervention group will undergo an additional first trimester 2D and 3D VR ultrasound examination. Following each examination participants will fill in validated questionnaires evaluating their quality of life and healthcare related expenses. Participants' and ultrasonographers' perspectives on the 3D VR ultrasound will be surveyed. The primary outcome will be the detection of fetal anomalies. The additional first trimester 3D VR ultrasound examination will be compared to 'care as usual'. Neonatal or histopathological examinations are considered the gold standard for the detection of congenital anomalies. To reach statistical significance and 80% power with a detection rate of 65% for second trimester ultrasound examination and 70% for the combined detection of first trimester 3D VR and second trimester ultrasound examination, a sample size of 2800 participants is needed. DISCUSSION: First trimester 3D VR detection of fetal anomalies may improve patients' quality of life through reassurance or earlier identification of malformations. Results of this study will provide policymakers and healthcare professionals with the highest level of evidence for cost-effectiveness of first trimester ultrasound using a 3D VR approach.

Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) is a new treatment in which the rectum is dissected transanally according to TME principles. The short-term results and oncological follow-up of the first 80 patients were described. METHODS Between June 2012 and September 2014, all patients in the Gelderse Vallei Hospital and the VU University Medical Center with histologically proven distal or mid-rectal carcinomas without evidence of distant metastases underwent TaTME. Patients with T4 tumors were excluded. Transanal mobilization was performed with the aid of a single port and endoscopic instruments according to TME criteria. RESULTS Eighty patients were operated in a period of 2 years. Laparotomy was recommended and performed in four patients. Postoperative morbidity was 39%. Ten (12%) complications were graded as severe (Clavien-Dindo grade 3, 4 and 5) and needed re-intervention. Median operative time was 204 min (range 91-447). Median hospital stay was 8 days (range 3-41). Specimens were graded as complete in 88% of the patients, nearly complete in 9% and incomplete in 3%. A positive circumferential resection margin (<2 mm) was observed in two patients. During the two and half years study period, a local recurrence was observed in two patients. CONCLUSION TaTME is a safe alternative to standard laparoscopic TME in selected low-risk patients with rectal carcinoma when treated by an experienced colorectal team. In the future, randomized trials are necessary to prove its oncological safety.","output":"Transanal total mesorectal excision for rectal carcinoma: short-term outcomes and experience after 80 cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a global crisis and has crippled the entire humankind throughout the globe More than 200 countries in the globe are under the clutch of this pandemic Apart from creating medical and public health problems, it has created a plethora of social problems in the globe As a new disease, inadequate and inaccurate information has created havoc in the global community This in turn has created social stigma and discrimination across the globe irrespective of social strata, geographical distribution, level of education, and economic status The stigma and discrimination has vehemently affected the efforts to fight against COVID-19 such as containment measures, health-care provision, prevention, and control measures This disease has peculiarly created stigma and discrimination among both the recipients and providers of health-care services The stigma and discrimination continue to prevail in societies for both these categories It is imperative that society should understand the significance of this disease and the role of stigma and discrimination mitigation to win the war against COVID-19 ? 2020 Archives of Mental Health ;Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow","output":"Let's fight against the ailment not the ailing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: An outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), comprising 185 cases linked to healthcare facilities, occurred in the Republic of Korea from May to July 2015. Owing to the nosocomial nature of the outbreak, it is particularly important to gain a better understanding of the epidemiological determinants characterizing the risk of MERS death in order to predict the heterogeneous risk of death in medical settings. METHODS: We have devised a novel statistical model that identifies the risk of MERS death during the outbreak in real time. While accounting for the time delay from illness onset to death, risk factors for death were identified using a linear predictor tied to a logit model. We employ this approach to (1) quantify the risks of death and (2) characterize the temporal evolution of the case fatality ratio (CFR) as case ascertainment greatly improved during the course of the outbreak. RESULTS: Senior persons aged 60 years or over were found to be 9.3 times (95 % confidence interval (CI), 5.3C16.9) more likely to die compared to younger MERS cases. Patients under treatment were at a 7.8-fold (95 % CI, 4.0C16.7) significantly higher risk of death compared to other MERS cases. The CFR among patients aged 60 years or older under treatment was estimated at 48.2 % (95 % CI, 35.2C61.3) as of July 31, 2015, while the CFR among other cases was estimated to lie below 15 %. From June 6, 2015, onwards, the CFR declined 0.3-fold (95 % CI, 0.1C1.1) compared to the earlier epidemic period, which may perhaps reflect enhanced case ascertainment following major contact tracing efforts. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of MERS death was significantly associated with older age as well as treatment for underlying diseases after explicitly adjusting for the delay between illness onset and death. Because MERS outbreaks are greatly amplified in the healthcare setting, enhanced infection control practices in medical facilities should strive to shield risk groups from MERS exposure.","output":"Real-time characterization of risks of death associated with the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Republic of Korea, 2015"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Essential workers are at increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We did a prospective study to estimate the yield, acceptability, and costs of workplace-based systematic SARS-CoV-2 testing of asymptomatic essential workers. METHODS: We recruited non-healthcare essential businesses, in Montreal, Canada. Mobile teams, composed of two non-healthcare professionals each, visited businesses. Consenting, asymptomatic employees provided saline gargle specimens under supervision. Mobile team members self-sampled weekly. Specimens were analyzed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). If an outbreak was detected ([]2 positives), we retested all initially negative participants. We did logistic regression for factors associated with a positive test. We estimated costs ($CAD) of this strategy. RESULTS: From 27 January to 12 March 2021, 69 essential businesses were visited. Of an estimated 2348 employees onsite, 2128 (90.6%) participated. Across 2626 tests, 53 (2.0%) were positive. Self-reported non-Caucasian ethnicity (aOR 3.7, 95% CI: 1.4-9.9) and a negative SARS-CoV-2 test before the study (0.4, 0.2-0.8) were positively and negatively associated with a positive test, respectively. Five businesses--3 manufacturing/supplier and 2 meat processing--were experiencing an outbreak. At these businesses, 40 (4.4%) of 917 participants were positive on the initial test. We repeated testing at three of these businesses over 2-3 weeks: 8/350 (2.3%) were positive on the second test, and zero were positive on the third and fourth test (148 tests); no employer reported new positives to 26 March 2021. In all other businesses, 1211 participants were tested once--5 (0.4%) were positive at three childcare enterprises, one grocery store, and one manufacturing/supplier. Per person, RT-PCR costs were $34.00 and all other costs $8.67. No mobile team member tested positive. INTERPRETATION: Onsite sampling of essential workers with saline gargle is safe, acceptable, and inexpensive. Repeat testing appeared to eliminate outbreaks.

This article explores Norwegian teachers ideologies of English in society and English in school to consider locally relevant 21st century English language teaching (ELT). Language ideologies construct certain social realities that shape teachers understanding of English and contextually meaningful ELT. Data was generated through extensive interviews with 12 teachers in basic education in Norway. Data were inductively analyzed using methods from grounded theory and resulted in a conceptual framework of teacher ideologies. Findings reveal English as a natural, supranational language in modern Norwegian society, but also as personal and threatening. English in school, on the other hand, is foreign, communicative, historic and cultural, humanistic, for learning interdisciplinary content, and in flux. The final category explores self-reflexive questions teachers raise about ownership and identity, diversity, digitalization, and global orientation. In considering new directions, findings suggest the need for a metalanguage for English in non-native contexts that better encompasses experiences in an increasingly diverse and interconnected world.

Prior to the introduction of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), lung resection for cancer was undertaken through an open thoracotomy. To date, the evidence base supporting the different surgical approaches is based on non-randomised studies, small randomised trials and is focused mainly on short-term in-hospital outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The VIdeo assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy versus conventional Open LobEcTomy for lung cancer study is a UK multicentre parallel group randomised controlled trial (RCT) with blinding of outcome assessors and participants (to hospital discharge) comparing the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of VATS lobectomy versus open lobectomy for treatment of lung cancer. We will test the hypothesis that VATS lobectomy is superior to open lobectomy with respect to self-reported physical function 5 weeks after randomisation (approximately 1 month after surgery). Secondary outcomes include assessment of efficacy (hospital stay, pain, proportion and time to uptake of chemotherapy), measures of safety (adverse health events), oncological outcomes (proportion of patients upstaged to pathologic N2 (pN2) disease and disease-free survival), overall survival and health related quality of life to 1 year. The QuinteT Recruitment Intervention is integrated into the trial to optimise recruitment. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This trial has been approved by the UK (Dulwich) National Research Ethics Service Committee London. Findings will be written-up as methodology papers for conference presentation, and publication in peer-reviewed journals. Many aspects of the feasibility work will inform surgical RCTs in general and these will be reported at methodology meetings. We will also link with lung cancer clinical studies groups.

In humans, the distal branches of the airway interweave with the alveolar gas-exchange niche, forming an anatomical structure known as the respiratory bronchioles. Owing to the lack of a counterpart in mouse, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern respiratory bronchioles in the human lung remain uncharacterized. Here we show that human respiratory bronchioles contain a unique secretory cell population that is distinct from cells in larger proximal airways. Organoid modelling reveals that these respiratory airway secretory (RAS) cells act as unidirectional progenitors for alveolar type 2 cells, which are essential for maintaining and regenerating the alveolar niche. RAS cell lineage differentiation into alveolar type 2 cells is regulated by Notch and Wnt signalling. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, RAS cells are altered transcriptionally, corresponding to abnormal alveolar type 2 cell states, which are associated with smoking exposure in both humans and ferrets. These data identify a distinct progenitor in a region of the human lung that is not found in mouse that has a critical role in maintaining the gas-exchange compartment and is altered in chronic lung disease.","output":"Human distal airways contain a multipotent secretory cell that can regenerate alveoli"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

We have run a multiple linear regressions model with interactions to explain geographical variability in seroprevalence, hospitalization (on voivodeship: NUTS-2 level) and current (beginning of the 4th wave: 15.09-21.11.2021) case notifications/crude mortality (on poviats: old NUTS-4 level) taking vaccination coverage and cumulative case notifications till so called 3rd wave as predictor variables and supply/demand (HCA) as moderating variables. Results. HCA with interacting terms (mainly demand) explained to the great extent the variance of current incidence and most variance in case of current mortality. HCA (mainly supply) is significantly moderating cumulative case notifications till the 3rd wave explaining the variance across seroprevalence. Conclusions. Seeking causal relations between vaccination or infection gained immunity level and current infection dynamics could be misleading without understanding socio-epidemiological context such as the moderating role of HCA (sensu lato).

In this work, we explore the value of soft-intelligence, leveraged using AI, as an evidence source to support public health research. As a case study, we deployed a natural language processing (NLP) platform to rapidly identify and analyse key barriers to vaccine uptake from a collection of geo-located tweets from London, UK. We developed a search strategy to capture COVID-19 vaccine related tweets, identifying 91,473 tweets between 30 November 2020 and 15 August 2021.

From the spatial spillover effects of AGTP, the level of agricultural economic development, real GDP per capita, and urbanization have significantly promoted AGTP in the local and neighboring areas, while the agricultural internal structure and the level of labor inhibit AGTP in the local and neighboring areas. In addition, the administrative environmental policy (ENVP) and the economic environmental policy (ECOP) have negative impacts in neighboring areas, while the policy has negative spillover effects and positive spillover effects in the local area, respectively. Therefore, we should adhere to the concept of green development, pay attention to the regional exchange of green technology, concentrate policies on low-low concentration areas, and increase the follow-up tracking and supervision mechanism of the policy design and implementation process.

This chemically undefined material known as lipofuscin, ceroid, or age pigment is mainly formed through unregulated and nonspecific oxidative modifications of cellular macromolecules that are induced by highly reactive free radicals. A necessary precondition for reactive free radical generation and lipofuscin formation is the intracellular availability of ferrous iron (Fe(2+)) (labile iron), catalyzing the conversion of weak oxidants such as peroxides, to extremely reactive ones like hydroxyl (HO(?)) or alcoxyl (RO(?)) radicals. If the oxidized materials remain unrepaired for extended periods of time, they can be further oxidized to generate ultimate over-oxidized products that are unable to be repaired, degraded, or exocytosed by the relevant cellular systems. Additionally, over-oxidized materials might inactivate cellular protection and repair mechanisms, thus allowing for futile cycles of increasingly rapid lipofuscin accumulation. In this review paper, we present evidence that the modulation of the labile iron pool distribution by nutritional or pharmacological means represents a hitherto unappreciated target for hampering lipofuscin accumulation and cellular ageing.","output":"Implication of Dietary Iron-Chelating Bioactive Compounds in Molecular Mechanisms of Oxidative Stress-Induced Cell Ageing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has played havoc at various levels throughout the world but has especially impacted the Health care professionals and put them at risk of mental ill health.

Since then it caused several outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever in humans with case fatality rates up to 90% and remains a serious Public Health concern and biothreat pathogen. The most pathogenic and best-studied species is Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV). EBOV encodes one viral surface glycoprotein (GP), which is essential for replication, a determinant of pathogenicity and an important immunogen. GP mediates viral entry through interaction with cellular surface molecules, which results in the uptake of virus particles via macropinocytosis. Later in this pathway endosomal acidification activates the cysteine proteases Cathepsin B and L (CatB, CatL), which have been shown to cleave ZEBOV-GP leading to subsequent exposure of the putative receptor-binding and fusion domain and productive infection. We studied the effect of CatB and CatL on in vitro and in vivo replication of EBOV. Similar to previous findings, our results show an effect of CatB, but not CatL, on ZEBOV entry into cultured cells. Interestingly, cell entry by other EBOV species (Bundibugyo, C?te d'Ivoire, Reston and Sudan ebolavirus) was independent of CatB or CatL as was EBOV replication in general. To investigate whether CatB and CatL have a role in vivo during infection, we utilized the mouse model for ZEBOV. Wild-type (control), catB(?/?) and catL(?/?) mice were equally susceptible to lethal challenge with mouse-adapted ZEBOV with no difference in virus replication and time to death. In conclusion, our results show that CatB and CatL activity is not required for EBOV replication. Furthermore, EBOV glycoprotein cleavage seems to be mediated by an array of proteases making targeted therapeutic approaches difficult.","output":"Cathepsin B & L Are Not Required for Ebola Virus Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The surge of SARS-CoV-2 has created a wave of pandemic around the globe due to its high transmission rate. To contain this virus, researchers are working around the clock for a solution in the form of vaccine. Due to the impact of this pandemic, the economy and healthcare have immensely suffered around the globe. Thus, an efficient vaccine design is the need of the hour. Moreover, to have a generalised vaccine for heterogeneous human population, the virus genomes from different countries should be considered. Thus, in this work, we have performed genome-wide analysis of 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries around the globe in order to identify the potential conserved regions for the development of peptide based synthetic vaccine viz. epitopes with high immunogenic and antigenic scores. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment technique viz. Clustal Omega is used to align the 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes. Thereafter, entropy is computed for each genomic coordinate of the aligned genomes. The entropy values are then used to find the conserved regions. These conserved regions are refined based on the criteria that their lengths should be greater than or equal to 60 nt and their corresponding protein sequences are without any stop codons. Furthermore, Nucleotide BLAST is used to verify the specificity of the conserved regions. As a result, we have obtained 17 conserved regions that belong to NSP3, NSP4, NSP6, NSP8, RdRp, Helicase, endoRNAse, 2'-O-RMT, Spike glycoprotein, ORF3a protein, Membrane glycoprotein and Nucleocapsid protein. Finally, these conserved regions are used to identify the T-cell and B-cell epitopes with their corresponding immunogenic and antigenic scores. Based on these scores, the most immunogenic and antigenic epitopes are then selected for each of these 17 conserved regions. Hence, we have obtained 30 MHC-I and 24 MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes with 14 and 13 unique HLA alleles and 21 B-cell epitopes for the 17 conserved regions. Moreover, for validating the relevance of these epitopes, the binding conformation of the MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes are shown with respect to HLA alleles. Also, the physico-chemical properties of the epitopes are reported along with Ramchandran plots and Z-Scores and the population coverage is shown as well. Overall, the analysis shows that the identified epitopes can be considered as potential candidates for vaccine design.","output":"Immunogenicity and antigenicity based T-cell and B-cell epitopes identification from conserved regions of 10664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is increasingly clear that academic high-throughput screening (HTS) and virtual HTS triage suffers from a lack of scientists trained in the art and science of early drug discovery chemistry. Many recent publications report the discovery of compounds by screening that are most likely artifacts or promiscuous bioactive compounds, and these results are not placed into the context of previous studies. For HTS to be most successful, it is our contention that there must exist an early partnership between biologists and medicinal chemists. Their combined skill sets are necessary to design robust assays and efficient workflows that will weed out assay artifacts, false positives, promiscuous bioactive compounds and intractable screening hits, efforts that ultimately give projects a better chance at identifying truly useful chemical matter. Expertise in medicinal chemistry, cheminformatics and purification sciences (analytical chemistry) can enhance the post-HTS triage process by quickly removing these problematic chemotypes from consideration, while simultaneously prioritizing the more promising chemical matter for follow-up testing.

Methods: A systematic review of four databases from December 01, 2019 to June 01, 2020 identified all studies assessing potential associations between clinical characteristics and investigations, and illness severity. Data for all variables that were statistically analysed in relation to COVID-19 disease severity were extracted. A meta-analysis was conducted to generate pooled estimates of odds ratios (pORs). This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020178098). Findings: Of 8402 relevant articles, 79 were eligible for inclusion, analysing 27713 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. A total of 202 features were analysed in relation to COVID-19 severity. Of these, 81 were deemed feasible for assessment in LRS: appropriate data were available for meta-analysis of 44 (543%).

Attenuation typically relies on de-optimisation of codon pairs and maximization of CpG dinucleotide frequencies. So as to formulate evolutionarily-informed attenuation strategies that aim to force nucleotide usage against the direction favoured by selection, here we examine available whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to infer patterns of mutation and selection on synonymous sites. Analysis of mutational profiles indicates a strong mutation bias towards U. In turn, analysis of observed synonymous site composition implicates selection against U. Accounting for dinucleotide effects reinforces this conclusion, observed UU content being a quarter of that expected under neutrality. Possible mechanisms of selection against U mutations includes selection for higher expression, for high mRNA stability or lower immunogenicity of viral genes. Consistent with gene-specific selection against CpG dinucleotides, we observe systematic differences of CpG content between SARS-CoV-2 genes. We propose an evolutionarily-informed approach to attenuation that, unusually, seeks to increase usage of the already most common synonymous codons. Comparable analysis of H1N1 and Ebola finds that GC3 deviated from neutral equilibrium is not a universal feature, cautioning against generalization of results.","output":"Evidence for strong mutation bias towards, and selection against, U content in SARS-CoV-2: implications for vaccine design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a rare case of bilateral central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) after COVID-19 management with steroids.

Cardiogenic shock and arrhythmias such as acute coronary syndrome and myocarditis have been documented in the scientific literature. Heart arrhythmias in COVID-19-infected patients have been the subject of several recent articles in the scientific literature. It was also shown to be linked to an increased mortality risk. Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation have all been recorded in the literature so far. Unexpectedly, a study found that 7 % of patients who didn't require intensive care unit treatment experienced arrhythmias, but 44 % of patients who required to be hospitalized in ICU. Repletion of electrolytes, withdrawal of drugs that cause arrhythmia, volume status management, or suppression of catecholamine surges in COVID-19 are some of the treatment options for arrhythmias. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the potential mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias especially of supraventricular tachycardia in COVID-19. Methods: The databases were searched for articles published in English in 4 data bases. PubMed, Google scholar, science direct and Boolean operators (AND OR NOT) had been used such as cardiac arrhythmia mechanisms, Covid-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 and in peer-reviewed articles between March 2005 and October 2021.

Each caregiver plays a critical role in the society, supporting the health and well-being of those who are ill, disabled, or older and who need frequent support. Digital technologies are becoming a ubiquitous part of everyday life for many, but little is known about the real-world impact of technology for those in a caring role, including the abilities of technologies to address the mental and physical impacts of caregiving. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the current and future technology use of caregivers, including digital technologies used to care for themselves and the person they look after. METHODS: We codeveloped a wide range of questions with caregivers and care professionals and delivered this survey both on the web and in paper format (eg, using social networks such as Twitter alongside in-person events). Questions were focused on providing care and looking after caregiver health and well-being. Analyses focused on both quantitative outcomes (frequency counts and Likert questions) and explored free text entries (thematic analysis). RESULTS: From 356 respondents, we identified that caregivers were receptive to, and largely positive about current and future use of technology both for their own care and their caring role (eg, checking in from distance). There were notable concerns, including the risk that technology could replace human contact. We identified several key areas for future work, including communication with health and social care professionals, and the potential for technology to help caregivers with their own health. We also identified several stakeholders (eg, care workers, pharmacy staff, and general practitioners) who could act as suitable points for technology signposting and support. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers are a transient, often difficult to reach population, and this work has collated a large body of knowledge across a diverse group of individuals. Many caregivers, like the rest of society, are realizing the benefits of using everyday technology to help deliver care. It is clear that there is already a high level of dependency on technologies, where future expectations will grow. However, many barriers to digital technology use remain, including a lack of ongoing technology support. Preventive measures linked to technology that can help look after a caregivers own health appear acceptable, particularly for communicative tools. This collated caregiver knowledge is a call for all stakeholdersacademics, policy makers, and practitionersto take note of these specific challenges, and to ensure that caregiver voices are both heard and fully integrated within the emerging digital health agenda.","output":"Understanding Current Needs and Future Expectations of Informal Caregivers for Technology to Support Health and Well-being: National Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report describes two teachers challenges and coping strategies while teaching online following the suspension of face-to-face classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic Findings shed light on proactive and passive agency This study also provides an understanding of teachers tea or tears in online teaching","output":"Tea or tears: online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic: JET"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monitoring older adults with wearable sensors and IoT devices requires collecting data from various sources and proliferates the number of data that should be collected in the monitoring center.

In particular, many of the RNA viruses, including among others the Dengue and Zika, are widespread pathogens of significant importance to human health. The ability to design and synthesize such viruses may contribute to exploring novel approaches for developing vaccines and virus based therapies. RESULTS: Here we develop a full multidisciplinary pipeline for generation and analysis of synthetic RNA viruses and specifically apply it to Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). The major steps of the pipeline include comparative genomics of endogenous and synthetic viral strains. Specifically, we show that although the synthetic DENV-2 viruses were found to have lower nucleotide variability, their phenotype, as reflected in the study of the AG129 mouse model morbidity, RNA levels, and neutralization antibodies, is similar or even more pathogenic in comparison to the wildtype master strain. Additionally, the highly variable positions, identified in the analyzed DENV-2 population, were found to overlap with less conserved homologous positions in Zika virus and other Dengue serotypes. These results may suggest that synthetic DENV-2 could enhance virulence if the correct sequence is selected.

While the 3D structure of mutated proteins has been studied with atomic resolution, the precise impact of somatic mutations on the 3D proteome during malignant transformation remains unknown because methods to reveal in vivo protein structures in high throughput are limited. Here, we measured the accessibility of the lysine ?-amine for chemical modification across proteomes using covalent protein painting (CPP) to indirectly determine alterations in the 3D proteome. CPP is a novel, high-throughput quantitative mass spectrometric method that surveyed a total of 8052 lysine sites across the 60 cell lines of the well-studied anticancer cell line panel (NCI60). Overall, 5.2 structural alterations differentiated any cancer cell line from the other 59. Structural aberrations in 98 effector proteins correlated with the selected presence of 90 commonly mutated proteins in the NCI60 cell line panel, suggesting that different tumor genotypes reshape a limited set of effector proteins. We searched our dataset for druggable conformational aberrations and identified 49 changes in the cancer conformational landscape that correlated with the growth inhibition profiles of 300 drug candidates out of 50,000 small molecules. We found that alterations in heat shock proteins are key predictors of anticancer drug efficacy, which implies that the proteostasis network may have a general but hitherto unrecognized role in maintaining malignancy. Individual lysine sites may serve as biomarkers to guide drug selection or may be directly targeted for anticancer drug development.","output":"Cancer Conformational Landscape Shapes Tumorigenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) underscored the importance of influenza detection and response in China.

From 2004 to 2014, CNIC and USCDC collaborated on the following activities: 1) developing human technical expertise in virology and epidemiology in China; 2) developing a comprehensive influenza surveillance system by enhancing influenza-like illness (ILI) reporting and virological characterization; 3) strengthening analysis, utilization and dissemination of surveillance data; and 4) improving early response to influenza viruses with pandemic potential. Since 2004, CNIC expanded its national influenza surveillance and response system which, as of 2014, included 408 laboratories and 554 sentinel hospitals. With support from USCDC, more than 2500 public health staff from China received virology and epidemiology training, enabling > 98% network laboratories to establish virus isolation and/or nucleic acid detection techniques. CNIC established viral drug resistance surveillance and platforms for gene sequencing, reverse genetics, serologic detection, and vaccine strains development. CNIC also built a bioinformatics platform to strengthen data analysis and utilization, publishing weekly on-line influenza surveillance reports in English and Chinese. The surveillance system collects 200,000C400,000 specimens and tests more than 20,000 influenza viruses annually, which provides valuable information for World Health Organization (WHO) influenza vaccine strain recommendations. In 2010, CNIC became the sixth WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza.

The etiopathogenesis of PR is still unknown, but is frequently associated with episodes of upper respiratory tract infections. It is likely that a new viral trigger of pityriasis rosea is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). PATIENT CONCERNS: We present the case of a female patient in whom the diagnosis of pityriasis rosea led to the investigation and diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient presented to the Department of Dermatology for a 3aweek duration of an extremely pruritic erythematous-squamous lesion, initially on the trunk and upper limbs, with extension to the lower limbs in the last week and the lesion respected the cephalic extremity, palms, and soles. One week before the rash, respiratory tract infection symptomatology was observed by the patient. At home, she underwent systemic treatment with antihistamines and topical medication with dermatocorticosteroids. The evolution was unfavorable, with the spread of the lesions and the accentuation of the pruritus. DIAGNOSES: Considering the actual epidemiological context, we performed a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay from nasal and pharyngeal swabs for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to investigate the PR etiology. The patient had a positive RT-PCR result, and was confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment was initiated with systemic corticosteroid therapy - hydrocortisone hemisuccinate 200amg/day for 7adays, and loratadine 10amg 2 times a day. Also, topical medication with dermatocorticosteroids and emollients was associated. OUTCOME: Under the treatment that was initiated a partial remission of the lesions after 7adays was observed. LESSONS: Our reported case adds to the other findings regarding the association of PR with SARS-CoV-2 infection, in the context of the pandemic, suggesting the need to test patients with PR skin lesions for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Pityriasis rosea Gibert triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Even though severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been observed to principally affect the respiratory system, neurological involvements have already been reported in some published work We have reviewed original articles, case reports, and existing open-source data-sets to delineate the spectrum of neurological disorders potentially observed in SARS-CoV-2 positive cases Neurological involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) corresponds to three situations: (a) neurological manifestations of viral infection, (b) post-infective neurological complications, and (c) infection in patients with neurological co-morbidity Neurological manifestations can further be subdivided into the central nervous system (headache, dizziness, alteration of the sensorium, ataxia encephalitis, stroke, and seizures) and peripheral nervous system (skeletal muscle injury and peripheral nerve involvement including hyposmia and hypogeusia) symptomatology Post-infective neurological complications include demyelinating conditions Reduced mobility and dementia as co-morbidities may predispose a patient to have a viral infection It is concluded that the pandemic of COVID-19 presents for a neurologist some unique challenges We observe that SARS-CoV-2 may have various neurological manifestations and in many cases, neurological features may precede typical respiratory symptoms","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic: A Neurological Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last 9 months, the most prominent global health threat has been COVID-19.

We investigated the effects of three negative everyday health behavior changes during the pandemic (changes in health services access, perceived changes in health, and increased social isolation) as well as two positive everyday health behaviors (adherence to stay-at-home guidelines to reduce risk, and adaptive coping activities) on mental health and COVID-related distress. Examples of active coping strategies were stockpiling resources, spiritual practices, or outreach to others. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, and multiple regressions characterized the impact of COVID-19 on perceived mental health. Descriptive data included changes in health service access, changes in mental and physical health, reduced social engagement, increased adherence to guidelines, and increased adaptive coping activities. Significant predictors of mental health impact of the pandemic were changes in health service access ( = .18, p < .05), health changes ( = .25, p < .01), and adaptive coping activities ( = .21, p < .05).

Phone interview surveys were conducted by trained enumerators across 12 states and 200 districts in India from 3 to 15 May 2020. A total of 1437 farmers completed the survey (94% male; 28% 30C39 years old; 38% with secondary schooling). About one in ten farmers (11%) did not harvest in the past month with primary reasons cited being unfavorable weather (37%) and lockdown-related reasons (24%). A total of 63% of farmers harvested in the past month (primarily wheat and vegetables), but only 44% had sold their crop; 12% were still trying to sell their crop, and 39% had stored their crop, with more than half (55%) reporting lockdown-related issues as the reason for storing. Seventy-nine percent of households with wage-workers witnessed a decline in wages in the past month and 49% of households with incomes from livestock witnessed a decline. Landless farmers were about 10 times more likely to skip a meal as compared to large farmers (18% versus 2%), but a majority reported receiving extra food rations from the government. Nearly all farmers reported consuming staple grains daily in the past week (97%), 63% consumed dairy daily, 40% vegetables daily, 26% pulses daily, and 7% fruit daily. These values are much lower than reported previously for farmers in India around this time of year before COVID-19: 94C95% dairy daily, 57C58% pulses daily, 64C65% vegetables daily, and 42C43% fruit daily.

We aimed to examine whether the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with an increase in the incidence of Kawasaki disease. METHODS: We did a quasi-experimental interrupted time series analysis over the past 15 years in a tertiary paediatric centre in the Paris region, a French epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak. The main outcome was the number of Kawasaki disease cases over time, estimated by quasi-Poisson regression. In the same centre, we recorded the number of hospital admissions from the emergency department (2005-2020) and the results of nasopharyngeal multiplex PCR to identify respiratory pathogens (2017-2020). These data were compared with daily hospital admissions due to confirmed COVID-19 in the same region, recorded by Public Health France. FINDINGS: Between Dec 1, 2005, and May 20, 2020, we included 230 patients with Kawasaki disease. The median number of Kawasaki disease hospitalisations estimated by the quasi-Poisson model was 12 per month (IQR 11-13). In April, 2020, we identified a rapid increase of Kawasaki disease that was related to SARS-CoV-2 (six cases per month; 497% increase [95% CI 72-1082]; p=00011), starting 2 weeks after the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic. SARS-CoV-2 was the only virus circulating intensely during this period, and was found in eight (80%) of ten patients with Kawasaki disease since April 15 (SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR or serology). A second peak of hospital admissions due to Kawasaki disease was observed in December, 2009 (six cases per month; 365% increase ([31-719]; p=0.0053), concomitant with the influenza A H1N1 pandemic. INTERPRETATION: Our study further suggests that viral respiratory infections, including SAR-CoV-2, could be triggers for Kawasaki disease and indicates the potential timing of an increase in incidence of the disease in COVID-19 epidemics. Health-care providers should be prepared to manage an influx of patients with severe Kawasaki disease, particularly in countries where the peak of COVID-19 has recently been reached.

Overall, the use of rapamycin can help to control viral particle synthesis, cytokine storms and contributes to fight the disease by its anti-aging and anti-obesity effects. Since, rapamycin targets the host factors and not viral machinery, it represents a potent candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 than antiviral drugs as its efficacy is less likely to be dampened with high mutation rate of viral RNA. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on cell proliferation may aid in reducing viral replication.

METHODS We estimated the R0 of EV71 and of Cox A16 from laboratory-confirmed HFMD outbreaks reported to the Department of Health, from 2004 to 2009. We derived a mathematical model and calculated R? based on the cumulative number of cases at the initial growth phase of the outbreaks, as determined by the epidemic curves. We tested the association of R? with settings and sizes of the institution and total number of persons affected. RESULTS We analyzed 34 outbreaks, 27 caused by Cox A16 and 7 caused by EV71. Assuming the incubation period to be 5 days, the median R? of EV71 was 5.48 with an interquartile range of 4.20 to 6.51, whereas the median R? of Cox A16 was 2.50 with an interquartile range of 1.96 to 3.67. The R? of EV71 was significantly higher than that of CoxA16, P = 0.002; and sensitivity analysis showed the same results. The R? was not associated with outbreak settings, sizes of the institutions, or number of persons affected. CONCLUSIONS The R? for EV71 and for Cox A16 was determined using a model which showed that the R? for EV71 was higher than that of Cox A16.

Therefore, this survey was conducted to investigate the prevalence and related factors of depressive, anxiety, acute stress, and insomnia symptoms in medical staffs in Kashi, Xinjiang, China during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among medical staffs working in First People's Hospital of Kashi, Xinjiang. The questionnaire collected demographic data and self-design questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Impact of Events Scale-6, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7, the Perceived Social Support Scale, the Chinese Big Five Personality Inventory-15, and the Trait Coping Style Questionnaire were used to measure psychological symptoms or characteristics. Binary logistic regression was carried out to examine the associations between socio-demographic factors and symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia. In total, data from 123 participants were finally included, among which the prevalence rate of depressive, anxiety, acute stress, and insomnia symptoms is 60.2, 49.6, 43.1, and 41.1%, respectively. The regression model revealed that minority ethnicity, being worried about infection, spending more time on following pandemic information, and neurotic personality were positively associated with the mental health symptoms, while extraversion personality, higher education level, and better social support were negatively associated. In our study, the prevalence of mental health impact was high among medical staffs in Kashi, China who experienced the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is a particularly difficult task when a complex source, such as a seaport, is considered. COVID-19 epidemic has had a significant impact on environmental noise related to road, rail, air and ship traffic and provided a unique opportunity to observe immediate noise reduction. In order to identify the noise sources, whose reduction was most effective in reducing noise from the port area, this study compared and quantified noise emissions between the historical and epidemic periods. Environmental noise measurements from three noise monitoring stations at the port boundary were analysed. In addition, noise emissions from ship, road, rail and industry as well as meteorological data in the historical pre - COVID-19 (January 2018-February 2020) and COVID-19 (April 2020) period were analysed in detail. The characteristics of the noise sources mentioned, geographical data and noise measurements were used to develop and validate a noise model of the port area, which was used to calculate noise contour maps. Our results show that the reduction in noise levels observed at all monitoring stations coincides with the reduced shipping traffic. The A weighted equivalent sound pressure levels in the day, evening and night periods were reduced by 2.2a?dB to 5.7a?dB compared to the long-term averages, and the area of the 55a?dB day-evening-night noise contour was reduced by 23%. Compared to the historical period, the number of people exposed to noise levels above 55a?dB(A) in the day-evening-night period due to shipping and industrial activities was reduced by 20% in the COVID-19 period. Such results show that environmental noise generated by moored ships is a problem for port cities that should be regulated internationally. In addition, this paper provides precise guidance on noise emission characteristics, ship categorisation and the post-processing of long-term measurement data, taking into account wind conditions and undesired sound events, which can be applied to future research at other locations near shipping ports and used to prepare strategies for noise reduction in ports.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on environmental noise emitted from the port"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People with pre-existing mental health conditions may be more susceptible to stressors associated with COVID-19 relative to the general population; however, no studies have assessed whether susceptibility differs between classes of mental health disorders.

METHODS: Adults from a population-representative sample from the United States and Canada who reported current (past year) anxiety-related (n = 700) or mood (n = 368) disorders were compared to a random sample of respondents who did not report a current mental health diagnosis (n = 500) on COVID-19-related stress, self-isolation stress, and coping. RESULTS: The anxiety-related disorders group exhibited higher COVID Stress Scales total scores and higher scores on its fears about danger and contamination, socioeconomic consequences, xenophobia, and traumatic stress symptoms scales than the other groups. The mood disorders group had higher scores on the traumatic stress symptoms and socioeconomic consequences scales than those with no current mental disorder. Those with current anxiety-related or mood disorders were more likely to voluntarily self-isolate and were more likely to report greater self-isolation stressors and distress than those without a mental health disorder. Yet, there were no major differences in perceived effectiveness of coping strategies across groups. CONCLUSION: People with anxiety-related or mood disorders were more negatively affected by COVID-19 compared to those with no mental health disorder; however, adding to psychological burden, those with anxiety-related disorders reported greater fears about danger and contamination, socioeconomic consequences, xenophobia, and traumatic stress symptoms than the other groups.

The resultant curfew had made the access to and delivery of cancer care services an arduous task. We have reported the patterns of care and 1-year outcome of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treatment before and during COVID-19 lockdown at our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent radiation therapy (RT) for nonmetastatic HNSCC between March 1, 2020, and July 31, 2020, were included in the COVID-RT group, and those who were treated between October 1, 2019, and February 29, 2020, were included in the preCOVID-RT group. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were in the COVID-RT group, and 51 patients were in the preCOVID-RT group. An increase in the incidence of locally advanced cancers across all subsites was observed in the COVID-RT group. There was a steep increase in the median overall RT treatment duration (52 v 44) and median break days during RT (10 v 2) in the COVID-RT group. The median follow-up period of all patients was 18 months. The progression-free survival at 1 year in the COVID-RT group and preCOVID-RT group was 84% and 90%, respectively (P = .08), and overall survival at 1 year was 86% and 96%, respectively (P = .06). CONCLUSION: Our study elucidates the adverse impact of the COVID-19 curfew on cancer care and has demonstrated safe delivery of RT for HNSCC without major acute adverse effects.

The role of animals as potential reservoirs for such pathogens remains an unanswered question. No systematic reviews have been published on this topic to date. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection in animals and its diagnosis by serological and molecular tests. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Results: 6,493articles were retrieved (1960-2019). After screening by abstract/title, 50 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Of them, 42 were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. From a total of 34 studies (n=20,896 animals), the pool prevalence by RT-PCR for MERS-CoV was 7.2% (95%CI 5.6-8.7%), with 97.3% occurring in camels, in which pool prevalence was 10.3% (95%CI 8.3-12.3). Qatar was the country with the highest MERS-CoV RT-PCR pool prevalence, 32.6% (95%CI 4.8-60.4%). From 5 studies and 2,618 animals, for SARS-CoV, the RT-PCR pool prevalence was 2.3% (95%CI 1.3-3.3). Of those, 38.35% were reported on bats, in which the pool prevalence was 14.1% (95%CI0.0-44.6%). Discussion: A considerable proportion of infected animals tested positive, particularly by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). This essential condition highlights the relevance of individual animals as reservoirs of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.

Kinins play a major role during acute inflammation by regulating vasodilatation and vascular permeability and by modulating adhesion and migration of leukocytes. Kinin system activation occurs in patients with ANCA vasculitis. Previous studies in animal models of GN and sclerosing kidney diseases have demonstrated protective effects of bradykinin receptor 1 (B1R) blockade via interference with myeloid cell trafficking. METHODS: To investigate the role of B1R in a murine model of MPO-ANCA GN, we evaluated effects of B1R genetic ablation and pharmacologic blockade. We used bone marrow chimeric mice to determine the role of B1R in bone marrow-derived cells (leukocytes) versus nonbone marrow-derived cells. We elucidated mechanisms of B1R effects using in vitro assays for MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation, endothelial adherence, endothelial transmigration, and neutrophil adhesion molecule surface display. RESULTS: B1R deficiency or blockade prevented or markedly reduced ANCA-induced glomerular crescents, necrosis, and leukocyte influx in mice. B1R was not required for in vitro MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation. Leukocyte B1R deficiency, but not endothelial B1R deficiency, decreased glomerular neutrophil infiltration induced by MPO-ANCA in vivo. B1R enhanced ANCA-induced neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration in vitro. ANCA-activated neutrophils exhibited changes in Mac-1 and LFA-1, important regulators of neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration: ANCA-activated neutrophils increased surface expression of Mac-1 and increased shedding of LFA-1, whereas B1R blockade reduced these effects. CONCLUSIONS: The leukocyte B1R plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MPO-ANCA-induced GN in a mouse model by modulating neutrophil-endothelial interaction.

IgG4-RD represents a spectrum of diseases that involve various organs such as the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and salivary glands often manifesting as diffuse organ enlargement or a mass-like lesion mimicking cancer. An increased incidence of malignancy among patients with IgG4-RD has been reported. Thus, differentiating malignancy from IgG4-RD manifestation is important as the treatment differs.

This is the first study in the scientific literature reporting the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in a sample of the Spanish population. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey of 3480 people. The presence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated with screening tests from 14 March. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data was collected. Additionally, spiritual well-being, loneliness, social support, discrimination and sense of belonging were assessed. Descriptive analyses were carried out and linear regression models compiled. The 18.7% of the sample revealed depressive, 21.6% anxiety and 15.8% PTSD symptoms. Being in the older age group, having economic stability and the belief that adequate information had been provided about the pandemic were negatively related to depression, anxiety and PTSD. However, female gender, previous diagnoses of mental health problems or neurological disorders, having symptoms associated with the virus, or those with a close relative infected were associated with greater symptomatology in all three variables. Predictive models revealed that the greatest protector for symptomatology was spiritual well-being, while loneliness was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The impact on our mental health caused by the pandemic and the measures adopted during the first weeks to deal with it are evident.

A greater understanding of citizens' perceptions of these measures can help government agencies adapt their strategies to boost compliance. We examined citizens' perceptions of government's measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications on compliance using data from Onitsha city, Anambra State Nigeria. METHODS: data was obtained through in-person interviews of 140 consenting adults in March 2020. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to summarize the data. RESULTS: most participants (84.7%) doubted government's ability to manage the COVID-19 outbreak, raising concerns about ineffective governance (25.7%) and inadequate health facilities (20.7%). However, participants expressed a favorable perception of school closures (92.3%) and a ban on large gatherings (83.9%), driven mostly by the need to contain the COVID-19 and avoid its spread. But, they were generally indifferent about the closure of the markets and workplaces due to concerns for food insecurity and lack of government's relief programs. Participants who had a positive perception of the ban on large gatherings were more likely to have high knowledge and to adopt good COVID-19 preventive practices. CONCLUSION: the study showed a lack of public's confidence in the government's ability to manage the pandemic.

The aim of the present study was to make a detailed description of re-interventions after EVAR-including incidence, indications, procedures, and outcome-with special reference to non-access-related re-interventions. METHODS This is a retrospective single-center cohort study of re-interventions after standard EVAR with special reference to non-access-related re-interventions. Consecutive patients (n = 405) treated with standard EVAR for non-ruptured (n = 337) or ruptured (n = 68) infrarenal aneurysms between 2005 and 2013 were analysed. Median follow-up was 29 months (range 0-108). RESULTS Eighty-nine patients (22 %) underwent 113 re-interventions during follow-up. Twenty-seven patients (7 %) had 28 access related re-intervention, 65 patients (16 %) had 85 non-access related reinterventions. Non-access related re-interventions were more common in ruptured aneurysms than in unruptured aneurysms (22 vs. 15 %, p = 0.002). The most frequent indications were endoleak type I (n = 19), type II (n = 21), or type III (n = 5); stent graft migration (n = 9); and thrombosis (n = 14). The most frequent procedures were embolization of endoleak type II (n = 21), additional iliac stent graft (n = 19), proximal extension (n = 12), thrombolysis (n = 8), iliac limb bare-metal stenting (n = 6), and stent graft relining (n = 7). Endovascular technique was used in 83 % of re-interventions. Thirty-day mortality after non-access-related re-interventions was 15 % when initiated from symptoms (rupture or infection) and 0 % when initiated from follow-up findings (p = 0.014). Cumulative survival five years after EVAR was 72 % in patients with a re-intervention and 59 % in patients without (p = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS Non-access-related re-intervention rates are still considerable after EVAR and more frequent after ruptured aneurysms. Endoleak embolization is the most frequent procedure, followed by additional iliac stent grafts.

METHODS A non-randomized controlled study (SiMbA; \\"Sicherheit der Medikamentherapie bei AltenheimbewohnerInnen\\", Safety of medication therapy in NHRs) was conducted in six nursing homes in Austria (2016-2018). Educational training, introduction of tailored health information technology (HIT) and a therapy check process were combined in an intervention aimed at healthcare professionals. Medication appropriateness was assessed using the Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI). Data was collected before (t0), during (t1, month 12) and after (t2, month 18) intervention via self-administered assessments and electronic health records. RESULTS We included 6 NHs, 17 GPs (52.94% female) and 240 NHRs (68.75% female; mean age 85.0). Data of 159 NHRs could be included in the analysis. Mean MAI-change was - 3.35 (IG) vs. - 1.45 (CG). In the subgroup of NHRs with mean MAI 23, MAI-change was - 10.31 (IG) vs. -3.52 (CG). The intervention was a significant predictor of improvement in MAI when controlled for in a multivariable regression model.

Data about Brazilian pregnant and postpartum women found a case fatality rate of 12.7% among COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome cases (ARDS). Studies in pregnant women found prevalences of antibodies (Ab) against SARS CoV-2 between 4 to 14% in Europe and North America. However, there is no data about the prevalence of SARS CoV-2 Ab among Brazilian pregnant women with viral hepatitis. Objectives The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of SARS CoV-2 antibodies in pregnant women infected with hepatitis B or C. Methods A total of 31 pregnant women (21 HBV and 10 HCV) were recruited in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) from January 7, 2020 to January 11, 2021. The study protocol was approved by the Brazilian National research ethics committee. Serum samples were collected and tested for total antibody (Ab) and IgM Abs specific for SARS-CoV-2 using electrochemiluminescence assay (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Roche). Results Pregnant women were at first (n=12), second (n=10) and third trimester of gestation (n=9). None of them had diabetic or are living with HIV, while three women presented arterial hypertension. Mean age was 30.6 7.26 years old, 90.3% were black and 38.7% had up 8 years of education. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 19.3% (6/31). Most of pregnant women were at first trimester of gestation, aged less than 35 years of old, and were black race. However, none of these variables were statistical associated to anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody positivity (table 1).

However, a role for virus-specific memory B cells (Bmem) within the CNS is poorly explored due to lack of robust phenotypic or functional identification in mice. This study takes advantage of the progeny of mice expressing tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (Cre-ERT2) under the Aicda promoter crossed with Rosa26-loxP-tdTomato reporter mice (AID(Cre)-Rosa26(tdTomato)) to monitor B cells having undergone activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-mediated somatic hypermutation (SHM) following neurotropic coronavirus infection. AID detection via tdTomato expression allowed tracking of virus-specific ASC and Bmem in priming and effector sites throughout infection. In draining lymph nodes, tdTomato-positive (tdTomato(+)) ASC were most prevalent prior to germinal center (GC) formation, but total tdTomato(+) B cells only peaked with robust GC formation at day 14 p.i. Moreover, their proportion of Bmem dominated over the proportion of ASC throughout infection. In the CNS, tdTomato(+) cells started emerging at day 14 p.i. While they initially comprised mainly Bmem, the proportions of ASC and Bmem became similar as tdTomato(+) B cells increased throughout viral persistence. Delayed tamoxifen treatment demonstrated ongoing CNS recruitment of tdTomato(+) B cells, mainly ASC, primed late during GC reactions. Overall, the data support the idea that virus-induced B cells exhibiting SHM require peripheral GC formation to emerge in the CNS. Ongoing GC reactions and regional signals further regulate dynamics within the CNS, with preferential maintenance of tdTomato(+) B cells in spinal cords relative to that in brains during viral persistence. IMPORTANCE The prevalence and role of antigen-specific Bmem in the CNS during viral encephalomyelitis is largely undefined. A lack of reliable markers identifying murine Bmem has made it difficult to assess their contribution to local antiviral protection via antigen presentation or conversion to ASC. Using reporter mice infected with neurotropic coronavirus to track virus-specific Bmem and ASC, this report demonstrates that both subsets only emerge in the CNS following peripheral GC formation and subsequently prevail. While early GC reactions supported preferential Bmem accumulation in the CNS, late GC reactions favored ASC accumulation, although Bmem outnumbered ASC in draining lymph nodes throughout infection. Importantly, virus-specific B cells undergoing sustained GC selection were continually recruited to the persistently infected CNS. Elucidating the factors governing temporal events within GCs, as well as regional CNS cues during viral persistence, will aid intervention to modulate CNS humoral responses in the context of infection and associated autoimmune pathologies.","output":"Dynamics of Virus-Specific Memory B Cells and Plasmablasts following Viral Infection of the Central Nervous System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the world tries to cope with the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and emerging variants of the virus, COVID-19 vaccination has become an even more critical tool toward normalcy.

This study investigated the knowledge, attitudes, and resulting community practice(s) associated with the new COVID-19 variants and vaccines in Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Malaysia, Zimbabwe, and the USA. A cross-sectional web-based Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) survey was administered to respondents living in six different countries using a structured and multi-item questionnaire. Survey questions were translated into English, Spanish, and Malay to accommodate the local language in each country. Associations between KAP and a range of explanatory variables were assessed using univariate and multiple logistic regression. A total of 781 responses were included in the final analysis. The Knowledge score mean was 24 (out of 46), Attitude score 28.9 (out of 55), and Practice score 7.3 (out of 11). Almost 65% of the respondents reported being knowledgeable about COVID-19 variants and vaccination, 55% reported a positive attitude toward available COVID-19 vaccines, and 85% reported engaging in practices that supported COVID-19 vaccination.

In this context, the Flipped Classroom (FC) model is one of the pedagogical models that is revolutionizing the scope of education. However, there is still not enough evidence of its advantages and disadvantages in the university stage. Therefore, it is important to analyze the impact of the FC on the learning, satisfaction and interaction of the different agents of the university community. Due to the idiosyncrasy of the present study, an exclusively qualitative and longitudinal methodology was selected;thus, 266 interviews based on open questions were conducted throughout the last five years. The results show that students value the FC model positively and corroborate its great potential from academic, competence, personal and social perspectives.

DESIGN: Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial. SETTING: Three Canadian provinces (Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia). PARTICIPANTS: 203 adults aged 18 years and older with polymerase chain reaction confirmed covid-19, presenting with fever, cough, or dyspnoea. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomised to receive either inhaled ciclesonide (600 g twice daily) and intranasal ciclesonide (200 g daily) or metered dose inhaler and nasal saline placebos for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was symptom resolution at day 7. Analyses were conducted on the modified intention-to-treat population (participants who took at least one dose of study drug and completed one follow-up survey) and adjusted for stratified randomisation by sex. RESULTS: The modified intention-to-treat population included 203 participants: 105 were randomly assigned to ciclesonide (excluding two dropouts and one loss to follow-up) and 98 to placebo (excluding three dropouts and six losses to follow-up). The median age was 35 years (interquartile range 27-47 years) and 54% were women. The proportion of participants with resolution of symptoms by day 7 did not differ significantly between the intervention group (42/105, 40%) and control group (34/98, 35%); absolute adjusted risk difference 5.5% (95% confidence interval ?7.8% to 18.8%). Results might be limited to the population studied, which mainly included younger adults without comorbidities. The trial was stopped early, therefore could have been underpowered. CONCLUSION: Compared with placebo, the combination of inhaled and intranasal ciclesonide did not show a statistically significant increase in resolution of symptoms among healthier young adults with covid-19 presenting with prominent respiratory symptoms. As evidence is insufficient to determine the benefit of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids in the treatment of covid-19, further research is needed.

The first is the traditional one: the global orchestration of resources and markets. We argue that it exacerbates local disconnectedness. The second, that we call local spawning, involves engaging with the local entrepreneurial eco-system to create and renew local connectedness, diffusing populist responses. Some MNEs are better able to implement a local spawning strategy, due to industry factors like innovation clock-speed, and firm characteristics like organizational path dependency. Finally, we distinguish between disconnection, which is an outcome of MNE strategy, and global disruptions, like the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which are primarily stochastic events.

METHODS: In this multicentre retrospective study, we enrolled people with confirmed COVID-19 from 44 hospitals in Wuhan and Sichuan, China, between 18 January and 30 March 2020. We extracted demographics, clinical, laboratory data and consciousness level (as measured by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score) from medical records. We used Cox proportional hazards regression, structural equation modelling and survival time analysis to compare people with different progressions of impaired consciousness. RESULTS: We enrolled 1,143 people (average age 51.3  standard deviation 17.1-year-old; 50.3% males), of whom 76 died. Increased mortality risk was identified in people with GCS score between 9 and 14 (hazard ratio (HR) 46.76, p < .001) and below 9 (HR 65.86, p < .001). Pathway analysis suggested a significant direct association between consciousness level and death. Other factors, including age, oxygen saturation level and pH, had indirect associations with death mediated by GCS scores. People who developed impaired consciousness more rapidly either from symptoms onset (<10 days vs. 10-19 days, p = .025, <10 days vs. &#8805;20 days and 10-19 days vs. &#8805;20 days, <.001) or deterioration of oxygen saturation (&#8804;2 days vs.>2 days, p = .028) had shorter survival times.

Advancement of sensor technologies has allowed the electroencephalography (EEG) devices to be portable and used in real-time to monitor mental health. However, real-time monitoring is not often practical in workplace environments with complex operations such as kindergarten, firefighting and offshore facilities. Integrating the EEG with virtual reality (VR) that emulates workplace conditions can be a tool to assess and monitor mental health of adults within their working environment. This paper evaluates the mental states induced when performing a stressful task in a VR-based offshore environment. The theta, alpha and beta frequency bands are analysed to assess changes in mental states due to physical discomfort, stress and concentration. During the VR trials, mental states of discomfort and disorientation are observed with the drop of theta activity, whilst the stress induced from the conditional tasks is reflected in the changes of low-alpha and high-beta activities. The deflection of frontal alpha asymmetry from negative to positive direction reflects the learning effects from emotion-focus to problem-solving strategies adopted to accomplish the VR task.

Substantial variation exists in the indications for GSL and surgical technique. The purpose of this study was to review surgical anatomy and biomechanics of the gastrocsoleus and to utilize expert orthopaedic opinion through a Delphi technique to establish consensus for surgical indications for GSL in ambulatory children with CP. METHODS: A 17-member panel, of Fellowship-trained paediatric orthopaedic surgeons, each with at least 9 years of clinical post-training experience in the surgical management of children with CP, was established. Consensus for the surgical indications for GSL was achieved through a standardized, iterative Delphi process. RESULTS: Consensus was reached to support conservative Zone 1 surgery in diplegia and Zone 3 surgery (lengthening of the Achilles tendon) was contraindicated. Zone 2 or Zone 3 surgery reached general agreement as a choice in hemiplegia and under-correction was preferred to any degree of overcorrection. Agreement was reached that the optimum age for GSL surgery was 6 years to 10 years and should be avoided in children aged under 4 years. Physical examination measures with the child awake and under anaesthesia were important in decision making.

These can be attributed to age and sex related alterations in the immune system and in the lung functions. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, epidemiological studies consistently report that age and sex are major risk factors in both morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. Thus, understanding age and sex dependent gene expression in the lung and in the immune system can provide mechanical evidences with respects to sex related higher risk of elderly to develop severe complications in respiratory infectious diseases. In this context, sex- and age- transcriptome analysis from hundreds of lung and blood samples, revealed significant downregulation of the lung surfactant and blood innate immune genes, that occur predominantly in elderly men. Depletion in lung surfactant leads to enhanced injury of alveolar epithelium and fibrotic destruction, and recruitment of the innate immune system is essential to control infection of new pathogens like SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, surfactant proteins, which protect the lung from infection, are co-produced with the SARS-CoV-2 host receptor- ACE2, by the AT2 cells. Thus, infection by SARS-CoV-2 is expected to lead to decline in AT2 cells and a loss of surfactant proteins, especially in elderly men.","output":"Age- and sex-transcriptome analysis provide evidences for the sex biases in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and other respiratory infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Study Objectives: As of June 10, 2020, there have been 17,300 confirmed and an additional 4,693 suspected COVID related-deaths in New York City (NYC) While much attention was given to the overwhelming burden on hospitals and skilled nursing facilities during the pandemic, it is less well known how the pandemic impacted EMS systems and rates of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) The NYC Regional Emergency Medical Advisory Committee (REMAC) is responsible for oversight and quality in out-of-hospital care in NYC This studys primary objective was to assess the burden of cardiac arrest in during the pandemic Methods: This observational study uses aggregate data from the New York City region collected through the National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) Daily counts of cardiac arrest incidents stratified by each of the five boroughs (geographical divisions) in NYC and by final disposition (eg, transported to the hospital or pronounced on scene) were obtained for the time periods of February 2020 through April 2020, and for the same time period in the final year Descriptive statistics were used to describe and compare the daily counts of cardiac arrests and the proportion of patients pronounced in the field between the current year during the pandemic time period and the corresponding time period in 2019 This study was determined to be exempt by the Mount Sinai Institutional Review Board Results: In NYC during the COVID-19 pandemic, EMS experienced a 220% increase in cardiac arrest call responses in February - April, 2020 (8,837) compared to February - April, 2019 (4,022), peaking on April 6 at 330 cases in a single day (See Figure 1) During this period, the Bronx experienced the highest rate of increase at 243% higher in 2020 compared to Queens (238% increase), Kings (231%), New York (184%) and Richmond (143%) For all of NYC, the rate of transport for OOHCA decreased during this time period from 37% in February-April 2019 to 16% in February-April 2020 Conclusion: There was exponential growth of the rate of OOHCA during the initial phase of the pandemic in NYC and there was a sustained increase through the month April 2020 With a 220% increase in cases over the course of three months and over a 780% (42 to 330 cases) increase on the highest day of OOHCA, and in light of a concurrent burden on NYC hospitals, our EMS system experienced an unprecedented demand for critical care and resuscitation Further studies are needed to better understand to what degree the increased in OOHCA was attributed to the disease itself, or due to delaying needed care for other conditions In planning for future pandemics, strategic planning should include consideration of impacts on operations and capacity of the regional EMS system [Formula presented]","output":"5 Burden of Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest in New York City during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extensive possibilities of applications have rendered emotion recognition ineluctable and challenging in the fields of computer science as well as in human-machine interaction and affective computing. Fields that, in turn, are increasingly requiring real-time applications or interactions in everyday life scenarios. However, while extremely desirable, an accurate and automated emotion classification approach remains a challenging issue. To this end, this study presents an automated emotion recognition model based on easily accessible physiological signals and deep learning (DL) approaches. As a DL algorithm, a Feedforward Neural Network was employed in this study. The network outcome was further compared with canonical machine learning algorithms such as random forest (RF). The developed DL model relied on the combined use of wearables and contactless technologies, such as thermal infrared imaging. Such a model is able to classify the emotional state into four classes, derived from the linear combination of valence and arousal (referring to the circumplex model of affects four-quadrant structure) with an overall accuracy of 70% outperforming the 66% accuracy reached by the RF model.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study design that was adopted to include a representative sample of physicians and nurses working at North West Armed Forces hospital throughout the study period, provided that they worked at this hospital for at least 6 months. A self-administered questionnaire was applied including three parts; the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants, factors that could be associated with depression and the patient health-9 questionnaire to diagnose depression. RESULTS: The study included 255 healthcare workers. Females represent 58.8 % of the participants. Their age ranged between 22 and 50 years (30.6  5.3 years). About two-thirds of them were nurses (64.3 %) and the remaining 35.7 % were physicians; mainly registrars (22.8 %). The prevalence of depression was 43.9 %. being severe among 0.8 % of them.

Acrylamide forms adduct in presynaptic neurons leading to neuroinflammation which is also a factor to consider. In this present study, we have explored whether our benzo[b]thiophene analogs, 1-(3-hydroxybenzo[b]thiophen-2-yl) ethanone (BP) and 1-(3-hydroxybenzo[b]thiophen-2-yl) propan-1-one hydrate (EP) with antioxidant activity, could inhibit the acrylamide-induced neurotoxicity-like behavior in zebrafish larvae.

Locomotion behavioral analysis, antioxidants, glutathione, and acetylcholineesterase activity in the head region were analyzed after one day of the experimental procedure. We witnessed a restoration effect on glutathione redox dynamics. Since glutathione plays a crucial role in the detoxification of acrylamide, it is necessary to maintain the glutathione redox cycle to eliminate acrylamide from the body. BP and EP reduced the pro-inflammatory transcript in the head, which correlates with the reduction in oxidative stress. Finally, BP and EP showed a positive effect on synaptic vesicle cycling transcript and partially restores the motor neuron response to stimuli.

This review will cover the first papers to use scRNAseq to characterise human lymphocyte phenotypes in T1D in the peripheral blood, pancreatic lymph nodes and islets. These have revealed specific genes such as IL-32 that are differentially expressed in islet Cspecific T cells in T1D. scRNAseq has also revealed wider gene expression patterns that are involved in T1D and can predict its development even predating autoantibody production. Single cell sequencing of TCRs has revealed V genes and CDR3 motifs that are commonly used to target islet autoantigens, although truly public TCRs remain elusive. Little is known about BCR repertoires in T1D, but scRNAseq approaches have revealed that insulin binding BCRs commonly use specific J genes, share motifs between donors and frequently demonstrate poly-reactivity. This review will also summarise new developments in scRNAseq technology, the insights they have given into other diseases and how they could be leveraged to advance research in the type 1 diabetes field to identify novel biomarkers and targets for immunotherapy.","output":"Insights From Single Cell RNA Sequencing Into the Immunology of Type 1 Diabetes- Cell Phenotypes and Antigen Specificity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a viral infection characterized by a cytokine storm similar to that in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), found in the bone marrow and peripheral blood as rare cell population, demonstrated a high proliferation and differentiation capacity. Understanding how such diseases influence the quantity and functionality of EPCs is essential for the development of novel therapies. This study aims to investigate the factors that affect the quantity and functionality of circulating EPCs in stroke patients and healthy controls. Blood samples were collected once from healthy donors (n = 30) and up to 3 times (within 7 days (baseline), 3 and 12 months post-stroke) from stroke patients (n = 207). EPC subpopulations were isolated with flow cytometry for characterization. The Matrigel tubular formation assay was performed as a measure of functionality. An increased amount of circulating EPCs was observed in stroke patients over 45 years when compared to age-matched healthy individuals. EPCs showed a rising trend in stroke patients over the 12-month post-stroke period, reaching statistical significance at 12 months post-stroke. Isolated CD34(+)KDR(+) cells from stroke patients showed impairment in tubular formation capability when compared to cells from healthy donors. The quantity and vasculogenic function of circulating EPCs in peripheral blood have been effectively evaluated in stroke patients and healthy control donors in this study. Age and stroke are found to be 2 influencing factors on the angiogenic capacity. It is suggested that the increase in EPC number is triggered by the recovery response following ischemic stroke.

This study aimed to assess the challenges faced by women who used RMNCH services in Nigeria's epicentre, their satisfaction with care received during the COVID-19 pandemic and the factors associated with their satisfaction. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in Lagos, southwest Nigeria among 1,241 women of reproductive age who had just received RMNCH services at one of twenty-two health facilities across the primary, secondary and tertiary tiers of health care. The respondents were selected via multi-stage sampling and face to face exit interviews were conducted by trained interviewers. Client satisfaction was assessed across four sub-scales: health care delivery, health facility, interpersonal aspects of care and access to services. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the relationship between personal characteristics and client satisfaction. RESULTS: About 43.51% of respondents had at least one challenge in accessing RMNCH services since the COVID-19 outbreak. Close to a third (31.91%) could not access service because they could not leave their houses during the lockdown and 18.13% could not access service because there was no transportation. The mean clients' satisfaction score among the respondents was 43.25 (SD: 6.28) out of a possible score of 57. Satisfaction scores for the interpersonal aspects of care were statistically significantly lower in the PHCs and general hospitals compared to teaching hospitals. Being over 30 years of age was significantly associated with an increased clients' satisfaction score (? = 1.80, 95%CI: 1.10-2.50). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 lockdown posed challenges to accessing RMNCH services for a significant proportion of women surveyed. Although overall satisfaction with care was fairly high, there is a need to provide tailored COVID-19 sensitive inter-personal care to clients at all levels of care.","output":"Challenges in access and satisfaction with reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health services in Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Australia implemented a travel ban on China on February 1(st) 2020, while COVID-19 was largely localised to China. We modelled three scenarios to test the impact of travel bans on epidemic control. Scenario one was no ban, scenario two and three were the current ban followed by a full or partial lifting (allow over 100 000 university students to enter Australia, but not tourists) from the 8(th) of March 2020. METHODS: We used disease incidence data from China and air travel passenger movements between China and Australia during and after the epidemic peak in China, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. We used the estimated incidence of disease in China, using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases, and an age specific deterministic model to model the epidemic in each scenario. RESULTS: The modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well, predicting 57 cases on March 6(th) in Australia, compared to 66 observed on this date, however we did not account for imported cases from other countries. The modelled impact without a travel ban results in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths, if the epidemic remained localised to China and no importations from other countries occurred. The full travel ban reduced cases by about 86%, while the impact of a partial lifting of the ban is minimal, and may be a policy option. CONCLUSIONS: Travel restrictions were highly effective for containing the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia during the epidemic peak in China and averted a much larger epidemic at a time when COVID-19 was largely localised to China. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of travel bans applied to countries with high disease incidence. This research can inform decisions on placing or lifting travel bans as a control measure for the COVID-19 epidemic.","output":"The effectiveness of full and partial travel bans against COVID-19 spread in Australia for travellers from China during and after the epidemic peak in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The relationship between pain and depression is thought to be bidirectional and the underlying neurobiology 'shared' between the two conditions. However, these claims are often based on qualitative comparisons of brain regions implicated in pain or depression, while focused quantitative studies of the neurobiology of pain-depression comorbidity are lacking. Particularly, the direction of comorbidity, i.e., pain with depression vs. depression with pain, is rarely addressed. In this systematic review (PROSPERO registration CRD42020219876), we aimed to delineate brain correlates associated with primary pain with concomitant depression, primary depression with concurrent pain, and equal pain and depression comorbidity, using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis. Neuroimaging studies published in English until the 28th of September 2021 were evaluated using PRISMA guidelines. A total of 70 studies were included, of which 26 reported stereotactic coordinates and were analysed with ALE. All studies were assessed for quality by two authors, using the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tool. Our results revealed paucity of studies that directly investigated the neurobiology of pain-depression comorbidity. The ALE analysis indicated that pain with concomitant depression was associated with the right amygdala, while depression with concomitant pain was related primarily to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).

However, evidence suggests that a high proportion of Twitter posts (ie, tweets) are not necessarily accurate, and many studies suggest that tweets do not need to be accurate, or at least evidence based, to receive traction. This is a dangerous combination in the sphere of health information. OBJECTIVE: The first objective of this study is to examine health-related tweets originating from Saudi Arabia in terms of their accuracy. The second objective is to find factors that relate to the accuracy and dissemination of these tweets, thereby enabling the identification of ways to enhance the dissemination of accurate tweets. The initial findings from this study and methodological improvements will then be employed in a larger-scale study that will address these issues in more detail. METHODS: A health lexicon was used to extract health-related tweets using the Twitter application programming interface and the results were further filtered manually. A total of 300 tweets were each labeled by two medical doctors; the doctors agreed that 109 tweets were either accurate or inaccurate. Other measures were taken from these tweets metadata to see if there was any relationship between the measures and either the accuracy or the dissemination of the tweets. The entire range of this metadata was analyzed using Python, version 3.6.5 (Python Software Foundation), to answer the research questions posed. RESULTS: A total of 34 out of 109 tweets (31.2%) in the dataset used in this study were classified as untrustworthy health information. These came mainly from users with a non-health care background and social media accounts that had no corresponding physical (ie, organization) manifestation. Unsurprisingly, we found that traditionally trusted health sources were more likely to tweet accurate health information than other users. Likewise, these provisional results suggest that tweets posted in the morning are more trustworthy than tweets posted at night, possibly corresponding to official and casual posts, respectively. Our results also suggest that the crowd was quite good at identifying trustworthy information sources, as evidenced by the number of times a tweets author was tagged as favorited by the community. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate some initially surprising factors that might correlate with the accuracy of tweets and their dissemination. For example, the time a tweet was posted correlated with its accuracy, which may reflect a difference between professional (ie, morning) and hobbyist (ie, evening) tweets. More surprisingly, tweets containing a kashidaa decorative element in Arabic writing used to justify the text within lineswere more likely to be disseminated through retweets. These findings will be further assessed using data analysis techniques on a much larger dataset in future work.","output":"Trustworthy Health-Related Tweets on Social Media in Saudi Arabia: Tweet Metadata Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Though areas such as the southeastern Guangdong province have introduced job retraining programs to encourage assembly-line workers to shift toward more [End Page 144] technical jobs,4 these same opportunities are not as widespread in the rural west [ ]older generations have been shown to struggle with assimilating to modern industries,5 while rural youth present a clean slate with untapped potential, if only the proper educational programs are available Even if families are able to afford tuition, rural schools provide poor-quality vocational training with predominantly unqualified teachers, leaving students without the math or science knowledge necessary for high-skilled labor 6 To address these concerns, the authors suggest that the Chinese government either significantly reduce tuition costs or make academic high school entirely free [ ]they encourage the use of conditional cash transfers to serve as a financial incentive for families to keep their children in school and pursue a serious strategic overhaul in government funding for rural education 7 However, Rozelle and Hell still find these policies insufficient to fully address the rural youths inability to access education, as the most alarming issues begin outside of the classroom [ ]the book functions as an informative piece for students as well as a step-by-step guideline for Chinese policymakers wishing to address these issues The terminology and diction are accessible for the average college student, and the authors adequately synthesize more complex topics Because the authors frequently expand upon the historical and political contexts to provide a backdrop for their arguments, the book requires little prior knowledge of the reader and serves as a solid introduction to Chinas urban-rural divide","output":"Chinas Developmental Shadow: A Review of Invisible China: How the Urban-Rural Divide Threatens Chinas Rise by Scott Rozelle and Natalie Hell"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Industries leading the experiment and clinical trial of various vaccines to approve effectiveness and safety on humans.

METHODS: An electronic survey of 18 questions was sent among residents registered in the Mexican Society of Neurological Surgery (MSNS), between October 2019 and July 2020. Statistical analysis was made in IBM SPSS Statistics 25. The survey focused on demographic characteristics, discrimination, personal satisfaction, and expectations of residents. RESULTS: A response rate of 50% (132 of 264 residents members of MSNS) was obtained and considered for analysis. Median age was 30.06  2.48 years, 5.3% (n = 7) were female and 16.7% (n = 22) were foreigners undergoing neurosurgical training in Mexico.

METHODS: Factor analysis grouped 11 indicators into 7 distinct susceptibility factors for 3,079 counties in the conterminous United States. Unconditional mean differences are assessed using a multivariate general linear model. Data from 2018 are primarily taken from the US Census Bureau and CDC. RESULTS: About 33% of rural counties are highly susceptible to COVID-19, driven by older and health-compromised populations, and care facilities for the elderly. Major vulnerabilities in rural counties include fewer physicians, lack of mental health services, higher disability, and more uninsured. Poor Internet access limits telemedicine. Lack of social capital and social services may hinder local pandemic recovery. Meat processing facilities drive risk in micropolitan counties. Although metropolitan counties are less susceptible due to healthier and younger populations, about 6% are at risk due to community spread from dense populations. Metropolitan vulnerabilities include minorities at higher health and diabetes risk, language barriers, being a transportation hub that helps spread infection, and acute housing distress. CONCLUSIONS: There is an immediate need to know specific types of susceptibilities and vulnerabilities ahead of time to allow local and state health officials to plan and allocate resources accordingly. In rural areas it is essential to shelter-in-place vulnerable populations, whereas in large metropolitan areas general closure orders are needed to stop community spread.

Our aim in this study is to determine the frequency of no-reflow phenomenon in COVID-19 patients with STEMI and to determine the factors that predict this complication. METHODS In this study, which is a single-centre, retrospective and observational, a total of 126 patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) in our centre due to STEMI between 11 March 2020 and 10 January 2021 were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS While 62 patients were in the COVID-19 (+) group, 64 patients were evaluated in the COVID-19 (-) group. When the two groups are compared, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly higher, and the lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the COVID-19 (+) group. No-reflow was numerically higher in patients with COVID-19. In multivariable analysis, D-dimer and NLR were found to be independent predictors of no-reflow phenomenon in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS Although the no-reflow phenomenon was numerically higher in COVID-19 patients who underwent pPCI due to STEMI compared to the non-COVID group, no statistical difference was found in our study.

Method A search was made of the literature for DID and a series of exclusion and structural quality criteria were defined (at least 4 quality criteria: classification according to severity, classification according to level of evidence, bibliographical reference data, description of clinical management, and 11 criteria used for weighting). The level of compliance of every DID with the criteria defined was analysed, together with the level of compliance of each criteria in each DID. Results A total of 54 DID were identified, 30 of which complied with exclusion criteria and 15 of which did not meet the minimum criteria. The rest of the criteria were evaluated in 9 DID: Botplus and Medinteract (100%), SEFH Guide, Lexi-interact and Medscape (89%), Hansten (83%), Micromedex and Stockley (78%), Drug Interactions Facts (68%). Ninety-two percent of the DID describe the mechanism of action, 87% classify the information according to the active ingredient, 75% do not state they have any conflict of interest, classify according to level of severity, have electronic format, and are easy to search. A total of 67% are specific DID, 62% are classified according to level of evidence, contain bibliographical references, and describe clinical management. Conclusions A third of the DID comply with the minimum criteria. Differences were observed in the level and compliance criteria among Spanish and foreign DID.

This study aimed at elucidating the penetration and mucoadhesive behavior of developed gCS multiunit carriers with zidovudine (ZVD) as a model antiretroviral agent in contact with excised human vaginal epithelium followed with an examination of in vitro antiherpes activity in immortal human keratinocytes HaCaT and human vaginal epithelial cells VK2-E6/E7. Both ZVD dispersion and placebo microparticles served as controls. Microparticles displayed feasible (comparable to commercial vaginal product) mucoadhesive and mucoretention characteristics to isolated human vaginal tissue. Ex vivo penetration studies revealed that gCS increased the accumulation of active agent in the vaginal epithelium but surprisingly did not facilitate its penetration across human tissue.

Natural products as sesame were reported to exhibit potential to protect from COVID-19 disease. In our study, the total methanolic extract of Sesamum indicum L. seeds (sesame) were led to isolation of seven known compounds, five lignan; sesamin 1, sesamolin 2, pinoresinol 3, hydroxymatairesinol 6, spicatolignan 7, together with two simple phenolic compounds; ferulic acid 4 and vanillic acid 5. All isolated compounds were evaluated in silico against three important SARS-CoV-2 protein targets; main protease (M(pro)), papain-like protease (PL(pro)) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which possessed crucial role in replication and proliferation of the virus inside the human cell. The results revealed that compound 6 has the high affinity against the three main proteins, specially towards the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) that exceeded the currently used SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitor darunavir as well as, exhibiting a similar binding energy at SARS CoV-2 PLpro when compared with the co-crystallized ligand. This activity continued to include the RdRp as it displayed a comparable docking score with remdesivir. Inferiorly, compounds 1 and 2 showed also similar triple inhibitory effect against the three main proteins while compound 7 exhibited a dual inhibitory effect against SARS CoV-2 PL(Pro) and RdRp. Further molecular dynamic simulation experiments were performed to validate these docking experiments and to calculate their binding free energies (Gs). Compounds 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 showed comparable binding stability inside the active site of each enzyme with G values ranged from ?4.9 to ?8.8 kcal mol(?1).

There are many arbitrators of what constitutes a responsible business and rethinking the United Kingdoms farm business, post BREXIT, post COVID-19 and in relation to the entrepreneurial orientation (EO) of farmers is timely and essential to tackle crisis, uncertainty and sustain a healthy rural ecosystem. This is an ethnographic study into contextual dualities. Data from one case farm are presented, and findings are triangulated through a grounded thematic data analysis of five in-depth interviews with other farms from the same community. An empirically informed framework is constructed explaining how, through duality, EO is moderated across six themes. The contributions to policy and practice are intertwined. Through identification of moderators of (and for) duality, the rural ecosystem can be better managed through effective policy design and responsible practice at grass roots. Accelerated professionalisation in the agricultural industry involves combining the rich, irreplaceable knowledge of older generations with shaping the values and behaviours of new generations. By synthesising EO with farmer mentality, we theorise and inform how to re-educate future generations in responsible and sustainable farm businesses.","output":"Responsible and sustainable farm business: Contextual duality as the moderating influence on entrepreneurial orientation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Adhesion formation is a major problem when a mesh is exposed to intraabodminal viscera, with potential severe complications (bowel occlusion, fistulas or abscesses). New methods for preventing adhesions from a polypropylene mesh placed intra-abdominally or to solve difficult situations, such as when the peritoneum cannot be closed during a TAPP repair for an inguinal hernia, are still being seeked. This study mimics in an animal model a situation that can be found in clinical practice during laparoscopic inguinal hernioplasty. A polypropylene mesh could be exposed to the intra-abdominal cavity even when the peritoneum is closed due to different circumstances, with no options to guarantee the prosthetic material of being exposed to the intrabdominal viscera. Different options have been suggested to solve these situations, being proposed in this study to cover the visceral surface of the mesh with an absorbable sponge containing thrombin, fibrinogen, and clotting factors (Tachosil?, Nycomed, Takeda, Osaka, Japan), to assess its use as a barrier to prevent postoperative adhesion formation. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty Wistar white rats (300-450 mg) were included in this study as experimental animals, being randomized into three groups (A, B, and C). We performed a bilateral prosthetic repair with conventional polypropylene mesh (2  2 cm, 82 kD). Prosthesis fixation was performed as follows. Group A: absorbable suture; group B: metal staples; group C: metal tackers. A piece of insulating absorbable sponge (Tachosil? 5  5 cm) was placed to cover the visceral surface of mesh placed at the right side of each animal. After 10 days, we performed a gross examination (by laparoscopy and laparotomy), measuring the quantity and the quality of the adhesions. Samples were taken for histopathological analysis. RESULTS Tachosil?-treated prostheses showed a statistically significant decrease in the quality of the adhesion found (p < 0.05). In addition, a smaller quantity of adhesions was identified in barrier-treated animals, although this lacked statistical significance. The histologic analysis showed no significant differences: more edema with the untreated mesh and increased angiogenesis and a lower degree of necrosis in mesh covered with Tachosil?. CONCLUSIONS The use of Tachosil? as a barrier material led to the absence of strong adhesions as it prevented direct contact between the mesh and the internal organs, preventing major problems associated with strong adhesions.","output":"Could we reduce adhesions to the intra-abdominal mesh in the first week?

OBJECTIVES To develop complete transection model of thoracic spinal cord using a polymer sheet and a microtube relevant for delayed transplantation of stem cells. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Stem cell transplantation for the regeneration of spinal cord injuries has used animal models. However, current models suffer from inflammation and leakage, which lessens their usefulness in studying delayed stem cell transplantation. METHODS Thoracic spinal cord at T9 level of adult Sprague-Dawley rats was exposed and a 50:50 sheet of poly(D,L-lactic-coglycolic acid) was inserted, exposed spinal cord was completely transected, and collagen was filled between the gap between the proximal and distal stumps of transected spinal cord. A microtube was placed and fixed between the polymer surfaces facing each other. Behavior testing, magnetic resonance imaging, and myelography were performed to characterize the new complete transection with a gap formation and polymer insertion (GAP) model and to compare the GAP model with the control models. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were transplanted into 3 models and immunohistochemistry and western blot were performed. RESULTS The inserted poly(D,L-lactic-coglycolic acid) sheet was completely disappeared 10 weeks after operation, but the inserted microtube remained firmly fixed in its original position. Myelography of the GAP model showed no leakage of contrast medium around the injured spinal cord, whereas magnetic resonance imaging of the severe contusion and simple transection models showed some leakage of contrast medium. Immunohistochemistry and western blot after hMSCs transplantation indicated that transplanted hMSCs survived and migrated well in the GAP model, and the deposition of inflammatory cells in GAP model was less than a simple transection model or severe contusion model. CONCLUSION The developed GAP model is more relevant for delayed transplantation of stem cells for the study of regeneration of spinal cord injury of rats.","output":"Development of complete thoracic spinal cord transection model in rats for delayed transplantation of stem cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a case of probable Zaire Ebola virus-related ophthalmologic complications in a physician from the United States who contracted Ebola virus disease in Liberia.

METHODS AND RESULTS We pooled individual patient data from 6 randomized trials of DAPT (EXCELLENT, OPTIMIZE, PRODIGY, RESET, SECURITY, ITALIC PLUS). The primary outcome was 1-year risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The main secondary outcome was 1-year risk of any bleeding. Out of the 11,473 randomized patients included in the pooled dataset, 3,454 (30%) were females. At 1-year follow-up, women had higher risk of MACE (3.6% vs. 2.8%; P = 0.01) but similar risk of bleeding (1.9% vs. 1.6%; P = 0.16) as compared with men. Compared with long-term DAPT, short-term DAPT was associated with similar rates of MACE in both women (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.62-1.25) and men (HR 1.25; 95% CI 0.95-1.6; P interaction = 0.08)]. At 1-year follow-up, short-term DAPT was associated with lower rates of bleeding as compared with long-term DAPT in both women (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.51-1.37) and men (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.40-0.84; P-interaction = 0.25).

Testing barriers have prohibited adequate screening for SARS-CoV-2, resulting in significant delays in commencement of treatment and outbreak control measures. This study aimed to generate evidence on the performance and implementation characteristics of the BD Veritor? Plus System rapid antigen test as compared to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in Kenya. Methods: This was a field test performance evaluation in adults undergoing testing for SARS-CoV-2. Recruited participants were classified as SARS-CoV-2-positive based on RT-PCR carried out on nasopharyngeal swabs. Antigen tests were performed with simultaneous RT-PCR on 272 participants, allowing estimation of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the rapid antigen test. Implementation characteristics were assessed. Results: : We enrolled 97 PCR negative symptomatic and 128 PCR negative asymptomatic, and 28 PCR positive symptomatic and 19 PCR positive asymptomatic participants. Compared to RT-PCR, the sensitivity of the rapid antigen test was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86.6 to 100.0) while the specificity was 98% (95% CI 96 to 100). There was no association between sensitivity and symptom status, or between the cycle threshold value and sensitivity of the BD Veritor. The rapid test had a quick turnaround time, required minimal resources, and laboratory personnel conducting testing found it easier to use than RT-PCR. The relatively high sensitivity of BD Veritor may be partially attributed to shortages of RT-PCR testing materials, resulting in specimen analysis delays and potential degradation of viral genetic material. Therefore, in resource-constrained settings, rapid antigen tests may perform better than the reference RT-PCR, resulting in prompt institution of isolation and treatment measures. Conclusion: The BD Veritor rapid antigen tests high sensitivity should be interpreted with consideration to the challenges occasioned by RT-PCR testing in resource-constrained settings.","output":"Assessment of performance and implementation characteristics of rapid point of care SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, evidence has emphasized the critical role that nurses play as public health leaders and the urgent need to prepare nurses for interprofessional collaboration in fulfilling those roles Sharing best practices in population health nursing education is especially critical now, in the era of COVID-19, when more nurses will be called to apply public health principles to patient care regardless of their work setting Although evidence from national nursing education bodies outline several critical implications for nursing curricula, undergraduate nursing programs lack operational guidance for instituting effective curricular changes to population health nursing teaching and learning The purpose of this paper is to outline the process by which a college of nursing translated this evidence into innovation through program development of a yearlong Population Health Internship (PHI) in its BSN program The inaugural PHI cohort placed 81 nursing students in 19 population health agencies to work with 64 interprofessional mentors The author details the six steps taken to operationalize the curricular innovation to enable replication by others Initial student evaluation data show participation in the PHI enables positive mentor relationships and exposes students to roles of population health nurses and the scope of their activities Community agency evaluation data indicate satisfaction with the yearlong model, noting that nursing intern contributions extended agency missions","output":"A Yearlong Population Health Internship: Operationalizing an Innovative Model for Population Health Nursing Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS) is a severe condition characterized by the coexistence of hypovolaemic shock, haemococentration, and hypoalbuminaemia, without albuminuria, that may progress to multiorgan failure and an unfavourable outcome.

The regulation aims to improve the affordability of hospital care by promoting price competition. However, a low compliance level among hospitals would compromise the operational effectiveness of this regulation. Understanding hospitals compliance status to the regulation has important implications for its enforcement effort and effectiveness assessment. OBJECTIVE: To analyze nationwide hospitals compliance status to the Hospital Price Transparency Rule. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3558 Medicare-certified general acute-care hospitals were examined. MAIN MEASURES: A binary compliance rating was generated by using data collected by Turquoise Health. Noncompliance means that no machine-readable file was posted or the posted file contains no commercial negotiated prices. Compliance means that a machine-readable file was posted with commercial negotiated prices for at least one insurance plan. KEY RESULTS: As of June 1, 2021, 55% of the 3558 Medicare-certified general acute-care hospitals we examined had not posted a machine-readable file containing commercial negotiated prices. Wide variations of compliance existed across states and hospital referral regions. A hospitals compliance status is strongly associated with the average compliance status of peer hospitals in the same market. Hospitals with greater IT preparedness, for-profit hospitals, system-affiliated hospitals, large hospitals, and non-urban hospitals had greater compliance. More concentrated hospital markets had greater average compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals take into consideration the behavior of their peers in the same market when making price disclosure decisions. Compliant hospitals are likely to have better IT preparedness, more financial resources and personnel expertise to mitigate the cost required for the implementation of the Price Transparency Rule. The compliance cost, therefore, might be a barrier for some hospitals.

However, little is known about how rural residentsa group systematically disadvantaged in Chinese societyresponded to authorities draconian restrictions. METHODS: To understand the lockdown measures and rural community responses at the grassroots level, face-to-face interviewers were conducted with both village cadres and villagers from two Henan villages in May and June 2020. The interviews were analysed with qualitative content analysis methods, with the coding process guided by the concepts of resilience, vulnerability and adaptability from the literature on disaster risk reduction. RESULTS: We found that the lockdown measures were indeed radical and disproportionate relative to the level of risk presented; however, they were largely accepted by villagers. This contradiction can be explained by two key contributing factors: (i) shared interests of individual villagers and the converged goal of government and civil society, and (ii) tacit flexibility in COVID-19 adaption strategies to tackle conflict resulting from goal diversion between citizens and local governments. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the nuances of ground-level politics. Despite their radical nature, the lockdown measures were not implemented as simple top-down coercion.

Setting: General population; 24th January 2020 - 15th August 2020 Participants: Successful linkage of 94.8% provided data on 17,173 adults with, and 195,859 without, intellectual disabilities. Outcomes: Crude rates of COVID-19 infection, severe infection (hospitalisation/death), mortality, and case-fatality; age-, sex- and deprivation-standardised severe infection and mortality ratios; annual all-cause mortality for 2020 and 2015-2019. Results: Adults with intellectual disabilities had higher rates of COVID-19 infection (957/100,000 versus 513/100,000); severe infection (549/100,000 versus 237/100,000); mortality (259/100,000 versus 114/100,000); and case-fatality (30% versus 24%). Poorer COVID-19 outcomes remained after standardising for age, sex, and deprivation: standardised severe infection ratio 2.59 (95% CI 1.80, 3.39) and mortality ratio 3.20 (95% CI 2.16, 4.25).

Dysregulation of GHR signaling is associated with various diseases and chronic conditions such as acromegaly, cancer, aging, metabolic disease, fibroses, inflammation and autoimmunity. Numerous studies entailing the GHR signaling pathway have been conducted for various cancers. Diverse factors mediate the up- or down-regulation of GHR signaling through post-translational modifications. Of the numerous modifications, ubiquitination and deubiquitination are prominent events. Ubiquitination by E3 ligase attaches ubiquitins to target proteins and induces proteasomal degradation or starts the sequence of events that leads to endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. In this review, we discuss the role of first line effectors that act directly on the GHR at the cell surface including ADAM17, JAK2, SRC family member Lyn, Ubc13/CHIP, proteasome, TrCP, CK2, STAT5b, and SOCS2. Activity of all, except JAK2, Lyn and STAT5b, counteract GHR signaling.

Here, we provide a detailed comparative analysis of NK cells and T cells in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus, focusing on the protein and gene expression of chemokine receptors known to be involved in recruitment to the lung. For this, we used 28-colour flow cytometry as well as re-analysis of a publicly available single-cell RNA-seq dataset from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Frequencies of NK cells and T cells expressing CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 were altered in peripheral blood of COVID-19 and influenza patients, in line with increased transcript expression of CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 and their respective ligands in BAL fluid.

Here, we identified 172 Cd-responsive lncRNAs and 295 differentially expressed target genes in the leaves of Populus tomentosa under Cd treatment. Functional annotation revealed that these lncRNAs involved in various processes, including photosynthesis, hormone regulation, and phenylalanine metabolism. Association studies identified 78 significant associations, representing 14 Cd-responsive lncRNAs and 28 target genes for photosynthetic and leaf physiological traits. Epistasis uncovered 83 pairwise interactions among these traits, unveiling Cd-responsive lncRNA-mediated genetic networks for photosynthesis and leaf physiology in P. tomentosa. We then focused on the roles of two Cd-responsive lncRNA-gene pairs, MSTRG.22608.1-PtoMYB73 and MSTRG.5634.1-PtoMYB27, in Cd tolerance of Populus, and detected insertions/deletions within lncRNAs as polymorphisms driving target gene expression. LncRNAs genotype analysis and heterologous overexpressing PtoMYB73 and PtoMYB27 in Arabidopsis indicated their positive effects on enhancing Cd tolerance, photosynthetic rate, and leaf growth, and the potential interaction mechanisms of PtoMYB73 with abiotic stresses.

State data are reported as of April 21, 2020; Genesis data are reported as of May 4, 2020. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The Genesis sample consisted of 341 SNFs in 25 states, including a subset of 64 SNFs that underwent universal testing of all residents. The non-Genesis sample included all other SNFs (n = 3,016) in the 12 states where Genesis operates that released the names of SNFs with outbreaks. MEASUREMENTS: For Genesis and non-Genesis SNFs: any outbreak (one or more residents testing positive for SARS-CoV-2). For Genesis SNFs only: number of confirmed cases, SNF case fatality rate, and prevalence after universal testing. RESULTS: One hundred eighteen (34.6%) Genesis SNFs and 640 (21.2%) non-Genesis SNFs had outbreaks. A difference in county prevalence of 1,000 cases per 100,000 (1%) was associated with a 33.6 percentage point (95% confidence interval (CI) = 9.6-57.7 percentage point; P = .008) difference in the probability of an outbreak for Genesis and non-Genesis SNFs combined, and a difference of 12.5 cases per facility (95% CI = 4.4-20.8 cases; P = .003) for Genesis SNFs. A 10-bed difference in facility size was associated with a 0.9 percentage point (95% CI = 0.6-1.2 percentage point; P < .001) difference in the probability of outbreak. We found no consistent relationship between Nursing Home Compare Five-Star ratings or past infection control deficiency citations and probability or severity of outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Larger SNFs and SNFs in areas of high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence are at high risk for outbreaks and must have access to universal testing to detect cases, implement mitigation strategies, and prevent further potentially avoidable cases and related complications.","output":"Variation in SARS-CoV-2 Prevalence in U.S. Skilled Nursing Facilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has triggered an unexpected digital revolution, speeding up universities' digital transformation worldwide. It has brought heavy disruptions to travel and mobility worldwide, but it drives the opportunity for hosting region\\\\wide or even international academic exchanges through learning programs, workshops, and conferences via an alternative online mode. This study reports on a case study of a 1\\\\month online aviation learning program that engaged 108 university students from Mainland China and Hong Kong during the lockdown. At first, we first recruited students in Hong Kong;however, the program registration was unsatisfactory. This could be attributed to the students' perceived future aviation career prospects and readiness of emergent remote teaching during the pandemic. In the program, we designed an alternative blended learning approach to attract students to sustain their aviation learning. First, we transformed the activities from face\\\\to\\\\face (F2F) to online settings using digital technologies including flight simulation and virtual visits in a web\\\\conferencing environment. Second, we extended the reach of the event and attracted a larger audience in the neighbouring regions in Mainland China. It turned out that we could successfully recruit 108 students from 20 cities. In the end, students' interviews and motivational surveys indicated that this online learning experience could effectively enhance students' knowledge and motivational gain. Since the government has relaxed the policy of homeschooling, we organised two F2F meetings for students in Hong Kong to connect them together. This blended mode of teaching favoured the students in Hong Kong who showed a greater motivation than those in Mainland China. Furthermore, follow\\\\up interviews for teachers revealed how they invest in new technological equipment and knowledge to support the radical changes. Overall, the virtual event eliminates geographical barriers which successfully motivate a larger audience and gain some online collaboration between universities. This article offered useful evidence for engineering educators to reflect on online informal learning, lab settings and academic exchanges, and motivate more students to revitalise aviation education and industry. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Emergency remote teaching (ERT) caused a temporary shift of instructional delivery to an alternate online mode due to crisis circumstances. After months, educators gained rich online teaching experience and resources, and developed strategies to digitally transform teaching online. During the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, many aviation educators were facing various teaching challenges due to the industry downturn and motivation problems. Although prior research had explored the potential of hands\\\\on activities such as flight simulation and online learning in university settings, few studies have examined students' motivations for online aviation learning, few studies discussed how these technologies are digitally transformed to a blended learning environment. What this paper adds The pandemic drastically affected students' learning in almost every discipline, but in seriously affected industries such as aviation and tourism, extra efforts are needed to investigate how educators support students to sustain their learning and recover the related industries. Motivation questionnaires and interviews were conducted to paint an initial picture of an online aviation education program across university students from Hong Kong and Mainland China.

RNA viruses have compact multifunctional genomes that frequently contain overlapping genes and non-coding functional elements embedded within protein-coding sequences. Overlapping features often escape detection because it can be difficult to disentangle the multiple roles of the constituent nucleotides via mutational analyses, while high-throughput experimental techniques are often unable to distinguish functional elements from incidental features. However, RNA viruses evolve very rapidly so that, even within a single species, substitutions rapidly accumulate at neutral or near-neutral sites providing great potential for comparative genomics to distinguish the signature of purifying selection. Computationally identified features can then be efficiently targeted for experimental analysis. Here we analyze alignments of protein-coding virus sequences to identify regions where there is a statistically significant reduction in the degree of variability at synonymous sites, a characteristic signature of overlapping functional elements. Having previously tested this technique by experimental verification of discoveries in selected viruses, we now analyze sequence alignments for 700 RNA virus species to identify hundreds of such regions, many of which have not been previously described.","output":"Mapping overlapping functional elements embedded within the protein-coding regions of RNA viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The majority of patients undergoing Orthotopic Liver Transplantation (OLT) have increased in age, therefore chronological age may have become an unreliable parameter for supporting clinical decisions.

No Frailty Index (FI) tailored specifically for OLT patients exists to date. Forty-three consecutive OLT patients with  20 years of survival with a functioning graft were included in our study. The FI was computed taking to account 39 items (FI-39), meeting the standard criteria for internal validation. Endpoints were polypharmacy, and recent Emergency Room admission. The mean age of our population was 69 (sd 9) years. The mean FI-39 was 0.23 (sd 0.1).

Our objective was to assess existing frameworks for healthy ageing and to identify commonly described factors that can potentially act as determinants of healthy ageing. METHODS: We carried out a systematic review by searching five electronic databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane, PsychINFO, and CINAHL) from January 2010 to November 2020 to capture contemporary evidence. Eligible studies needed to report a clear framework of healthy ageing in humans, within one or more of three domains (physical, mental/cognitive, social), in English. No restriction was placed on geographical location. Retrospective studies, studies that did not report a framework of healthy ageing, and studies with a focus on diagnostic measures were excluded. RESULTS: Of 3329 identified records, nine studies met our eligibility criteria and were included. Most of the studies were qualitative or cross sectional, and a majority were carried out in Asia, followed by North America, Australia, and Africa. The ten determinants identified for healthy ageing include physical activity, diet, self-awareness, outlook/attitude, life-long learning, faith, social support, financial security, community engagement, and independence.

These themes are likely to develop further with additional data from subsequent interviews. There is often a dichotomy between what information is wanted by relatives towards the end of life and what people with ILD are happy to discuss.

BACKGROUND: To meet the workforce needs of nurses who care for adults with cancer, an academic-practice partnership was created in 2016. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Nursing, North Carolina Cancer Hospital and UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center collaborated to provide structured clinical and didactic practice experiences for undergraduate nursing students interested in oncology nursing. With COVID-19, nursing students were not permitted to be in the clinical setting. DESIGN: Discursive paper. METHOD: An innovative and collaborative partnership created reflective and interactive activities. The majority of the learning activities were created at the revised Bloom's taxonomy level of application or higher, with some encompassing multiple levels. Students engaged in a variety of meaningful experiences requiring multiple learning processes that promoted professional development in the interpersonal and critical thinking domains. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the challenges of COVID-19, the delivery of oncology nurse fellowship was successful because of innovative virtual strategies.

A sample of 351 Chinese school teachers retrospectively reported their online TSE at the beginning and end of COVID-19 school lockdown, out of which six were followed up for an in-depth interview. TSE for online instruction did not significantly increase (? = .014, p > 0.05) whereas that for technology application increased significantly (? = .231, p < 0.01). Lack of experience in online teaching, separation of teachers from students, school administrative process and unsatisfactory student academic performance were identified as the major associated factors. A moderation effect of adaptability and teacher burnout on the change in online TSE were examined, of which passion burnout was the only significant moderator toward the change in online TSE. The study thus concluded that teachers' online TSE for technology application increased among Chinese teachers during COVID-19 school lockdown.

In trying to prepare for the future, with or without COVID-19 implications, dental providers and clinics are facing opportunities to add value, consider alternative payment models, and to incorporate risk stratification and population health management along with medical systems. However, as alternative payment models emerge in dentistry, stand-alone dental clinics may face unique challenges in trying to prepare for the future while still providing patient care in the fee for service environment. This article focuses on a 6-months pilot project of how implementing a comprehensive caries disease management care model, evaluating caries risk, and implementing risk stratification strategies can prepare dental offices for future payment models and inclusion in the greater health system. There are two overall goals for this pilot. First, applying a caries disease management protocol to every patient visit, regardless of reimbursement. Second, applying quality improvement (QI) principles to change how a dental office approaches care delivery.

Multiple studies have examined changes in population levels of smoking at the start of the pandemic. However, conclusions remain mixed due to the high proportion of studies with poor methods and short follow-up periods. MethodsThis study used longitudinal data from the UKHLS COVID-19 study to derive smoking trajectories among 4,130 UK adults aged 35-64 across four time points over the first year of the pandemic (2018-19, April 2020, September 2020, and January 2021). Random-effects models were used to examine subject-specific changes across time points. ResultsBetween the pre-pandemic estimate and January 2021, there was a significant decline in smoking from 14.8% to 13.1% (PR = 0.89, 95%CI 0.83-0.95). The number of cigarettes smoked per day among smokers increased in April 2020 (B = 0.5, 95%CI 0.0, 1.0) and September 2020 (B = 1.0, 95%CI 0.4, 1.5), but declined back to pre-pandemic levels in January 2021 (B = 0.3, 95%CI -0.3, 0.8). These changes did not vary by sex, ethnicity, relationship status, education, occupation, or household income. ConclusionAmong UK adults aged 35-64, there has been a slight decrease in smoking which was maintained up to January 2021. Whereas there was an increase in cigarette consumption among smokers at the start of the pandemic, this was no longer observable in January 2021. The findings support the argument that the first year of the pandemic is unlikely to have had a negative effect of most middle-aged adult smokers trajectory.","output":"Smoking trajectories over the first year of the pandemic in UK middle-aged adults: evidence from the UKHLS COVID-19 study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Percutaneous image guided thermal ablation has become a cornerstone of therapy for patients with oligometastatic disease and primary liver malignancies Evolving from percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), thermal ablation utilizing radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) have become the standard approach in the treatment of isolated lesions that fit within the size criteria for curative intent therapy (typically 3-4cm) With the evolution of more intense thermal ablation, such as MWA, the dramatic increase in both the size of ablation zone and intensity of heat generation have extended the limits of this technique As a result of these innovations, intra-procedural and post-procedural pain have also significantly increased, requiring either higher levels of intravenous sedation or, in some institutions, general anesthesia In addition to the increase in therapeutic intensity, the use of intravenous sedation during aggressive ablation procedures carries the risk of over-sedation when the noxious insult (i e the ablation) is removed, adding further difficulty to post-procedural recovery and management Furthermore, high subdiaphragmatic lesions become challenging in this setting due to issues relating to sedation and compliance with breath hold/breathing instructions Although general anesthesia may mitigate these complications, the added resources associated with providing general anesthesia during ablation is not cost effective and may result in substantial delays in treatment The reduction of Aerosol Generating Medical Procedures (AGMP), such as intubation due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, must also be taken into consideration Due to the potential increased risk of infection transmission, alternatives to general anesthesia should be considered when safe and possible Upper abdominal regional nerve block techniques have been used to manage pain related to trauma, surgery, and cancer;however, blocks of this nature are not well described in the interventional radiology literature The McGill University group has developed experience in using such blocks as splanchnic, celiac and hepatic hilar nerve blocks to provide peri-procedural pain control [1] Since incorporating these techniques (along with hydrodissection with tumescent anesthesia), we have also observed in our high volume ablation center a dramatic decrease in the amount of sedatives administered during the procedure, a decrease in patient discomfort during localization and ablation, as well as decreased pain post-procedure Faster time to discharge and overall reduction in room procedural time serve as added benefits The purpose of this publication is to outline and illustrate the practical application and use of nerve block/regional anesthesia techniques with respect to percutaneous hepatic thermal ablation","output":"Optimized nerve block techniques while performing percutaneous hepatic ablation: Literature review and practical use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Faith community nurses receive additional education in holistic health and intentional spiritual care, including self-caring.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically review evidence for the risk factors of COVID-19 patients progressing to critical illness. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We conducted a comprehensive search for primary literature in both Chinese and English electronic bibliographic databases. The American agency for health research and quality tool was used for quality assessment. A meta-analysis was undertaken using STATA version 15.0. RESULTS: Twenty articles (4062 patients) were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. First and foremost, we observed that elderly male patients with a high body mass index, high breathing rate and a combination of underlying diseases (such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were more likely to develop severe COVID-19 infections. Second, compared with non-severe patients, severe patients had more serious symptoms such as fever and dyspnea. Besides, abnormal laboratory tests were more prevalent in severe patients than in mild cases, such as elevated levels of white blood cell counts, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, as well as decreased levels of lymphocytes and albumin.

It causes fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue up to dyspnoea, responsible for hospitalization and artificial oxygenation. SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells using ACE2, the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro ). Once bound to ACE2 and the other two proteases in concert they allow the virus replication and spread throughout the body. Our attention has been focused on the role of ACE2 as its binding to by the virus increases bradykinin and its metabolites, which facilitate inflammation in the lung (causing cough and fever), coagulation and the complement system. These three systems are involved in angioedema, cardiovascular dysfunction and sepsis, pathologies which occur in COVID-19 patients. Thus, we propose that blocking the kallikrein-kinin system with lanadelumab, approved for hereditary angioedema, will prevent facilitation of these 3 systems.

Accumulating evidence shows that the oxytocin-receptor genotype may play a role in differential susceptibility to early-life adversity, but no studies have examined whether this moderation extends to the prenatal stress exposures. METHODS In the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study, a sample of 1173 mother-child dyads were examined. We studied the possible moderating effect of the cumulative effect of infant oxytocin-receptor risk genotypes (rs53576GG and rs2254298A) in the association between maternal prenatal stress, and infant negative reactivity and emerging self-regulation at 6 months of age. RESULTS The number of OTr risk genotypes moderated the association between maternal prenatal anxiety and infant self-regulation, implying a cumulative effect of genotype, although effects sizes were small. In infants with two risk genotypes, a negative association between prenatal anxiety and self-regulation was observed, whereas in infants with one or no risk genotypes, the association between maternal prenatal anxiety and temperament was non-significant. CONCLUSION Oxytocin-receptor genotype may moderate the association of maternal stress during pregnancy and child social-emotional development. Possible mechanisms for this moderation effect are discussed. Further studies with a more comprehensive polygenic approach are needed to confirm these results.","output":"Oxytocin receptor genotype moderates the association between maternal prenatal stress and infant early self-regulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New technologies are assuming a prominent role in the transformation of economic and social systems and are capturing the interest of many businesses and international institutions.

Older adults with Alzheimer disease (AD) are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID\\\\19. It is unknown how COVID\\\\19 affects the mobility patterns of older adults with preclinical AD. Since before the pandemic, we have been monitoring the driving behaviors of older adults, enabling us to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on individuals with and without preclinical AD. METHOD: We used in\\\\vehicle Global Positioning System (GPS) devices to study driving behaviors of 115 older adults enrolled in the DRIVES study (aged 65+) from 1/1/2019 to 31/12/2020. The cohort included 62 individuals with preclinical AD (PreAD) and 53 without preclinical AD (CTL), as determined by cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. All participants completed an online survey about their overall experiences during the pandemic. Using the GPS data, we determined the average monthly distance travelled, and the number of visitations to destinations categorized as food shopping, place of worship, restaurant, leisure, or health. All measures were computed monthly. RESULT: oth groups experienced an approximate 40% decline in average monthly distance travelled overall after the start of the pandemic (PreAD: 1287.92 to 783.38 km vs. CTL: 1751.26 to 1053.29 km). Visits to places of worship, restaurants, leisure and health places declined by 70%, 46%, 23%, and 23% for the PreAD group, and by 48%, 31%, 48%, and 22% for the CTL group, respectively. However, the pandemic did not result in a significant decline in Food Shopping among either of the groups. Overall, compared to the CTL group, the PreAD group experienced a higher level of stress in response to the recommendations for socially distancing (p<0.01), more uncertainty about their risk of COVID\\\\19 (p<0.05), more decline in trips for worship (p<0.05) and less decline in trips for leisure (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate decreased mobility in all older adults during the pandemic, with the preclinical AD group exhibiting more decline in trips to places of worship, less decline in leisure activities, and increased stress and uncertainty in response to COVID\\\\19.","output":"COVID\\\\19 and preclinical Alzheimer disease: Driving, mobility, activity and experiences of older adults in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Essa  uma produo do Departamento de Cincia e Tecnologia (Decit) da Secretaria de Cincia, Tecnologia, Inovao e Insumos Estratgicos em Sade (SCTIE) do Ministrio da Sade (Decit/SCTIE/MS), que tem como miss?o promover a cincia e tecnologia e o uso de evidncias cientficas para a tomada de decis?o do SUS, tendo como principal atribuio o incentivo ao desenvolvimento de pesquisas em sade no Brasil, de modo a direcionar os investimentos realizados em pesquisa pelo Governo Federal s necessidades de sade pblica Informar sobre as principais evidncias cientficas descritas na literatura internacional sobre tratamento farmacolgico para a COVID-19 Alm de resumir cada estudo identificado, o informe apresenta tambm uma avaliao da qualidade metodolgica e a quantidade de artigos publicados, de acordo com a sua classificao metodolgica (revis?es sistemticas, ensaios clnicos randomizados, entre outros) Foram encontrados 9 artigos","output":"Informe dirio de evidncias COVID-19: busca realizada em 27 de abril de 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern has been reported recently which were linked to increased transmission.

Without this personal protective equipment, healthcare providers, essential workers, and the general public are exposed to the risk of infection. In light of the aforementioned, it is critical to balance the supply and demand for masks. COVID-19 will also ensure that masks are always considered as an essential commodity in future pandemic preparedness. Moreover, billions of facemasks are produced from petrochemicals derived raw materials, which are non-degradable upon disposal after their single use, thus causing environmental pollution and damage. The sustainable way forward is to utilise raw materials that are side-stream products of local industries to develop facemasks having equal or better efficiency than the conventional ones. In this regard, wheat gluten biopolymer, which is a by-product or co-product of cereal industries, can be electrospun into nanofibre membranes and subsequently carbonised at over 700 C to form a network structure, which can simultaneously act as the filter media and reinforcement for gluten-based masks. In parallel, the same gluten material can be processed into cohesive thin films using plasticiser and hot press. Additionally, lanosol, a naturally-occurring substance, imparts fire (V-0 rating in vertical burn test), and microbe resistance in gluten plastics. Thus, thin films of flexible gluten with very low amounts of lanosol (<10 wt%) can be bonded together with the carbonised mat and shaped by thermoforming to create the facemasks. The carbon mat acting as the filter can be attached to the masks through adapters that can also be made from injection moulded gluten.

Most existing methods tend to define the adjacency matrix among samples manually based on meta-features, and then obtain the node embeddings for downstream tasks by Graph Representation Learning (GRL). However, it is not easy for these approaches to generalize to unseen samples. Meanwhile, the complex correlation between modalities is also ignored. As a result, these factors inevitably yield the inadequacy of providing valid information about the patient's condition for a reliable diagnosis. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Multimodal Graph Learning framework (MMGL) for disease prediction. To effectively exploit the rich information across multi-modality associated with diseases, amodal-attentional multi-modal fusion is proposed to integrate the features of each modality by leveraging the correlation and complementarity between the modalities. Furthermore, instead of defining the adjacency matrix manually as existing methods, the latent graph structure can be captured through a novel way of adaptive graph learning. It could be jointly optimized with the prediction model, thus revealing the intrinsic connections among samples. Unlike the previous transductive methods, our model is also applicable to the scenario of inductive learning for those unseen data. An extensive group of experiments on two disease prediction problems is then carefully designed and presented, demonstrating that MMGL obtains more favorable performances. In addition, we also visualize and analyze the learned graph structure to provide more reliable decision support for doctors in real medical applications and inspiration for disease research.","output":"Multi-modal Graph Learning for Disease Prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hydroxychloroquine is an immunomodulatory agent used primarily in malaria, lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis The authors summarize the potential proarrhythmic effect of this formulation and the key signs of drug-induced long QT syndrome The topicality of the present summary is given by the more frequent use of hydroxychloroquine (currently without evidence) in the COVID-19 epidemic Orv Hetil 2020;161 (17): 689-691","output":"[The risk of acquired long QT syndrome during a coronavirus epidemic.

We aim to establish a gold standard of care by systematically analysing symptom clusters and current practices, iteratively improving pathways and systems of care, and working to disseminate better practices. Methods and analysis: This mixed-method, multi-site study is informed by the principles of applied health services research, quality improvement, co-design, and learning health systems. It was developed in close partnership with patients (whose stated priorities are prompt clinical assessment; evidence-based advice and treatment; and help with returning to work and other roles) and with front-line clinicians. Workstreams and tasks to optimise assessment, treatment and monitoring are based in three contrasting settings: [1] specialist management in 10 long COVID clinics across the UK, via a quality improvement collaborative, experience-based co-design and targeted efforts to reduce inequalities of access; [2] patient self-management at home, with technology-supported monitoring; and [3] generalist management in primary care, harnessing electronic record data to study population phenotypes and develop evidence-based decision support, referral pathways and prioritisation criteria across the primary-secondary care interface, along with analysis of costs.

Nevertheless there are currently no publicly available transcriptome reference sequences or genome for this species. RESULTS: A cDNA library derived from mRNA and snRNA isolated and pooled from the brains, lungs, spleens, kidneys, livers, and hearts of three adult female Syrian hamsters was sequenced. Sequence reads were assembled into 62,482 contigs and 111,796 reads remained unassembled (singletons). This combined contig/singleton dataset, designated as the Syrian hamster transcriptome, represents a total of 60,117,204 nucleotides. Our Mesocricetus auratus Syrian hamster transcriptome mapped to 11,648 mouse transcripts representing 9,562 distinct genes, and mapped to a similar number of transcripts and genes in the rat. We identified 214 quasi-complete transcripts based on mouse annotations. Canonical pathways involved in a broad spectrum of fundamental biological processes were significantly represented in the library. The Syrian hamster transcriptome was aligned to the current release of the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transcriptome and genome to improve the genomic annotation of this species. Finally, our Syrian hamster transcriptome was aligned against 14 other rodents, primate and laurasiatheria species to gain insights about the genetic relatedness and placement of this species. CONCLUSIONS: This Syrian hamster transcriptome dataset significantly improves our knowledge of the Syrian hamster's transcriptome, especially towards its future use in infectious disease research. Moreover, this library is an important resource for the wider scientific community to help improve genome annotation of the Syrian hamster and other closely related species.

In the present study, we aimed to provide a statistical characterization of COVID-19 transmissions that led to this small outbreak. We collated the individual data of the first 28 confirmed cases reported from 20 January to 10 February 2020. We estimated key epidemiological parameters such as reporting delay (i.e., time from symptom onset to confirmation), incubation period, and serial interval by fitting probability distributions to the data based on the maximum likelihood estimation. We also estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) using the renewal equation, which allows for the transmissibility to differ between imported and locally transmitted cases. There were 16 imported and 12 locally transmitted cases, and secondary transmissions per case were higher for the imported cases than the locally transmitted cases (nine vs. three cases). The mean reporting delays were estimated to be 6.76 days (95% CI: 4.53, 9.28) and 2.57 days (95% CI: 1.57, 4.23) for imported and locally transmitted cases, respectively. The mean incubation period was estimated to be 5.53 days (95% CI: 3.98, 8.09) and was shorter than the mean serial interval of 6.45 days (95% CI: 4.32, 9.65). The R0 was estimated to be 0.40 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.99), accounting for the local and imported cases. The fewer secondary cases and shorter reporting delays for the locally transmitted cases suggest that contact tracing of imported cases was effective at reducing further transmissions, which helped to keep R0 below one and the overall transmissions small.","output":"Subcritical Transmission in the Early Stage of COVID-19 in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is rare for children to be in serious condition or die from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) except for those with underlying diseases such as chronic lung disease (including asthma), cardiovascular disease, and immunosuppressive disease.

However, in many cases, performance has not been clinically validated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of commercial AI solutions in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia from other lung conditions. METHODS: Four commercial AI solutions were evaluated on a dual-center clinical dataset consisting of 500 CT studies; COVID-19 pneumonia was microbiologically proven in 50 of these. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and AUC were calculated. In a subgroup analysis, the performance of the AI solutions in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia from other conditions was evaluated in CT studies with ground-glass opacities (GGOs). RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity ranges were 62C96% and 31C80%, respectively. Negative and positive predictive values ranged between 82C99% and 19C25%, respectively. AUC was in the range 0.54C0.79. In CT studies with GGO, sensitivity remained unchanged. However, specificity was lower, and ranged between 15 and 53%. AUC for studies with GGO was in the range 0.54C0.69. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the variable specificity and low positive predictive value of AI solutions in diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia in chest CT. However, one solution yielded acceptable values for sensitivity. Thus, with further improvement, commercial AI solutions currently under development have the potential to be integrated as alert tools in clinical routine workflow.

All probable SARS cases were isolated in negative-pressure rooms. Twenty-six HCWs worked in the ultra high-risk area caring for SARS patients and 88 HCWs managed non-SARS patients in other ward areas. None of the HCWs developed clinical features suggestive of SARS. In addition, there was no nosocomial spread of SARS-associated coronavirus to other patients or visitors during this period. In conclusion, stringent infection control precautions, appropriate triage and prompt isolation of potential SARS patients may have contributed to a lack of nosocomial spread and HCW acquisition of SARS in our unit.","output":"Infection control for SARS in a tertiary paediatric centre in Hong Kong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread worldwide recently, leading to global social and economic disruption.

Here, we attempt to computationally screen for possible medications for COVID-19 via rapidly estimating the highly potential inhibitors from an FDA-approved drug database against the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. The approach combined molecular docking and fast pulling of ligand (FPL) simulations that were demonstrated to be accurate and suitable for quick prediction of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. The results suggested that twenty-seven compounds were capable of strongly associating with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Among them, the seven top leads are daclatasvir, teniposide, etoposide, levoleucovorin, naldemedine, cabozantinib, and irinotecan.

The survey was emailed to the Fall Voice Community on Doc Matter and to members of the American Broncho\\\\Esophagological Association (ABEA) from May to June 2020. RESULTS: Eighty\\\\two respondents were analyzed (response rate: 10%). Respondents represented diverse locations, including international. Most reported academic (71%) or private practices (16%), laryngology fellowship training (76%), and a significant practice devotion to laryngology and broncho\\\\esophagology. During the early re\\\\introduction, most continued to perform all procedure categories. The office was preferred to the OR setting for most, though 36% preferred the OR for laser procedures.

The present study evaluates the effectiveness of different types of commercial iron nanoparticles (nanoscale zero valent iron (nZVI), bimetallic nZVI-Pd, and nano-magnetite (nFe3O4)), for the remediation of an industrial soil co-contaminated with Cr and PCBs. Soil samples were mixed with nZVI, nZVI-Pd, or nFe3O4 at doses selected according to their reactivity with PCBs, homogenized, saturated with water and incubated at controlled conditions for 15, 45 and 70 days. For each sampling time, PCBs and chromium were analyzed in aqueous and soil fractions. Cr(VI) and Cr leachability (TCLP test) were determined in the soil samples. The treatment with the three types of iron nanoparticles showed significant reduction in Cr concentration in aqueous extracts at the three sampling times (> 98%), compared to the control samples. The leachability of Cr in treated soil samples also decreased and was stable throughout the experiment. Results suggested that nZVI and nZVI-Pd immobilized Cr through adsorption of Cr(VI) on the shell and reduction to Cr(III). The mechanism of interaction of nFe3O4 and Cr(VI) included adsorption and reduction although its reducing character was lower than those of ZVI nanoparticles. PCBs significantly decreased in soil samples (up to 68%), after 15 days of treatment with the three types of nanoparticles. However, nFe3O4 evidenced reversible adsorption of PCBs after 45 days. In general, nZVI-Pd reduced PCB concentration in soil faster than nZVI. Control soils showed a similar reduction in PCBs concentration as those obtained with nZVI and nZVI-Pd after a longer time (45 days). This is likely due to natural bioremediation, although it was not effective for Cr remediation. Results suggest that the addition of nZVI or nZVI-Pd and pseudo-anaerobic conditions could be used for the recovery of soil co-contaminated with Cr and PCBs.","output":"Iron nanoparticles to recover a co-contaminated soil with Cr and PCBs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most frequent adult-onset motor neuron disorder. The disease is characterized by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to death usually within five years after the onset of symptoms. While most cases are sporadic, 5%-10% of cases can be associated with familial inheritance, including ALS type 6, which is associated with mutations in the Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) gene. This work aimed to evaluate how the most frequent ALS-related mutations in FUS, R521C, R521H, and P525L affect the protein structure and function. We used prediction algorithms to analyze the effects of the non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms and performed evolutionary conservation analysis, protein frustration analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations. Most of the prediction algorithms classified the three mutations as deleterious. All three mutations were predicted to reduce protein stability, especially the mutation R521C, which was also predicted to increase chaperone binding tendency. The protein frustration analysis showed an increase in frustration in the interactions involving the mutated residue 521C. Evolutionary conservation analysis showed that residues 521 and 525 of human FUS are highly conserved sites. The molecular dynamics results indicate that protein stability could be compromised in all three mutations. They also affected the exposed surface area and protein compactness. The analyzed mutations also displayed high flexibility in most residues in all variants, most notably in the interaction site with the nuclear import protein of FUS.","output":"Molecular dynamics and protein frustration analysis of human fused in Sarcoma protein variants in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis type 6: An In Silico approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic likely exacerbated caregiving challenges for caregivers of parents diagnosed with a blood cancer. Providing care during a public health crisis presents a complex web of uncertainties regarding cancer care, personal health, and COVID-19 risk. Identifying caregivers uncertainty experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic can be a first step in learning where to direct resources or alter policies to ensure that they can not only perform their caregiver role but also cope in health-promoting ways. Using uncertainty management theory, this study explored how the pandemic has impacted adult child caregivers experiences caring for a parent diagnosed with a blood cancer, as well as their experiences of uncertainty and uncertainty management. As part of a larger study on blood cancer caregivers needs, a survey was administered from March 30 to June 1, 2020, to recruit caregivers through the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. A qualitative and quantitative content analysis was conducted on open-ended responses from 84 caregivers. Caregivers described changes illustrating the complexity of providing care during a pandemic: (a) increased fears and uncertainty-related distress, b) reduced in-person care opportunities, (c) increased isolation, and (d) enhanced family communication. Caregivers with parents diagnosed with acute blood cancers used significantly more uncertainty management strategies and had more sources of uncertainty than caregivers with parents living with chronic blood cancer types. Findings highlight the need for supportive services to help caregivers manage uncertainty and improve their capacity to provide care in an unpredictable global health crisis.

New evidence indicates that irisin protects the heart against myocardial ischemic injury. However, whether irisin enhances cardiac progenitor cell (CPC)-induced cardiac repair remains unknown. This study examines the effect of irisin on CPC-induced cardiac repair when these cells are introduced into the infarcted myocardium. Nkx2.5+ CPC stable cells were isolated from mouse embryonic stem cells. Nkx2.5 + CPCs (0.5  10 6 ) were reintroduced into the infarcted myocardium using PEGlylated fibrin delivery. The mouse myocardial infarction model was created by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Nkx2.5 + CPCs were pretreated with irisin at a concentration of 5 ng/ml in vitro for 24 hr before transplantation. Myocardial functions were evaluated by echocardiographic measurement. Eight weeks after engraftment, Nkx2.5 + CPCs improved ventricular function as evident by an increase in ejection fraction and fractional shortening. These findings are concomitant with the suppression of cardiac hypertrophy and attenuation of myocardial interstitial fibrosis. Transplantation of Nkx2.5 + CPCs promoted cardiac regeneration and neovascularization, which were increased with the pretreatment of Nkx2.5 + CPCs with irisin. Furthermore, irisin treatment promoted myocyte proliferation as indicated by proliferative markers Ki67 and phosphorylated histone 3 and decreased apoptosis. Additionally, irisin resulted in a marked reduction of histone deacetylase 4 and increased p38 acetylation in cultured CPCs. These results indicate that irisin promoted Nkx2.5 + CPC-induced cardiac regeneration and functional improvement and that irisin serves as a novel therapeutic approach for stem cells in cardiac repair.","output":"Irisin promotes cardiac progenitor cell-induced myocardial repair and functional improvement in infarcted heart."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What explains the variation in how states collectively deal with public health challenges across different regions? We tackle this puzzle by comparing the regional health governance efforts pursued within the Central American Integration System (SICA) and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR). We show that Central America's health governance has been driven by external actors, whereas South America's was driven by states within the region, and remained insulated from external actors influence. We argue that the explanation for such variation lies in the interplay of state capacity and regional leadership. In Central America, weak state capacity combined with the absence of a regional leader willing to provide governance resources. This opened up space for external actors to contribute actively to regional health governance, complementing the governance of Central American governments. In South America, Brazil's regional leadership mobilised neighbouring states capacities by promoting a South-South cooperation agenda based on intra-regional exchanges among national health bureaucracies, which, however, proved vulnerable to intergovernmental conflicts.

Psychological readiness has been associated with improved patient reported outcomes as well as RTS rates in young athletes. The COVID-19 pandemic may have altered the typical recovery process for patients undergoing ACLR. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: To compare 6-month postoperative levels of psychological readiness to RTS in ACLR patients before and during the pandemic. METHODS: Patients were prospectively enrolled 6 months after primary ACLR at a single academic sports medicine practice, from December 2018 until May 2021. Patients were categorized into pre-COVID (enrollment prior to March 13, 2020) and COVID groups (March 13, 2020 - May 26, 2021). Demographic information, outcomes scores including the ACL-Return to Sport after Injury Scale (RSI) and PROMIS Psychological Stress Experiences (PROMIS-PSE), and physician RTS clearance were obtained and compared for both groups. Comparisons were performed utilizing Chi-square, Students t-tests and linear regression. A matched analysis was conducted between groups controlling for age, sex, and graft type. RESULTS: 231 patients were included in the present study (89 males, 142 females; mean age 16.9 years), with 76% (176/231) in the pre-COVID group and 24% (55/231) in the COVID group. There were no significant differences in age and sex between the two population cohorts. There was a significant difference in time from surgery to enrollment in the COVID group compared to the pre-COVID group (7.1 vs 6.2 months, p<0.001). In the matched cohort (n=126, 37/126 COVID group), the COVID group was cleared earlier by their physician to RTS compared to the pre-COVID group (6.9 months vs 8.5 months, p<0.001). While there was no significant difference between groups in 6 month ACL-RSI scores (63.8 pre-COVID vs 66.6 COVID, p=0.48), both groups yielded globally low scores. There were no significant associations between matched groups in PROMIS-PSE (p=0.71), IKDC (p=0.55), Pedi-IKDC (p=0.15), and Pedi-FABS (p=0.77) scores (Table 1). CONCLUSION: Young athletes demonstrated similar levels of psychological readiness to RTS at 6 months following ACLR prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient-reported outcome scores were similar in pre-COVID and COVID ACLR patients, suggesting that the pandemic may not have played a detrimental role in perceptions of recovery. Psychological readiness may not be fully optimized at 6 months post-ACLR and young athletes may benefit from additional time and training for progressive confidence, muscle strength, and performance.","output":"Did the Covid-19 Pandemic Affect Psychological Readiness to Return-To-Sport in Young Athletes Undergoing ACL Reconstruction?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 may manifest as mild, moderate or severe disease with each grade of severity having its own features and post-viral implications.

In some tissues, Akt phosphorylates and activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) to produce nitric oxide (NO) that has anti-inflammatory effects. NO production has antibacterial and antiviral effects in the airway, and increasing NO may be a useful anti-pathogen strategy. Akt also stimulates the nuclear factor erythroid 2Crelated factor 2 (Nrf-2) transcription factor, which transcribes antioxidant genes. Therefore, we hypothesized that activation of the Akt/eNOS pathway, which also activates Nrf-2, may have protective effects in human airway cells against injury. METHODS: To directly test the effects of Akt signaling in the airway, we treated A549 and 16HBE cells as well as primary bronchial, nasal, and type II alveolar epithelial cells with small molecule Akt activator SC79. We examined the effects of SC79 on eNOS activation, NO production, Nrf-2 target levels, and interleukin-8 (IL-8) transcription during exposure to TNF- or Pseudomonas flagellin (TLR5 agonist). Additionally, airCliquid interface bronchial cultures were treated with cadmium, an oxidative stressor that causes airway barrier breakdown. RESULTS: SC79 induced a ~ twofold induction of p-eNOS and Nrf-2 protein levels blocked by PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Live cell imaging revealed SC79 increased acute NO production. Quantitative RT-PCR showed a ~ twofold increase in Nrf-2 target gene transcription. TNF- or flagellin-induced IL-8 levels were also significantly reduced with SC79 treatment. Moreover, the transepithelial electrical resistance decrease observed with cadmium was ameliorated by SC79, likely by an acute increase in tight junction protein ZO-1 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Together, the data presented here demonstrate SC79 activation of Akt induces potentially anti-pathogenic NO production, antioxidant gene transcription, reduces IL-8 transcription, and may protect against oxidative barrier dysfunction in a wide range of airway epithelial cells.

To explore whether population variants in ACE2 influence Spike binding and hence infection, we selected 10 ACE2 variants based on affinity predictions and prevalence in gnomAD and measured their affinities and kinetics for Spike receptor binding domain through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 37C. We discovered variants that reduce and enhance binding, including three ACE2 variants that strongly inhibited (p.Glu37Lys, G = C1.33  0.15 kcal mol(-1) and p.Gly352Val, predicted G = C1.17 kcal mol(-1)) or abolished (p.Asp355Asn) binding. We also identified two variants with distinct population distributions that enhanced affinity for Spike. ACE2 p.Ser19Pro (G = 0.59  0.08 kcal mol(-1)) is predominant in the gnomAD African cohort (AF = 0.003) whilst p.Lys26Arg (G = 0.26  0.09 kcal mol(-1)) is predominant in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AF = 0.01) and European non-Finnish (AF = 0.006) cohorts. We compared ACE2 variant affinities to published SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype infectivity data and confirmed that ACE2 variants with reduced affinity for Spike can protect cells from infection. The effect of variants with enhanced Spike affinity remains unclear, but we propose a mechanism whereby these alleles could cause greater viral spreading across tissues and cell types, as is consistent with emerging understanding regarding the interplay between receptor affinity and cell-surface abundance. Finally, we compared mCSM-PPI2 G predictions against our SPR data to assess the utility of predictions in this system. We found that predictions of decreased binding were well-correlated with experiment and could be improved by calibration, but disappointingly, predictions of highly enhanced binding were unreliable. Recalibrated predictions for all possible ACE2 missense variants at the Spike interface were calculated and used to estimate the overall burden of ACE2 variants on Covid-19.","output":"Missense variants in human ACE2 strongly affect binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike providing a mechanism for ACE2 mediated genetic risk in Covid-19: A case study in affinity predictions of interface variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease of unknown etiology, primarily affecting the joints, then extra-articular manifestations can occur. Due to its complexity, which is based on an incompletely elucidated pathophysiological mechanism, good RA management requires a multidisciplinary approach. The clinical status of RA patients has improved in recent years due to medical advances in diagnosis and treatment, that have made it possible to reduce disease activity and prevent systemic complications. The most promising results were obtained by developing disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the class to which conventional synthetic, biologic, and targeted synthetic drugs belong. Furthermore, ongoing drug development has led to obtaining molecules with improved efficacy and safety profiles, but further research is needed until RA turns into a curable pathology. In the present work, we offer a comprehensive perspective on the management of RA, by centralizing the existing data provided by significant literature, emphasizing the importance of an early and accurate diagnosis associated with optimal personalized treatment in order to achieve better outcomes for RA patients.

Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent 2019-nCoV, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging 2019-nCoV.","output":"Functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for lineage B -coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 infection causes a wide range of clinical manifestations. Though the exact mechanism through which COVID-19 affects each system remains poorly understood, the development of a cytokine-mediated systemic inflammatory response could explain the virus's multi-system impact. The effect of COVID-19 on the central nervous system is now well recognized. We present a case of COVID-19 with neuropsychiatric symptoms and accelerated worsening of chronic conditions. CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis and depression presented with confusion, hallucinations, and extremity stiffness. Two months ago, he was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia. Since then, he has experienced inability to walk, hallucinatory episodes, and insomnia. Episodes are recurrent with a return to baseline over 24 to 48 hours. He ultimately became non-ambulatory due to worsened joint deformities. On presentation, he was delirious with word repetition, inappropriate response to questions, and was profusely diaphoretic. Extremities were rigid and held in a semi-flexed position. Brisk reflexes were noted in lower extremities. There was no neck stiffness. Vitals and labs were stable. COVID-19 test negative. Non-contrast head CT showed subtle white matter changes. Brain MRI was unrevealing. EEG was mildly abnormal with diffuse background slowing, limited findings due to motion artifact. His symptoms considerably improved overnight, however, he continued to have episodes of disorientation and visual hallucinations with no time-of-day preference. He was managed with a low dose of Seroquel. Neurology diagnosed COVID-19 cerebritis with post-infection sequalae. Patient was referred for long-term physical therapy and rehabilitation. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic created a paradigm shift in global health practices. Initially assumed to mainly affect the respiratory system with symptoms ranging from a mild flu-like illness to an ARDS phenotype, there is now literature evidence of disseminated disease. COVID-19 related encephalopathy occurs in 8.7% hospitalized patients, who are also more likely to have underlying medical co-morbidities. Other neurologic presentations include headache, generalized weakness, motor neuron disease, neuropathy, and seizures. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as personality changes and hallucinations are commonly described in other coronavirus outbreaks. They are now seen in active COVID-19 infection and in the post infectious phase, termed Long-COVID syndrome. Also, this patient with underlying rheumatoid arthritis experienced accelerated disability, likely immune mediated. Timely evaluation, intervention and long-term rehabilitation can improve functional outcomes in these patients.

We found that N influences both the maximum number of actively infected cases and the date on which the maximum number of actively infected cases is reached. The high effect of N on maximum actively infected cases and peak date suggests the necessity of isolating the infected cases in a small community. The protection rate and average quarantined time are most sensitive to the infected populations, with a summation of their first-order sensitivity indices greater than 0.585, and their interactions are also substantial, being 0.389 and 0.334, respectively.

Electricity markets are central for the coordination of electric power generation. These markets rely evermore on short-term trading to facilitate the balancing of power generation and demand and to enable systems integration of small producers. Electricity prices in these spot markets show pronounced fluctuations, featuring extreme peaks as well as occasional negative prices. In this article, we analyse electricity price time series from the European EPEX market, in particular the hourly day-ahead, hourly intraday, and 15-min intraday market prices. We quantify the fluctuations, correlations, and extreme events and reveal different time scales in the dynamics of the market. The short-term fluctuations show remarkably different characteristics for time scales below and above 12 hours. Fluctuations are strongly correlated and persistent below 12 hours, which contributes to extreme price events and a strong multifractal behaviour. On longer time scales, they get anti-correlated and price time series revert to their mean, witnessed by a stark decrease of the Hurst coefficient after 12 hours. The long-term behaviour is strongly influenced by the evolution of a large-scale weather patterns with a typical time scale of four days. We elucidate this dependence in detail using a classification into circulation weather types. The separation in time scales enables a superstatistical treatment, which confirms the characteristic time scale of four days, and motivates the use of $q$-Gaussian distributions as the best fit to the empiric distribution of electricity prices.","output":"Complexity and Persistence of Price Time Series of the European Electricity Spot Market"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: In this COVID-19 epidemic, most of the countries are facing issues regarding health care from the points of management, academic, and treatment.

Materials and Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted on 336 undergraduate medical students 61 medical faculty members of ABVMS, Jammu. The two online intake forms in the form of a voluntary, self-administered questionnaires were used to collect the data;whose link was made active from May 15, 2020, to May 30, 2020. The questionnaire was designed with 10 questions for faculty and 7 for students. The questions encompassed different subjects related to their preferences and perception of online learning. The data were entered in MS Excel and analyzed using the SPSS software version 20.0. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The medical faculty perceived online class discussions and assessments of the students as difficult barriers (27.87% and 40.99%, respectively) and access to books/images for teaching and lectures making and delivering as easy (50.82% and 52.46%, respectively).

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Studies including generally healthy adults or children with or without overweight or obesity were eligible. Included study designs allowed for a direct comparison of no intake or lower intake of NSS with higher NSS intake. NSSs had to be clearly named, the dose had to be within the acceptable daily intake, and the intervention duration had to be at least seven days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Body weight or body mass index, glycaemic control, oral health, eating behaviour, preference for sweet taste, cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, mood, behaviour, neurocognition, and adverse effects. RESULTS The search resulted in 13 941 unique records. Of 56 individual studies that provided data for this review, 35 were observational studies. In adults, evidence of very low and low certainty from a limited number of small studies indicated a small beneficial effect of NSSs on body mass index (mean difference -0.6, 95% confidence interval -1.19 to -0.01; two studies, n=174) and fasting blood glucose (-0.16 mmol/L, -0.26 to -0.06; two, n=52). Lower doses of NSSs were associated with lower weight gain (-0.09 kg, -0.13 to -0.05; one, n=17 934) compared with higher doses of NSSs (very low certainty of evidence). For all other outcomes, no differences were detected between the use and non-use of NSSs, or between different doses of NSSs. No evidence of any effect of NSSs was seen on overweight or obese adults or children actively trying to lose weight (very low to moderate certainty). In children, a smaller increase in body mass index z score was observed with NSS intake compared with sugar intake (-0.15, -0.17 to -0.12; two, n=528, moderate certainty of evidence), but no significant differences were observed in body weight (-0.60 kg, -1.33 to 0.14; two, n=467, low certainty of evidence), or between different doses of NSSs (very low to moderate certainty). CONCLUSIONS Most health outcomes did not seem to have differences between the NSS exposed and unexposed groups.

Preventative aerosol inhalation is prohibited in our hospital during COVID-19, however the number of cases of fever after surgery has not increased significantly. We want to know whether wearing surgical masks coupled with restricting the flow of people in patient wards has same effect with preventive atomization inhalation in preventing fever after surgery, and we wonder whether preventive atomization inhalation is unnecessary during COVID-19, as long as strictly wearing surgical masks and restricting the flow of people in patient wards have been met. Methods: : Eight kinds of common surgery were covered in this retrospective analysis, including total thyroidectomy (for the treatment of thyroid carcinoma), total adrenalectomy (adrenal tumor), radical gastrectomy (gastric cancer), radical nephrectomy (renal cell carcinoma), radical prostatectomy (prostate cancer), radical resection for sigmoid colon cancer, radical resection for rectal cancer and appendectomy (appendicitis). Cases in Group A underwent preventive atomization inhalation whilst cases in group B wore surgical masks and restricted the flow of people in patient wards. Occurrence of fever, occurrence of fever recurrence and the maximum temperature in the first week after surgery were analyzed in this study. Results: : No significant differences can be seen between group A and group B in terms of occurrence of fever, occurrence of fever recurrence and the maximum temperature after surgery in the first week. Conclusion: Wearing surgical masks combined with restricting the flow of people in patient wards has same effect with preventive atomization inhalation in preventing fever after general anesthesia surgery, which means, during COVID-19, preventive atomization inhalation might not be necessary as long as strictly wearing surgical masks and restricting the flow of people in patient wards have been met.","output":"Wearing Surgical Masks Coupled With Restricting the Flow of People in Patient Wards Versus Preventive Atomization Inhalation in Preventing Fever After General Anesthesia Surgery: A Retrospective Analysis During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged from China in December 2019.

Agents differ with regard to their profession, family status and age and interact with other agents at home, work or during leisure activities. The model allows to implement and test actually used or counterfactual policies such as closing schools or the leisure industry explicitly in the model in order to explore their impact on the spread of the virus, and their economic consequences. The model is calibrated with German statistical data on time use, demography, households, firm demography, employment, company profits and wages. I set up a baseline scenario based on the German containment policies and fit the epidemiological parameters of the simulation to the observed German death curve and an estimated infection curve of the first COVID-19 wave. My model suggests that by acting one week later, the death toll of the first wave in Germany would have been 180% higher, whereas it would have been 60% lower, if the policies had been enacted a week earlier. I finally discuss two stylized fiscal policy scenarios: procyclical (zero-deficit) and anticyclical fiscal policy. In the zero-deficit scenario a vicious circle emerges, in which the economic recession spreads from the high-interaction leisure industry to the rest of the economy. Even after eliminating the virus and lifting the restrictions, the economic recovery is incomplete. Anticyclical fiscal policy on the other hand limits the economic losses and allows for a V-shaped recovery, but does not increase the number of deaths. These results suggest that an optimal response to the pandemic aiming at containment or holding out for a vaccine combines early introduction of containment measures to keep the number of infected low with expansionary fiscal policy to keep output in lower risk sectors high.","output":"COVID-Town: An Integrated Economic-Epidemiological Agent-Based Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacillus amyloliquefaciens is a gram-positive, nonpathogenic, endospore-forming, member of a group of free-living soil bacteria with a variety of traits including plant growth promotion, production of antifungal and antibacterial metabolites, and production of industrially important enzymes. We have attempted to reconstruct the biogeographical structure according to functional traits and the evolutionary lineage of B. amyloliquefaciens using comparative genomics analysis. All the available 96 genomes of B. amyloliquefaciens strains were curated from the NCBI genome database, having a variety of important functionalities in all sectors keeping a high focus on agricultural aspects. In-depth analysis was carried out to deduce the orthologous gene groups and whole-genome similarity. Pan genome analysis revealed that shell genes, soft core genes, core genes, and cloud genes comprise 17.09, 5.48, 8.96, and 68.47%, respectively, which demonstrates that genomes are very different in the gene content. It also indicates that the strains may have flexible environmental adaptability or versatile functions. Phylogenetic analysis showed that B. amyloliquefaciens is divided into two clades, and clade 2 is further dived into two different clusters. This reflects the difference in the sequence similarity and diversification that happened in the B. amyloliquefaciens genome. The majority of plant-associated strains of B. amyloliquefaciens were grouped in clade 2 (73 strains), while food-associated strains were in clade 1 (23 strains). Genome mining has been adopted to deduce antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes and their prevalence among all strains. The genes tmrB and yuaB codes for tunicamycin resistance protein and hydrophobic coat forming protein only exist in clade 2, while clpP, which codes for serine proteases, is only in clade 1.

Methods: Bioimpedance measurements were taken among 19 non-elite runners at 24 h pre-race, immediately post-race, and at 48 h post-race. The bioimpedance measurements were analyzed by BIVA using the Hotelling's T2 test. The runners were divided according to a cutoff of serum creatinine level immediately post-race in G1 (<1.2 mg/dl of serum creatinine level) and G2 (1.2 mg/dl of serum creatinine level). The increase of the serum creatinine levels in 83% of G2 runners was related to acute kidney injury (AKI) stage 1. Results: Neither G1 nor G2 showed a creatinine clearance rate (CCr) lower than 60 ml/min. G2 showed a significant increase in CRP values at 48 h post-race vs baseline compared to G1 (P < 0.05), with over 5 mg/L (6.8-15.2) in 92% of the runners, and in CK values with over 215 U/L (282-1,882) at 48 h post-race in 100% of the runners. By BIVA, the 95% confidence ellipses of G2 showed shorter bioimpedance vectors than G1, with a noticeable minor Xc/H (P < 0.01), indicating an expansion on extracellular water and inflammation. The runners with 48 h post-race Xc/H values 30.5 , with a decrease from -3 to -12% with respect to the Xc/H value at 24 h pre-race, indicated AKI stage 1 with 85.7% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity, with a direct correlation between AKI stage 1 with greater CRP values at 48 h post-race and bioimpedance vector displacement, but not with CK values at 48 h post-race. Conclusion: Through this data collection, it was evidenced that a transient reduction in renal function is more related to inflammatory factors than muscle damage.

Objective: We tested Corona-Debriefing as a pilot test with 48 participants (TN) in July 2020 (30 present, 14 online) in order to assess mental stress and risk perception of participants plus formative/brief summative evaluation of the workshop. Methods: The PHQ-4 with its subscales GAD-2 (anxiety) and PHQ-2 (depression) was used to assess mental stress; risk assessments were made by means of self-constructed 5-point Likert-scales for the dimensions person/society/health/economy. A formative evaluation was carried out by means of a questionnaire at the end of the event; the brief summative assessment was asked for by means of a school grading scale. Results: 37 complete TED questionnaires and 22 evaluations were obtained. TN showed a low personal risk assessment, but considerable fears about social and economic developments. Needs are seen mainly in improvements regarding organization, protective equipment and technical communication (e.g. official recommendations for action). The workshop was rated good or very good in 95% of the evaluations. Criticism was directed at the limited time available, the narrowing of topics by moderators and the desire for (even) more room for the exchange of personal experiences.

COVID-19 was first reported in China and rigorous researches are going on for developing vaccine for the pandemic. This review was prepared by following PRISMA guidelines and used the resources from the Web of Science and PubMed. This research focuses on the niches of symptoms and vaccines for COVID-19. The research for vaccine involves research for new vaccine and drug repurposing. Out of various drug repurposing options, Remdesivir, and Favipiravir, Chloroquine and Lopinavir/Ritonavir were found to be the popular ones for treating COVID-19 patients across the world. Even though there are concerns regarding asymptotic patients, the most dominant symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and cough, followed by Dyspnoea and muscle ache. This review concludes that the COVID-19 related research should focus on developing immunity vaccines, and repurposing of drugs. Research on the problems of quarantine life, patient monitoring, and usage of information technology in facing COVID-19 will improve the quality of patient handling during the pandemic.

Sparse data documenting the impact of COVID-19 in Africa has fostered the belief that COVID-19 skipped Africa. We previously published results from a systematic postmortem surveillance at a busy inner-city morgue in Lusaka, Zambia. Between June-October 2021, we detected COVID-19 in 15-19% of all deaths and concentrated in community settings where testing for COVID-19 was absent. Yet these conclusions rested on a small cohort of 70 COVID-19+ individuals. Subsequently, we conducted a longer and far larger follow-on survey using the same methodology. Methods We obtained a nasopharyngeal swab from each enrolled decedent and tested these using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). A subset of samples with a PCR cycle threshold <30 underwent genotyping to identify viral variants. We weighted our results to adjust for enrolment ratios and stratified them by setting (facility vs. community), time of year, age, and location. Results From 1,118 enrolled decedents, COVID-19 was detected among 32.0% (358/1,116). We observed three waves of transmission that peaked in July 2020, January 2021, and ~June 2021 (end of surveillance). These were dominated by viral variants AE.1, Beta, and Delta, respectively. During peak transmission, COVID-19 was detected in ~90% of all deaths. COVID-19 deaths clustered in Lusakas poorest city wards. Roughly four COVID-19 deaths occurred in the community for every facility death. Antemortem testing occurred for 52.6% (302/574) of facility deaths but only 1.8% (10/544) of community deaths; overall, only ~10% of COVID-19+ deaths were identified in life. Conclusions COVID-19 had a devastating impact in Lusaka. COVID-19+ deaths occurred in all age groups and was the leading cause of death during peak transmission periods. Testing was rarely done for the vast majority of COVID-19 deaths that occurred in the community, yielding a substantial undercount.

AIM: In this study, we examined the prevalence and the risk factors of LCS in a cohort of patients with previous COVID-19 and followed for at least 6 months of follow-up. DESIGN: We conducted a prospective study including all hospitalized patients affected by COVID-19 at our center of Infectious Diseases (Vercelli, Italy) admitted between 10 March 2020 and 15 January 2021 for at least 6 months after discharge. Two follow-up visits were performed: after 1 and 6 months after hospital discharge. Clinical, laboratory and radiological data were recorded at each visit. RESULTS: A total of 449 patients were included in the analysis. The LCS was diagnosed in 322 subjects at Visit 1 (71.7%) and in 206 at Visit 2 (45.9); according to the post-COVID-19 functional status scale we observed 147 patients with values 2C3 and 175 with values >3 at Visit 1; at Visit 2, 133 subjects had the score between 2C3 and 73 > 3.

The study aimed to evaluate impact of influenza vaccine on childhood otitis media. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included data for 803,592 children (<10 years old) recorded in Taiwans National Health Insurance Research Database. AOM incidence and tympanostomy tube insertion incidence in each influenza season before and after the introduction of traditional injectable trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) were compared using the Poisson regression analysis to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: In children < 2 years old, the age group eligible for free influenza vaccination, there was a significant reduction in seasonal AOM incidence after TIV introduction in 2004 (from 98.4 episodes/1000 person-seasons [95% CI: 96.4C100.5] to 66.1 episodes/1000 person-seasons [95% CI: 64C68.1]). In addition, with the increased vaccine coverage rate, the outpatient visits for AOM in the influenza season of 2005 and 2006 were significantly lower than that in 2004 (IRR = 0.85 and 0.80, respectively, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in primary care consultations for children <2 years old was observed after the introduction of the TIV in Taiwan in 2004. With the increased vaccine coverage, there was an additional decline in 2005 and 2006. In addition of the direct protection provided by the vaccination, we believe that TIV may have induced some herd immunity that further contributed to the reduction in influenza attack rates and the rates of associated AOM in that age group. These reductions were observed only in vaccine-eligible children, while older children, who were not enrolled in the influenza vaccination program during the study period, have experienced increases in the AOM incidence during the 2004C2006 period compared to the 2000C2003 period.","output":"Impact of influenza vaccine on childhood otitis media in Taiwan: A population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 77-year-old man was admitted with severe acute kidney injury and nephrotic syndrome.

Here we show that in COVID-19 patients, circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) decline early after symptom onset and this correlated with COVID-19 disease severity. This transient depletion coincides with decreased expression of antiviral type I IFN and the systemic inflammatory cytokines CXCL10 and IL-6. Importantly, COVID-19 disease severity correlated with decreased pDC frequency in peripheral blood. Using an in vitro stem cell-based human pDC model, we demonstrate that pDCs directly sense SARS-CoV-2 and in response produce multiple antiviral (IFN and IFN{lambda}1) and inflammatory (IL-6, IL-8, CXCL10) cytokines. This immune response is sufficient to protect epithelial cells from de novo SARS-CoV-2 infection. Targeted deletion of specific sensing pathways identified TLR7-MyD88 signaling as being crucial for production of the antiviral IFNs, whereas TLR2 is responsible for the inflammatory IL-6 response. Surprisingly, we found that SARS-CoV-2 engages the neuropilin-1 receptor on pDCs to mitigate the antiviral IFNs but not the IL-6 response. These results demonstrate distinct sensing pathways used by pDCs to elicit antiviral vs. immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that targeting neuropilin-1 on pDCs may be clinically relevant for mounting TLR7-mediated antiviral protection.

SARS-CoV-2 is internalized by pDCs via a yet unknown endocytic mechanism. The intracellular TLR7 sensor detects viral RNA and induces a signaling cascade involving MyD88-IRAK4-TRAF6 (1) to induce CXCL10 and, via IRF7 phosphorylation and translocation, inducing type I and III Interferons (2). Once secreted, type I and III IFNs initiate autocrine and paracrine signals that induce the expression of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), thereby facilitating an antiviral response that can protect the cell against infection. However, SARS-CoV-2, has the intrinsic property to facilitate CD304 signaling, potentially by interfering with IRF7 nuclear translocation, thereby inhibiting type I IFN production and thus reducing the antiviral response generated by the pDC (4). Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) glycoprotein is sensed by the extracellular TLR2/6 heterodimer and this facilitates production of the inflammatory IL-6 cytokine (5).

Setting UTH is the largest tertiary care referral hospital in Zambia and its morgue registers ~80% of Lusaka's deaths. Participants Participants of all ages were enrolled if within 48 hours of death and if the next of kin or representative provided written informed consent. Results We enrolled 372 participants between June and September 2020, and had PCR results for 364 (99.5%). CV19 was detected in 70/364 (19.2%). The median age for CV19+ deaths was 48 years (IQR 36-72 years) and 70% were male. Most CV19+ deaths (51/70, 72.8%) occurred in the community; none had been tested for CV19 antemortem. Among the 19/70 facility deaths, six were tested antemortem. Among the 52/70 CV19 deaths with symptoms data, 44/52 had typical symptoms of CV19 (cough, fever, shortness of breath), of whom only five were tested antemortem. We identified CV19 among seven children; only one had been tested antemortem. The proportion of CV19+ deaths increased with age, but 75.7% of CV19+ deaths were aged <60 years. The five most common co-morbidities among CV19+ deaths were: tuberculosis (31.4%); hypertension (27.1%); HIV/AIDS (22.9%); alcohol use (17.1%); and diabetes (12.9%). Conclusions Contrary to expectations, CV19+ deaths were common in Lusaka. The majority occurred in the community where testing capacity is lacking. Yet few who died at facilities were tested, despite presenting with typical symptoms of CV19. Therefore, CV19 cases were under reported because testing was rarely done, not because CV19 was rare. If our data are generalizable, the impact of CV19 in Africa has been vastly underestimated.","output":"COVID-19 deaths detected in a systematic post-mortem surveillance study in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In hospitalized patients recovering from the SARS-coronavirus-2 disease 19 (COVID-19), high prevalence of muscle weakness and physical performance impairment has been observed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation in these subjects in a real-life setting. METHODS: Retrospective data analysis of patients recovering from COVID-19, including those requiring assisted ventilation or oxygen therapy, consecutively admitted to an in-patient pulmonary rehabilitation program between April 1 and August 15, 2020. Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB: primary outcome), Barthel Index (BI), and six-min walking distance were assessed as outcome measures. RESULTS: Data of 140 patients were analyzed.

It is the greatest approach to avoid the spread of hepatitis C, especially injecting drugs, is to avoid these behaviors. Treatments for hepatitis C can cure most patients within 8 to 12 weeks, so being tested is critical. After examining multiple types of machine learning approaches to construct the classification models, we built an AI-based ensemble model for predicting Hepatitis C disease in patients with the capacity to predict advanced fibrosis by integrating clinical data and blood biomarkers. The dataset included a variety of factors related to Hepatitis C disease. The training data set was subjected to three machine-learning approaches and the validated data was then used to evaluate the ensemble learning-based prediction model. The results demonstrated that the proposed ensemble learning model has been observed ad more accurate compared to the existing Machine learning algorithms. The Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) technique was the most precise learning approach (94.1% accuracy). The Bayesian network was the second-most accurate learning algorithm (94.47% accuracy). The accuracy improved to the level of 95.59%. Hepatitis C has a significant frequency globally, and the disease's development can result in irreparable damage to the liver, as well as death. As a result, utilizing AI-based ensemble learning model for its prediction is advantageous in curbing the risks and improving treatment outcome. The study demonstrated that the use of ensemble model presents more precision or accuracy in predicting Hepatitis C disease instead of using individual algorithms.

METHODS: Open-access data and press releases on COVID-19 in Taiwan were collected on the website of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. All 55 community-acquired cases of COVID-19 confirmed from January 28 to April 12, 2020, in Taiwan were included. Basic demographic characteristics, symptom presentation, infection source, route of identification, and transmission dynamics were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 55 cases, 52.7% were female and 74.5% were between 20-59 years of age. One-sixth (16.4%) of community-acquired cases were asymptomatic. More than half (58.2%) of the cases were identified via contact tracing. The median incubation period was 6 days (range 1-13 d) and the median serial interval was 4 days (range -3-24 d). Twenty-six cases (47.3%) were transmitted from presymptomatic cases, 11 cases (20%) from symptomatic cases, and 2 cases (3.6%) from an asymptomatic case. The contagious period of symptomatic cases was from 7 days before to 15 days after the onset of symptoms. CONCLUSION: The high proportion of asymptomatic cases and the transmissibility in the presymptomatic and asymptomatic periods make control of COVID-19 challenging.

However, to our knowledge, the consequences of mask wearing on communication between surgeons and patients have not been studied. Objective To evaluate the effects of clear vs standard covered masks on communication during surgical clinic encounters. Design This randomized clinical trial examined communication between surgeons and their patients when surgeons wore clear vs covered masks in surgical outpatient clinics at a single academic medical center. New patients were recruited from participating surgeons' clinic schedules. Interventions Surgeons wore either clear masks or covered masks for each clinic visit with a new patient, based on a per-visit randomization plan. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome measures included patient perceptions of (1) surgeon communication and (2) trust in surgeons, as well as (3) quantitative assessments and (4) qualitative assessments regarding patient impressions of the surgeon's mask. After the clinic encounter, patients completed a verbal survey including validated Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems questions. Additional questions involved surgeon empathy, trust, and the patient's impression of the surgeon's mask. Data were analyzed by comparing patient data in the clear vs covered groups using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests, and comments were analyzed for themes. Results Two hundred patients were enrolled from 15 surgeons' clinics spanning 7 subspecialties. When surgeons wore a clear mask, patients rated their surgeons higher for providing understandable explanations (clear, 95 of 100 [95%] vs covered, 78 of 100 [78%]; P < .001), demonstrating empathy (clear, 99 [99%] vs covered, 85 [85%]; P < .001), and building trust (clear, 94 [94%] vs covered, 72 [72%]; P < .001). Patients preferred clear masks (clear, 100 [100%] vs covered, 72 [72%]; P < .001), citing improved surgeon communication and appreciation for visualization of the face. Conversely, 8 of 15 surgeons (53%) were unlikely to choose the clear mask over their standard covered mask. Conclusions and Relevance This randomized clinical trial demonstrates that patients prefer to see their surgeon's face. Surgeons who wore clear masks were perceived by patients to be better communicators, have more empathy, and elicit greater trust. Because masks will remain part of the health care landscape for some time, deliberate attention to preserving communication within the surgeon-patient relationship is warranted.

Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the necessity of prescribed intraoral radiographs and to estimate the number of unnecessary prescriptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 143 patients with a mean age of 29.36  14.11 years who visited the Radiology Department of Shiraz Dental School during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. Information, including gender, age, systemic diseases, referring department, and type and urgency of radiography, was collected using a checklist. Chi-squared test and Fishers exact test were run to assess the relationships between variables. Results: Among all the patients referred to the Radiology Department, the endodontics and oral medicine departments accounted for the highest percentage of referrals. The relationship between the necessity of radiography prescriptions and dental departments was significant (P < 0.05). The lowest rate of unnecessary referrals was reported in the Department of Endodontics (13.3%), whereas the highest rate of unnecessary referrals was attributed to the aesthetic and restorative dentistry departments (73.3%). There was a significant association between dental department and the type of prescribed radiographs (extraoral/intraoral). The Orthodontics Department was the only department with more extraoral radiograph prescriptions than intraoral radiographs. One-third of the prescribed intraoral radiographs and half of the extraoral radiographs were unnecessary, with a significant difference during the pandemic (P = 0.019). Conclusions: Although there has been some success in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, this pandemic will not be easily eradicated.

The actual procedure for producing a metal shadow is relatively simple; a heavy metal is evaporated from a source at an oblique angle to the specimen. The metal atoms pile up on the surfaces that face the source, but the surfaces away from the source are shielded and receive little metal deposit, creating a shadow. However, the process of producing biological specimens that are suitable for metal shadowing can be very complex. There are a whole host of specimen preparation techniques that can precede metal shadowing, and all provide superior preservation in comparison to air drying, a required step in negative staining procedures. The physical forces present during air drying (i.e., surface tension of the waterCair interface) will literally crush most biological specimens as they dry. In this chapter I explain the development of and procedures for the production of biological specimens from macromolecular assemblies (e.g., DNA and RNA), purified isolated molecules (e.g., proteins), and isolated viruses and bacteria preparations suitable for metal shadowing.

Increased MDSCs was revealed in MDS patients when compared to healthy controls. Especially, MDSCs performed higher activated STAT3 and CCR2 expression in high-risk MDS patients. The CCL2 and IL-6 levels in MDS patients were also higher than in healthy controls, which could drive recruitment and activation of MDSCs.

However, whether it decreases mortality remains unknown. PURPOSE: : We aimed to explore the association between QPT use and in-hospital mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: : A retrospective study based on a real-world database was conducted. METHODS: : We identified patients consecutively hospitalized with COVID-19 in 15 hospitals from a national retrospective registry in China, from January through May 2020. Data on patients characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were extracted from the electronic medical records. The association of QPT use with COVID-19 related mortality was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models based on propensity score analysis. RESULTS: : Of the 8939 patients included, 28.7% received QPT. The COVID-19 related mortality was 1.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8% to 1.7%) among the patients receiving QPT and 4.8% (95% CI 4.3% to 5.3%) among those not receiving QPT. After adjustment for patient characteristics and concomitant treatments, QPT use was associated with a relative reduction of 50% in in-hospital COVID-19 related mortality (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.66 P <0.001).

METHODS: A systematic search of the relevant literature was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and LILACS databases, for articles published up to May 27, 2020, relating to studies evaluating cleaning products that inactivate coronavirus in the environment. RESULTS: Seven studies were selected. These analyzed use of 70% alcohol, detergent, detergent containing iodine, household bleach, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide, glutaraldehyde, ultraviolet irradiation and plasma air purifier. The effectiveness of treating sewage with sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide was also evaluated. CONCLUSION: Disinfection of environments, especially those in ordinary use, such as bathrooms, needs to be done constantly. Viral inactivation was achieved using chlorine-based disinfectants, alcohol, detergents, glutaraldehyde, iodine-containing detergents, hydrogen peroxide compounds and household bleaches. Alcohol showed efficient immediate activity. In sewage, sodium hypochlorite had better action than chlorine dioxide.

Methods: This study was a longitudinal study using the dataset from the Employee Cohort Study in Japan (E-COCO-J). The study comprised 4120 individuals from February 2019. A baseline survey in March 2020, a 2-month follow-up survey in May 2020, and a 5-month follow-up survey in August 2020 were conducted. Questions surveyed respondents global fear and worry and six items related to COVID-19. A mixed model for repeated measures of an analysis of variance was used. Results: A total of 1,421 respondents completed the baseline survey. At 2- and 5-month follow-ups, 1,032 and 1,181 respondents completed surveys, respectively. Of those, 64 and 33 individuals who were temporarily laid off or on leave were recorded as missing values. Global fear and worry about COVID-19 significantly increased from March to August 2020. Fears of personal or family infection, limiting one's activities and national and local government policies also significantly increased with time. In contrast, fears of lack of knowledge and difficulty of obtaining hygiene products significantly decreased. Conclusions: Global fear and worry about COVID-19 were increased even though people have stayed together longer with this infectious disease. To conduct efficient risk communication during a pandemic, knowing the concerns of the populace, providing correct information and a sufficient supply of products, and setting clear guidelines are essential.","output":"Changes in fears and worries related to COVID-19 during the pandemic among current employees in Japan: a 5-month longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has already reached 3,207,248 patients with more than 225,000 deaths all over the world.

Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection should be treated only after clinical recovery, two consecutive negative oropharyngeal swabs and, if available, a negative stool sample. Before any elective oncologic procedure, a multidisciplinary oncologic team including an anaesthesiologist and an infectious disease specialist must assess every patient to evaluate the risk of infection and its impact on perioperative morbidity, mortality and oncologic prognosis.

In order to identify and obtain viable Tr1 cells for research and clinical applications, co-expression of CD49b and LAG3 has been proposed as a unique surface signature for both human and mouse Tr1 cells. However, recent studies have revealed that this pattern of co-expression is dependent on the stimulating conditions and the differentiation stage of the CD4(+) T cells.

OBJECTIVE To examine the relationship between serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) level and COVID-19 infection, its severity, and its clinical case characteristics. METHODS This case-control study compared serum 25(OH)D levels and rates of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) between 80 healthy controls and 62 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to Guangxi People's Hospital, China, 2/16/2020-3/16/2020. Cases were categorized into asymptomatic, mild/moderate, and severe/critical disease. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the associations between 25(OH)D level, or VDD, and case status/severity of COVID-19 while controlling for demographics and comorbidities. A threshold level of vitamin D for conveying COVID-19 risk was estimated. RESULTS Severe/critical COVID-19 cases were significantly older and had higher percentages of comorbidity (renal failure) compared to mild cases. The serum 25(OH)D concentration in COVID-19 patient was much lower than that in healthy control. And 25(OH)D level was the lowest in severe/critical cases, compared with mild cases. In further, significantly higher rates of VDD were found in COVID-19 cases (41.9%) compared to healthy controls (11.1%). And VDD was the greatest in severe/critical cases (80%), compared with mild cases (36%). These statistically significant associations remained even after controlling for demographics and comorbidities. A potential threshold of 25(OH)D (41.19 nmol/L) to protect against COVID-19 was identified. CONCLUSION Elderly and people with comorbidities were susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection. VDD was a risk factor for COVID-19, especially for severe/critical cases.

Given the crucial role of EF in learning and school adjustment, it is important to document the factors that bolster the development of executive competence, especially during a period of growth. Although substantial evidence suggests that parent-child relationships relate to EF, few longitudinal studies have examined the parental antecedents of EF developmental trajectories during the school years. Accordingly, this multiyear longitudinal study (N = 102) explored the respective roles of early mother-child attachment security and maternal autonomy support in the prediction of patterns of growth in working memory, cognitive flexibility, and planning skills across Grades 2 to 4. Multilevel growth curve analyses revealed a unique positive relation between attachment security and all EF skills, whereas autonomy support was mainly independently associated with initial planning performance. These findings provide further suggestion for a global contribution of secure attachment relationships to children's executive competence and highlight the importance of supporting children's autonomy to foster the emergence of more complex EF abilities such as planning. This study also supports the relevance of considering multiple aspects of parent-child relationships to delineate how early caregiving experiences contribute to children's EF development.","output":"Patterns of growth in executive functioning during school years: Contributions of early mother-child attachment security and maternal autonomy support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cardiac injury is recognized as one of the most common critical complications during exacerbation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to investigate the effect of cardiac injury on the clinical course of COVID-19 and to examine its potential mechanism and treatments. Methods and Results: A total of 222 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan were selected for the study during February 10 to March 28, 2020. Demographic, laboratory, and clinical data on admission and during hospitalization were compared between patients with COVID-19 with or without cardiac injury. On admission, cardiac injury (n = 29) was associated with advanced age, more underlying coronary artery disease, and a lower Pao(2). Troponin levels were correlated with inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein: r = 0.348, P < 0.001; interleukin 6: r = 0.558, P < 0.001) and d-dimer levels (r = 0.598, P < 0.001). During hospitalization, another six patients suffered from cardiac injury and cardiac injury (n = 35), resulting in higher rates of ventilation (invasive: 51.4 vs. 1.6%, P < 0.001; non-invasive: 31.4 vs. 1.1%, P < 0.001) and mortality (54.3 vs. 1.1%, P < 0.001). Cardiac injury on admission was a predictive factor for mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 4.73, 95% confidence interval = 1.35C16.63, P = 0.015). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that, on admission, a troponin level of 36.35 pg/mL was predictive for mortality with a sensitivity of 73.7% and a specificity of 92.1%. Conclusions: Cardiac injury complicates the disease course and increases the mortality rate of COVID-19. Troponin levels should be checked at admission and during hospitalization for triage, better monitoring, and managing those with COVID-19, especially in the most severe patients. Condensed Abstract: Cardiac injury is not uncommon in COVID-19. In a cohort of 222 patients with COVID-19, cardiac injury was found in 29 patients on admission and in another 6 patients during hospitalization. The admission level of troponin was well-correlated with inflammatory factors and d-dimer levels and strongly predicted mortality. Cardiac injury is a manifestation secondary to hypoxia and systemic infection, but which nevertheless further complicates the disease course and increases the mortality rate. Troponin levels should be checked at admission and during hospitalization for triage, better monitoring, and managing those with COVID-19, especially in the most severe patients.","output":"Cardiac Injury and Clinical Course of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Changes in the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) may require changes in public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as they have the potential to evade vaccines and pharmaceutical interventions and may be more transmissive relative to other SARS-CoV-2 variants.

We developed digital RT-PCR assays for mutations characteristic of VOCs and used them to quantify those mutations in wastewater settled solids samples collected from a publicly owned treatment works (POTW) during different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Wastewater concentrations of single mutations characteristic to each VOC, normalized by the concentration of a conserved SARS-CoV-2 N gene, correlate to regional estimates of the proportion of clinical infections caused by each VOC.

Existing approaches for risk scoring in COVID-19 patients focus primarily on intensive care units with specialized medical measurement devices, but not on hospital general wards. OBJECTIVE In this paper, we aim to develop a risk score for COVID-19 inpatients in general wards based on consumer-grade wearables (smartwatches). METHODS Patients wore consumer-grade wearables to record physiological measurements such as heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiration frequency. Based on Bayesian survival analysis, we validate the association between these measurements and the patient outcomes (i.e., discharge or intensive care unit admission). To build our risk score, we generate a low-dimensional representation of the physiological features. Subsequently, a pooled ordinal regression with time-dependent covariates infers the probability of either hospital discharge or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS We evaluate the predictive performance of our developed system for risk scoring in a single-center, prospective study based on N = 40 inpatients with COVID-19 in a general ward of a tertiary referral center in Switzerland. First, the Bayesian survival analysis shows that physiological measurements from consumer-grade wearables are significantly associated with the patient outcomes (i.e., discharge or intensive care unit admission). Second, our risk score achieves a time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73 to 0.90 based on leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of consumer-grade wearables for risk scoring in COVID-19 inpatients.

In this regard, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) have shown great promise, exhibiting antibiotic properties through the targeting of cellular nucleic acids. We aimed to study the efficacy of PNA as an anti-tuberculosis agent. Since the efficacy of PNA is limited by its low penetration into the cell, we also investigated combinatorial treatments using permeabilizing drugs to improve PNA efficacy. Various concentrations of anti-inhA PNA, permeabilizing drugs, and their combinations were screened against extracellular and intracellular mycobacteria.0.625 to 5 M anti-inhA PNA was observed to merely inhibit the growth of extracellular M. smegmatis, while low intracellular bacterial load was reduced by 2 or 2.5 log-fold when treated with 2.5 or 5 M PNA, respectively. Anti-inhA PNA against M. tuberculosis H37Ra exhibited bactericidal properties at 2.5 and 5 M and enabled a slight reduction in intracellular M. tuberculosis at concentrations from 2.5 to 20 M. Of the permeabilizing drugs tested, ethambutol showed the most permeabilizing potential and ultimately potentiated anti-inhA PNA to the greatest extent, reducing its efficacious concentration to 1.25 M against both M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis. Furthermore, an enhanced clearance of 1.3 log-fold was observed for ethambutol-anti-inhA PNA combinations against intracellular M. tuberculosis. Thus, permeabilizing drug-PNA combinations indeed exhibit improved efficacies. We therefore propose that anti-inhA PNA could improve therapy even when applied in minute doses as an addition to the current anti-tuberculosis drug regimen. IMPORTANCE Peptide nucleic acids have great potential in therapeutics as anti-gene/anti-sense agents. However, their limited uptake in cells has curtailed their widespread application. Through this study, we explore a PNA-drug combinatorial strategy to improve the efficacy of PNAs and reduce their effective concentrations. This work also focuses on improving tuberculosis treatment, which is hindered by the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is observed that the antibacterial efficacy of anti-inhA PNA is enhanced when it is combined with permeabilizing drugs, particularly ethambutol. This indicates that the addition of even small concentrations of anti-inhA PNA to the current TB regimen could potentiate their therapeutic efficiency. We hypothesize that this system would also overcome isoniazid resistance, since the resistance mutations lie outside the designed anti-inhA PNA target site.","output":"Potentiating the Anti-Tuberculosis Efficacy of Peptide Nucleic Acids through Combinations with Permeabilizing Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pet ownership offers undisputed benefits to immunocompromised (IC) patients, however, it poses the risk for potentially serious zoonoses.

Demographic and clinical data at hospital and ICU admission were collected. The primary endpoint was to identify parameters associated with a need for tracheostomy; secondary endpoints were to analyze the clinical course of patients who needed tracheostomy. RESULTS: 118 patients were enrolled; 37 patients (31.5%) were transferred to ICU, of which 11 (29.72%) needed a tracheostomy due to prolonged MV. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at ICU admission (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47-0.92, p 0.015) was the only variable found to be associated with increased risk of the need for tracheostomy, with a cut-off point of 4.5 (sensitivity 0.72, specificity 0.73, positive predictive value 0.57 and negative predictive value 0.85). The main complications were nosocomial infection (100%), supraventricular cardiac arrhythmia (45.5%), agitation (54.5%), pulmonary thromboembolism (9.1%) and depression (9.1%).

There is a link between COVID-19 infection and impairment in the myocardial micro-vasculation which may cause an increase of INOCA patients. Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR), is the standard of care in cardiology but its diagnostic function is only related to Obstructive Coronary Artery disease (or epicardial) and it is ineffective with INOCA. The lack of effective and accurate tools for timely evaluation of coronary impairments creates a clinical unmet need. The PhysioCath catheter was developed within the Eurostars project FPCatheter, E!113577 aims to resolve this need a provide an effective tool to interventional cardiologists. The main project outcome is a catheter prototype equipped with a blood flow velocity sensor based on a thermo-convection principle, and a fiber optic pressure sensor (based on Fabry-Perot principle). While the use of Fabry-Perot type of sensor is already standard in the industry, the use of a thermo-convection sensor represents a progress with respect the state of the art. The sensor creates an overheat of 7C above the physiological blood's temperature (considered as being within the safety limits), and it exchanges thermal power with the blood stream. The power is then measured and converted to velocity by means of a calibration curve. The project encompassed interviews with 14 clinical experts, the summary of the interviews indicated that the preferred form of the device is an over the wire microcatheter, with rapid exchange. Within the project then, it was developed a 3Fr microcatheter, with a rapid exchange section of 24cm. Both pressure sensor and flow velocity sensor were integrated in this embodiment. Finally, the PhysioCath prototype was evaluated in a bench test study. The test setup was composed by an anatomical silicone phantom of the aortic root and the coronaries (Elastrat, Geneva, Switzerland), perfused with a peristaltic pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston MA, US). The measurements performed by the flow velocity sensor were compared against and external doppler flow velocity sensor. While the pressure measurement was assessed for stability and presence of drift. The data processing revealed and extreme accuracy in the measurement of flow based indexes like CFR (6% variability), accuracy of the blood flow velocity measurement (10%), and extreme stability in the measurement of both pressure and flow velocity. In the second part of the project (that is currently ongoing), it will be studied the performance of the device within an animal setting. In conclusion, the PhysioCath device is a microcatheter integrating bot pressure measurement and blood flow velocity measurement.

This present study aimed to assess the early impact of COVID-19 on vaccine activities by comparing current trends to trends over the past year when vaccine coverage of major antigens (BCG, OPV, DTP-HepB-Hib, MMR, IPV, and Td) had improved considerably. Methods: The study was carried out at the Expanded Vaccination Program (EPI) of the Republic of Guinea from February 2019 to June 2019. It was a comparative retrospective cohort study on the trends in administrative coverage of the different antigens used in the framework of vaccination. We performed interrupted time series (STI) analysis using the delayed dependent variable model ANCOVA type II Sum Squares with significance for a p-value less than 0.05 to confirm the link between the occurrence of Covid-19 and the collapse of vaccine coverage. These analyzes were performed on global vaccine-preventable disease surveillance data extracted from the District Immunization Data Management Tool (DVD-MT) designed by WHO. Estimates of the target population were obtained from the National Health Information System (SNIS), and surveillance data for Covid-19 patients were obtained from the National Health Security Agency (ANSS). Results: Overall, the EPI recorded a median vaccination coverage of less than 80% for all the vaccines introduced and the analysis of the interrupted time series shows that the interruption of the vaccination program was significant for all the vaccines. This finding is factual at both the national and district levels. However, there are disparities at this level, even though some districts have yet to report cases of COVID-19 but have experienced drop-in vaccination coverage. The comparison of vaccination coverage for DTP3, for example, shows a sharp drop in the prefectures of Yomou, N'Nzerekore, Macenta, Kankan, Mandiana, Dinguiraye, Mamou, Koubia, Mali, and Conakry, where it varies between 0 and 80% compared to 2019 where it was above 80%. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the need for a resilient health system that could adapt quickly and effectively to pandemics and which in turn makes it possible to strengthen EPI activities in Guinea during this period of a health crisis, in particular for children.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with COVID-19 older than 65 years who were treated in our hospital from January 28, 2020 to March 5, 2020, and explored the relationship between nutritional risk and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 141 patients with COVID-19 (46 common COVID-19, 73 severe COVID-19, and 22 extremely severe COVID-19) were enrolled in the study. NRS 2002 identified 85.8% of patients as having risk, with being identified 41.1% by MUST, 77.3% by MNA-sf, and 71.6% by NRI.

Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based therapies to prevent COVID-19 following exposure to the virus, or to prevent worsening of symptoms following confirmed infection. We describe the design of a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-emptive therapy (PET) for COVID-19. METHODS: We will conduct two nested multicentre international double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for: 1) PEP of asymptomatic household contacts or healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 within the past four days, and 2) PET for symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 showing symptoms for less than four days. We will recruit 1,500 patients each for the PEP and PET trials. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive five days of hydroxychloroquine or placebo. The primary PEP trial outcome will be the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19. The primary PET trial outcome will be an ordinal scale of disease severity (not hospitalized, hospitalized without intensive care, hospitalization with intensive care, or death). Participant screening, informed consent, and follow-up will be exclusively internet-based with appropriate regulatory and research ethics board approvals in Canada and the United States. DISCUSSION: These complementary randomized-controlled trials are innovatively designed and adequately powered to rapidly answer urgent questions regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine to reduce virus transmission and disease severity of COVID-19 during a pandemic. In-person participant follow-up will not be conducted to facilitate social distancing strategies and reduce risks of exposure to study personnel.

Several serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 are now becoming available in the market. However, it has also become extremely important to have well-established assays with desirable high sensitivity and specificity. To date, the micro-neutralization (MN) assay, is currently considered the gold-standard being capable of evaluating and detecting, functional neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Several protocols exist for microneutralization assays which vary in several steps of the protocol: cell seeding conditions, number of cells seeded, virus amount used in the infection step, virus-serum-cells incubation period etc. These potential differences account for a high degree of variability and inconsistency of the results and using a harmonized protocol for the micro-neutralization assay could potentially solve this. Given this situation, the main aim of our study was to carry out SARS-CoV-2 wild type virus MN assay in order to investigate which optimal tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50) infective dose in use is the most adequate choice for implementation in terms of reproducibility, standardization possibilities and comparability of results. Therefore, we assessed the MN by using two different viral infective doses: a standard dose of 100 TCID50/well and a lower dose of 25 TCID50/well. The results obtained, yielded by MN on using the lower infective dose (25 TCID50), were in line with those obtained with the standard infective dose; in some cases, however, we detected a titre that was one or two dilution steps higher, which maintained all negative samples negative. This suggesting that the lower dose can potentially have a positive impact on the detection and estimation of neutralizing antibodies present in a given sample, showing higher sensitivity but similar specificity and therefore, it would require a more accurate assessment and cross-laboratories standardisation especially when MN is employed as serological assay of choice for pre-clinical and clinical studies.","output":"The Theory and Practice of the viral dose in neutralization assay: insights on SARS-CoV-2 doublethink effect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pemerintah mengeluarkan sejumlah kebijakan hukum diantaranya menetapkan COVID-19 sebagai bencana nasional dan Pembatasan Berskala Sosial Besar.

Many studies carried out with diverse samples attest to the negative influence of stress on health. However, few studies focus on stress and self-rated health among the Spanish workforce, or analyse which variables can act as a buffer against the negative effects of stress on self-perceived health. Aim: to analyse the mediator role of social support and job satisfaction in the relationship between work-related stress and self-rated health among the Spanish working population between 2006 and 2017. Method: repeated cross-sectional study using Spanish Surveys from 2006 to 2017, a total of 32.105 participants (47.4% women) aged 16 years and over (M = 42.3, SD = 10.7) answered a series of questions about work-related stress (PV), self-rated health (CV), job satisfaction, and social support (mediator variables) through the National Health Survey (NHS) prevalences of work-related stress, self-rated health, job satisfaction, and social support were calculated (standardised by age). We performed mediation/moderation analysis with Macro Process for SPSS to analyse the role of social support and job satisfaction in the relationship between self-rated health and work-related stress among the Spanish working population. Results: three mediation analyses were conducted, one for each time point in the study period. The results revealed a significant direct association between stress and job satisfaction. In the 2006 model, both job satisfaction and social support acted as mediators between stress and self-rated health, while in the 2011 and 2017 models, only job satisfaction acted as a mediator.

Here, we investigated the clinical features of critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients with and without diabetes and identified risk factors for death of these patients. METHODS: The medical records including epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 49 critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients were collected and analyzed in Huanggang City and Xiaogan City, Hubei Province, outside Wuhan. RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent (33) of patients survived and 33% (16) of patients died in 49 critically ill patients (32 men, 17 women), with a median age of 63 years (IQR 53C73). Univariate analyses indicated that the deceased patients were more often associated with two or more comorbidities, one or more gastrointestinal symptoms, high neutrophil percentage, low lymphocytes and lymphocyte percentage, high C-reactive protein, high procalcitonin, high fasting blood glucose (FBG), and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) compared with the survivors; moreover, the patients with T2DM had the higher neutrophil percentage, the lower lymphocyte percentage, and the higher levels of FBG and LDH compared with the patients without T2DM.

According to Spearmans correlation analysis, there was a strong correlation (rho 0.95) between the total mean of awareness and performance (p < 0.01). The highest incidence rate of COVID-19 was in district 7 which had the lowest mean score in both awareness and performance. In addition, the results of ANOVA (LSDleast significant difference) showed that there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between district 7with lower mean scores in awareness and performanceand other districts. Overall, it is concluded that citizens awareness level was lower than that of their performance. This conclusion not only calls for more training programs to be implemented in public places, schools, universities and governmental offices, but it also necessitates maintaining a proper and timely training about using disinfectants.","output":"Awareness and Performance towards Proper Use of Disinfectants to Prevent COVID-19: The Case of Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in Wuhan, HubeProvince, China, in December 2019 and has caused over 240,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of","output":"The Role of Environmental Factors on Transmission Rates of the COVID-19 Outbreak: An Initial Assessment in Two Spatial Scales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During periods of pandemic disease, the practice of Dentistry must be altered incorporating the appropriate patient management strategies to reduce the transmission of disease.

Electron microscopy was also performed. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to detect 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in lung tissue, and the pathological characteristics were demonstrated in combination with clinical data analysis. Results: Of the 10 deaths associated with COVID-19, 7 were male and 3 were female. The average age was 70 (39-87) years. Medical record showed that 7 patients had underlying diseases. The average course of disease was 30 (16-36) days. Nine cases showed fibrinous and suppurative exudation in the alveolar cavity accompanied by the formation of hyaline membrane, and fibroblastic proliferation of alveolar septum. Type  alveolar epithelial cells showed reactive hyperplasia and desquamation. Many macrophages accumulated in the alveolar cavity. Capillary hyaline thrombus and intravascular mixed thrombus were noted. In some cases, acute bronchiolitis with mucous membrane exfoliation, accumulation of bronchiolar secretions, and bronchiolar epithelial metaplasia occurred.

This paper focuses on how physicians should implement the results of these clinical trials when counseling patients who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed about vaccines with government authorization for clinical use. Determining the most effective approach to counsel patients about coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination is challenging. We address the professionally responsible counseling of 3 groups of patients-those who are pregnant, those planning to become pregnant, and those breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed. We begin with an evidence-based account of the following 5 major challenges: the limited evidence base, the documented increased risk for severe disease among pregnant coronavirus disease 2019-infected patients, conflicting guidance from government agencies and professional associations, false information about coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines, and maternal mistrust and vaccine hesitancy. We subsequently provide evidence-based, ethically justified, practical guidance for meeting these challenges in the professionally responsible counseling of patients about coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination. To guide the professionally responsible counseling of patients who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, and breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed, we explain how obstetrician-gynecologists should evaluate the current clinical information, why a recommendation of coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination should be made, and how this assessment should be presented to patients during the informed consent process with the goal of empowering them to make informed decisions. We also present a proactive account of how to respond when patients refuse the recommended vaccination, including the elements of the legal obligation of informed refusal and the ethical obligation to ask patients to reconsider. During this process, the physician should be alert to vaccine hesitancy, ask patients to express their hesitation and reasons for it, and respectfully address them. In contrast to the conflicting guidance from government agencies and professional associations, evidence-based professional ethics in obstetrics and gynecology provides unequivocal and clear guidance: Physicians should recommend coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination to patients who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, and breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed. To prevent widening of the health inequities, build trust in the health benefits of vaccination, and encourage coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine and treatment uptake, in addition to recommending coronavirus disease 2019 vaccinations, physicians should engage with communities to tailor strategies to overcome mistrust and deliver evidence-based information, robust educational campaigns, and novel approaches to immunization.","output":"Professionally responsible coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination counseling of obstetrical and gynecologic patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The aim of this retrospective observational study is to compare C-reactive protein to albumin ratio and CURB-65 score in the emergency department in terms of predicting mortality in patients over the age of 18 who were hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia.

Functional genetic polymorphisms might have predictive and/or prognostic value in lung cancer, opening novel opportunities to improve prediction and guide clinical reasoning and therapeutics in lung cancer patients. Recent knowledge pinpoints a pleiotropic role for renin-angiotensin system, particularly in the lung and mainly through locally regulated alternative molecules and secondary pathways. Dysregulation of this system play a role in cell proliferation, hypoxia and angiogenesis, which processes are involved in lung cancer progression. Here we suggest that polymorphic variants in genes coding for renin-angiotensin system might play a role in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer progression. ABSTRACT: Introduction: The reninCangiotensin system (RAS) is involved in cell proliferation, immunoinflammatory response, hypoxia and angiogenesis, which are critical biological processes in lung cancer. Our aim was to study the association of putatively functional genetic polymorphisms in genes coding for proteins involved in RAS, hypoxia and angiogenesis with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prognosis. Methods: Genotyping of 52 germline variants from genes of the RAS and hypoxic/angiogenic factors/receptors was performed using MassARRAY iPLEX Gold in a retrospective cohort (n = 167) of advanced NSCLC patients. Validation of the resulting genetic markers was conducted in an independent group (n = 190), matched by clinicopathological characteristics. Results: Multivariate analysis on the discovery set revealed that MME rs701109 C carriers were protected from disease progression in comparison with homozygous T (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.2C0.8, p = 0.010). Homozygous A and T genotypes for KDR rs1870377 were at increased risk for disease progression and death compared to heterozygous (HR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2C2.5, p = 0.005 and HR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.2C3.4, p = 0.006, respectively). Carriers of homozygous genotypes for ACE2 rs908004 presented increased risk for disease progression, only in the subgroup of patients without tumour actionable driver mutations (HR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.3C6.3, p = 0.010). Importantly, the association of homozygous genotypes in MME rs701109 with risk for disease progression was confirmed after multivariate analysis in the validation set. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that MME polymorphism, which encodes neprilysin, may modulate progression-free survival in advanced NSCLC. Present genetic variation findings will foster basic, translational, and clinical research on their role in NSCLC.","output":"Germline Genetic Variants of the Renin-Angiotensin System, Hypoxia and Angiogenesis in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Progression: Discovery and Validation Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective We formulate population representativeness of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) as a machine learning (ML) fairness problem, derive new representation metrics, and deploy them in visualization tools which help users identify subpopulations that are underrepresented in RCT cohorts with respect to national, community-based or health system target populations. Materials and Methods We represent RCT cohort enrollment as random binary classification fairness problems, and then show how ML fairness metrics based on enrollment fraction can be efficiently calculated using easily computed rates of subpopulations in RCT cohorts and target populations. We propose standardized versions of these metrics and deploy them in an interactive tool to analyze three RCTs with respect to type-2 diabetes and hypertension target populations in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Results We demonstrate how the proposed metrics and associated statistics enable users to rapidly examine representativeness of all subpopulations in the RCT defined by a set of categorical traits (e.g., sex, race, ethnicity, smoker status, and blood pressure) with respect to target populations. Discussion The normalized metrics provide an intuitive standardized scale for evaluating representation across subgroups, which may have vastly different enrollment fractions and rates in RCT study cohorts. The metrics are beneficial complements to other approaches (e.g., enrollment fractions and GIST) used to identify generalizability and health equity of RCTs.

Several possible explanations have been floated, including greater detection of mild cases due to expanded testing, shifts in age distribution among the infected, lags between confirmed cases and reported deaths, improvements in treatment, mutations in the virus, and decreased viral load as a result of mask-wearing. Using both Florida line-level data and recently released (but incomplete) national line level data from April 1, 2020 to November 1, 2020 on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths--each stratified by age--we unpack the drop in case fatality rate (CFR). Under the hypothesis that improvements in treatment efficacy should correspond to decreases in hospitalization fatality rate (HFR), we find that improvements in the national data do not always match the story told by Florida data. In the national data, treatment improvements between the first wave and the second wave appear substantial, but modest when compared to the drop in aggregate CFR. By contrast, possibly due to constrained resources in a much larger second peak, Florida data suggests comparatively little difference between the first and second wave, with HFR slightly increasing in every age group. However, by November 1st, both Florida and national data suggest significant decreases in age-stratified HFR since April 1st. By accounting for several confounding factors, our analysis shows how age-stratified HFR can provide a more realistic picture of treatment improvements than CFR. One key limitation of our analysis is that the national line-level data remains incomplete and plagued by artifacts. Our analysis highlights the crucial role that this data can play but also the pressing need for public, complete, and high-quality age-stratified line-level data for both cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for all states.","output":"Unpacking the Drop in COVID-19 Case Fatality Rates: A Study of National and Florida Line-Level Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and the simultaneous increased focus on structural racism and racial/ethnic disparities across the United States have shed light on glaring inequities in U.S. health care, both in oncology and more generally.

METHODS: A literature search was conducted, ending 1 August 2020, to identify AMD outcomes and telecare management strategies that could be used during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 237 total articles were retrieved, 56 of which were included for analysis. Four American Academy of Ophthalmology and Center for Disease Control web resources were also included. DISCUSSION: Risk-stratification models have been developed that let providers readily screen existing patients for their future risk of neovascular AMD (nAMD). When used with at-home monitoring devices to detect nAMD, providers may be able to determine who should be contacted via teleophthalmology for screening. Telemedicine triage can be used for new complaints of vision loss to determine who should be referred to a retinal specialist for management of suspected nAMD. To increase access and provider flexibility, smartphone fundus photography images sent to a centralized teleophthalmology service can aid in the detection of nAMD.

Moreover, the value of self-reported weight changes, a more practical approach to assess long-term history in adiposity status, is still a matter of debate. In this longitudinal study, long-term changes in BMI and overweight status were assessed in 106 healthy young adults (age 40.5  1.1 years, 60 males). These were a subgroup of adolescent school students who had originally been examined in 1983 initially aiming to assess cardiovascular risk factor prevalence. Markers of early (carotid IMT) and advanced (presence of plaques in the carotid and femoral arteries and ankle-brachial index, ABI) subclinical atherosclerosis were measured in all individuals. By multivariate analysis, among other risk factors, IMT and the presence of plaques were independently determined by BMI change, while a low ABI was also determined by changes in overweight status. An adverse long term adiposity profile change ( +4 kg/m(2) and/or change into overweight/obese status from normal weight since adolescence) incrementally determined a low ABI over current risk factors. Self-reported and actual BMI changes were correlated (r = 0.587) but their means significantly differed, while the former significantly correlated with IMT only (P = 0.032). In conclusion, an adverse long term adiposity status change was more prominently associated with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis and particularly low ABI. These results also suggest that the utility of self-reported weight changes may be limited in primary prevention practice.","output":"Long-Term BMI changes since adolescence and markers of early and advanced subclinical atherosclerosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandmic, more patients are presenting with complications late after acute myocardial infarction.

We investigated the mechanism by which a mucosal vaccine based in recombinant lactic acid bacteria breaks the immunological tolerance of the gut in order to elicit a protective immune response. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed how the lipid modification of OspA affects the localization of the antigen in our delivery vehicle using a number of biochemistry techniques. Furthermore, we examined how OspA-expressing L. plantarum breaks the oral tolerance of the gut by stimulating human intestinal epithelial cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte derived dendritic cells and measuring cytokine production. We show that the leader peptide of OspA targets the protein to the cell envelope of L. plantarum, and it is responsible for protein export across the membrane. Mutation of the lipidation site in OspA redirects protein localization within the cell envelope. Further, we show that lipidated-OspA-expressing L. plantarum does not induce secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 by intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, it breaks oral tolerance of the gut via Th1/Th2 cell mediated immunity, as shown by the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by human dendritic cells, and by the production of IgG2a and IgG1 antibodies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Lipid modification of OspA expressed in L. plantarum modulates the immune response to this antigen through a Th1/Th2 immune response.","output":"Immune Response to Lactobacillus plantarum Expressing Borrelia burgdorferi OspA Is Modulated by the Lipid Modification of the Antigen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic causes of cholestasis constitute a diverse group of diseases across organ systems.

Nationwide surveillance could benefit from using data on meat inspection findings, but several limitations need to be overcome. At the producer level, interpretation of meat inspection findings is a notable opportunity for surveillance with relevance to animal health and welfare. In this study, we propose that discovery and monitoring of relational patterns between condemnation conditions co-present in broiler batches at meat inspection can provide valuable information for surveillance of farmed animal health and welfare. RESULTS: Great Britain (GB)-based integrator meat inspection records for 14,045 broiler batches slaughtered in nine, four monthly intervals were assessed for the presence of surveillance indicators relevant to broiler health and welfare. K-means and correlation-based hierarchical clustering, and association rules analyses were performed to identify relational patterns in the data. Incidence of condemnation showed seasonal and temporal variation, which was detected by association rules analysis. Syndrome-related and non-specific relational patterns were detected in some months of meat inspection records. A potentially syndromic cluster was identified in May 2016 consisting of infection-related conditions: pericarditis, perihepatitis, peritonitis, and abnormal colour. Non-specific trends were identified in some months as an unusual combination of condemnation reasons in broiler batches.

The intervention consists of an online video which demonstrates how general practitioners (GPs) can prescribe appropriate polypharmacy during a consultation with an older patient and a patient recall process, whereby patients are invited to scheduled medication review consultations with GPs. The aim of the process evaluation is to further examine the implementation of the PolyPrime intervention in primary care. This will involve investigating whether the PolyPrime intervention can be delivered as intended across two healthcare systems, how acceptable the intervention is to GPs, practice staff and patients, and to identify the interventions likely mechanisms of action. METHODS: The PolyPrime study is an external pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) which aims to recruit 12 GP practices across Northern Ireland [NI] (n=6) and the six counties in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) that border NI (n=6). Practices have been randomised to intervention or usual care. An embedded process evaluation will assess intervention fidelity (i.e. was the intervention delivered as intended), acceptability of the intervention to GPs, practice staff and patients and potential mechanisms of action (i.e. what components of the intervention were perceived to be effective). Quantitative data will be collected from data collection forms completed by GPs and practice staff and a feedback questionnaire completed by patients from intervention arm practices, which will be analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data will be collected through semi-structured interviews with GPs and practice staff and audio-recordings of medication review appointments from the intervention arm practices which will be transcribed and analysed using the framework method. Quantitative and qualitative data will be triangulated to provide an overall assessment of intervention fidelity, intervention acceptability, and mechanisms of action.

Nevertheless, inequalities in the levels and trends of adverse SRH outcomes still exist in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including South Africa. Thus, this study examines the inequalities associated with adverse SRH outcomes among young women in Durban informal settlements, South Africa, using a mixed-method analysis and suggested requisite interventions to reduce or eliminate the disparity. METHODS: A mixed-method sequential explanatory design was used to address the research question. First, a quantitative cross-sectional survey was conducted among 547 young women aged 18 to 24 years in four informal settlements in Durban, South Africa, between April and July 2021. Thereafter, twenty (20) key informant interviews were conducted among different participants but with the same study characteristics. The study's outcome variable was adverse SRH outcomes, including HIV, STIs and unintended pregnancy, while the independent variable was inequality. The quantitative analysis employed binary and multivariable analysis to determine the association between the outcome and explanatory variables, using an alpha level of p < 0.05 to determine significance, while the qualitative analysis was done thematically. RESULTS: At the quantitative level, the prevalence of adverse SRH outcomes among young women dwelling in Durban informal settlements was 82.45%, 90.86% and 81.90% for STIs, HIV and unintended pregnancy, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio showed that young women who ever discussed sexual matters with their parents had a lower likelihood of reporting having STIs [aOR = 0.20; 95% (CI = 0.15C1.01)], HIV [aOR = 0.20; 95% (CI = 0.15C1.01)] and unintended pregnancy [aOR = 0.20; 95% (CI = 0.15C1.01)] compared to young women who never had a sexual discussion with their parents. Almost all the key informant interview participants shared the same perspective and proffered possible solutions in the qualitative results.

Methods: We examined all patients aged 18 years or older with cancer and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reported between March 16, 2020 and February 6, 2021 in the international CCC19 registry. We examined frequency of LRTD (pneumonia, pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or respiratory failure), demographic and clinicopathologic factors associated with LRTD, and 30-day and overall mortality in pts with and without LRTD. Results: Of 7,289 pts with a median follow-up time of 42 (21-90) days, 2187 (30%) developed LRTD. Pts of older age (65 yrs or older), male sex, pre-existing comorbidities, baseline immunosuppressants, baseline corticosteroids, and ECOG performance status of 2 or more had substantially higher rates of LRTD compared to those without these risk factors (Table). We did not observe differences in LRTD rates between pts of different racial/ethnic groups, smoking history, hypertension, obesity, cancer status, timing or type of anti-cancer therapy. LRTD was more likely in pts with thoracic malignancy (39%), hematological malignancy (39%) compared to those with other solid tumors (27%). The majority of pts (86%) had symptomatic presentation;however, 8% of pts with asymptomatic presentation developed LRTD. 30-day and overall mortality rates were significantly higher in pts with LRTD than those without LRTD (31% vs. 4% and 38% vs. 6%, P < 0.05). Conclusions: COVID-19 related LRTD rate is high and associated with worse mortality rates in pts with cancer. The majority of risk factors associated with LRTD demonstrate underlying immunodeficiency or lung structural damage as a driving force in this population.

Advances in pDNA delivery to host tissue with the employment of in vivo electroporation (EP) have led to significantly enhanced gene expression and the recent demonstration of clinical efficacy with the platform. Building upon this platform, this study reports that enzyme-mediated modification of the muscle tissue extracellular matrix structure at the site of pDNA delivery operates in a synergistic manner with EP to enhance both local and systemic gene expression further. Specifically, administration of chondroitinase ABC (Cho ABC) to the site of intramuscular delivery of pDNA led to transient disruption of chondroitin sulfate scaffolding barrier, permitting enhanced gene distribution and expression across the tissue. The employment of Cho ABC in combination with CELLECTRA(?) intramuscular EP resulted in increased gene expression by 5.5-fold in mice and 17.98-fold in rabbits. The study demonstrates how this protocol can be universally applied to an active prophylaxis platform to increase the in vivo production of functional immunoglobulin G, and to DNA vaccine protocols to permit drug dose sparing. The data indicate the Cho ABC formulation to be of significant value upon combination with EP to drive enhanced gene expression levels in pDNA delivery protocols.","output":"Active Immunoprophylaxis and Vaccine Augmentations Mediated by a Novel Plasmid DNA Formulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Criticism on the use of the income/expenditure poverty line to estimate the number of the poor in Indonesia leads to questioning the use of the multidimensional poverty line (MPL) measurement. While current research on the defining variables, dimensions, and indicators to develop the MPL measurement in Indonesia was not based on direct views of the poor and the non-poor household heads, we complement this research gap by examining it based on direct views of the poor and the non-poor household heads. Methods used to collect the empirical data were conducted in four stages. The first stage was by organizing a Focus Group Discussion with twenty-five participants. The second stage was by conducting a pilot for the main survey on thirty poor and non-poor household heads. The third stage was by distributing the main survey questionnaire to 274 non-poor and 315 poor household head respondents in six representative locations in Indonesia. The fourth stage was by taking in-depth interviews with 8C12 key informants in each survey location. These data were further analysed by employing the qualitative technique. The results confirmed that the poor and the non-poor household head respondents, and the interviewees under the survey viewed the MPL measurement as a comprehensive and better poverty measurement. However, dimensions and indicators that were viewed to be important in developing the MPL measurement were mostly in the groups of three variables. These three variables were capability, empowerment, and opportunity. These three variables should be no hierarchy of importance in developing the MPL measurement as well as in formulating policy and programs to eradicate the incidence of poverty in Indonesia.","output":"Variables, Dimensions, and Indicators Important to Develop the Multidimensional Poverty Line Measurement in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic financial risk prediction is a complex nonlinear problem and tied tightly to financial stability since the recent global financial crisis.

There have been many social and economic benefits to this digital disruption, but it has also largely contributed to the digital destruction of mental model alignment and shared situational awareness through the propagation of mis-information i.e. reinforcement of dissonant mental models by recommender algorithms, bots and trusted individual platform users (influencers). To mitigate this process of digital destruction, new methods and approaches to the centralized management of these platforms are needed to build on and encourage trust in the actors that use them (and by association trust in their mental models). The global 'infodemic' resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, highlights the current problem confronting the information system discipline and the urgency of finding workable solutions.","output":"Who do you trust?

This leaves a very important gap in evidence and means that decisions about public spending allocations are likely to miss opportunities to improve social welfare from existing budgets. Greater attention to the development of methods and evidence to better inform the allocation of public sector spending between departments is therefore urgently needed. We identify a number of possible approaches to thissome of which are being used in different countriesand highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We propose a new, pragmatic approach that incorporates a generic descriptive system to measure the disparate outcomes produced by public sector activities in a commensurate manner. Discrete-choice experiments could be used to generate evidence of the relative importance placed on different aspects of public sector outcomes by members of the general public. The proposed approach would produce evidence on value for money across departments, and the generation of evidence on public preferences to support that.","output":"Allocating Public Spending Efficiently: Is There a Need for a Better Mechanism to Inform Decisions in the UK and Elsewhere?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, children with neurodevelopmental disabilities could not attend their usual rehabilitation therapies, with a consequent reduced support of developmental process and risk of worsening of their clinical conditions.

We included them in a 12-day programme of home-based music therapy. The children and their parents were investigated using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children and the Parent Stress Index-Short Form. RESULTS: Fourteen children started the intervention, while only 12 children completed all the planned home sessions and assessments. We observed a significant improvement in children's sleep quality and a reduction of parental distress. DISCUSSION: The significant improvements in parental distress and sleep quality must be considered important achievements for the quality of life of a child and their family.

Patients aged under 18 years had higher re-positive rates than average, and none of the severely ill patients re-tested positive. There were no significant differences in sex between re-positives and non-re-positives. Notably, most of the re-positives turned negative in the following tests, and all of them carried antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This indicates that they might not be infectious, although it is still important to perform regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing and follow-up for assessment of infectivity.

The results of our study suggest that risk perceptions may vary across preferences for conservative or liberal bias; however, our results do not support differences in the mitigation behavior across patterns of media use. Further, our findings do not support the notion of echo chambers, but rather suggest that people with lower information-seeking behavior may be more strongly influenced by politicized COVID-19 news. Risk estimates converge at higher levels of information seeking, suggesting that high information seekers consume news from sources across the political spectrum.

Within weeks, the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games (Tokyo 2020) were postponed, and ultimately rescheduled for summer 2021. The purpose of this study is to present results from the COVID mitigation effort during Tokyo 2020. Methods: Airport testing on arrival to Japan was conducted by the Japanese health authorities. Subsequent daily screening with rapid antigen testing on saliva was conducted by the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (TOCOG). Positive samples were tested via saliva PCR. Final confirmatory testing occurred via nasopharyngeal PCR;if positive, the individual was required to isolate. Results: During the Games, 40-50,000 quantitative antigen saliva screening tests were performed daily. From 1 July to 7 September, 54,236 COVID-19 tests were performed on Games-related personnel arriving at the Haneda and Narita Airports, with 54 positive tests, for a positivity rate of 0.10%. A subsequent 1,017,190 COVID-19 tests were performed within the Tokyo 2020 bubble by TOCOG, with 312 positives, yielding a positivity rate of 0.03%. Out of a total 11,476 Olympic athletes, 24 tested positive and required isolation;13 of 4,303 Paralympic athletes tested positive and required isolation. Close contact tracing throughout Toyko 2020 lead to additional screening of 402 individuals, and resulted in the identification of 2 confirmed cases. A small number of athletes had a series of three positive results (saliva screening, saliva PCR, and NP PCR), but were able to produce sufficient documentation outlining recent COVID-19 infection and subsequent recovery, and thus were allowed to participate. Conclusions: The Tokyo 2020 COVID-19 mitigation plan relied on the formation of a Tokyo 2020 bubble, extensive testing, distancing, masking, contact tracing, quarantining and isolation. The athlete testing structure was designed to limit false positive results which might unfairly disqualify athletes from participation.","output":"Experience with COVID mitigation during the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally, and the number of cases continues to rise all over the world.

Neuronal damage and corpora amylacea (CA) numbers /mm2 were histopathologically assessed. Other features studied were the immunohistochemical expression of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and the Iba-1 antigen for glial activation. RESULTS: Autopsies showed normal gross brainstem anatomy. Histopathological examination demonstrated increased neuronal and CA damage in Covid-19 patients' medulla oblongata. Immunohistochemistry disclosed SARS-CoV-2 NP in brainstem neurons and glial cells, and in cranial nerves. Glial elements also exhibited a widespread increase in Iba-1 expression.

The signal responsible for efficient frameshift is composed of the slippery site UUUAAAU followed by a sequence that has the potential to adopt two alternative folding patterns, either a structure involving a pseudoknot, or a simple stem-loop structure. To investigate the structure requirements for efficient frameshifting, mutants in the stem-loop or in the potential pseudoknot regions of a Polish isolate of PLRV (PLRV-P) have been analyzed. Mutations that are located in the second stem (S2) of the potential pseudoknot structure, but are located in unpaired regions of the alternative stem-loop structure, reduce frameshift efficiency. Deletion of the 3' end sequence of the alternative stem-loop structure does not reduce frameshift efficiency. Our results confirm that -1 frameshift in the overlap region depends on the slippery site and on the downstream positioned sequence, and propose that in PLRV-P a pseudoknot is required for efficient frameshifting.

This variant possibly has increased virulence and may be associated with increased mortality. The objective of this study was to determine if patients admitted in the second wave had more severe illness and higher mortality than those admitted in the first. Methods We analysed and compared the characteristics, biological severity markers, treatments, level of care and outcomes of patients hospitalised in a private hospital in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Results Compared to the first wave, patients admitted in the second were older and less likely to have co-morbidities. In contrast, the D-dimer and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were significantly higher. Despite this, significantly less patients were admitted to ICU and/or were mechanically ventilated. The total length of hospital stay was identical in both groups. Whereas the overall mortality was not significantly higher during the second wave, the ICU mortality was. Those that died in the second wave were older than those in the first wave. Multivariable logistic regression showed that being admitted during the second wave was an independent risk factor for mortality. Conclusion This study appears to confirm previous reports that the 501Y.V2 variant is possibly more virulent as indicated by the higher levels of D-dimer and IL-6, the slight increase in mortality of hospitalised patients and the higher ICU mortality in the second wave.","output":"COVID-19: A comparative study of severity of patients hospitalized during the first and the second wave in South Africa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This short essay aims to reflect on an unexpected effect of the Coronavirus in Italy: the increase of domestic violence.

RESULTS: Ninety patients (25.6% female), mean age 52.0  10.8 years, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VVECMO) (42.2%) were studied. A significantly higher proportion of patients were identified as having RV dysfunction by RV fractional area change (FAC) (72.0%,95% confidence interval (CI) 61.0C81.0) and RV velocity time integral (VTI) (86.4%, 95 CI 77.3C93.2) than by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) (23.8%, 95 CI 16.0C33.9), RVS (11.9%, 95% CI 6.6C20.5) or RV free wall strain (FWS) (35.3%, 95% CI 23.6C49.0).

Given that dreams are associated with mental health, understanding these changes could provide crucial information about wellbeing during the pandemic. This study explored associations between COVID-19 and dream recall frequency (DRF), and related social, health, and mental health factors. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional web survey of 19,355 individuals in 14 countries from May to July 2020. We collected data on COVID-19, mental health, sleep and DRF during the pandemic. We performed McNemar Tests to compare low (<3 nights per week) and high DRF (3 nights per week) before and during COVID-19 and to evaluate changes in sleep variables segmented by DRF. Chi-square tests were conducted to compare characteristics between low and high DRF. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between various independent variables and DRF. RESULTS: Reports of high DRF during the pandemic were higher than before the pandemic (P<0.001). Female gender (aOR=1.25, 95% CI 1.10C1.41), nightmares (aOR=4.22, 95% CI 3.45C5.17), sleep talking (aOR= 2.36, 1.73C3.23), sleep maintenance problems (aOR=1.34, 95% CI 1.15C1.56), symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD; aOR=1.24, 95% CI 1.09C1.41) and repeated disturbing thoughts (posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms) were associated with high DRF. Age group 55C64 years (aOR=0.69, 95% CI 0.58C0.83) reported less high DRF than younger participants. Unadjusted OR showed associations between depression, anxiety, and DRF; however, in adjusted regression depression (aOR= 0.71, 0.59C0.86) and anxiety (aOR=0.79, 95% CI 0.66C0.94) were negatively associated with high DRF. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: DRF was higher than pre-pandemic levels across four continents. DRF was associated with gender and parasomnias like nightmares and RBD symptoms, sleep maintenance problems, PTSD symptoms and negatively associated with depression and anxiety.

Its identification in large healthcare databases can help better characterize this risk. OBJECTIVE: To create an ICD-10 anaphylaxis algorithm, estimate its positive predictive values (PPVs) in a post-vaccination risk window, and estimate vaccination-attributable anaphylaxis rates in the Medicare Fee For Service (FFS) population. METHODS: An anaphylaxis algorithm with core and extended portions was constructed analyzing ICD-10 anaphylaxis claims data in Medicare FFS from 2015 to 2017. Cases of post-vaccination anaphylaxis among Medicare FFS beneficiaries were then identified from October 1, 2015 to February 28, 2019 utilizing vaccine relevant anaphylaxis ICD-10 codes. Information from medical records was used to determine true anaphylaxis cases based on the Brighton Collaboration's anaphylaxis case definition. PPVs were estimated for incident anaphylaxis and the subset of vaccine-attributable anaphylaxis within a 2-day post-vaccination risk window. Vaccine-attributable anaphylaxis rates in Medicare FFS were also estimated. RESULTS: The study recorded 66,572,128 vaccinations among 21,685,119 unique Medicare FFS beneficiaries. The algorithm identified a total of 190 suspected anaphylaxis cases within the 2-day post-vaccination window; of these 117 (62%) satisfied the core algorithm, and 73 (38%) additional cases satisfied the extended algorithm. The core algorithm's PPV was 66% (95% CI [56%, 76%]) for identifying incident anaphylaxis and 44% (95% CI [34%, 56%]) for vaccine-attributable anaphylaxis. The vaccine-attributable anaphylaxis incidence rate after any vaccination was 0.88 per million doses (95% CI [0.67, 1.16]).

Little to no work has been done to establish optimal design strategies and implementation plans to ease surge capacity and expand isolation capacity over long periods in congregate living facilities.

PURPOSE: In this study we designed, implemented, and validated an isolation space at a skilled nursing facility in Lancaster, PA. The overall goal was to minimize disease transmission between residents and staff within the facility. BASIC PROCEDURES: We created an isolation space by modifying an existing HVAC system of the SNF. We measured pressure on-site and performed computational fluid dynamics and Lagrangian particle-based modeling to test containment and possible transmission extent given the isolation space is considered negative rather than individual rooms. MAIN FINDINGS: Pressure data shows the isolation space maintained an average (standard deviation) hourly value of -2.3 Pa (0.12 Pa) pressure differential between it and the external hallway connected to the rest of the facility. No transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between residents isolated to the space occurred, nor did any transmission to the staff or other residents occur.

Birthing people with more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection category had higher maternal and cord blood IgG levels (p=0.0001, p=0.0001). Median IgG transfer ratio was 0.87-1.2. Maternal and cord blood IgG were higher after vaccination than infection (p=0.001, p=0.001). Transfer ratio was higher after 90 days in the vaccinated group (p<0.001). Modeling showed higher amplitude and half-life of maternal IgG following vaccination (p<0.0001). There were no significant differences by fetal sex. InterpretationCOVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy leads to higher and longer lasting maternal IgG levels, higher cord blood IgG, and higher transfer ratio after 90 days compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Greater infection severity leads to higher maternal and cord blood antibodies. Maternal IgG decreases over time following both vaccination and infection, reinforcing the importance of vaccination, even after infection, and vaccine boosters for pregnant patients.","output":"Maternal Antibody Response and Transplacental Transfer Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection or Vaccination in Pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A major complication in treating hemophilia A is the development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against therapeutic administered factor VIII (FVIII), which occurs in approximately 20-30% of patients with severe disease. These inhibitors render FVIII replacement therapy ineffective and increase the morbidity and mortality risk. The currently accepted method to eradicate inhibitors is immune tolerance induction (ITI), and frequent intensive administration of FVIII until inhibitor titers drop. Current ITI protocols are extremely costly and not effective in all patients. During the last decade, many types of research have been accomplished to clarify the mechanisms that mediate immune tolerance induction. Novel experimental therapies including monoclonal antibodies, viral vector-mediated gene therapy, regulatory T cell induction using immunosuppressive drugs, and nanoparticle-based immune modulation show promising results in hemophilia A clinical trials.

We used zero-inflated regression modeling to determine the strength of the associations between environmental justice variables and the location of CAFOs and meatpacking facilities at the State level and on the Eastern Shore. Hot spot analyses demonstrated that CAFO hot spots on the Eastern Shore were located in counties with some of the lowest wealth in the State, including the lowest ranking countySomerset. Zero-inflated regression models demonstrated that increases in median household income across the state were associated with a 0.04-unit reduction in CAFOs. For every unit increase in the percentage of people of color (POC), there was a 0.02-unit increase in meat processing facilities across the state.

No effective treatment is yet in sight for this catastrophic illness. Several antiviral agents and vaccines are in clinical trials, and drug repurposings as immediate and alternative choices are also under consideration. Immunomodulatory agents like hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as well as biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) such as tocilizumab and anakinra received worldwide attention for treatment of critical patients with COVID-19. This is of interest to rheumatologists, who are well versed with rational use of these agents. This brief review addresses the understandings of some of the common immunopathogenetic mechanisms in the context of autoimmune rheumatic diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and COVID-19. Apart from demographic comparisons, the role of type I interferons (IFN), presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and finally mechanism of action of HCQ in both the scenarios are discussed here. High risks for fatal disease in COVID-19 include older age, metabolic syndrome, male gender, and individuals who develop delayed type I IFN response. HCQ acts by different mechanisms including prevention of cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and inhibition of type I IFN signaling. Recent controversies regarding efficacy of HCQ in management of COVID-19 warrant more studies in that direction. Autoantibodies were also reported in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well as in COVID-19.

How this impacts on risk-stratification for patients requiring surgery for time-critical conditions, such as malignancy, requires further urgent investigation. MAIN BODY: The deleterious effect of sarcopenia and poor physical capacity are well recognised in cancer surgery. This review commentary highlights current evidence which suggests skeletal muscle as an under recognised cause of COVID-19-related functional deconditioning. The mechanisms behind this are via direct (viral induced myositis, nutritional decline, cytokine-mediated myopathy) and indirect mechanisms (social isolation, inactivity, and psychological consequences).

METHODS Primary end-points were safety and immunogenicity and secondary end-points were vaccine efficacy in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 symptomatic disease. The two intervention arms were compared to a matched control group. Eligible participants were healthcare-workers (HCW) vaccinated with three BNT162b2 doses, and whose IgG antibody levels were []700 BAU (40-percentile). IgG and neutralizing titers, direct neutralization of live VOCs, and T-cell activation were assessed. All participants were actively screened for SARS-CoV-2 infections on a weekly basis. RESULTS Of 1050 eligible HCW, 154 and 120 were enrolled to receive BNT162b2 and mRNA1273, respectively, and compared to 426 age-matched controls. Recipients of both vaccine types had a ~9-10-fold increase in IgG and neutralizing titers within 2 weeks of vaccination and an 8-fold increase in live Omicron VOC neutralization, restoring titers to those measured after the third vaccine dose. Breakthrough infections were common, mostly very mild, yet, with high viral loads. Vaccine efficacy against infection was 30% (95%CI:-9% to 55%) and 11% (95%CI:-43% to +43%) for BNT162b2 and mRNA1273, respectively. Local and systemic adverse reactions were reported in 80% and 40%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The fourth COVID-19 mRNA dose restores antibody titers to peak post-third dose titers.

METHODS We obtained eight quantitative measures from whole slide images (WSIs) from a benign breast disease (BBD) nested case-control study within the Nurses' Health Studies (287 breast cancer cases and 1083 controls). Qualitative assessments of TDLU involution were available for 177 cases and 857 controls. The associations between risk factors and quantitative measures among controls were assessed using analysis of covariance adjusting for age. The relationship between each measure and risk was evaluated using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for the matching factors, BBD subtypes, parity, and menopausal status. Qualitative measures and breast cancer risk were evaluated accounting for matching factors and BBD subtypes. RESULTS Menopausal status and parity were significantly associated with all eight measures; select TDLU measures were associated with BBD histological subtype, BMI, and birth index (p<0.05). No measure was correlated with body size at ages 5-10 years, age at menarche, age at first birth, or breastfeeding history (p>0.05).

However, a key aspect of a sustainable food system should be its ability to deliver nutrition to the global population. Quantifying nutrient adequacy with current tools is challenging. OBJECTIVE: To produce a computational model illustrating the nutrient adequacy of current and proposed global food systems. METHODS: The DELTA Model was constructed using global food commodity balance sheet data, alongside demographic and nutrient requirement data from UN and European Food Safety Authority sources. It also includes nutrient bioavailability considerations for protein, the indispensable amino acids, iron, and zinc, sourced from scientific literature. RESULTS: The DELTA Model calculates global per capita nutrient availability under conditions of equal distribution and identifies areas of nutrient deficiency for various food system scenarios. Modeling the 2018 global food system showed that it supplied insufficient calcium (64% of demographically weighted target intake) and vitamin E (69%), despite supplying sufficient macronutrients. Several future scenarios were modeled, including variations in waste; scaling up current food production for the 2030 global population; plant-based food production systems; and removing sugar crops from the global food system. Each of these scenarios fell short of meeting requirements for multiple nutrients. These results emphasize the need for a balanced approach in the design of future food systems. CONCLUSIONS: Nutrient adequacy must be at the forefront of the sustainable food system debate. The DELTA Model was designed for both experts and nonexperts to inform this debate as to what may be possible, practical, and optimal for our food system.

Protease-activated receptor 4 (PAR4) is a thrombin receptor that mediates platelet activation and is involved in inflammatory and apoptotic processes. Therefore, we investigated the role of PAR4 blockade in liver injury induced by BD and its associated mechanisms. In this study, we constructed a BD rat model and treated rats with TcY-NH2, a selective PAR4 antagonist, to block PAR4 signaling at the onset of BD induction. Our results revealed that PAR4 protein expression increased in the livers of rats with BD. PAR4 blockade alleviated liver injury induced by BD, as indicated by lower serum ALT/AST levels and an improvement in histomorphology. Blood platelet activation and hepatic platelet accumulation in BD rats were reduced by PAR4 blockade. Additionally, PAR4 blockade attenuated the inflammatory response and apoptosis in the livers of BD rats. Moreover, the activation of NF-B and MAPK pathways induced by BD was inhibited by PAR4 blockade. Thus, our results suggest that PAR4 contributes to liver injury induced by BD by regulating inflammation and apoptosis through the NF-B and MAPK pathways. Thus, PAR4 blockade may provide a feasible approach to improve the quality of organs from BD donors.","output":"Blocking protease-activated receptor 4 alleviates liver injury induced by brain death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During evolution, certain endoparasitoid wasps have developed mechanisms to suppress the defence systems of their hosts. For this purpose, these species, all of which belong to the families Ichneumonidae and Braconidae, inject various kinds of virus-like particles. The most studied of these particles are classified as polydnaviruses (family Polydnaviridae) which are symbiotic viruses. Over the past decade, it has also been shown that several wasp species harbour reoviruses (family Reoviridae), and that two of these suppress host defence, allowing the development of the parasitoid eggs. In this paper, we summarize the key features of these viruses and their relationships with their wasp hosts. Five reoviruses are known that appear to be non-pathogenic for the wasps. Three of these, McRVLP, HeRV, OpRVLP, use their wasp hosts as vectors, and do not appear to be involved in host defence suppression. The fourth, DpRV-1, is a commensal reovirus detected in most field populations of the wasp, Diadromus pulchellus. This reovirus is always found associated with an ascovirus, DpAV-4a, which is indispensable for host immune suppression. Although DpRV-1 has not been shown to directly increase D. pulchellus parasitic success, it may contribute to this success by retarding DpAV-4a replication in the wasp. The fifth reovirus, DpRV-2, occurs in a specific population of D. pulchellus in which DpRV-1 and DpAV-4 are absent. This virus has a mutualistic relationship with its wasp host, as its injection by females during oviposition is essential for host immunosuppression. Interestingly, these viruses belong to several different reovirus genera.","output":"Commensal and mutualistic relationships of reoviruses with their parasitoid wasp hosts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: The effectiveness of silver nanomaterials (AgNMs), as antiviral agents, has been confirmed in humans against many different types of viruses. Nanobiocides-based AgNMs can be effectively applied to eliminate coronaviruses (CoVs), as the cause of various diseases in animals and humans, particularly the fatal human respiratory infections. Mostly, these NMs act effectively against CoVs, thanks to the NMs fundamental anti-viral structures like reactive oxygen species (ROS), and photo-dynamic and photo-thermal abilities. Particularly, the antiviral activity of AgNMs is clarified under three inhibitory mechanisms including viral entry limitation, attachment inhibition, and viral replication limitation. It is believed that nanobiocide with other possible materials such as TiO(2), silica and, carbon NMs exclusively nano-graphene materials can emerge as a more effective disinfectant for long-term stability with low toxicity than common disinfectants. Nanobiocides also can be applied for the prevention and treatment of viral infections specifically against COVID-19.

The severity of the disease, combined with its rapid spread along international air-travel routes, prompted WHO to set up a network of scientists from 11 laboratories around the world to try to identify the causal agent and develop a diagnostic test. The network unites laboratories with different methods and capacities to rapidly fulfil all postulates for establishing a virus as the cause of a disease. Results are shared in real time via a secure website, on which microscopy pictures, protocols for testing, and PCR primer sequences are also posted. Findings are discussed in daily teleconferences. Progress is further facilitated through sharing between laboratories of samples and test materials. The network has identified a new coronavirus, consistently detected in samples of SARS patients from several countries, and conclusively named it as the causative agent of SARS; the strain is unlike any other known member of the genus Coronavirus.

However, the low nutrient utilization efficiency (NUE) is the main obstacle for attaining higher crop productivity and reducing nutrients losses from these fertilizers to the environment. Coating fertilizer with micronutrients and biopolymer can offer an opportunity to overcome these fertilizers associated problems. Here, we coated urea with zinc sulphate (ZnS) and ZnS plus molasses (ZnSM) to control its N release, decrease the ammonia (NH(3)) volatilization and improve N utilization efficiency by sunflower. Morphological analysis confirmed a uniform coating layer formation of both formulations on urea granules. A slow release of N from ZnS and ZnSM was observed in water. After soil application, ZnSM decreased the NH(3) emission by 38% compared to uncoated urea. Most of the soil parameters did not differ between ZnS and uncoated urea treatment. Microbial biomass N and Zn in ZnSM were 125 and 107% higher than uncoated urea, respectively. Soil mineral N in ZnSM was 21% higher than uncoated urea. Such controlled nutrient availability in the soil resulted in higher sunflower grain yield (53%), N (80%) and Zn (126%) uptakes from ZnSM than uncoated fertilizer. Hence, coating biopolymer with Zn on urea did not only increase the sunflower yield and N utilization efficiency but also meet the micronutrient Zn demand of sunflower. Therefore, coating urea with Zn plus biopolymer is recommended to fertilizer production companies for improving NUE, crop yield and reducing urea N losses to the environment in addition to fulfil crop micronutrient demand.","output":"Zinc Plus Biopolymer Coating Slows Nitrogen Release, Decreases Ammonia Volatilization from Urea and Improves Sunflower Productivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efforts to strengthen health information systems in low- and middle-income countries should include forging links with systems in other social and economic sectors. Governments are seeking comprehensive socioeconomic data on the basis of which to implement strategies for poverty reduction and to monitor achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The health sector is looking to take action on the social factors that determine health outcomes. But there are duplications and inconsistencies between sectors in the collection, reporting, storage and analysis of socioeconomic data. National offices of statistics give higher priority to collection and analysis of economic than to social statistics. The Report of the Commission for Africa has estimated that an additional US$ 60 million a year is needed to improve systems to collect and analyse statistics in Africa. Some donors recognize that such systems have been weakened by numerous international demands for indicators, and have pledged support for national initiatives to strengthen statistical systems, as well as sectoral information systems such as those in health and education. Many governments are working to coordinate information systems to monitor and evaluate poverty reduction strategies. There is therefore an opportunity for the health sector to collaborate with other sectors to lever international resources to rationalize definition and measurement of indicators common to several sectors; streamline the content, frequency and timing of household surveys; and harmonize national and subnational databases that store socioeconomic data.

We evaluate the performance of the first commercial surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT, GenScript Biotech) against SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) in convalescent and vaccinated individuals. We compare it to five other ELISAs, two of which are designed to detect neutralizing antibodies. ResultsIn 491 pre-vaccination serum samples, sVNT missed 23.6% of PRNT-positive samples when using the manufacturer-recommended cutoff of 30% binding inhibition. Introducing a equivocal area between 15 and 35% maximized sensitivity and specificity against PRNT to 72.8-93.1 % and 73.5- 97.6%, respectively. The overall diagnostic performance of the other ELISAs for neutralizing antibodies was below that of sVNT. Vaccinated individuals exhibited higher antibody titers by PRNT (median 119.8, IQR 56.7-160) and binding inhibition by sVNT (median 95.7, IQR 88.1-96.8) than convalescent patients (median 49.1, IQR 20-62; median 52.9, IQR 31.2-76.2). ConclusionGenScript sVNT is suitable to screen for SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies; however, to obtain accurate results, confirmatory testing by PRNT in a equivocal area is required.

Considering the physical distancing; travel restrictions; the high human-human transmission rate; misinformation and uncertainty about the sexual routes of transmission for SARS-CoV-2; and fear about intimacy, sexuality, and safe sexual practices have increased significantly. This is more prominent in newly settled or distanced couples and the frontline health workers, with increased risk exposure to the virus. For them, guilt and distress associated with sexual relationships might increase primary psychiatric and sexual disorders. This, in turn, impacts relationships and emotional bonding in couples and affects healthy coping during the pandemic crisis. Although sexual abstinence is the safest practice to prevent transmission, it is not practically feasible in all cases. Risk reduction counseling, sex with quarantined partners, and digital sex are other options that are worth exploring.

The main purpose of this study is to examine whether an 8-week IEMT programme can improve respiratory muscle strength and swallow dysfunction severity in subacute stroke patients with dysphagia. METHODS: Retornus-2 is a two-arm, prospectively registered, randomized controlled study with blinded assessors and the participation of fifty individuals who have suffered a stroke. The intervention group undergoes IEMT training consisting of 5 sets of 10 repetitions, three times a day for 8 weeks. Training loads increase weekly. The control group undergoes a sham-IEMT protocol. The primary outcome examines the efficacy of the IEMT protocol to increase respiratory muscle strength and reduce dysphagia severity. The secondary outcome assesses the longitudinal impact of dysphagia on body composition and nutritional assessment over a 6-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: IEMT induces an improvement in respiratory muscle strength and might be associated with relevant benefits in dysphagia patterns, as well as a reduction in the number of aspiration events confirmed by videofluoroscopy or fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing.

METHODS: A 33-item survey was developed by the Tic Disorders and Tourette syndrome Study Group members of the Movement Disorder Society. The survey was distributed to the complete society membership and included responses from 346 members, 314 of whom reported treating tic disorders. RESULTS: Approximately one third of survey respondents (35%) frequently evaluated patients with tics. The data revealed widespread use of existing guidelines (about 70%) and screening for comorbid disorders (>90%). The most common investigations used to rule out secondary causes of tics were imaging (92%), laboratory tests (66%) and neurophysiology (38%). Functional tics were the second most common tic etiology following primary tics. Only 27% of respondents reported confidence in knowledge about tic pathogenesis.

Anxiety and depression were measured using a 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS: 0C21) and insomnia was measured by using a 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI: 0C28). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to determine the risk factors of mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 41.9% of health workers had symptoms of anxiety, 37.5% had depression symptoms and 33.9% had symptoms of insomnia. Stigma faced by health workers was significantly associated with higher odds of experiencing symptoms of anxiety (AOR: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.62C3.76), depression (AOR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.34C3.11) and insomnia (AOR: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.46C3.84). History of medication for mental health problems was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing symptoms of anxiety (AOR: 3.40; 95% CI:1.31C8.81), depression (AOR: 3.83; 95% CI: 1.45C10.14) and insomnia (AOR: 3.82; 95% CI: 1.52C9.62) while inadequate precautionary measures in the workplace was significantly associated with higher odds of exhibiting symptoms of anxiety (AOR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.12C3.19) and depression (AOR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.16C3.37).

Serological tests monitored across the course of the second wave can provide insights into the population-level prevalence and dynamic patterns of COVID-19 infection. Objective: To assess changes in COVID-19 seroprevalence among asymptomatic employees working in Tokyo during the second wave. Design: We conducted an observational cohort study. Healthy volunteers working for a Japanese company in Tokyo were enrolled from disparate locations to determine seropositivity against COVID19 from May 26 to August 25, 2020. COVID-19 IgM and IgG antibodies were determined by a rapid COVID19 IgM/IgG test kit using fingertip blood. Across the company, tests were performed and acquired weekly. For each participant, serology tests were offered twice, separated by approximately a month, to provide self-reference of test results and to assess for seroconversion and seroreversion. Setting: Workplace setting within a large company. Participants: Healthy volunteers from 1877 employees of a large Japanese company were recruited to the study from 11 disparate locations across Tokyo. Participants having fever, cough, or shortness of breath at the time of testing were excluded. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Seropositivity rate (SPR) was calculated by pooled data from each two-weeks window across the cohort. Either IgM or IgG positivity was defined as seropositive. Changes in immunological status against SARS-CoV-2 were determined by comparing results between two tests obtained from the same individual. Results: Six hundred fifteen healthy volunteers (mean + SD 40.8 + 10.0; range 19-69; 45.7 % female) received at least one test. Seroprevalence increased from 5.8 % to 46.8 % over the course of the summer. The most dramatic increase in SPR occurred in late June and early July, paralleling the rise in daily confirmed cases within Tokyo, which peaked on August 4. Out of the 350 individuals (mean + SD 42.5 + 10.0; range 19-69; 46.0 % female) who completed both offered tests, 21.4 % of those individuals who tested seronegative became seropositive and seroreversion was found in 12.2 % of initially seropositive participants. 81.1% of IgM positive cases at first testing became IgM negative in approximately one month. Conclusions and Relevance: COVID-19 infection may have spread widely across the general population of Tokyo despite the very low fatality rate. Given the temporal correlation between the rise in seropositivity and the decrease in reported COVID-19 cases that occurred without a shut-down, herd immunity may be implicated. Sequential testing for serological response against COVID-19 is useful for understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 infection at the population-level.","output":"Dynamic Change of COVID-19 Seroprevalence among Asymptomatic Population in Tokyo during the Second Wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We hypothesized that patients with rheumatic diseases (RD) would have increased psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak; therefore, assessed their psychological symptoms and changes in their routine. A web-based questionnaire survey was conducted in a cross-sectional design in three groups of participants: (1.) patients with RD, (2.) hospital workers, and (3.) high-school teachers/academic staff. Psychiatric status was evaluated using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Impact of Event Scale-Revised scale. Overall response rate was 34.7%. We studied 771 patients with RD, 535 hospital workers, and 917 teachers/academic staff. Most of the patients with RD were unwilling to go to the hospital (86%), while 22% discontinued their medications. Biological DMARDS were the most frequent drugs whose doses were altered. Only 4% were willing to take hydroxychloroquine for protection. Moreover, the frequency of anxiety (20%), depression (43%), and post-traumatic stress (28%) among patients with RD were found to be comparable to that found among the teachers/academic staff (23%, 43% and 29%, respectively), whereas significantly less than that observed among the hospital workers (40%, 62%, and 46%, respectively) (p < 0.001). Female gender, use of social media, having a comorbid disease, or a psychiatric disorder were found to be independently associated with psychiatric symptoms in total study population. The majority of the patients were unwilling to attend outpatient visits and one-fifth skipped or stopped their immunosuppressive agents. Psychiatric symptoms in patients and teachers populations were of considerable clinical concern, despite being significantly lower than that observed among the hospital workers.

Notwithstanding the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on molecular biology approaches including multiplex or singleplex real time RT-PCR, there is a real need for affordable and rapid serological methods to support diagnostics, and surveillance of infection spreading. In this study, we performed a diagnostic accuracy analysis of COVID-19 IgG/IgM rapid test cassette lateral flow immunoassay test (LFIA) assay. To do so, we analyzed different cohorts of blood samples obtained from 151 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay positive patients (group 1) and 51 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay negative patients (group 2) in terms of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and likelihood ratios. In addition, we challenged LFIA with plasma from 99 patients stored during 2015C2017 period. Our results showed that this LFIA detected SARS-CoV-2 IgM and/or IgG in 103 out of 151 (68.21%) samples of group 1, whereas no IgM and/or IgG detection was displayed both in the group 2 and in pre-pandemic samples. Interestingly, IgM and/or IgG positivity was detected in 86 out of 94 (91.49%) group 1 samples collected after 10 days from symptoms onset whereas only 17 out of 57 of group 1 samples obtained before day 10 were positive to SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies.

However, the demands of COVID-19 research for timely RWD (e.g., 2-week delay) make this less feasible. Methods and Materials: We describe the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model as a canonical model for representation of clinical data for automated transformation to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs and the near automated production of linked clinical data repositories (CDRs) for COVID-19 research using the FHIR subscription standard. The approach was applied to healthcare data from a large academic institution and was evaluated using published quality assessment tools.

This is why nephrologists in many centers have begun to create arteriovenous fistulas themselves. The aim of this study was to determine possible differences and predictive parameters for arteriovenous fistula function in patients whose fistulas were created by a nephrologist or a vascular surgeon. METHODS: The study was organized as a retrospective, descriptive-analytical study of interventions by nephrologists and vascular surgeons during a period of 15 years. The total number of arteriovenous fistulae created by surgical interventions in this interval was 1048. A nephrologist created them in 764 (72.9%) patients, while vascular surgeons were responsible for 284 (27.1%) fistulae. All laboratory, demographic, and clinical parameters which might affect functioning of these arteriovenous fistulae were analyzed. RESULTS: Patients whose arteriovenous fistula was formed by the nephrologist differed significantly from those created by vascular surgeons in relation to positioning of the anastomosis (p <0.001), the preventive character of the arteriovenous fistula (p <0.001), lumen of the vein (p = 0.004) and systolic blood pressure (p = 0.02).

The results reveal processes of different nature and express the effect of the dominance of the Community agricultural policy on the economic conjuncture for the development of agriculture in our country. The dichotomy in the used agricultural area is an expression of increased competitiveness, which is inherent mainly in the production of extensive crops, with the presence of significant features for monoculture agriculture. At the same time, systemic problems in the intensive crops stand out, for the production of which Bulgaria possesses monopoly natural-climatic conditions. These results highlight the role of land relations and reveal/bring out potential opportunities for increasing the importance of agriculture in improving public relations and the socio-economic environment not only in the sector but also in the country as a whole. The Covid-19 challenge creates the preconditions for re-evaluating some existing stereotypes. The results of surveys over the last ten years reveal processes of consolidation of the utilized agricultural area and its concentration in a small number of large agricultural holdings. Extensive crop production is increasing. Intensive production, vegetables, fruit and livestock fall into the group of vulnerable sectors. The number of small actors is decreasing;the processes of medium-sized ones are unstable. This creates difficulties in establishing sustainable family farms and is a potential risk of depopulation in some rural areas in Bulgaria. The registered processes are in dissonance with the goal setting of the Common agricultural policy (CAP).

We develop a robust COVID-19 Community Risk Score (C-19 Risk Score) that summarizes the complex disease co-occurrences for individual census tracts with unsupervised learning, selected on their basis for association with risk for COVID complications, such as death. We mapped the C19 Risk Score onto neighborhoods in New York City and associated the score with C-19 related death. Last, we predict the C-19 Risk Score using satellite image data to map the built environment in C-19 Risk. Results. The C-19 Risk Score describes 85% of variation in co-occurrence of 15 diseases that are risk factors for COVID complications among 26K census tract neighborhoods (median population size of tracts: 4,091).

We propose a model that couples epidemic spreading and resource diffusion in multiplex networks. The spread of disease in a physical contact layer and the recovery of the infected nodes are both strongly dependent upon resources supplied by their counterparts in the social layer. The generation and diffusion of resources in the social layer are in turn strongly dependent upon the state of the nodes in the physical contact layer. Resources diffuse preferentially or randomly in this model. To quantify the degree of preferential diffusion, a bias parameter that controls the resource diffusion is proposed. We conduct extensive simulations and find that the preferential resource diffusion can change phase transition type of the fraction of infected nodes. When the degree of interlayer correlation is below a critical value, increasing the bias parameter changes the phase transition from double continuous to single continuous. When the degree of interlayer correlation is above a critical value, the phase transition changes from multiple continuous to first discontinuous and then to hybrid. We find hysteresis loops in the phase transition. We also find that there is an optimal resource strategy at each fixed degree of interlayer correlation where the threshold reaches a maximum and under which the disease can be maximally suppressed.

Among one of the most pressing concerns is that behavior analysts commonly rely on direct observation of behavior to make data-based decisions regarding client treatment plans. The shift to a telehealth model in light of the COVID-19 pandemic requires behavior analysts to quickly adapt the manner in which many have been providing services. Although many behavior analysts may be familiar with various technologies, they may struggle to identify the benefits and limitations of each technology in terms of providing telehealth. Selecting an appropriate technology that allows behavior analysts to stay true to the science of behavior analysis is prudent.

Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective and effective methods of preventing infectious diseases in the modern world, including one of the most effective methods of combating COVID-19. Over several centuries of history, vaccination has proven its effectiveness in saving people's lives, reducing the spread of infectious diseases among the population, as well as reducing mortality. The effectiveness of immunization against COVID-19 is an urgent problem at the moment, especially when it comes to vaccination. The aim of the work is to study the effect of vaccination on the incidence of a new coronavirus infection among residents of the Saratov Region. Material and methods. Methods of retrospective epidemiological analysis of trends in the epidemic process COVID-19 were used. The obtained materials were processed using methods of variational statistics (Excel program). The analysis was based on data from daily monitoring of laboratory diagnostic results (more than 1780 thousand PCR diagnostic studies were conducted during the epidemic), COVID-19 cases and deaths, taking into account the coverage of the population with preventive vaccinations. The statistical significance of the differences was assessed according to the Student's criterion. The differences were considered significant at t2. Results and discussion. As of June 30, 2021, more than 267 thousand people or 11% of the population of the Saratov region were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. There were no complications after the introduction of vaccines. In the structure of all medical immunobiological preparations that were immunized, the proportion of the vaccine Gam-COVID-Vac was 97.88%, Epivaccorona - 1.69% and Covivac - 0.43%. According to preliminary data, 361 of the vaccinated people were infected with SARS-CoV-2, of which: 255 (70.6%) had a mild course of the disease with manifestations of catarrhal syndrome, 84 (23.3%) had community-acquired pneumonia, 22 (6%) had no symptoms of the disease. No deaths have been registered among the vaccinated. The overall incidence of COVID-19 among vaccinated was 0.06%. The incidence rate of COVID-19 among the vaccinated population is 6.0250.15 per 10 thousand people, which is significantly lower (t>2) than among the unvaccinated (103.80.63 per 10 thousand people), efficiency index - 17.23, epidemiological efficiency coefficient - 94.20% Conclusion. Insufficient coverage of the population of the Saratov Region with vaccination (as of June 30, 2021, 11% were fully vaccinated) does not allow to influence the reduction of the incidence of COVID-19.

In this study, the concentrations of ?-cyclocitral in different bacterial growth phases were investigated using GC-MS to determine the growth stage of Microcystis aeruginosa at high risk for ?-cyclocitral production. Moreover, the synchronicity of the production of ?-cyclocitral and its precursor ?-carotene at both population and single-cell levels was assessed. The results indicated that ?-cyclocitral was the main odorous compound produced by M. aeruginosa cells. The intracellular concentration of ?-cyclocitral (C?-cc) as well as its cellular quota (Q?-cc) increased synchronously in the log phase, along with the increase of cell density. However, they reached the maximum values of 415 g/L and 10.7 fg/cell in the late stationary phase and early stationary phase, respectively. The early stage of the stationary phase is more important for ?-cyclocitral monitoring, and the sharp increase in Q?-cc is valuable for anticipating the subsequent increase in C?-cc. The molar concentrations of ?-cyclocitral and ?-carotene showed a linear relationship, with an R2 value of 0.92, suggesting that the production of ?-cyclocitral was linearly dependent on that of ?-carotene, especially during the log phase. However, the increase in Q?-cc was slower than that in ?-carotene during the stationary phase, suggesting that ?-cyclocitral production turned to be carotene oxygenase-limited when the growth rate decreased. These results demonstrate that variations of ?-cyclocitral production on a single-cell level during different bacterial growth phases should be given serious consideration when monitoring and controlling the production of odorous compounds by M. aeruginosa blooms.","output":"Production of ?-Cyclocitral and Its Precursor ?-Carotene in Microcystis aeruginosa: Variation at Population and Single-Cell Levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues, little guidance is available on clinical indicators for safely discharging patients with severe COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical courses of adult patients admitted for COVID-19 and identify associations between inpatient clinical features and post-discharge need for acute care. DESIGN: Retrospective chart reviews were performed to record laboratory values, temperature, and oxygen requirements of 99 adult inpatients with COVID-19. Those variables were used to predict emergency department (ED) visit or readmission within 30 days post-discharge. PATIENTS (OR PARTICIPANTS): Age  18 years, first hospitalization for COVID-19, admitted between March 1 and May 2, 2020, at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Center, managed by an inpatient medicine service. MAIN MEASURES: Ferritin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, procalcitonin, white blood cell count, absolute lymphocyte count, temperature, and oxygen requirement were noted. KEY RESULTS: Of 99 patients, five required ED admission within 30 days, and another five required readmission. Fever within 24 h of discharge, oxygen requirement, and laboratory abnormalities were not associated with need for ED visit or readmission within 30 days of discharge after admission for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that neither persistent fever, oxygen requirement, nor laboratory marker derangement was associated with need for acute care in the 30-day period after discharge for severe COVID-19.

We aimed to develop a deep learning algorithm on the basis of chest CT for rapid triaging in fever clinics. METHODS: We trained a U-Net-based model on unenhanced chest CT scans obtained from 2447 patients admitted to Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Feb 1, 2020, and March 3, 2020 (1647 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and 800 patients without COVID-19) to segment lung opacities and alert cases with COVID-19 imaging manifestations. The ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to triage patients suspected to have COVID-19 was assessed in a large external validation set, which included 2120 retrospectively collected consecutive cases from three fever clinics inside and outside the epidemic centre of Wuhan (Tianyou Hospital [Wuhan, China; area of high COVID-19 prevalence], Xianning Central Hospital [Xianning, China; area of medium COVID-19 prevalence], and The Second Xiangya Hospital [Changsha, China; area of low COVID-19 prevalence]) between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 14, 2020. To validate the sensitivity of the algorithm in a larger sample of patients with COVID-19, we also included 761 chest CT scans from 722 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 treated in a makeshift hospital (Guanggu Fangcang Hospital, Wuhan, China) between Feb 21, 2020, and March 6, 2020. Additionally, the accuracy of AI was compared with a radiologist panel for the identification of lesion burden increase on pairs of CT scans obtained from 100 patients with COVID-19. FINDINGS: In the external validation set, using radiological reports as the reference standard, AI-aided triage achieved an area under the curve of 0953 (95% CI 0949C0959), with a sensitivity of 0923 (95% CI 0914C0932), specificity of 0851 (0842C0860), a positive predictive value of 0790 (0777C0803), and a negative predictive value of 0948 (0941C0954). AI took a median of 055 min (IQR: 043C063) to flag a positive case, whereas radiologists took a median of 1621 min (1167C2571) to draft a report and 2306 min (1567C3920) to release a report. With regard to the identification of increases in lesion burden, AI achieved a sensitivity of 0962 (95% CI 0947C1000) and a specificity of 0875 (95 %CI 0833C0923). The agreement between AI and the radiologist panel was high (Cohen's kappa coefficient 0839, 95% CI 0718C0940). INTERPRETATION: A deep learning algorithm for triaging patients with suspected COVID-19 at fever clinics was developed and externally validated. Given its high accuracy across populations with varied COVID-19 prevalence, integration of this system into the standard clinical workflow could expedite identification of chest CT scans with imaging indications of COVID-19.

However, the physiological demands of singing, whether it can be considered exercise, and its intensity as a physical activity are not well understood. We therefore compared cardiorespiratory parameters while completing components of Singing for Lung Health (SLH) sessions, with treadmill walking at differing speeds (2, 4, and 6km/hr). Eight healthy adults were included, none of whom reported regular participation in formal singing activities. Singing induced physiological responses that were consistent with moderate intensity activity (METS: median 4.12, IQR 2.72 - 4.78), with oxygen consumption, heart rate, and volume per breath above those seen walking at 4km/hr. Minute ventilation was higher during singing (median 22.42L/min, IQR 16.83 - 30.54) than at rest (11L/min, 9 - 13), lower than 6km/hr walking (30.35L/min, 26.94 - 41.11), but not statistically different from 2km/hr (18.77L/min, 16.89 - 21.35) or 4km/hr (23.27L/min, 20.09 - 26.37) walking.

Ovarian cyclicity and uterine involution are delayed when there is uterine dysbiosis (overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria). Fertility in dairy cows may involve a mechanism through which the uterine microbiota affects ovarian cyclicity as well as the transcriptome of the endometrium within the involuting uterus. The hypothesis was that the transcriptome of the endometrium in postpartum cows would be associated with the cyclicity status of the cow as well as the microbiota during uterine involution. The endometrium of first lactation dairy cows was sampled at 1, 5, and 9 weeks postpartum. All cows were allowed to return to cyclicity without intervention until week 5 and treated with an ovulation synchronization protocol so that sampling at week 9 was on day 13 of the estrous cycle. The endometrial microbiota was measured by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and principal component analysis. The endometrial transcriptome was measured by mRNA sequencing, differential gene expression analysis, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. RESULTS The endometrial microbiota changed from week 1 to week 5 but the week 5 and week 9 microbiota were similar. The endometrial transcriptome differed for cows that were either cycling or not cycling at week 5 and cyclicity status depended in part on the endometrial microbiota. Compared with cows cycling at week 5, there were large changes in the transcriptome of cows that progressed from non-cycling at week 5 to cycling at week 9. There was evidence for concurrent and longer-term associations between the endometrial microbiota and transcriptome. The week 1 endometrial microbiota had the greatest effect on the subsequent endometrial transcriptome and this effect was greatest at week 5 and diminished by week 9. CONCLUSIONS The cumulative response of the endometrial transcriptome to the microbiota represented the combination of past microbial exposure and current microbial exposure. The endometrial transcriptome in postpartum cows, therefore, depended on the immediate and longer-term effects of the uterine microbiota that acted directly on the uterus. There may also be an indirect mechanism through which the microbiome affects the transcriptome through the restoration of ovarian cyclicity postpartum.","output":"Concurrent and long-term associations between the endometrial microbiota and endometrial transcriptome in postpartum dairy cows."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT To assist nurses caring for hospitalized adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the authors synthesize evidence-based information on the disease, providing background on the epidemiology and history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative virus.

We then compare these patterns to data on reported cases of coronavirus disease and testing practices from different states in the United States from March 4 to August 30, 2020. We find that changes in testing practices and delays in reporting can result in biased estimates of R0 and Rt. Examination of changes in the daily number of tests conducted and the percent of patients testing positive may be helpful for identifying the potential direction of bias.

While the fundamental causes of this resurgence remain the subject of much conjecture, the study of historical patterns of pathogen diffusion can be illuminating. Here, we examined time series of pertussis incidence in the boroughs of Greater London from 1982 to 2013 to document the spatial epidemiology of this bacterial infection and to identify the potential drivers of its percolation. The incidence of pertussis over this period is characterized by 3 distinct stages: a period exhibiting declining trends with 4-year inter-epidemic cycles from 1982 to 1994, followed by a deep trough until 2006 and the subsequent resurgence. We observed systematic temporal trends in the age distribution of cases and the fade-out profile of pertussis coincident with increasing national vaccine coverage from 1982 to 1990. To quantify the hierarchy of epidemic phases across the boroughs of London, we used the Hilbert transform. We report a consistent pattern of spatial organization from 1982 to the early 1990s, with some boroughs consistently leading epidemic waves and others routinely lagging. To determine the potential drivers of these geographic patterns, a comprehensive parallel database of borough-specific features was compiled, comprising of demographic, movement and socio-economic factors that were used in statistical analyses to predict epidemic phase relationships among boroughs. Specifically, we used a combination of a feed-forward neural network (FFNN), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to quantify the contribution of each covariate to model predictions. Our analyses identified a number of predictors of a boroughs historical epidemic phase, specifically the age composition of households, the number of agricultural and skilled manual workers, latitude, the population of public transport commuters and high-occupancy households. Univariate regression analysis of the 2012 epidemic identified the ratio of cumulative unvaccinated children to the total population and population of Pakistan-born population to have moderate positive and negative association, respectively, with the timing of epidemic. In addition to providing a comprehensive overview of contemporary pertussis transmission in a large metropolitan population, this study has identified the characteristics that determine the spatial spread of this bacterium across the boroughs of London.","output":"Dissecting recurrent waves of pertussis across the boroughs of London"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a promising procedure for the surgical treatment of morbid obesity. We report our 2-year experience with LSG and specifically evaluate the importance of staple-line protection to prevent leakage after the laparoscopic procedure. METHODS One hundred eighteen consecutive patients with BMI > 30 who underwent LSG from January 2006 to February 2009 were included in our study. There were 88 women and 30 men with a mean age of 33.2  9.6 years and a mean BMI of 38.0  6.4 kg/m(2). The first 40 patients (group 1) underwent the operation without any reinforcement procedure and the other 78 patients received reinforcement of the staple-line (group 2). Data including demographics, hospital stay, blood loss, operative time, complications, excess weight loss percentage (EWL%), and gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) were collected prospectively for evaluation. RESULTS The overall mean operative time was 118.5  37.0 min, mean blood loss was 56.8  56.7 ml, mean hospital stay was 5  3 days. The mean EWL% at 12 and 24 months was 81.5 and 76.0%, respectively.
