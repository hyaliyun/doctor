Although molecular mechanisms are yet to be substantiated by scientific evidence, hypoxemia remains an independent worsening factor in serious COVID 19 patients.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in social relationships in a U.S. population sample during a time of social distancing. METHODS: We deployed a matched, longitudinal survey design of the National Institutes of Health Adult Social Relationship Scales to assess the social aspects of emotional support, instrumental support, friendship, loneliness, perceived hostility, and perceived rejection from a time without social distancing (February 2018) to a time where social distancing directives were active (May 2020). Changes in social relationships were compared using paired t-tests, and generalized linear regression models were constructed to identify subpopulations experiencing differential changes in each subdomain of social relationships during social distancing. RESULTS: Within our sample population, individuals experienced an increased sense of emotional support, instrumental support, and loneliness, and decreased feelings of friendship and perceived hostility during a period of social distancing. Individuals with low self-rated health experienced a decreased sense of emotional support, and females experienced increased feelings of loneliness compared with males. CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing measurably impacts social relationships and may have a disproportionate impact on females and individuals with lower self-rated health. If novel emergent infectious diseases become more commonplace, social interventions may be needed to mitigate the potential adverse impact of social distancing on social relationships.","output":"Changes in social relationships during an initial \\"stay-at-home\\" phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal survey study in the U.S"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: COVID-19 is a new disease, knowledge on the mode of transmission and clinical features are still evolving, new tests are being developed with inherent challenges regarding interpretation of tests results.

To address this health inequity, a nationwide pharmacy chain implemented telephonic Advanced Care (AC) outreach for patients with diabetes. During the AC call, pharmacists used motivational interviewing techniques to counsel patients on the importance of closing gaps in care and reducing barriers to medication adherence. Gaps included timely A1C testing, exams (eye, foot, kidney), immunizations (influenza, pneumonia, Hepatitis B), and recommendation of additional therapies for patients with multiple chronic conditions (ACE/ARB, statins). Medication fill gaps were compared between the Intervention period (8/1/20-1/31/-21) and a pre-intervention period (2/1/20-7/31/20).

The aim of this study was therefore to determine age-related differences in structural and functional properties of primary nasal epithelial cultures from healthy children and non-smoking elderly people. To achieve this goal, highly differentiated nasal epithelial cultures were established from nasal brushes at airCliquid interface and used to study epithelial cell type composition, mucin (MUC5AC and MUC5B) expression, and ion transport properties. Furthermore, we determined age-dependent molecular signatures using global proteomic analysis. We found lower numeric densities of ciliated cells and higher levels of MUC5AC expression in cultures from children vs. elderly people. Bioelectric studies showed no differences in basal ion transport properties, ENaC-mediated sodium absorption, or CFTR-mediated chloride transport, but detected decreased calcium-activated TMEM16A-mediated chloride secretory responses in cultures from children vs. elderly people. Proteome analysis identified distinct age-dependent molecular signatures associated with ciliation and mucin biosynthesis, as well as other pathways implicated in aging.

They were admitted for maternity care at a tertiary center between May to September 2020. The data was collected during their hospital stay and subsequently by telephonic or in-person interviews at 4-6 weeks and 8-10 weeks postpartum for contraceptive use, breastfeeding and use of facemask and hand-hygiene. Results: Sixty-three (59.4%) women had vaginal delivery and 43 (40.6%) required cesarean-section. Only one of the 98 newborns who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 turned out positive. Initiation of breastfeeding was delayed by an average of three days due to preparing the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) report. Exclusive breastfeeding was practiced by 69% and mixed feeding by 26%. Pre breastfeeding hand hygiene and facemask use declined after discharge (100% to 53.75% at 8-10 weeks postpartum).

Many people are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. However, in some cases (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities) the disease may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction that can lead to death. Such wide interindividual differences in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection may relate to several pathogen- and host-related factors. These include the different levels of the ubiquitously present human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors gene expression and its variant alleles, the different binding affinities of ACE2 to the virus spike (S) protein given its L- and S-subtypes and the subsequent extent of innate immunity-related hypercytokinemia. The extensive synthesis of cytokines and chemokines in coronavirus diseases was suggested as a major factor in exacerbating lung damage and other fatal complications. The polymorphisms in genes coding for pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been associated with mediating the response and susceptibility to a wide range of infections and their severe outcomes.

Therefore we developed a mobile app intervention for ICU clinicians and family members called ICUconnect that assists with delivering need-based care. OBJECTIVE To describe the methods and early experiences of a clustered randomized clinical trial (RCT) being conducted to compare ICUconnect vs. usual care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The goal of this two-arm, parallel group clustered RCT is to determine the clinical impact of the ICUconnect intervention in improving outcomes overall and for each racial subgroup on reducing racial disparities in core palliative care outcomes over a 3-month follow up period. ICU attending physicians are randomized to either ICUconnect or usual care, with outcomes obtained from family members of ICU patients. The primary outcome is change in unmet palliative care needs measured by the NEST instrument between baseline and 3 days post-randomization. Secondary outcomes include goal concordance of care and interpersonal processes of care at 3 days post-randomization; length of stay; as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder at 3 months post-randomization. We will use hierarchical linear models to compare outcomes between the ICUconnect and usual care arms within all participants and assess for differential intervention effects in Blacks and Whites by adding a patient-race interaction term. We hypothesize that both compared to usual care as well as among Blacks compared to Whites, ICUconnect will reduce unmet palliative care needs, psychological distress and healthcare resource utilization while improving goal concordance and interpersonal processes of care.

This disease generates substantial economic losses every year worldwide as a result of increased morbidity and mortality. Escherichia coli, one of the pathogens associated with NCD, can express several fimbrial and afimbrial adhesins. The objective of this study was to assess the presence of clpG, f5, f17A, f17G(II), and f17G(I) genes that encode three important adhesins expressed in diarrheagenic E. coli: F5, F17 and CS31A, isolated from feces of calves in Uruguay. METHODOLOGY Feces of 86 (70 diarrheic and 16 healthy) calves, from 15 animal facilities in Uruguay, were collected between 2012 and 2013. Biochemical and molecular identification were performed to finally obtain 298 E. coli isolates. Partial amplification of adhesion-related genes was performed by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS The most prevalent gene was f17A (31.2%), followed by f17G(II), clpG, f17G(I) and f5 (25.8%, 17.5%, 3.7% and 0.7%, respectively). All genes were present in diarrheic and healthy animals except f5 and f17G(I); these genes were present only in affected calves, although in low numbers.

Endovascular rescue therapies (ERT) have proven beneficial in selected cases. However, angioplasty (AP) and intraarterial lysis (IAL) are measures of last resort and prospective, quantitative results regarding the efficacy (cerebral oxygenation, metabolism) are largely lacking. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of ERTs for medically refractory vasospasm using multimodal, continuous event neuromonitoring. METHODS To detect cerebral compromise in a timely fashion, sedated patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage received continuous neuromonitoring (p ti O 2 measurement, intraparenchymal microdialysis). ERT (AP and/or IAL) was considered in cases of clinically relevant vasospasm refractory to conservative treatment measures. Oxygen saturation and cerebral and systemic metabolism before and after events of ERT was recorded. RESULTS We prospectively included 13 consecutive patients and recorded a total of 25 ERT events: AP (n = 10), IAL (n = 11), or both (AP + IAL, n = 4). Average cerebral p ti O 2 was 10  11 torr before and 49  22 torr after ERT ( P < .001), with a lactate-pyruvate ratio decreasing from 146.6  119.0 to 27.9  10.7 after ERT ( P < .001). Comparable improvement was observed for each type of intervention (AP, IAL, or both). No significant alterations in systemic metabolism could be detected after ERT. CONCLUSION Multimodal event neuromonitoring is able to quantify treatment efficacy in subarachnoid hemorrhage-related vasospasm. In our small cohort of highly selected cases, ERT was associated with improvement in cerebral oxygenation and metabolism with reasonable outcome. Event neuromonitoring may facilitate individual and timely optimization of treatment modality according to the individual clinical course.","output":"Endovascular Rescue Therapies for Refractory Vasospasm After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Prospective Evaluation Study Using Multimodal, Continuous Event Neuromonitoring."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Africa has defied predictions of being the worst hit by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which has devastated Europe, the Americas, and some Asian countries.

The way in which mechanical ventilation is applied during VV-ECMO is not clear, however it is associated with prognosis. Currently, the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients that receive VV-ECMO stands at approximately 50%. Here, we report three patients that successfully recovered from COVID-19-induced ARDS after VV-ECMO and implementation of an ultra-protective ventilation. This ventilation strategy involved maintaining a peak inspiratory pressure of &#8804;20 cmH2O and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of &#8804; 10 cmH2O, which are lower values than have been previously reported. Thus, we suggest that this ultra-protective ventilation be considered during VV-ECMO as it minimizes the ventilator-induced lung injury.","output":"Case Report of Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Caused by COVID-19: Successfully Treated by Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation and an Ultra-Protective Ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The present narrative review provides a comprehensive update of the current knowledge on urticaria, both in adult and pediatric populations, and on the safety and efficacy of fexofenadine hydrochloride (HCl) as a treatment option.

RESULTS: Although the exact pathogenesis of urticaria is not fully understood, multiple pathways of mast cell activation are discussed to explain the existence of phenotypically different clinical manifestations of urticaria. An overview of the worldwide prevalence of chronic urticaria, including disease burden and patients quality of life is provided. The impact of urticaria on patients life differs on the basis of whether its form is acute or chronic, but pharmacological approaches are most often needed to control the disabling symptoms. A summary of the current management of urticaria recommended by different guidelines across countries (Global; European; American; Australian; Asian; Japanese) is presented. Non-sedating, second-generation H(1)-antihistamines are the preferred choice of treatment across several guidelines worldwide. Herein, the efficacy and safety of fexofenadine HCl, a representative second-generation H(1)-antihistamine approved for the treatment of urticaria, is discussed. The occurrence of urticaria manifestations in COVID-19 patients is also briefly presented. CONCLUSION: The burden of acute and chronic urticaria is high for patients.

Female rats of substrain B gained 5 g per day and males gained 8 g. Animals were implanted with a stainless steel guide cannula, allowing ICV injections into the lateral ventricle. ICV injections of 1, 5, or 10 g of oxytocin or isotonic saline in a volume of 5 l were given. In females, ICV treatment with either saline or 5 g of oxytocin caused a transient loss of weight within 24 h of treatment. However, in the more slowly growing females of substrain A depression in body weight was observed after a single treatment with saline, whereas the body weight of oxytocin-treated females showed less marked depression and rapidly returned to the pretreatment weight. After a 3-day treatment period an even greater difference in daily weight gain was seen between oxytocin-treated and saline-treated female rats of substrain A. In contrast, no difference in daily weight gain or food intake was observed between oxytocin- and saline-treated male rats of substrain A, nor in females or males of the more rapidly growing substrain B.

METHODS: IR procedural volumes were compiled, stratified by location and compared with Diagnostic Radiology (DR) volumes during the same timeframe. Procedure volume was categorized by type, including oncology, dialysis interventions, and drainage procedures with comparisons made using Z-score test for proportions. IR and system-wide surgical procedural volume was compared with baseline values. RESULTS: System-wide IR procedural volume decreased by 35%, with a 41% decrease in outpatient and a 25% decrease in inpatient volume during the state-mandated order. DR volume decreased by 45%, with a 57% decrease in outpatient and a 22% decrease in inpatient volume. Total IR procedural volume during the mandate was 1077 versus 1518 during the preceding six weeks. The proportion of Interventional Oncology and dialysis interventions showed no significant change (p > 0.05) while that of drainage procedures increased (p < 0.05). Compared to baseline values, system-wide procedural volumes for IR, Vascular Surgery, Urology, General Surgery, Gastroenterology and Gynecology decreased by 3%, 11%, 25%, 20%, 38% and 31% in March 2020 and 25%, 47%, 68%, 63%, 79% and 73% in April 2020 respectively. CONCLUSION: Outpatient IR volumes were less impacted compared to DR during the initial phase of COVID-19.

However, certain non-heparin medications (pentosan polysulfate, hypersulfated chondroitin sulfate, fondaparinux) can trigger \\"HIT\\". Further, naturally-occurring polyanions (bacterial lipopolysaccharide, DNA/RNA) can interact with PF4 to recapitulate HIT antigens. Indeed, immunologic presensitization to naturally-occurring polyanions could explain why HIT more closely resembles a secondary, rather than a primary, immune response. In 2008 it was first reported that a HIT-mimicking disorder can occur without any preceding exposure to heparin or polyanionic medications. Termed \\"spontaneous HIT syndrome\\", two subtypes are recognized: (a) surgical (post-orthopedic, especially post-total knee arthroplasty, and (b) medical (usually post-infectious). Recently, COVID-19 adenoviral vector vaccination has been associated with a thrombotic thrombocytopenic disorder associated with positive PF4-dependent enzyme-immunoassays and serum-induced platelet activation that is maximal when PF4 is added. Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) features unusual thromboses (cerebral venous thrombosis, splanchnic vein thrombosis) similar to those seen in spontaneous HIT syndrome. The emerging concept is that classic HIT reflects platelet-activating anti-PF4/heparin antibodies whereas spontaneous HIT syndrome and other atypical \\"autoimmune HIT\\" presentations (delayed-onset HIT, persisting HIT, heparin \\"flush\\" HIT) reflect heparin-independent platelet-activating anti-PF4 antibodies-although the precise relationships between PF4 epitope targets and the clinical syndromes remain to be determined.

By analysing the transmission dynamics during the first wave of COVID-19 in the country, the effectiveness of the various levels of control actions taken to flatten the curve can be better quantified and understood. This in turn can help the relevant authorities to better plan for and control the subsequent waves of the pandemic. To achieve this, a deterministic population model for the pandemic is firstly developed to take into consideration the time-dependent characteristics of the model parameters, especially on the ever-evolving value of the reproduction number, which is one of the critical measures used to describe the transmission dynamics of this pandemic. The reproduction number alongside other key parameters of the model can then be estimated by fitting the model to real-world data using numerical optimisation techniques or by inducing ad-hoc control actions as recorded in the news platforms. In this paper, the model is verified using a case study based on the data from the first wave of COVID-19 in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The model is fitted to provide estimates for two settings in simulations;time-invariant and time-varying (with bounded constraints) parameters. Finally, some forecasts are made using four scenarios with time-dependent control measures so as to determine which would reflect on the actual situations better.","output":"Assessing the effects of time-dependent restrictions and control actions to flatten the curve of COVID-19 in Kazakhstan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Repurposing of authorised medicines has been under discussion for a long time.

This study aimed to investigate the biological significance and underlying molecular mechanisms of CK18 in inducing EMT phenotype and stemness properties of breast cancer cells. Three breast cancer cell lines (i.e., non-metastatic MCF-7, highly metastatic MDA-MB-231, and mitoxantrone (MX)-selected resistant MCF-7/MX cells) and two CK18-knockdown stable cell clones (MCF-7-shCK18-7D and 3C) were used to determine the association between CK18 and EMT and stemness. CK18 expression was extremely low in highly metastatic, resistant, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-?1/tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;-treated breast cancer cells with mesenchymal phenotype and increased expression of CSC markers. Depletion of CK18 promoted partial EMT and the acquisition of stemness properties in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Mechanistically, CK18 interference in MCF-7 cells activated the Wnt/?-catenin signaling, resulting in the up-regulation of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Consistently, the stemness properties and metastasis can be attenuated by further knockdown of EpCAM in CK18-depleted cells. In conclusion, downregulation of CK18 promotes partial EMT and enhances breast cancer stemness by increasing EpCAM expression partly via the Wnt/?-catenin pathway.

However, others, including cardiovascular conditions, do not follow clear linear patterns of change with economic development. Abnormal blood pressure is a serious health risk factor with consequences for population growth and longevity as well as public and private expenditure in health care and labor productivity. This also increases the risk of the population in certain pandemics, such as COVID-19. To determine the correlation of income and blood pressure, we analyzed time-series for the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of mens population (mmHg) and nominal Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPPC) for 136 countries from 1980 to 2008 using regression and statistical analysis by Pearsons correlation (r). Our study finds a trend similar to an inverted-U shaped curve, or a Heart Kuznets Curve. There is a positive correlation (increase GDPPC, increase SBP) in low-income countries, and a negative correlation in high-income countries (increase GDPPC, decrease SBP). As country income rises people tend to change their diets and habits and have better access to health services and education, which affects blood pressure. However, the latter two may not offset the rise in blood pressure until countries reach a certain income. Investing early in health education and preventive health care could avoid the sharp increase in blood pressure as countries develop, and therefore, avoiding the Heart Kuznets Curve and its economic and human impacts.","output":"The Heart Kuznets Curve?

We hypothesized that unlike global functional residual capacity (FRC), component sector gas volumes and their corresponding regional tidal expansions would vary markedly in the setting of unilateral pleural effusion (PLEF), owing to shifting distributions of aeration and collapse as posture changed. METHODS Six deeply anesthetized swine underwent tracheostomy, thoracostomy, and experimental PLEF with 10 mL/kg of radiopaque isotonic fluid randomly instilled into either pleural space. Animals were ventilated at VT = 10 mL/kg, frequency = 15 bpm, I/E = 1:2, PEEP = 1 cmH2O, and FiO2 = 0.5. Quantitative lung computed tomographic (CT) analysis of regional aeration and global FRC measurements by nitrogen wash-in/wash-out technique was performed in each of these randomly applied positions: semi-Fowler's (inclined 30 from horizontal in the sagittal plane); prone, supine, and lateral positions with dependent PLEF and non-dependent PLEF. RESULTS No significant differences in total FRC were observed among the horizontal positions, either at baseline (p = 0.9037) or with PLEF (p = 0.58). However, component sector total gas volumes in each phase of the tidal cycle were different within all studied positions with and without PLEF (p = < .01). Compared to other positions, prone and lateral positions with non-dependent PLEF had more homogenous VT distributions among quadrants (p = .051). Supine position was associated with most dependent collapse and greatest tendency for tidal recruitment (48 vs ~ 22%, p = 0.0073).

In patients receiving infliximab and adalimumab, the proportion of patients who had positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels after two-dose vaccination was 40 out of 59 patients (67.7%) and 14 out 16 patients (87.5%), respectively. Whereas the proportions of patients who had positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels were 12 out of 13 patients (92.3%) and 13 out of 14 patients (92.8%) in patients receiving ustekinumab and vedolizumab. Conclusion: The majority of patients with IBD on infliximab, adalimumab, and vedolizumab seroconverted after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. All patients on ustekinumab seroconverted after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 SARS-CoV-2 are both likely to be effective after two doses in patients with IBD on biologics.

This paper suggests that entrepreneurship is also inextricably linked to a fundamental value common among the western developed economies, democracy. Three distinct contexts are examined to link democracy to entrepreneurship, two historical and one contemporary. The first is National Socialism in Germany, which emerged by suppressing both entrepreneurship and democracy. The second is the rise of the Trusts, or dominant large corporations and concomitant decline of small business in the United States at the end of the nineteenth century. Finally, both measurement and perception suggest a decline in democracy as well as entrepreneurship in the contemporary era. These concerns are only exacerbated in the current Covid-19 crisis. The paper concludes that an important policy mandate for entrepreneurship may be to ensure the independent, decentralized and autonomous decision-making serving as a cornerstone of democracy.","output":"Democracy and Entrepreneurship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Counterfeiting has never been more challenging than during the COVID-19 pandemic as counterfeit test kits and therapeutics have been discovered in the market. Current anti-counterfeiting labels have weaknesses: they can either be duplicated easily, are expensive or ill-suited for the existing complex supply chains. While RFID tags provide for an excellent alternative to current anti-counterfeiting methods, they can prove to be expensive and other routes involving nanomaterials can be difficult to encrypt. A DNA based anticounterfeiting system has significant advantages such as relative ease of synthesis and vast data storage abilities, along with great potential in encryption. Although DNA is equipped with such beneficial properties, major challenges that limit its real-world anti-counterfeiting applications include protection in harsh environments, rapid inexpensive sequence determination, and its attachment to products. This review elaborates the current progress of DNA based anti-counterfeiting systems and identifies technological gaps that need to be filled for its practical application.

METHODS 278 mental health apps from the Apple iOS store and Google Play store were downloaded and reviewed in a standardized manner by trained app raters using a validated framework. Apps were evaluated with this framework comprising 105 questions and covering app origin and accessibility, privacy and security, inputs and outputs, clinical foundation, features and engagement style, and interoperability. RESULTS Our results confirm that app stars and downloads - even for the most popular apps by these metrics - did not correlate with more clinically relevant metrics related to privacy/security, effectiveness, and engagement. Most mental health apps offer similar functionality, with 16.5% offering both mood tracking and journaling and 7% offering psychoeducation, deep breathing, mindfulness, journaling, and mood tracking. Only 36.4% of apps were updated with a 100-day window, and 7.5% of apps had not been updated in four years. CONCLUSION Current app marketplace metrics commonly used to evaluate apps do not offer an accurate representation of individual apps or a comprehensive overview of the entire space. The majority of apps overlap in terms of features offered, with many domains and other features not well represented.

A palliative care program was launched by the Jiangsu Nursing Association (JNA training program) and to identify gaps in palliative care training. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the training effects of the JNA training program on nurses knowledge and attitudes to palliative care. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 10 048 registered nurses in all regions of Jiangsu. All participants completed an online questionnaire using the Chinese version of The Palliative Care Quiz for Nursing (PCQN-C) and the Frommelt Attitude Toward Care of the Dying scale (FATCOD-B-C). A propensity score matched analysis was performed between the nurses who had attended the JNA training program and whose who hadnt. RESULTS: The average score of PCQN-C among all nurses was 8.79, while the mean score of the FATCOD-B-C was 103.62. Those participants who attended the JNA training program had significantly better scores than those who did not. Propensity score matching analysis showed that the palliative care training program failed to improve nurses knowledge in psychosocial and spiritual care or their attitudes towards the necessity of family support although there was positive impact on other aspects of palliative care. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of palliative care among Chinese nurses remains low. Training programs may improve general knowledge and attitudes to palliative care. However, important aspects of knowledge such as communication skills, family support, and psychosocial aspects of care, are missing. These gaps should be filled in future palliative care training programs targeting nurses with oriental culture background.

The UCSF AI4ALL program was established in 2019 to address this issue by targeting high school students from underrepresented backgrounds in AI, giving them a chance to learn about AI with a focus on biomedicine, and promoting diversity and inclusion. In 2020, the UCSF AI4ALL three-week program was held entirely online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, students participated virtually to gain experience with AI, interact with diverse role models in AI, and learn about advancing health through AI. Specifically, they attended lectures in coding and AI, received an in-depth research experience through hands-on projects exploring COVID-19, and engaged in mentoring and personal development sessions with faculty, researchers, industry professionals, and undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom were women and from underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds. At the conclusion of the program, the students presented the results of their research projects at the final symposium. Comparison of pre- and post-program survey responses from students demonstrated that after the program, significantly more students were familiar with how to work with data and to evaluate and apply machine learning algorithms. There were also nominally significant increases in the students knowing people in AI from historically underrepresented groups, feeling confident in discussing AI, and being aware of careers in AI. We found that we were able to engage young students in AI via our online training program and nurture greater diversity in AI.

Irradiation which is necessary for EAE induction caused a decrease in the total number of lymphocytes and an increase in CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio in the spleen of BALB/c mice. EAE induction increased the ratio further until clinical and histological signs of EAE appeared. Entry of perivascular CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells preceded the onset of clinical signs and the appearance of MAC-1(+) cells in the central nervous system (CNS). In the acute phase of EAE, cellular infiltrates, which were sparse, consisted mainly of MAC-1(+) cells and a few CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells. Inflammatory cells gradually disappeared during the recovery phase. SFV-A7 infection after irradiation and EAE induction did not significantly change the CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio in the spleen or in the CNS infiltrates but enhanced the entry of inflammatory cells into the CNS. Similar perivascular cell influx was also seen in untreated mice infected with SFV-A7. We conclude that observed rapid reduction of splenic mononuclear cells and increase of the CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell ratio caused by irradiation prior EAE induction are early crucial events in disease induction in this resistant strain of mice. SFV-A7 infection, which further facilitates the development of EAE, does not induce immunoregulatory changes but provides its effect by enhancing the entry of inflammatory cells into the CNS. The combination of these two mechanisms thus effectively breaks the natural resistance against EAE in this genetically resistant mouse strain.","output":"Facilitation of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis by irradiation and virus infection: role of inflammatory cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. Its relationship with environmental factors is an issue that has attracted the attention of scientists and governments. This article aims to deal with a possible association between COVID-19 and environmental factors and provide some recommendations for adequately controlling future epidemic threats. Environmental management through ecosystem services has a relevant role in exposing and spreading infectious diseases, reduction of pollutants, and control of climatic factors. Pollutants and viruses (such as COVID-19) produce negative immunological responses and share similar mechanisms of action. Therefore, they can have an additive and enhancing role in viral diseases. Significant associations between air pollution and COVID-19 have been reported. Particulate matter (PM 2.5, PM 10) can obstruct the airway, exacerbating cases of COVID-19. Some climatic factors have been shown to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Yet, it is not well established if climatic factors might have a cause-effect relationship to the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. So far, positive as well as negative indirect environmental impacts have been reported, with negative impacts greater and more persistent. Too little is known about the current pandemic to evaluate whether there is an association between environment and positive COVID-19 cases. We recommend smart technology to collect data remotely, the implementation of one health approach between public health physicians and veterinarians, and the use of biodegradable medical supplies in

Accordingly, we employ a simple extension to models currently used in the literature to estimate the reproduction number and present a case-study of the progression of COVID-19 in Austria.

These challenges have led to the need for new approaches and technologies to reinforce the capacity of traditional surveillance systems for detecting emerging infectious diseases. In the last few years, the availability of novel web-based data sources has contributed substantially to infectious disease surveillance. This study explores the burgeoning field of web-based infectious disease surveillance systems by examining their current status, importance, and potential challenges. METHODS: A systematic review framework was applied to the search, screening, and analysis of web-based infectious disease surveillance systems. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases to extensively review the English literature published between 2000 and 2015. Eleven surveillance systems were chosen for evaluation according to their high frequency of application. Relevant terms, including newly coined terms, development and classification of the surveillance systems, and various characteristics associated with the systems were studied. RESULTS: Based on a detailed and informative review of the 11 web-based infectious disease surveillance systems, it was evident that these systems exhibited clear strengths, as compared to traditional surveillance systems, but with some limitations yet to be overcome. The major strengths of the newly emerging surveillance systems are that they are intuitive, adaptable, low-cost, and operated in real-time, all of which are necessary features of an effective public health tool. The most apparent potential challenges of the web-based systems are those of inaccurate interpretation and prediction of health status, and privacy issues, based on an individuals internet activity. CONCLUSION: Despite being in a nascent stage with further modification needed, web-based surveillance systems have evolved to complement traditional national surveillance systems. This review highlights ways in which the strengths of existing systems can be maintained and weaknesses alleviated to implement optimal web surveillance systems.

We evaluated if shorter sedation exposure was associated with increased proportion of delirium-free/coma-free (DF/CF-ICU) days and change in time to definitive fascial closure (DFC). METHODS: We reviewed trauma DCL patients at an ACS-verified level I center over 5 years as shorter (SE) or longer than median (LE) sedation exposure. We compared demographics, injury patterns, hemodynamic parameters, and injury severity between groups. We calculated the propensity for each patient to achieve DFC using age, gender, ISS, red blood cell transfusion, bowel discontinuity, abdominal vascular injury, and time to first takeback; we then determined the effect of sedation exposure on rate of DFC by multivariate Cox regression, adjusted for propensity to achieve DFC. We used linear regression adjusted for age, ISS, head-AIS, bowel discontinuity, and vascular injury to determine the effect of sedation exposure on the proportion of DF/CF-ICU days. RESULTS: 65 patients (33.8% penetrating) had mean age 41.8  16.0, ISS 27.1  14.2, Head-AIS 1.2  1.6 and median sedation exposure of 2.2 [IQR 0.78, 7.3] days (35 SE and 30 LE). Pattern and severity of solid organ injuries and proportion of small and large bowel and vascular injuries were similar between groups. LE had more abdominal sepsis (23.3% vs 0%, p = 0.003) and enterocutaneous fistula (16.7% vs 0%, p = 0.016), and more ventilator (17.3  12.7 vs 6.1  6.8, p < 0.001), ICU (20.8  14.2 vs 7.2  7.6, p < 0.001), and hospital days (29.6  19.6 vs 13.9  9.0, p < 0.001). DFC was achieved more rapidly in the SE group (2.0  1.5 days vs 3.9  3.7 days [unadjusted], p = 0.023) and SE had a higher proportion of unadjusted DF/CF-ICU days (33.0  32.0% vs 18.1  16.4%, p = 0.020). SE was associated with an increased proportion of adjusted DF/CF-ICU days by multivariate linear regression (13.1% [95% CI 1.4C24.8%], p = 0.029) and with faster adjusted rate of DFC by multivariate Cox regression (RR 2.28 [95% CI 1.25C4.15, p = 0.007]).

The fronto-subcortical circuit is a critically important neural structure in the pathophysiology of AM. Using diffusion tensor tractography, a few neural tracts in the fronto-subcortical circuit can be reconstructed. This mini-review article evaluated 6 DTT-based studies on the fronto-subcortical circuit injury in patients with AM. According to these results, the neural tracts among the fronto-subcortical circuit, which are related to AM, were as follows (in decreasing order of importance): 1) the prefronto-caudate tract, 2) the prefronto-thalamic tract, and 3) the cingulum. In particular, the medial prefrontal cortex is an important brain area related to recovery from AM. However, only 6 studies on this topic have been published, and most were case reports. In addition, these studies analyzed only a few neural tracts in the fronto-subcortical circuit. Because AM is a rare disorder, studies involving a large number of subjects might be impossible. Nevertheless, an analysis of various neural tracts in the fronto-subcortical circuit is necessary.

However, the images taken by patients with smartphones often are of poor quality, and there is no regulation or standard instruction about how to use smartphones to take photographs of medical examination images effectively. These problems limit the use of smartphones in remote diagnosis and treatment. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: To formulate a set of guidelines for the most appropriate and effective use of smartphones to capture images (radiographs, CT images, and MR images), and to determine whether these guidelines are more effectively adopted by patients of differing ages and genders. METHODS: In this prospective study, a set of step-by-step instructions was created with the goal of helping patients take better smartphone photographs of orthopaedic diagnostic images for transfer to telemedicine services. Following the advice of surgeons, experts in smartphone technology, imaging experts, and suggestions from patients, the instructions were modified based on clinical experience and finalized with the goals of simplicity, clarity, and convenience. Potentially eligible patients were older than 18 years, had no cognitive impairment, and used smart phones. Based on that, 256 participants (patients or their relatives and friends) who visited the orthopaedic department of our hospital from June to October 2020 potentially qualified for this study. A total of 11% (29) declined to participate, leaving 89% (227) for analysis here. Their mean age was 36  11 years, 50% were women (113 of 227), and the patient himself/herself represented in 34% (78 of 227) of participants while relatives or friends of patients made up 66% (149 of 227) of the group. In this study, the diagnoses included spinal stenosis (47% [107 of 227]), disc herniation without spinal stenosis (31% [71 of 227]), vertebral fractures (14% [32 of 227]), and other (7% [17 of 227]). Each study participant first took photographs of their original medical images based on their own knowledge of how to use the smartphone camera function; each participant then took pictures of their original images again after receiving our instructional guidance. Three senior spine surgeons (YZ, TQL, TCM) in our hospital analyzed, in a blinded manner, the instructed and uninstructed imaging files based on image clarity (the content of the image is complete, the text information in the image is clearly visible, there is neither reflection nor shadow in the image) and image position (it is not tilted, curled, inverted, or reversed). If either of these conditions was not satisfied, the picture quality was deemed unacceptable; two of three judges' votes determined the outcome. Interobserver reliability with kappa values for the three judges were 0.89 (YZ versus TQL), 0.92 (YZ versus TCM), and 0.90 (TQL versus TCM). RESULTS: In this study, the overall proportion of smartphone medical images deemed satisfactory increased from 40% (91 of 227) for uninstructed participants to 86% (196 of 227) for instructed participants (risk ratio 2.15 [95% CI 1.82 to 2.55]; p0.001). The proportion of acceptable-quality images in different age groups improved after instruction, except for in patients aged 51 years or older (3 of 17 uninstructed participants versus 8 of 17 instructed participants; RR 2.67 [95% CI 0.85 to 8.37]; p = 0.07). The proportion of acceptable-quality images in both genders improved after instruction, but there was no difference between the genders. CONCLUSION: We believe our guidelines for patients who wish to take smartphone photographs of their medical images will decrease image transmission cost and facilitate orthopaedic telemedicine consultations. However, it appears that patients older than 50 years are more likely to have difficulty with this approach, and if so, they may benefit from more hands-on assistance from clinic staff or younger relatives or friends. The degree to which our findings are culture-specific should be verified by other studies in other settings, but on the face of it, there is little reason to believe our findings would not generalize to a reasonable degree. Other studies in more heterogeneous populations should also evaluate factors related to levels of educational attainment and wealth differences, but in the meantime, our findings can give clinical teams an idea of which patients may need a little extra assistance. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.","output":"What Is the Best Way for Patients to Take Photographs of Medical Images (Radiographs, CT, and MRI) Using a Smartphone?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis that gender stereotypes influence human behaviour and relational well-being is widely accepted in the literature. However, a comparison based on scientific assumptions is necessary to deeply understand the mechanisms activated by stereotypes in conditions of stress. The global health emergency from COVID-19 offers the opportunity to compare countries with different socio-cultural conditions, whose population has been subjected to the same stressful event during the lockdown phase. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The same questionnaire was disseminated in both Italy and Turkey during their respective lockdown phases. 140,000 interviews were collected in Italy and 10,000 in Turkey, a number big enough to obtain useful information for a comparative analysis in relation to behaviours, attitudes and well-being, also using the recursive regression models. RESULTS: The results, based on scientific data, show that gender stereotypes are much more rooted in Turkey than in Italy, where the emancipation process of the population is more advanced, producing profound social changes and decreasing differences between men and women in terms of behaviour and reactions to difficult situations, such as the present one. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotypes, which are hostile to any opposite evidence, affect individual behaviours and attitudes to the point that, within a specific context, they play a protective role against the uncertainty during a period of health emergency, inducing people to seek shelter in pre-established and widespread behavioural models. According to the data analysis, this has happened in Turkey more than in Italy. The results show that within a culture still strongly pervaded by these social conditioning, especially at the presence of low levels of education, the adherence to gender roles constitutes a \\"protective factor\\" of the individual well-being against external stress factors.","output":"Comparing the influence of gender stereotypes on well-being in Italy and Turkey during the COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Editor - social network changes constitute a pivotal influence on both academic success and emotional well-being for medical students throughout the various stages of training.

A high triglyceride to high density lipoprotein cholesterol (Tg/HDL c) ratio has been associated with reduced insulin sensitivity, metabolic syndrome and adverse cardiovascular events. Our aim in this study was to determine the association between different components of the lipid profile and particularly the Tg/HDL c ratio with severe complications like the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We collected demographic, clinical and biochemical data to conduct a cohort study in 43 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) at baseline and in the subsequent 15 days. Patients were subjected to a very similar treatment scheme with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. Descriptive statistics, variable association and logistic regression were applied to identify predictors of disease severity among elements and calculations from the lipid profile. RESULTS: Patients were aged 57  14 years; 55.8% were male from which 75% required hospitalization and 44.2% were female who 58% were hospitalized. The most common comorbidities were type 2 diabetes mellitus (58%) and hypertension (40%). Hospitalized and critical care patients showed lower HDL c blood levels and increased Tg/HDL c ratio than those with outpatient management and mild/asymptomatic COVID-19. Tg/HDL c ratio correlated with variables of disease severity such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (r = 0.356; p < 0.05); National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS 2) (r = 0.495; p < 0.01); quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) (r = 0.538; p < 0.001); increased need of oxygen support (r = 0.447; p < 0.01) and requirement of mechanical ventilation (r = 0.378; p < 0.05). Tg/HDL c ratio had a negative correlation with partial oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (SaO 2/FiO2) ratio (r = -0.332;p < 0.05). Linear regression analysis showed that Tg/HDL c ratio can predict increases in inflammatory factors like LDH (p < 0.01); ferritin (p < 0.01) and D-dimer (p < 0.001). Logistic regression model indicated that &#8805;7.45 Tg/HDL c ratio predicts requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 11.815, CI 1.832-76.186, p < 0.01).

To evaluate potential biomarkers of coagulopathy and disease severity in COVID-19, we measured plasma levels of eight biomarkers potentially associated with coagulation, fibrinolysis, and platelet function in 43 controls and 63 COVID-19 patients, including 47 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 16 non-ICU patients. COVID-19 patients showed significantly elevated levels of fibrinogen, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), and its inhibitor plasminogen activation inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), as well as ST2 (the receptor for interleukin 33) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) compared to the control group. We found that higher levels of t-PA, ST2, and vWF at the time of admission were associated with lower survival rates, and that thrombotic events were more frequent in patients with initial higher levels of vWF. These results support a predictive role of specific biomarkers such as t-PA and vWF in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. The data provide support for the case that hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is fibrin-mediated, but also highlights the important role that vWF may play in the genesis of thromboses in the pathophysiology of COVID-19.

In such circumstances, resources should remain allocated to patients most likely to survive. Understanding how these guidelines perform is an important consideration in disaster planning. Numerous allocation guidelines exist however nearly all utilize a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. We sought to evaluate the performance of ventilator reallocation by applying the New York State Ventilator Allocation Guidelines (NYVAG) to a large cohort of COVID-19 patients. Our retrospective cohort included 895 intubated COVID-19 patients admitted to an academic system in New York City. SOFA scores were calculated for every day of mechanical ventilation. Per NYVAG, patients would have their ventilator reallocated at 48 hours if their interval SOFA score increased, did not change from an initial SOFA of 8-11, or was greater than 11. At 120 hours it would be reallocated if their SOFA score worsened or was greater than 7. At 168 hours and every subsequent 48 hours it would be reallocated if their SOFA score worsened. Ventilator reallocation was simulated and no reallocation was made for any patient. The average SOFA (n=895) at the time of intubation was 7.1  3.6. At the 48-hour reassessment (average SOFA 8.2  3.6, n=759), 436 (57%) patients would have their ventilator reallocated, 145 (33%) of whom would later survive to discharge. At the 120-hour reassessment (average SOFA 7.8  3.6, n=264) 173 (66%) of the 264 remaining simulated ventilated patients would have their ventilators reallocated, 83 (48%) of whom would later survive to discharge. At the 168-hour reassessment (average SOFA 7.8  3.6, n=80) 66 (83%) of the 80 simulated remaining ventilated patients would have their ventilators reallocated. Overall, 685 patients (77%) of the starting cohort would have had their ventilator reallocated at some time during the first 168 hours of mechanical ventilation, 268 (40%) of whom survived to discharge. Our simulated study found that the application of NYVAG to the COVID-19 surge at one academic system would have resulted in a significant portion of ventilated patients having had their ventilators reallocated. This may be deeply concerning as a significant portion of patients ultimately survived to discharge.

Unfortunately, antiviral drugs to treat enterovirus infections have not been approved yet. Over the past decades, several direct-acting inhibitors have been developed, including capsid binders, which block virus entry, and inhibitors of viral enzymes required for genome replication. Capsid binders and protease inhibitors have been clinically evaluated, but failed due to limited efficacy or toxicity issues. As an alternative approach, host-targeting inhibitors with potential broad-spectrum activity have been identified. Furthermore, drug repurposing screens have recently uncovered promising new inhibitors with disparate viral and host targets.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the effect of remdesivir on clinical and virologic outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients from June to July 2020. Primary clinical endpoints included clinical recovery, additional mechanical ventilator (MV) support, and duration of oxygen or MV support. Viral load reduction by hospital day (HD) 15 was evaluated by calculating changes in cycle threshold (Ct) values. RESULTS: A total of 86 severe COVID-19 patients were evaluated including 48 remdesivir-treated patients. Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between the two groups. Remdesivir was administered an average of 7.42 days from symptom onset. The proportions of clinical recovery of the remdesivir and supportive care group at HD 14 (56.3% and 39.5%) and HD 28 (87.5% and 78.9%) were not statistically different. The proportion of patients requiring MV support by HD 28 was significantly lower in the remdesivir group than in the supportive care group (22.9% vs. 44.7%, P = 0.032), and MV duration was significantly shorter in the remdesivir group (average, 1.97 vs. 5.37 days; P = 0.017).

The post-industrial city has become a stage for events that serve a wide range of social, cultural, economic and spatial objectives. However, the densification of the built environment has led to a debate about the extent to which live musics positive outcomes outweigh the nuisance experienced by residents in terms of noise and the unavailability of public spaces. Furthermore, small venues in many cities are struggling with issues of gentrification, implying that the spatial value of music is part of wider concerns about who owns the city and which forms of culture can be produced and consumed in urban centres. Against this background, the paper asks the following questions concerning the spatial value of live music: how can it be defined? What are the challenges to achieving it? How can it be supported in urban planning? The study is grounded in a qualitative content analysis of 24 live music reports and strategies, as well as 10 in-depth interviews with policymakers, festival organisers and venue owners.

It is also to find out if lockdowns and the difficulty providing face-to-face care in the health system have led to children showing more severe symptoms at the time of diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational multicenter study of the province of Tarragona where data is collected from new diagnoses of type 1 diabetes mellitus in patients under the age of 15 during the year 2020 and compared with years 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: The number of new diagnoses of type 1 diabetes during 2020 was 37 cases compared to 2019 and 2018 which was 23 and 29 respectively. The median age at onset was 9 years, 54% males. There was an increase in new diagnoses in the range of 10 to14-year-olds, with a decrease in the range of 0 to 4 year-olds. In 2020, the incidence in the group of patients with families from the Maghreb area rose from 52.2 cases per 100,000 population/year (c/10(5) p-y) in 2019 to 135.8 in 2020.

A growing body of research supports the effectiveness of telemental health for a variety of psychiatric conditions, but few studies have examined telemental health for individuals with comorbid medical diagnoses. Furthermore, little is known about the remote implementation of clinical trials examining telemental health interventions. OBJECTIVE: This paper outlines the procedural modifications used to facilitate conversion of an in-person randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression in individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI; CBT-TBI) to a telemental health study administered remotely. METHODS: Given the nature of remote implementation and specific challenges experienced by individuals with TBI, considerations related to treatment delivery, remote consent, data management, neuropsychological assessment, safety monitoring, and delivery of supportive material have been discussed. Feasibility, acceptability, and safety were evaluated by examining attendance and participant responses on self-report measures of treatment satisfaction and suicidal behavior. RESULTS: High rates of treatment attendance, assessment completion, study retention, and satisfaction with the intervention and modality were reported by participants who completed at least one telemental health CBT-TBI session. CONCLUSIONS: Study modifications are necessary when conducting a study remotely, and special attention should be paid to comorbidities and population-specific challenges (eg, cognitive impairment). Preliminary data support the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of remotely conducting a randomized controlled trial of CBT-TBI.

The objective of this study was to analyze the humoral response to Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus 6A/B and cytomegalovirus, and the levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and the three main short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), propionate (PA), butyrate (BA) and acetate (AA), in MS patients and healthy controls (HC) to understand how they could contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. With this purpose, we analyzed the correlations among them and with different clinical variables and a wide panel of cell subsets. We found statistically significant differences for most of the environmental factors analyzed when we compared MS patients and HC, supporting their possible involvement in the disease. The strongest correlations with the clinical variables and the cell subsets analyzed were found for 25(OH)D and SCFAs levels. A correlation was also found between 25(OH)D and PA/AA ratio, and the interaction between these factors negatively correlated with interleukin 17 (IL-17)-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in untreated MS patients.

The aim was to create capacities for the in-hospital care of the patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to check whether a reduction in the number of trauma patients compared to the mean of the previous 3 years could be observed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients who presented in the emergency admission from 1 March to 15 April 2020 with the mean of the patients from the previous 3 years 2017-2019. The age of the patients, time of presentation, diagnoses, whereabouts of the patients, inpatient or outpatient, number and duration of the operative care and required capacity on the normal ward and intensive care units (ICU) were recorded. The injury mechanism was also examined. RESULTS: A total of 4967 patients between 1 March and 15 April were included. On average over the 3 previous years, a total of 1348 patients, i.e. 29.3 patients per day were counted in our emergency room. In 2020 a total of 923, i.e. 20 patients per day (pa?< 0.01) were counted. On average 227 (24.6%) were admitted to hospital compared to 311.5 (23.1%) in 2020.

Understanding transmission, susceptibility and exposure risks is crucial for surveillance, control and response to the disease. Knowing the geographic distribution of health resource scarcity areas is necessary if a country is to adequately anticipate and prepare for the full impact of infections. We explored the potential to undertake a spatial risk assessment of an emerging pandemic under data scarcity in Eswatini. We used a set of socio-economic and demographic variables to identify epidemic risk prone areas in the country. Three risk zone levels for COVID-19 were identified in the country. The analysis showed that about 29% (320 818) of the population were located in the high risk zone and these were people who could potentially be infected with COVID-19 in the absence of mitigation measures. A majority of cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 would likely remain unknown but our estimate could be used to gauge the full burden of the disease. Approximating and quantifying the number of people who may be potentially infected with COVID-19 remains impossible under data scarcity and limited healthcare capacity especially in sub-Saharan Africa. We provided an estimation method that could support the pandemic risk forecasting, preparedness and response measures in the midst of data scarcity.

The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique natural experiment because the source of unemployment is very likely to be exogenous to the individual. This study assessed the effect of job loss and job furlough on the mental health of individuals in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA AND METHODS: The data for the study came from the first and second waves of the national survey, the National Income Dynamics-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM), conducted during May-June and July-August 2020, respectively. The sample for NIDS-CRAM was drawn from an earlier national survey, conducted in 2017, which had collected data on mental health. Questions on depressive symptoms during the lockdown were asked in Wave 2 of NIDS-CRAM, using a 2-question version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). The PHQ-2 responses (0-6 on the discrete scale) were regrouped into four categories making the ordered logit regression model the most suited for assessing the impact of employment status on depressive symptoms. RESULTS: The study revealed that adults who retained paid employment during the COVID-19 lockdown had significantly lower depression scores than adults who lost employment. The benefits of employment also accumulated over time, underscoring the effect of unemployment duration on mental health. The analysis revealed no mental health benefits to being furloughed (on unpaid leave), but paid leave had a strong and significant positive effect on the mental health of adults. CONCLUSIONS: The economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented job losses, which impaired mental wellbeing significantly. Health policy responses to the crisis therefore need to focus on both physical and mental health interventions.","output":"Job loss and mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown: Evidence from South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer in women.

Their appropriate use and interpretation require accurate assay performance data. METHOD: We conducted an evaluation of 10 lateral flow assays (LFAs) and two ELISAs to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The specimen set comprised 128 plasma or serum samples from 79 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive individuals; 108 pre-COVID-19 negative controls; and 52 recent samples from individuals who underwent respiratory viral testing but were not diagnosed with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Samples were blinded and LFA results were interpreted by two independent readers, using a standardized intensity scoring system. RESULTS: Among specimens from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive individuals, the percent seropositive increased with time interval, peaking at 81.8C100.0% in samples taken >20 days after symptom onset. Test specificity ranged from 84.3C100.0% in pre-COVID-19 specimens. Specificity was higher when weak LFA bands were considered negative, but this decreased sensitivity. IgM detection was more variable than IgG, and detection was highest when IgM and IgG results were combined. Agreement between ELISAs and LFAs ranged from 75.7C94.8%. No consistent cross-reactivity was observed. CONCLUSION: Our evaluation showed heterogeneous assay performance. Reader training is key to reliable LFA performance, and can be tailored for survey goals. Informed use of serology will require evaluations covering the full spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infections, from asymptomatic and mild infection to severe disease, and later convalescence.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Suicide mortality data, population data and unemployment data were obtained from available statistical databases (e.g. Statistics Canada). We quantified suicide rate by dividing the total number of suicide deaths by the national population expressed as a rate per 100,000 population. RESULTS: Overall suicide mortality rate decreased in Canada from 10.82 deaths per 100,000 in the March 2019 - February 2020 period to 7.34 per 100,000 (i.e. absolute difference of 1300 deaths) in the March 2020 - February 2021 period.

Although the I-IFN-based antiviral innate immune response is crucial for eliminating viruses, overproduction led to immune disorders. Therefore, the relatively long-lasting I-IFNs must be precisely controlled, but the regulatory mechanism for the innate antiviral response in microglia remains largely unknown. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are being recognized as crucial factors in numerous diseases, but their regulatory roles in the innate antiviral response in microglia are undefined. Methods: The high-throughput RNA sequencing was performed to obtain differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) in primary microglia infected with or without the neurotropic herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). We selected four DELs ranked in the top 15 in basic level and their fold change induced by HSV-1, i.e., FPKM(HSV-1)/FPKM(Cells).We subsequently found a key lncRNA affecting the innate antiviral response of microglia significantly. We next used dual-luciferase reporter assays, bioinformatical tools, and truncation mutants of both lncRNA and targeted proteins to elucidate the downstream and upstream mechanism of action of lncRNA. Further, we established microglia-specific knock-in (KI) mice to investigate the role of lncRNA in vivo. Results: We identified a long intergenic non-coding RNA, linc-AhRA, involved in regulating the innate antiviral response in murine microglia. linc-AhRA is activated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and restricts I-IFN production in microglia upon neurotropic herpesvirus infection and innate immune stimulation. Mechanistically, linc-AhRA binds to both tripartite motif-containing 27 (TRIM27) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) through its conserved 117nt fragment as a molecular scaffold to enhance TRIM27-TBK1 interaction. This interaction facilitates the TRIM27-mediated ubiquitination of TBK1 and results in ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of TBK1. Consequently, linc-AhRA suppresses I-IFN production through facilitating TBK1 degradation and limits the microglial innate immune response against neurotropic herpesvirus infection. Microglia-specific KI of linc-AhRA mice shows a weakened antiviral immune response upon neurotropic herpesvirus challenge due to a reduction of TBK1 in microglia. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that linc-AhRA is a negative regulator of I-IFN production in microglia to avoid excessive autoimmune responses. These findings uncover a previously unappreciated role for lncRNA conserved fragments in the innate antiviral response, providing a strong foundation for developing nucleotide drugs based on conserved functional fragments within lncRNAs.","output":"A novel lncRNA linc-AhRA negatively regulates innate antiviral response in murine microglia upon neurotropic herpesvirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The p53 transcription factor confers its potent tumor suppressor functions primarily through the regulation of a large network of target genes.

Penicillin, the first antibiotic, was used in the 1930s and led to the emergence of AMR. Due to alterations in the microbes genome and the evolution of new resistance mechanisms, antibiotics are losing efficacy against microbes. There are high rates of mortality and morbidity due to antibiotic resistance, so addressing this major health issue requires new approaches. Staphylococcus auricularis is a Gram-positive cocci and is capable of causing opportunistic infections and sepsis. S. auricularis is resistant to several antibiotics and does not currently have a licensed vaccine. In this study, we used bacterial pan-genome analysis (BPGA) to study S. auricularis pan-genome and applied a reverse immunology approach to prioritize vaccine targets against S. auricularis. A total of 15,444 core proteins were identified by BPGA analysis, which were then used to identify good vaccine candidates considering potential vaccine filters. Two vaccine candidates were evaluated for epitope prediction including the superoxide dismutase and gamma-glutamyl transferase protein. The epitope prediction phase involved the prediction of a variety of B-Cell and T-cell epitopes, and the epitopes that met certain criteria, such as antigenicity, immunogenicity, non-allergenicity, and non-toxicity were chosen. A multi-epitopes vaccine construct was then constructed from all the predicted epitopes, and a cholera toxin B-subunit adjuvant was also added to increase vaccine antigenicity. Three-dimensional models of the vaccine were used for downward analyses. Using the best-modeled structure, binding potency was tested with MHC-I, MHC-II and TLR-4 immune cells receptors, proving that the vaccine binds strongly with the receptors. Further, molecular dynamics simulations interpreted strong intermolecular binding between the vaccine and receptors and confirmed the vaccine epitopes exposed to the host immune system. The results support that the vaccine candidate may be capable of eliciting a protective immune response against S. auricularis and may be a promising candidate for experimental in vitro and in vivo studies.","output":"Immunoinformatics and Biophysics Approaches to Design a Novel Multi-Epitopes Vaccine Design against Staphylococcus auricularis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As schools reopen as a result of low community transmission rates of COVID-19, parents and teachers will have understandable concerns about the risks to students and staff.","output":"Back to school: Safe for children with underlying medical conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Physical distancing precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic may challenge the provision of tangible support many middle age and older adults receive in managing their health.

RESULTS: Two hundred four environmental samples were obtained from inpatient and outpatient oncology clinics and infusion suites, and they were categorized as 1) public areas, 2) staff areas, or 3) medical equipment. One hundred thirty surfaces from 2 outpatient hematology and oncology clinics and 36 surfaces from an inpatient leukemia/lymphoma/chimeric antigen receptor T-cell unit were examined, and all 166 samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2. One of 38 samples (2.6%) from COVID-19+ inpatient units was positive. Altogether, the positive test rate for SARS-CoV-2 RNA across all surfaces was 0.5% (1 of 204). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective, systematic quality assurance investigation of real-world environmental surfaces, performed in inpatient and outpatient hematology/oncology units, revealed overall negligible detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA when strict mitigation strategies against COVID-19 transmission were instituted. LAY SUMMARY: The potential risks of nosocomial infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have deterred patients with cancer from seeking timely care despite consensus guidelines. This study has found negligible rates of environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 across a multitude of commonly used surfaces in outpatient and inpatient hematology/oncology settings with adherence to strict infection control protocols.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial infection: Real-world results of environmental surface testing from a large tertiary cancer center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virus can currently pose a serious health threat and can lead to severe COVID\\\\19 outcomes, especially for populations suffering from comorbidities. Currently, the data available on the risk for severe COVID\\\\19 outcomes due to an HIV infection with or without comorbidities paint a heterogenous picture. In this meta\\\\analysis, we summarized the likelihood for severe COVID\\\\19 outcomes among people living with HIV (PLHIV) with or without comorbidities. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we utilized PubMed, Web of Science and medRxiv to search for studies describing COVID\\\\19 outcomes in PLHIV with or without comorbidities up to 25 June 2021. Consequently, we conducted two meta\\\\analyses, based on a classic frequentist and Bayesian perspective of higher quality studies. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We identified 2580 studies (search period: January 2020C25 June 2021, data extraction period: 1 January 2021C25 June 2021) and included nine in the meta\\\\analysis. Based on the frequentist meta\\\\analytical model, PLHIV with diabetes had a seven times higher risk of severe COVID\\\\19 outcomes (odd ratio, OR = 6.69, 95% CI: 3.03C19.30), PLHIV with hypertension a four times higher risk (OR = 4.14, 95% CI: 2.12C8.17), PLHIV with cardiovascular disease an odds ratio of 4.75 (95% CI: 1.89C11.94), PLHIV with respiratory disease an odds ratio of 3.67 (95% CI: 1.79C7.54) and PLHIV with chronic kidney disease an OR of 9.02 (95% CI: 2.53C32.14) compared to PLHIV without comorbidities. Both meta\\\\analytic models converged, thereby providing robust summative evidence. The Bayesian meta\\\\analysis produced similar effects overall, with the exclusion of PLHIV with respiratory diseases who showed a non\\\\significant higher risk to develop severe COVID\\\\19 outcomes compared to PLHIV without comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta\\\\analyses show that people with HIV, PLHIV with coexisting diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and chronic kidney disease are at a higher likelihood of developing severe COVID\\\\19 outcomes. Bayesian analysis helped to estimate small sample biases and provided predictive likelihoods. Clinical practice should take these risks due to comorbidities into account and not only focus on the HIV status alone, vaccination priorities should be adjusted accordingly.","output":"The likelihood of severe COVID\\\\19 outcomes among PLHIV with various comorbidities: a comparative frequentist and Bayesian meta\\\\analysis approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical features and chest computed tomography (CT) findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Materials and Methods An Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective review was performed for 51 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Patients were divided into two groups depending on their clinical status: mild and severe. Clinical characteristics and chest CT findings were compared between the two groups. Results Among the 51 patients (22 men, 29 women; mean age, 56.5  16 years; range, 22C88 years), 37 (72.5%) were in the mild group and 14 (27.5%) were in the severe group. The patients in the severe group (68.7  12.5 years) were older than the patients in the mild group (51.8  14.9 years, p &lt; 0.001). Premorbid conditions and decreased lymphocyte counts were more often observed in the severe group than in the mild group (71% vs. 41%, p = 0.049 and 86% vs. 32%, p = 0.001, respectively). On chest CT, most patients exhibited a mixed ground-glass opacification (GGO) with consolidation (76%) or a GGO (22%) pattern. The majority of lesions were predominantly bilateral in the lower lung with a posterior, peripheral distribution. The patients in the severe group had higher severity scores than those in the mild group.

This study was performed to estimate the number of COVID-19 deaths and population-level exposure per province using seasonal all-cause mortality data. METHODS: Time-series data were collected from the National Organization for Civil Registration on the seasonal all-cause mortality from spring 2015 to summer 2020 (from March 21, 2015 to September 21, 2020), in accordance with the Solar Hijri (SH) calendar, to estimate the expected number of seasonal deaths for each province using a piecewise linear regression model. A population-weighted infection fatality ratio was then applied to estimate the level of exposure per province during this period. RESULTS: From the start of winter to the end of summer (from December 22, 2019 to September 21, 2020), there were a total of 58 900 (95% confidence interval 46 900C69 500) excess deaths across all 31 provinces, with 27% (95% confidence interval 20C34%) estimated nationwide exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The present study aimed to describe the prevalence of venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients receiving different regimens of prophylactic anticoagulation. DESIGN: Single-center retrospective review using data from patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requiring intubation. SETTING: Tertiary-care center in Indianapolis, IN, United States. PATIENTS: Patients hospitalized at international units Health Methodist Hospital with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requiring intubation between March 23, 2020, and April 8, 2020, who underwent ultrasound evaluation for venous thrombosis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 45 patients were included. Nineteen of 45 patients (42.2%) were found to have deep venous thrombosis. Patients found to have deep venous thrombosis had no difference in time to intubation (p = 0.97) but underwent ultrasound earlier in their hospital course (p = 0.02). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were similar between the groups on day of intubation and day of ultrasound (p = 0.44 and p = 0.07, respectively). d-dimers were markedly higher in patients with deep venous thrombosis, both for maximum value and value on day of ultrasound (p < 0.01 for both). Choice of prophylactic regimen was not related to presence of deep venous thrombosis (p = 0.35). Ultrasound evaluation is recommended if d-dimer is greater than 2,000 ng/mL (sensitivity 95%, specificity 46%) and empiric anticoagulation considered if d-dimer is greater than 5,500 ng/mL (sensitivity 53%, specificity 88%). CONCLUSIONS: Deep venous thrombosis is very common in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. There was no difference in incidence of deep venous thrombosis among different pharmacologic prophylaxis regimens, although our analysis is limited by small sample size. d-dimer values are elevated in the majority of these patients, but there may be thresholds at which screening ultrasound or even empiric systemic anticoagulation is indicated.","output":"Incidence of Venous Thromboembolism in Critically Ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients Receiving Prophylactic Anticoagulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The role of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), or other antihypertensive agents in the case of Covid-19 remains controversial. We aimed to investigate the association between antihypertensive agent exposure and in-hospital mortality in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicenter cohort study on patients hospitalized between February 1 and May 15, 2020. All patients had been followed up for at least 30 days. RESULTS: Of the 8078 hospitalized patients for Covid-19, 3686 (45.6%) had hypertension and were included in the study. In this population, the median age was 75.4 (IQR, 21.5) years and 57.1% were male. Overall in-hospital 30-day mortality was 23.1%. The main antihypertensive pharmacological classes used were calcium channel blockers (CCB) (n=1624, 44.1%), beta-blockers (n=1389, 37.7%), ARB (n=1154, 31.3%), and ACEi (n=998, 27.1%). The risk of mortality was lower in CCB (aOR, 0.83 [0.70C0.99]) and beta-blockers (aOR, 0.80 [0.67C0.95]) users and non-significant in ARB (aOR, 0.88 [0.72C1.06]) and ACEi (aOR, 0.83 [0.68C1.02]) users, compared to non-users. These results remain consistent for patients receiving CCB, beta-blocker, or ARB as monotherapies. CONCLUSION: This large multicenter retrospective of Covid-19 patients with hypertension found a reduced mortality among CCB and beta-blockers users, suggesting a putative protective effect. Our findings did not show any association between the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and the risk of in-hospital death. Although they need to be confirmed in further studies, these results support the continuation of antihypertensive agents in patients with Covid-19, in line with the current guidelines.

This study assesses whether exposure to social and traditional media during the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with mental distress among U.S. adults. METHODS: Data came from the Understanding America Study, conducted with a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of adults who completed surveys online. Participants included 6,329 adults surveyed between March 10 and March 31, 2020. Regression analyses examined the associations of (1) self-reported average time spent on social media in a day (hours) and (2) number of traditional media sources (radio, TV, and newspaper) consulted to learn about COVID-19 with self-reported mental distress (4-item Patient Health Questionnaire). Data were analyzed in April 2020. RESULTS: Participants responding at later survey dates reported more time spent on social media (?=0.02, 95% CI=0.01, 0.03), a greater number of traditional media sources consulted to learn about COVID-19 (?=0.01, 95% CI=0.01, 0.02), and greater mental distress (?=0.07, 95% CI=0.04, 0.09).

Given its mild initial symptoms, T2DM is often diagnosed several years after its onset, leaving half of diabetic individuals undiagnosed. While several classical clinical and genetic biomarkers have been identified, improving early diagnosis by exploring other kinds of omics data remains crucial. In this study, we have combined longitudinal data from two population-based cohorts CoLaus and DESIR (comprising in total 493 incident cases vs. 1360 controls) to identify new or confirm previously implicated metabolomic biomarkers predicting T2DM incidence more than 5 years ahead of clinical diagnosis. Our longitudinal data have shown robust evidence for valine, leucine, carnitine and glutamic acid being predictive of future conversion to T2DM. We confirmed the causality of such association for leucine by 2-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) based on independent data. Our MR approach further identified new metabolites potentially playing a causal role on T2D, including betaine, lysine and mannose. Interestingly, for valine and leucine a strong reverse causal effect was detected, indicating that the genetic predisposition to T2DM may trigger early changes of these metabolites, which appear well-before any clinical symptoms. In addition, our study revealed a reverse causal effect of metabolites such as glutamic acid and alanine. Collectively, these findings indicate that molecular traits linked to the genetic basis of T2DM may be particularly promising early biomarkers.","output":"Triangulating evidence from longitudinal and Mendelian randomization studies of metabolomic biomarkers for type 2 diabetes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of CT for quantitative assessment of the neck structures after RFA in patients with benign thyroid nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS This single-center, retrospective cohort study included 38 patients with benign thyroid nodules who had received RFA and had available pre- and post-treatment CT images. Changes in the tracheal anteroposterior (AP)/transverse diameter ratio, cross-sectional tracheal area, midline deviation of the trachea, and anterior neck angle after RFA were quantitatively measured using CT. Volume reduction rates (VRRs) for the thyroid gland and nodules were measured using CT and US, respectively, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated. The paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare pre- and post-treatment CT-based measurements, and univariate linear regression analysis was performed to determine the association of VRR with the mean delivered radiofrequency energy, number of RFA sessions, and initial thyroid volume. RESULTS After RFA, the tracheal AP/transverse diameter ratio and midline deviation were significantly decreased while the tracheal area and anterior neck angle were significantly increased (all, p < 0.001). The thyroid volume reduction was also significant (VRR, 42.1%  21.1%, p < 0.001), with moderate consistency between the CT-based thyroid VRR and US-based nodule VRR (ICC = 0.68, 95% confidence interval = 0.38-0.83, p < 0.001). The mean delivered radiofrequency energy (p = 0.565), number of RFA sessions (p = 0.209), and initial thyroid volume (p = 0.363) showed no significant association with VRR.

This study aimed, firstly, to describe the prevalence of long COVID in mild COVID-19 patients in Cape Town, and, secondly, to document the impact of COVID-19 on patients well-being, work, and their access to long COVID treatment. METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, a random sample of adults diagnosed with mild COVID-19 were called two months post-diagnosis. The participants telephonically completed a standardised survey describing their long COVID symptoms, missed workdays, and health-seeking behaviour. Medical records were reviewed for comorbidities, original COVID-19 symptoms, and treatment. RESULTS: It was found that 60% of patients with mild COVID-19 had  1 long COVID symptom, while 35% had  3 ongoing symptoms for two months. Dyspnoea and fatigue were the most common symptoms. The findings revealed that 52% of employed patients missed work and 25% of patients self-reported non-recovery from their COVID-19. Moreover, 24% of patients consulted a clinician for long COVID, but only 7% of patients received long COVID care in the public sector.

Researchers wanted to survey the online medical education status quo and find out the underlying challenges and probable solutions in terms of online medical education to better understand improving and developing medical education in China. METHODS: Researchers distributed self-administered and piloted surveys regarding the implementation of online medical education on WeChat and Wenjuanxing. Researchers distributed three phases of online surveys to the undergraduate medical students, and one online survey to the medical teachers on phase three. RESULTS: Online medical education was carried out smoothly in China. Seventy-six percent of the students were satisfied with online medical education, and it hardly changed after a month. Courses with the quiz and live-stream courses were rare compared with courses incorporated with other elements. Most parents would remind their children to study online at home. At first, the biggest challenge of learning online was the lagging platform. Nevertheless, as time went by, the major challenge became the learning motivation. Most students thought it necessary to re-teach face-to-face after online education, while most teachers did not think so. CONCLUSION: Generally speaking, online medical education was satisfying for both students and teachers, although online courses diversity with different forms and elements could be enhanced. Infrastructure construction should be considered first for the schools intended to promote online medical education. If the infrastructure were ready, learning motivation would become the biggest challenge for online medical education. Online medical education efficacy evaluation tools need to be developed in the future to narrow the discrepancy of the evaluation between teachers and students.","output":"Students and Teachers Perspective on the Implementation of Online Medical Education in China: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had exceptional effects on travel behaviour in the UK. This paper focuses specifically on the outdoor exercise trips of Scottish residents at several distinct points of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the negative health consequences of limited exercise, this study aims to determine the sociodemographic and behavioural factors affecting frequency of outdoor exercise trips. METHODS: Using recent public survey data (n=6000), random parameters ordered probit models (with allowances for heterogeneity in the means of random parameters) are estimated for three points during the pandemic: the most stringent lockdown, modest restriction easing and further easing of restrictions. RESULTS: The survey data show frequent outdoor exercise in the early stages of the pandemic, with 46% making six or more weekly trips during lockdown, reducing to 39% during the first phase of restriction easing, and further to 34% during the following phase of easing. The model estimations show that common factors, dominated by socioeconomic and demographic variables, influenced the frequency of outdoor exercise trips across most survey groups. The modelling framework also allowed insights into the impact of unobserved characteristics within several independent variables; for example, the lockdown exercise trip rates of those with a health problem or disability, and those over 65, were both found to be dependent on personal vehicle access. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that those with a health problem or disability, those who live in households where the main income earner is employed in a semi-skilled/unskilled manual occupation or is unemployed and ethnic minority groups (i.e., any mixed, Asian, or Black background) were significantly more likely to complete no weekly outdoor exercise trips throughout the pandemic. As a result, we suggest that these groups are at higher risk of the negative health consequences associated with limited physical activity. Policy implications are discussed in terms of mitigating this effect, as well as reducing transport inequity related to vehicle accessibility.","output":"Trips for outdoor exercise at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Beta blockers are well-established drugs widely used to treat cardiovascular conditions. Observational studies consistently report that beta blocker use in people with COPD is associated with a reduced risk of COPD exacerbations. The bisoprolol in COPD study (BICS) investigates whether adding bisoprolol to routine COPD treatment has clinical and cost-effective benefits. A sub-study will risk stratify participants for heart failure to investigate whether any beneficial effect of bisoprolol is restricted to those with unrecognised heart disease. METHODS: BICS is a pragmatic randomised parallel group double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted in UK primary and secondary care sites. The major inclusion criteria are an established predominant respiratory diagnosis of COPD (post-bronchodilator FEV(1) < 80% predicted, FEV(1)/FVC < 0.7), a self-reported history of  2 exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids in a 12-month period since March 2019, age  40 years and a smoking history  10 pack years. A computerised randomisation system will allocate 1574 participants with equal probability to intervention or control groups, stratified by centre and recruitment in primary/secondary care. The intervention is bisoprolol (1.25 mg tablets) or identical placebo. The dose of bisoprolol/placebo is titrated up to a maximum of 4 tablets a day (5 mg bisoprolol) over 4C7 weeks depending on tolerance to up-dosing of bisoprolol/placebothese titration assessments are completed by telephone or video call. Participants complete the remainder of the 52-week treatment period on the final titrated dose (1, 2, 3, 4 tablets) and during that time are followed up at 26 and 52 weeks by telephone or video call. The primary outcome is the total number of participant reported COPD exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics during the 52-week treatment period. A sub-study will risk stratify participants for heart failure by echocardiography and measurement of blood biomarkers. DISCUSSION: The demonstration that bisoprolol reduces the incidence of exacerbations would be relevant not only to patients and clinicians but also to healthcare providers, in the UK and globally.

Despite this large-scale research effort, these models have found limited practical application due in part to unproven generalization of these models beyond their source study. This study investigates the generalizability of key published models using the publicly available COVID-19 Computed Tomography data through cross dataset validation. We then assess the predictive ability of these models for COVID-19 severity using an independent new dataset that is stratified for COVID-19 lung involvement. Each inter-dataset study is performed using histogram equalization, and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization with and without a learning Gabor filter. The study shows high variability in the generalization of models trained on these datasets due to varied sample image provenances and acquisition processes amongst other factors. We show that under certain conditions, an internally consistent dataset can generalize well to an external dataset despite structural differences between these datasets with f1 scores up to 86%. Our best performing model shows high predictive accuracy for lung involvement score for an independent dataset for which expertly labelled lung involvement stratification is available. Creating an ensemble of our best model for disease positive prediction with our best model for disease negative prediction using a min-max function resulted in a superior model for lung involvement prediction with average predictive accuracy of 75% for zero lung involvement and 96% for 75-100% lung involvement with almost linear relationship between these stratifications.","output":"Systematic investigation into generalization of COVID-19 CT deep learning models with Gabor ensemble for lung involvement scoring"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the effects of stringency measures (provided by the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker) and total time spent away from home (provided by the Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports) on the COVID-19 outcomes (measured by total COVID-19 cases and total deaths related to the COVID-19) in the United States.

Students' self-regulation and attributes of the learning tasks may be assumed to have played important roles when adapting to this novel schooling situation. They may be predicted to have influenced students' daily self-regulation and hence the independence with which they worked on learning tasks. The present work investigated the role of students' trait self-regulation as well as task difficulty and task enjoyment for students' daily independence from their parents in learning during the homeschooling period. Data on children's trait self-regulation were obtained through a baseline questionnaire filled in by the parents of 535 children (M age a?= 9.69, SD age a?= 2.80). Parents additionally reported about the daily task difficulty, task enjoyment, and students' learning independence through 21 consecutive daily online questionnaires. The results showed students' trait self-regulation to be positively associated with their daily learning independence.

The specificity of such antibody responses was compared among a cohort of toddlers to identify differences between seropositive versus seronegative responses. METHODS: An assessment of the serum IgM and IgG antibody reactivities in 197 toddlers of 1- and 2-years of age was performed with a microfluidic array containing 110 distinct antigens. Longitudinal profiling was done from years 1 to 2. Seropositivity to RNA and DNA viruses; bacteria; live attenuated, inactive, and subunit vaccines; and autoantigens was compared. A stratification was developed based on quantitative variations in the IgG responses. Clinical presentations and previously known genetic risk alleles for various immune system conditions were investigated in relation to IgG responses. RESULTS: IgG reactivities stratified toddlers into low, moderate, and high responder groups. The high group (17%) had elevated IgG responses to multiple RNA and DNA viruses (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, Epstein-Barr virus, adenovirus, Coxsackievirus) and this correlated with increased responses to live attenuated viral vaccines and certain autoantigens. This high group was more likely to be associated with gestational diabetes and an older age. Genetic analyses identified polymorphisms in the IL2RB, TNFSF4, and INS genes in two high responder individuals that were associated with their elevated cytokine levels and clinical history of eczema and asthma. CONCLUSION: Serum IgG profiling of toddlers reveals correlations between the magnitude of the antibody responses towards viruses, live attenuated vaccines, and certain autoantigens. A low responder group had much weaker responses overall, including against vaccines. The serum antibody screen also identifies individuals with IgG responses to less common infections (West Nile virus, parvovirus, tuberculosis). The characterization of the antibody responses in combination with the identification of genetic risk alleles provides an opportunity to identify children with increased risk of clinical disease.

The objective of the current study was to assess the biocompatibility of Silicon Hydroxyapatite (Si-HA) and to improve osteogenic potential by using autologous adipose-derived SVF with Si-HA in a rabbit bone defect model. Si-HA granules synthesized using a wet precipitation method were used. They were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). A hemolysis assay was used to assess the hemolytic effects of Si-HA, while cell viability was assessed through Alamar Blue assay using MC3T3 mouse osteoblasts. The osteogenic potential of Si-HA both alone and with enzymatically/non-enzymatically-derived SVF (modified) was performed by implantation in a rabbit tibia model followed by histomorphometric analysis and SEM of dissected bone after six weeks. The results showed that Si-HA granules were microporous and phase pure and that the addition of Silicon did not influence Si-HA phase composition. Si-HA granules were found to be non-hemolytic on the hemolysis assay and non-toxic to MC3T3 mouse osteoblasts on the Alamar Blue assay. Six weeks following implantation Si-HA showed high biocompatibility, with increased bone formation in all groups compared to control. Histologically more mature bone was formed in the Si-HA implanted along with non-enzymatically-derived modified SVF. Bone formation was observed on and around Si-HA, reflecting osseointegration.

Even for applications with extremely regular and homogeneous compute-communicate phases, simply adding communication time to computation time does often not yield a satisfactory prediction of parallel runtime due to deviations from the expected simple lockstep pattern caused by system noise, variations in communication time, and inherent load imbalance. In this paper, we highlight the specific cases of provoked and spontaneous desynchronization of memory-bound, bulk-synchronous pure MPI and hybrid MPI+OpenMP programs. Using simple microbenchmarks we observe that although desynchronization can introduce increased waiting time per process, it does not necessarily cause lower resource utilization but can lead to an increase in available bandwidth per core. In case of significant communication overhead, even natural noise can shove the system into a state of automatic overlap of communication and computation, improving the overall time to solution. The saturation point, i.e., the number of processes per memory domain required to achieve full memory bandwidth, is pivotal in the dynamics of this process and the emerging stable wave pattern. We also demonstrate how hybrid MPI-OpenMP programming can prevent desirable desynchronization by eliminating the bandwidth bottleneck among processes.

How to effectively identify the motion process accurately has become a hot spot in the optimization system. In the existing research studies, the recognition accuracy is not very good and the response time is long. To end this issue, the paper proposed an information processing system and optimization method of human motion recognition based on the GA-BP neural network algorithm. Firstly, a human motion recognition system based on dynamic capture recognition technology is designed, which realizes the recognition of motion information from common postures such as action span, speed change, motion trajectory, and other aspects in the process of human motion. Secondly, the proposed algorithm is used to comprehensively analyse and evaluate the motion state. Finally, experiments are designed to verify and analyse the results. Compared to some baseline methods in human motion recognition information systems, the system in this paper based on the GA-BP neural network algorithm has the advantages of higher data accuracy and response speed, which can quickly and accurately identify the muscle group change in the process of human motion, and it can also provide customized motion suggestions based on the results.","output":"Optimization of Human Motion Recognition Information Processing System Based on GA-BP Neural Network Algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Government response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic promises to entrench austerity politics deeper into the organization of academic life, and audit regimes are the likely means of achieving this. Redoubled efforts to understand the operation of audit as a strategic technology of control are therefore clearly a priority. A distinctly anthropological literature has emerged over recent years to analyse and understand audit culture in academia, but what seems to be missing are analyses capable of bringing the disparate techniques experienced in academic audit together into coherent technologies, and identifying how these technologies thereby constitute a distinct audit regime within the broader audit culture. While the anthropological literature implicitly calls for further historical and conceptual exploration of the rationality to these techniques, what is required is the translation of our understanding of audit rationality into a presentation of the concrete techniques of control as they are experienced, so that more effective counter-conducts and resistances can be conceived. This article indicates how an excursion into the Soviet Gulag, and the political technology of the ?camp? that is its principal apparatus, can reveal not merely how the techniques of audit operate, but also indicate how those techniques might be engaged tactically in the academic setting. This kind of analogic analysis can allow us to understand audit in ways more promising for resistance to its idiomatic power, replacing demoralized and helpless resignation with inspirational exempla. Politically, the article argues that ?techniques of the self? are not only necessary to engage audit techniques through particular kinds of counter-conduct, but how these counter-conducts are contributory to the organized and concerted kind of resistance that we so desperately desire. The practice of tukhta is singled out and introduced as an illustrative means for combining survival strategies with the development of critical rationality in praxis.","output":"Controlling academics: Power and resistance in the archipelago of post-COVID-19 audit regimes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic represents a major challenge for health care systems worldwide. Recent data suggests an increased risk for personnel of gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy units for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Several societies have provided recommendations for the current situation, but their feasibility is unclear and real-world data on preparedness of endoscopy units are lacking. Aims & Methods A web-based survey among German GI-endoscopy heads was conducted from April 1 to April 7, 2020. It comprised 33 questions based on the ESGE (European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy) recommendations and was distributed electronically by the German Society of Gastroenterology, Digestive and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS). Results Of 551 completed surveys, 202 (37 %) endoscopy units cancelled less than 40 % of their procedures. Small-volume units (< 4000 procedures/year) cancelled significantly less procedures than high-volume units (> 4000). Complete spatial separation of high-risk patients was possible in only 17 %. Most units systematically identified patients at risk (91 %) and used risk adapted personal protective equipment (PPE, 85 %). For the future, shortages in PPE (83 %), staff (69 %) and relevant financial losses (80 %) were expected. Conclusions Recommendations on structural measures were only partially fulfilled and cancellations of procedures were heterogeneous. Clear definitions of indications to perform endoscopies during such a pandemic are needed. Further, structural recommendations should be adapted and strategies to compensate financial losses need to be developed.","output":"Gastrointestinale Endoskopie in Zeiten der COVID-19-Pandemie: Umsetzung von Empfehlungen und Erwartungen fr die Zukunft"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The negative effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have impacted the world economy due to the absence from work because of SARS-CoV-2 infection in workers, among other reasons. However, some economic areas are essential to society and people must continue working outside the home to support economic reactivation; their serological profile could be different from that of the global population. Cross-sectional study: Workers from health, construction, public transportation, public force, bike delivery messengers, independent or informal commerce areas, and residents of Bucaramanga or its metropolitan area were invited to participate. All participants self-completed a virtual survey and a blood test was taken to assess IgG and IgM with the ARC COV2 test. Seroprevalence was estimated considering a complex survey design, correcting for a finite population effect and adjusting for test performance. A total of 7045 workers were enrolled; 59.9% were women and most were residents of Bucaramanga and working in health occupations. The global adjusted seroprevalence was 19.5% (CI: 95% 18.6C20.4), being higher for Girn (27.9%; 95% CI: 24.5C31.30).

The aim of the paper is to give a brief introduction to the anomalies of the global mortgage markets. After having studied different continents and countries, the most pressing problems are presented, and the study confirms the fact that in general the initial monthly obligations place a huge financial burden on households. This fact limits the room for manoeuvre of the young families when buying a property. With the concept of adjustable net present value of the repayments, a new mortgage market formula is introduced. In general the solution may provide more flexible monthly repayments in present value terms for the borrowers. The new approach could be an alternative to renting properties, it may help young families achieve home ownership and at the same time it may mitigate the problems of the currently rather unhealthy global mortgage market tendencies.","output":"How to breathe a new life into the global mortgage market? - An alternative solution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While COVID-19 has generated a massive burden of illness worldwide, healthcare workers (HCWs) have been disproportionately exposed to SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection. During the so-called first wave, infection rates among this population group have ranged between 10% and 20%, raising as high as one in every four COVID-19 patients in Spain at the peak of the crisis. Now that many countries are already dealing with new waves of COVID-19 cases, a potential competition between HCW and non-HCW patients for scarce resources can still be a likely clinical scenario. In this paper, we address the question of whether HCW who become ill with COVID-19 should be prioritised in diagnostic, treatment or resource allocation protocols. We will evaluate some of the proposed arguments both in favour and against the prioritisation of HCW and also consider which clinical circumstances might warrant prioritising HCW and why could it be ethically appropriate to do so. We conclude that prioritising HCWs access to protective equipment, diagnostic tests or even prophylactic or therapeutic drug regimes and vaccines might be ethically defensible. However, prioritising HCWs to receive intensive care unit (ICU) beds or ventilators is a much more nuanced decision, in which arguments such as instrumental value or reciprocity might not be enough, and economic and systemic values will need to be considered.","output":"Should healthcare workers be prioritised during the COVID-19 pandemic?

Although Cornwall was used as the study area in this research, this index has been designed such that it can be readily applied elsewhere. Two differently weighted models were created using the framework C one with equal weights and the other based on the frequency the constituent indicators appeared in the reviewed academic literature. Both models were mapped across Cornwall, identifying areas of deprivation at a finer resolution than under the current widely used Participation of Local Areas (POLAR) methodology. The weighted model performed marginally better than both the equal weighted model and the current POLAR methodology when validated against external data, and additionally it worked well in both rural and urban environments leading to it being selected as the new HEAD index. The HEAD index maps smaller scale areas of deprivation than previously available, and by enabling users to investigate the underlying socio-demographic characteristics of an area, it also allows universities to create interventions, support, and policies that best targets the students they aim to recruit and teach.","output":"Creating a Composite Index to Target Recruitment of UK Students from Areas of Low Participation in Higher Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite measures taken world-wide, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues. Because efficient antiviral drugs are not yet widely available, vaccination is the best option to control the infection rate. Although this option is obvious in the case of COVID-19-naive individuals, it is still unclear when individuals who have recovered from a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection should be vaccinated and whether the vaccination raises immune responses against the coronavirus and its novel variants. In this study, we collected peripheral blood from 84 healthy human donors of different COVID-19 status who were vaccinated with the Sputnik Light vaccine and measured the dynamics of the Ab and T cell responses, as well as the virus-neutralizing activity (VNA) in serum, against two SARS-CoV-2 variants, B.1.1.1 and B.1.617.2. We showed that vaccination of individuals previously exposed to the virus considerably boosts the existing immune response. In these individuals, receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG titers and VNA in serum were already elevated on the 7th day after vaccination, whereas COVID-19-naive individuals developed the Ab response and VNA mainly 21 d postvaccination. Additionally, we found a strong correlation between RBD-specific IgG titers and VNA in serum, and according to these data vaccination may be recommended when the RBD-specific IgG titers drop to 142.7 binding Ab units/ml or below. In summary, the results of the study demonstrate that vaccination is beneficial for both COVID-19-naive and recovered individuals, especially since it raises serum VNA against the B.1.617.2 variant, one of the five SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.","output":"Boosting of the SARS-CoV-2-Specific Immune Response after Vaccination with Single-Dose Sputnik Light Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the 1940s, the US dollar was established as an international currency Since then, its position has been practically unchallenged However, in light of the financial crisis of 2008, the strengthening of the Chinese and European economies, and the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to reflect on the future balance of power in the international monetary system To this end, this article poses the following research question: Is the US dollar facing a threat to its leading position in the global arena?

Telemedicine, has been relatively less used in India especially in public sector hospitals. The current study was designed to assess the patients knowledge, attitude and acceptance of telenephrology services at our institute, a public sector hospital in a developing country. METHOD: This study is a cross-sectional survey carried out among patients who had availed our telenephrology services during the preceding three months. A total of 150 patients were selected by stratified random sampling from the list of attendees of telenephrology consultation in the past 3 months. The questionnaire was administered in local language by telephone interview method. The frequency distributions and average and median values for each of the questionnaire variables were calculated using SPSS software. RESULTS: The average age of the study cohort was 42.52  15.1 years (17 C 83yrs). 68% of the patients were males. The questionnaire was answered by the patient himself/herself in 56% cases, spouse in 14.0% and children in 20.7% cases. 51.3% patients were graduates or post graduates. 40.7% patients belonged to the upper middle and 39.3% belonged to the lower middle socioeconomic class. 54.6% patients were residing in towns, 28.7% in cities and 16.7% in villages. Prior to the telenephrology service, the median distance travelled to attend our OPD was 113.5 (3 C 2249 km). Attendees incurred loss of work in 54.7% cases. Information about availability of telenephrology services was obtained from institutional helpline number by 59 (39.3%) patients while 50 (33.3%) patients obtained it from the internet. Others got information from friends, television or short message service (SMS). The average number of teleconsultations was 2 per patient. A large majority of patients (99.3%) felt that Telenephrology service was a right approach during the COVID-19 pandemic. On asking how they felt regarding Telenephrology experience, 70.67% said they were very happy, 25.3% were happy and 4.0% said they were apprehensive or doubtful. 96.6% patients said that they were confident discussing their complaints over phone. 92.6% patients were comfortable sharing reports over phone while 7.3% needed help from caretakers. Regarding the problems faced during teleconsultation, 36% patients responded that they wish to see the doctor in person to feel satisfied while 3.3% found difficulty in understanding drug dosages. 86% patients felt that Telenephrology services should continue even after the COVID pandemic.

To assess this, we compared outcomes of patients with and without ESKD, hospitalized with COVID-19. This was a retrospective study of patients admitted with COVID-19 from 13 New York hospitals from March 1, 2020, to April 27, 2020, and followed through May 27, 2020. We measured primary outcome (in-hospital death), and secondary outcomes (mechanical ventilation and length of stay). Of 10,482 patients with COVID-19, 419 had ESKD. Patients with ESKD were older, had a greater percentage self-identified as Black, and more comorbid conditions. Patients with ESKD had a higher rate of in-hospital death than those without (31.7% vs 25.4%, odds ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.12 - 1.70). This increase rate remained after adjusting for demographic and comorbid conditions (adjusted odds ratio 1.37, 1.09 - 1.73).

There was no difference in the odds of mechanical ventilation between the groups. Independent risk factors for in-hospital death for patients with ESKD were increased age, being on a ventilator, lymphopenia, blood urea nitrogen and serum ferritin.

Considering the importance of the topic, we report on six kidney transplant recipients (median age 47 [41C55]) with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19. The most common admission presentations were fever (83.3%), dyspnea, and myalgia. At baseline, immunosuppressive therapy was ceased, prednisolone dose was increased, and all patients received antiviral treatment including hydroxychloroquine and umifenovir.

Despite the lack of classroom teaching, the aim was to achieve intensive cooperation between the students. Project description: In the elective, the students worked on a total of 14 learning tasks, so-called e-tivities, which stimulate collaborative work and thus promote the examination of the learning content. These asynchronous learning activities were supplemented by video conferences, in which the students also took on the role of presenters. The teachers accompanied this learning process as e-moderators. Results: In April/May 2020, the elective course was carried out with 12 students entirely online. Despite a workload that was experienced as high, the elective was rated very well by the students. Discussion: The didactic concept of the elective enabled an active engagement with the learning material and the social interaction between the learners. With the digital learning offers, the learners were able to gain new experiences which are also of professional relevance.

Each of these disciplines works in systems that face ethical dilemmas, making it important that public health workers have motivation to understand and practice within the ethical guidelines of their profession, thus making ethics an important component of training and practice. The dangers of ethical lapses are overwhelmingly apparent in the case of the Eugenics movement of the early 20(th) century which metamorphosed from forced sterilizations in many liberal democratic countries into mass murder of physically and mentally handicapped children and adults in Nazi Germany. Between 1939 and 1941, 180 thousand psychiatric patients along with an equivalent number of handicapped children and adults were killed in an organized extermination program in Germany by lethal gassing. This method was then applied to the industrialized murder or Holocaust of six million Jews and millions of other untermenschen (sub human) in the greatest genocide in human history. Shortly after World War II ended the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals were conducted including medical doctors, and some were executed for crimes against humanity. This was followed by the 1948 United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and by the World Medical Associations Helsinki Declaration. Both are widely accepted as cornerstone documentsthe latter specifically governing ethical standards related to human experimentationand are revised regularly since being issued in 1964.

Having little access to their social networks and support systems, people have had to turn to digital tools and spaces to cope with their experiences of anxiety and loss. With no clear end to the pandemic in sight, many of us are likely to remain reliant upon DMH for the foreseeable future. As such, it is important to articulate some of the specific ways in which the pandemic is affecting our self and world-relation, such that we can identify how DMH services are best able to accommodate some of the newly emerging needs of their users. In this paper I will identify a specific type of loss brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and present it as an important concept for DMH. I refer to this loss as loss of perceptual world-familiarity. Loss of perceptual world-familiarity entails a breakdown in the ongoing effortless responsiveness to our perceptual environment that characterizes much of our everyday lives. To cash this out I will turn to insights from the phenomenological tradition. Initially, my project is descriptive. I aim to bring out how loss of perceptual world-familiarity is a distinctive form of loss that is deeply pervasive yet easily overlooked-hence the relevance of explicating it for DMH purposes. But I will also venture into the space of the normative, offering some reasons for seeing perceptual world-familiarity as a component of well-being. I conclude the paper with a discussion of how loss of perceptual world-familiarity affects the therapeutic setting now that most if not all therapeutic interactions have transitioned to online spaces and I explore the potential to augment these spaces with social interaction technologies. Throughout, my discussion aims to do justice to the reality that perceptual world-familiarity is not an evenly distributed phenomenon, that factors like disability, gender and race affect its robustness, and that this ought to be reckoned with when seeking to incorporate the phenomenon into or mitigate it through DMH services.","output":"Perceptual breakdown during a global pandemic: introducing phenomenological insights for digital mental health purposes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) belongs to coronavirus group II and encodes 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) which mediate genome replication and transcription.

Between 2020 and 2021, such an event occurred across pig production sites in the Midwestern U.S. The emerging viral clade is referred to as the novel sub-lineage 1C (L1C) 1-4-4 variant. This genetic classification is based on the open reading frame 5 (ORF5) gene. However, although whole genome sequence (WGS) suggested that this variant represented the emergence of a new strain, the true evolutionary history of this variant remains unclear. To better elucidate the variant's evolutionary history, we conducted a recombination detection analysis, time-scaled phylogenetic estimation, and discrete trait analysis on a set of L1C-1-4-4 WGSs (n = 19) alongside other publicly published WGSs (n = 232) collected over a 26-year period (1995C2021). Results from various methodologies consistently suggest that the novel L1C variant was a descendant of a recombinant ancestor characterized by recombination at the ORF1a gene between two segments that would be otherwise classified as L1C and L1A in the ORF5 gene. Based on analysis of different WGS fragments, the L1C-1-4-4 variant descended from an ancestor that existed around late 2018 to early 2019, with relatively high substitution rates in the proximal ORF1a as well as ORF5 regions. Two viruses from 2018 were found to be the closest relatives to the 2020-21 outbreak strain but had different recombination profiles, suggesting that these viruses were not direct ancestors. We also assessed the overall frequency of putative recombination amongst ORF5 and other parts of the genome and found that recombination events which leave detectable numbers of descendants are not common. However, the rapid spread and high virulence of the L1C-1-4-4 recombinant variant demonstrates that inter-sub-lineage recombination occasionally found amongst the U.S. PRRSV-2 might be an evolutionary mechanisms that contributed to this emergence. More generally, recombination amongst PRRSV-2 accelerates genetic change and increases the chance of the emergence of high fitness variants.","output":"Measuring How Recombination Re-shapes the Evolutionary History of PRRSV-2: A Genome-Based Phylodynamic Analysis of the Emergence of a Novel PRRSV-2 Variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Legalization of cannabis for medical uses has proceeded without well-controlled study of its efficacy and safety for most indications. Real world patterns of medical cannabis use are highly variable and rarely overseen by a physician. Pragmatic effectiveness studies with web-based and smartphone assessment methods, designed to understand ecologically valid patterns of medical cannabis use and health symptoms, can help clarify the risks and benefits of cannabis use for medical indications. Methods: As part of a larger, randomized trial (NCT03224468), adults (N=181) seeking medical cannabis for insomnia, pain, or anxiety or depressive symptoms were randomized to obtain a medical cannabis card immediately (MCC) or to a waitlist control (WLC) and subsequently completed 12-weeks of daily web-based surveys on cannabis use and three health outcomes: sleep, pain, and depressive symptoms. Results: Completion rates of daily surveys in this long-term, web-based survey design were moderate to high across participants (median number of daily assessments completed: 72 out of 90 days). Daily reports of cannabis use were consistent with monthly interview assessments and urinalysis. The MCC group increased cannabis use frequency in the 12 weeks following randomization, while WLC did not. Within the MCC group, self-reported sleep quality was significantly higher on cannabis use days, compared to nonuse days. The MCC group displayed long-term sleep improvements, consistent with increased cannabis frequency rather than a sustained effect of any single cannabis use. Daily associations between cannabis use and self-reported pain or depressive symptoms were small and not significant. Conclusion: Cannabis use is associated with same day improvements in self-reported sleep quality, but not pain or depressive symptoms, although sleep improvements occurred in the context of increased frequency of cannabis use, raising the risk for cannabis use disorder. Long-term, daily web-based assessments of cannabis appear valid and feasible in medical cannabis users, providing a robust method for future real-world effectiveness studies with expanded and objective measures. .","output":"Cannabis Use and Sleep Quality in Daily Life: a Daily Diary Study of Adults Starting Cannabis for Health Concerns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading throughout the world after emerging in China in December 2019.

With anecdotal reports and in vitro studies suggesting that certain medicines already in use for treatment of other conditions could be viable treatment options, there has been an increased demand for these therapies which could have adverse consequences on patients and healthcare systems. Toxicity from these medicines resulting from a mad rush for them at community pharmacies and pressure on physicians to prescribe for individuals who do not have the infection are worth noting.

Whereas Fc effector functions are dispensable when representative neutralizing mAbs are administered as prophylaxis, they are required for optimal protection as therapy. When given after infection, intact mAbs reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden and lung disease in mice and hamsters better than loss-of-function Fc variant mAbs. Fc engagement of neutralizing antibodies mitigates inflammation and improves respiratory mechanics, and transcriptional profiling suggests these phenotypes are associated with diminished innate immune signaling and preserved tissue repair. Immune cell depletions establish that neutralizing mAbs require monocytes and CD8+ T cells for optimal clinical and virological benefit. Thus, potently neutralizing mAbs utilize Fc effector functions during therapy to mitigate lung infection and disease.","output":"Human neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 require intact Fc effector functions for optimal therapeutic protection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug development is a long, expensive and multistage process geared to achieving safe drugs with high efficacy. A crucial prerequisite for completing the medication regimen for oral drugs, particularly for pediatric and geriatric populations, is achieving taste that does not hinder compliance. Currently, the aversive taste of drugs is tested in late stages of clinical trials. This can result in the need to reformulate, potentially resulting in the use of more animals for additional toxicity trials, increased financial costs and a delay in release to the market. Here we present BitterIntense, a machine learning tool that classifies molecules into very bitter or not very bitter, based on their chemical structure. The model, trained on chemically diverse compounds, has above 80% accuracy on several test sets. BitterIntense suggests that intense bitterness does not correlate with toxicity and hepatotoxicity of drugs and that the prevalence of very bitter compounds among drugs is lower than among microbial compounds. BitterIntense allows quick and easy prediction of strong bitterness of compounds of interest for food and pharma industries. We estimate that implementation of BitterIntense or similar tools early in drug discovery and development process may lead to reduction in delays, in animal use and in overall financial burden. Significance Statement Drug development integrates increasingly sophisticated technologies, but extreme bitterness of drugs remains a poorly addressed cause of medicine regimen incompletion. Reformulating the drug can result in delays in the development of a potential medicine, increasing the lead time to the patients. It might also require the use of extra animals in toxicity trials and lead to increased costs for pharma companies. We have developed a computational predictor for intense bitterness, that has above 80% accuracy. Applying the classifier to annotated datasets suggests that intense bitterness does not correlate with toxicity and hepatotoxicity of drugs. BitterIntense can be used in the early stages of drug development to identify drug candidates that require bitterness masking, and thus reduce animal use, time and monetary loss.","output":"Intense bitterness of molecules: machine learning for expediting drug discovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Iran health system has implemented various reforms to provide equitable access to health care for citizens.

Rather than a smooth continuum to facilitate application of knowledge, clerkship blocks are discrete, fragmented structures with little integration. Developments in cognitive psychology and increasing attention to the student learning environment are driving more purposeful integration in medical education. We sought to enhance knowledge transfer in the Family Medicine clerkship by developing an e-learning pathway with both asynchronous and synchronous components to integrate pre-clerkship problem-based learning (PBL) cases into more complex clinical scenarios. METHODS: A parallel-convergent mixed methods evaluation was conducted, which included comparison of learning outcomes (exit exams) relative to the prior class, knowledge check quiz performance, and qualitative analysis of student and faculty perceptions. RESULTS: Analyses revealed no significant difference between exit exam scores of the intervention and pre-intervention clerks (p = 0.30). There were statistically significant differences in mean quiz scores over the rotation (p = 0.0001). Moreover, learners and faculty each perceived the integration components as facilitating the transfer of pre-clinical learning into clerkship activities.

In response to rising cases, these were supplemented by national restrictions on contacts (the Rule of Six), then 10 pm closing for bars and restaurants, and encouragement to work from home. These were quickly followed by a 3-tier system applying different restrictions in different localities. As cases continued to rise, a second national lockdown was declared. We used a national survey to quantify the impact of these restrictions on epidemiologically relevant contacts. METHODS: We compared paired measures on setting-specific contacts before and after each restriction started and tested for differences using paired permutation tests on the mean change in contacts and the proportion of individuals decreasing their contacts. RESULTS: Following the imposition of each measure, individuals tended to report fewer contacts than they had before. However, the magnitude of the changes was relatively small and variable. For instance, although early closure of bars and restaurants appeared to have no measurable effect on contacts, the work from home directive reduced mean daily work contacts by 0.99 (95% confidence interval CI] 0.03-1.94), and the Rule of Six reduced non-work and school contacts by a mean of 0.25 (0.01-0.5) per day. Whilst Tier 3 appeared to also reduce non-work and school contacts, the evidence for an effect of the lesser restrictions (Tiers 1 and 2) was much weaker. There may also have been some evidence of saturation of effects, with those who were in Tier 1 (least restrictive) reducing their contacts markedly when they entered lockdown, which was not reflected in similar changes in those who were already under tighter restrictions (Tiers 2 and 3). CONCLUSIONS: The imposition of various local and national measures in England during the summer and autumn of 2020 has gradually reduced contacts. However, these changes are smaller than the initial lockdown in March. This may partly be because many individuals were already starting from a lower number of contacts.","output":"The impact of local and national restrictions in response to COVID-19 on social contacts in England: a longitudinal natural experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Valnemulin (VAL) and tiamulin (TIA) are pleuromutilin antibiotics used primarily for treating bacterial infections in swine or other food animals.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the population-level interest in anti-rheumatic drugs during the COVID-19 era, by analyzing changes in Google search frequency data. METHOD: To obtain the relative search volume (RSV) of anti-rheumatic drugs, we queried Google Trends for 78 search terms representing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, antigout agents, conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), immunosuppressants, biologics, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors within the USA. Three 8-week periods in 2020 (March 15CMay 9), (May 10CJuly 4), and (July 5CAugust 29) representing the initial- and short-term periods were compared to overlapping periods of the preceding 3 years (2017C2019). RESULTS: We found statistically significant increases in RSV for colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab (and its brand name-Actemra), and anakinra, and statistically significant decreases among brand names of immunosuppressive agents (i.e., mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, cyclosporine) during both the initial- and short-term COVID-19 periods as compared to overlapping periods of the preceding 3 years. CONCLUSION: There were significant increases in RSV of colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and anakinra during both initial- and short-term COVID-19 periods when compared to overlapping periods of the preceding 3 years reflecting a heightened level of information-seeking on these drugs during the pandemic.

Therefore, in a first study we investigated the mechanisms involved in the relaxant effect of pirfenidone in rat intrapulmonary arteries and coronary arteries from normal mice. Then in a second study, we investigated whether pirfenidone restores endothelial function in the aorta and mesenteric arteries from diabetic animals. From 16C18-week old normal male C57BL/6 mice and normoglycemic (db/db+), and type 2 diabetic (db/db) male and female mice, arteries were mounted in microvascular isometric myographs for functional studies, and immunoblotting was performed. In rat pulmonary arteries and mouse coronary arteries, pirfenidone induced relaxations, which were inhibited in preparations without endothelium. In mouse coronary arteries, pirfenidone relaxation was inhibited in the presence of a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-l-arginine (L-NOARG), a blocker of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BK(Ca)), iberiotoxin, and a blocker of K(V)7 channels, XE991. Patch clamp studies in vascular smooth muscle revealed pirfenidone increased iberiotoxin-sensitive current. In the aorta and mesenteric small arteries from diabetic db/db mice relaxations induced by the endothelium-dependent vasodilator, acetylcholine, were markedly reduced compared to db/db + mice. Pirfenidone enhanced the relaxations induced by acetylcholine in the aorta from diabetic male and female db/db mice. An opener of K(V)7 channels, flupirtine, had the same effect as pirfenidone. XE991 reduced the effect of pirfenidone and flupirtine and further reduced acetylcholine relaxations in the aorta. In the presence of iberiotoxin, pirfenidone still increased acetylcholine relaxation in aorta from db/db mice. Immunoblotting for K(V)7.4, K(V)7.5, and BK(Ca) channel subunits were unaltered in aorta from db/db mice. Pirfenidone failed to improve acetylcholine relaxation in mesenteric arteries, and neither changed acetylcholine-induced transient decreases in blood pressure in db/db+ and db/db mice.

The aim was to categorise WMTY and investigate changes during COVID-19. METHODS: WMTY, clinical frailty score (CFS), age, gender, vision and hearing impairment, malnutrition risk, modified Barthel Index (mBI), living alone status, 4AT and dementia screening results were prospectively entered onto MS Excel. Answers were retrospectively categorised and compared, pre-COVID-19 (April to June 2019) and during COVID-19 (April to June 2020). Descriptive statistics and MS Excel T-test were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The mean CFS (5), age (82 years), male: female ratio (1:1.3), prevalence of visual and hearing impairment (20C30%) and malnutrition risk were similar (23%) in both groups mBI was non-significantly reduced by a 1 point average during COVID-19. Less patients lived alone during COVID-19 (p = 0.05). Positive delirium screen doubled (12% vs 26%) during COVID-19. Positive dementia screen doubled (10% vs 20%) during COVID-19. Themes in decreasing order were family, health, home, functional independence, pets, discharge plan, religion, work, social activities and other pre-COVID-19. Family and health accounted for 49% of responses. During COVID-19, the order changed to health, family and home, functional independence, work and discharge planning, pets, religion and social activities. There was a 50% increase in functional independence as a response, a 40% increase in home and a 58% decrease in family as a response. CONCLUSION: Cognitive vulnerability doubled during COVID-19. Nine themes were identified. WMTY themes shifted during COVID-19. Health become the most frequent response. Family became a less frequent response with less people living alone. Functional independence was more frequent reflecting the need for self-reliance during COVID-19. Home, where all COVID-19 life was lived, was expressed as WMTY by a greater number of respondents. Promotion of functional independence has been identified as a key driver for practice change.","output":"179 WHAT MATTERS TO THE FRAIL OLDER PERSON CHANGES DURING COVID-19 AND SHOULD INFORM PATIENT CENTRED CHANGE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Discuss advantages and disadvantages of relocating IV pumps for coronavirus disease 2019 patients from bedside to outside the patient room and characterize reproducible details of an external infusion pump model. DESIGN: Brief report. SETTING: ICUs at a single-center teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients under contact and special droplet precautions. INTERVENTIONS: Relocation of IV pumps for coronavirus disease 2019 patients from bedside to outside the patient room using extension tubing. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Infusion pumps secured to a rolling IV pole are moved immediately outside the patient room with extension tubing, reaching the patient through a closed door. It is anticipated that this practice may reduce unnecessary coronavirus disease 2019 exposure for healthcare professionals, reduce the consumption of personal protective equipment, and promote patient safety by limiting delays of donning personal protective equipment to initiate or adjust medications. CONCLUSIONS: Risks of situating IV pumps outside the patient room must be carefully weighed against the benefits. Relocation of IV pumps outside the patient room may be considered given shortages of personal protective equipment and high risk of healthcare professional exposure.

METHODS: An EDR approach was used to inform a de novo implementation of an LMS during an early clinical rotation of medical students. The EDR consisted of three phases: analysis and exploration; design and construction; and evaluation and reflection. Process and evaluation data (including academic years 2018 and 2019) from two student cohorts (total n = 190, 107 without and 83 with LMS exposure) at one academic teaching hospital were analyzed. RESULTS: Learning theories and concepts of self-regulated learning were used to develop and implement an LMS clerkship prototype. For design and construction, the maturing prototype design included flipped-classroom elements, in-class activation, voluntary digital self-assessments, and clinical teaching videos. For evaluation and reflection, global satisfaction improvement was significant (from 3.9 to 4.4 on a 5-point Likert scale, p < 0.05). There was a positive evaluation trend for all evaluation items related to learning climate, self-regulated learning, and perceived usefulness of the LMS prototype; however, these changes were not statistically significant. The teaching hospital also improved its ranking after the introduction of the LMS prototype. Nearly all students (94%) used the LMS material. The average number of times the LMS course was accessed per student was 70 (range: 7C172), and the average duration students spent online was 58 minutes (range: 9C165). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that using an EDR approach was helpful for systematically introducing an LMS in a clerkship curriculum informed by learning theory. Our evidence-oriented curriculum reform was associated with higher student satisfaction and appeared to support self-regulated learning in the workplace. Further research should explore which elements of an LMS most effectively help to achieve educational outcomes.","output":"Curriculum Development with the Implementation of an Open-Source Learning Management System for Training Early Clinical Students: An Educational Design Research Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One impact of COVID-19 on teaching has been the utilization of the virtual classroom and, along with that, ?Zoom fatigue?. At Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM), one approach to reduce the scheduled screen time has been to pre-record lectures so students can access these at their convenience. Much of the pharmacology content is delivered as lecture with some content reinforcement in small group sessions. Transitioning from synchronous, live lectures to pre-recorded lectures that can be accessed asynchronously presents a number of potential challenges including building rapport with students, maintaining a common experience between the pharmacology faculty and students since the lectures can be recorded weeks or months before being accessible to the students, responding to non-verbal cues during the lecture to expand or quickly move past a concept, opportunities for faculty development in response to those non-verbal cues, and continuous quality improvement of the lecture based on real-time feedback. One solution has been the ?interactive lecture?: a hybrid model in which students prepare for a synchronous session by watching a short (15-20 min) pre-recording that provides relevant physiology and potentially pharmacological strategies. Students join the synchronous session to reinforce and build on concepts from the pre-recording. Because they are coming into the session with some degree of foundational knowledge, there are more opportunities for interaction in the form of polling questions. Similar to reading the non-verbal cues in the classroom, these questions allow the instructor to respond to the students in the room and adjust the teaching focus in real-time. In this way, the session is somewhat directed by the students and their understanding and questions. Additionally, the instructor can revise the session in the future based on a better understanding of what concepts were clear and where students struggled. The IUSM second-year medical students had the experience of one course in which pharmacology was taught asynchronously with only one synchronous small group session and another course in which pharmacology was taught synchronously for all sessions either as interactive lectures or small group sessions. At the end of the second course, students received an evaluation in which they were asked to rank their preference. The overall response rate was 79% (296 of 375 students responding). Of these, 32% of students chose only the pre-recording and 13% of students chose to only access slides without any recording or live session. The remaining 55% of students included a synchronous session in their preference. Clearly, there is a large fraction of students who prefer to learn the pharmacology content independently. Based on other feedback, many of these students are utilizing non-IUSM resources such as Sketchy Pharm, First Aid, and USMLE Step 1 Qbank as their primary resource for pharmacology content. However, the majority of students want some form of synchronous session and interaction in order to help learn, solidify, and apply pharmacology. Of those students, nearly half preferred the interactive lecture format. The interactive lecture is an efficient and effective way to deliver pharmacology content and maintain student-faculty interaction in the virtual classroom.","output":"Teaching Pharmacology to Medical Students: Preference for Faculty Interaction Over Recorded Lectures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to detect the SARS-CoV-2 in a widespread epidemic is crucial for screening of carriers and for the success of quarantine efforts.

It is estimated that up to 70% of the health workforce are women, however, this pattern is not reflected in the leadership of health systems where women are under-represented. METHODS This systematized review explored the existing literature around women's progress towards leadership in the health sector in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) which has used intersectional analysis. RESULTS While there are studies that have looked at the inequities and barriers women face in progressing towards leadership positions in health systems within LMICs, none explicitly used an intersectionality framework in their approach. These studies did nevertheless show recurring barriers to health systems leadership created at the intersection of gender and social identities such as professional cadre, race/ethnicity, financial status, and culture. These barriers limit women's access to resources that improve career development, including mentorship and sponsorship opportunities, reduce value, recognition and respect at work for women, and increase the likelihood of women to take on dual burdens of professional work and childcare and domestic work, and, create biased views about effectiveness of men and women's leadership styles. An intersectional lens helps to better understand how gender intersects with other social identities which results in upholding these persisting barriers to career progression and leadership. CONCLUSION As efforts to reduce gender inequity in health systems are gaining momentum, it is important to look beyond gender and take into account other intersecting social identities that create unique positionalities of privilege and/or disadvantage. This approach should be adopted across a diverse range of health systems programs and policies in an effort to strengthen gender equity in health and specifically human resources for health (HRH), and improve health system governance, functioning and outcomes.","output":"The Use of Intersectional Analysis in Assessing Women's Leadership Progress in the Health Workforce in LMICs: A Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Australian states and territories implemented eviction moratoriums and measures to vary rent obligations C a remarkable response for jurisdictions that have, for decades, regulated residential landlord-tenant relations on a model of mild consumer protection, market rents and ready termination.

We establish the S-palmitoylation at the outer nuclear membrane assay (SwissKASH) to probe substrate specificity of PATs in intact cells. With this assay, we show that PATs localizing to different membrane compartments display remarkable substrate selectivity, which is the basis for PMP compartmentalization.

Given testing limitations from March 15 to April 24, all patients receiving a SARS-CoV-2 test were symptomatic. On April 24, testing was expanded to all ED admissions. The primary and secondary outcome was ED LOS and number needed to test (NNT) to obtain a positive, respectively. Results A total of 70,856 patients were cared for in the EDs during the seven month period. The testing change increased admission LOS by 1.89 hours (SE 0.25, 95% CI: 1.39, 2.38). The NNT was 2.5 patients and was highest yield on April 1, 2020 when the state positivity rate was 39.7%, however the NNT exceeded 170 patients by Sept 1, 2020 at which point the state positivity rate was 0.5%. Discussion While universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of ED admissions may meaningfully support mitigation and containment efforts, the clinical cost of testing all admissions amidst low community positivity is notable. In our system, universal ED SARS-CoV-2 testing was associated with a 24% increase in admission LOS alongside the detection of only one positive case every other day.

Studies on hCoVs and the identification of antivirals are therefore crucial to improve human well-being. However, hCoVs have long been neglected and the methodology to study virus infection, replication and inhibition warrants being updated. We here evaluated the established plaque-based assays to determine viral titers and cell-to-cell spread and developed protocols for the immunodetection of the viral nucleocapsid protein by flow cytometry and in-cell ELISA to study infection rates at early time points. The developed protocols allow detection of hCoV-229E infection after 2, and hCoV-NL63 and -OC43 infection after 3 days at a single cell level or in a 96 well microtiter format, in large sample numbers without being laborious or expensive. Both assays can be applied to assess the susceptibility of cells to hCoV infection and replication, and to determine the efficacy of antiviral compounds as well as neutralizing antibodies in a sensitive and quantitative manner. Application revealed that clinically applied SARS-CoV-2 targeting monoclonal antibodies are inactive against hCoVs, but that the viral polymerase targeting antivirals remdesivir and molnupiravir are broadly active also against all three hCoVs. Further, the in-cell ELISA provided evidence that nirmatrelvir, previously shown to broadly inhibit coronavirus proteases, also prevents replication of authentic hCoVs. Importantly, the protocols described here can be easily adapted to other coronavirus strains and species as well as viruses of other families within a short time.

Clinical factors and laboratory assays to streamline plasma donor selection, and the durability of nAb responses, are incompletely understood. METHODS Potential convalescent plasma donors with virologically-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for serum IgG to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain, nucleoprotein (NP), and for nAb. RESULTS Amongst 250 consecutive persons, including 27 (11%) requiring hospitalization, studied a median of 67 days since symptom onset, 97% were seropositive on one or more assays. Sixty percent of donors had nAb titers 1:80. Correlates of higher nAb titer included older age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.03/year of age, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), male sex (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.82), fever during acute illness (AOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.97), and disease severity represented by hospitalization (AOR 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-32.96). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of anti-S1 and anti-NP antibody results yielded cutoffs that corresponded well with nAb titers, with the anti-S1 assay being slightly more predictive. NAb titers declined in 37 of 41 paired specimens collected a median of 98 days (range, 77-120) apart (P<0.001). Seven individuals (2.8%) were persistently seronegative and lacked T cell responses. CONCLUSIONS Nab titers correlated with COVID-19 severity, age, and sex. Standard commercially available SARS-CoV-2 IgG results can serve as useful surrogates for nAb testing. Functional nAb levels were found to decline and a small proportion of persons recovered from COVID-19 lack adaptive immune responses.","output":"Clinical, laboratory, and temporal predictors of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among COVID-19 convalescent plasma donor candidates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social occupational therapy has been located throughout history as a subarea that is built in Brazil, mainly on the emergence of studying, researching, and questioning themes related to the social contradictions and injustices of capitalist society, proposing occupational therapys actions that seek to face them.

A 54-item, valid, and reliable questionnaire, including items on demographic characteristics and past medical history, stress levels, awareness about signs and symptoms of COVID-19, knowledge about at-risk groups and prevention methods, knowledge about transmission methods, trust in sources of information, and availability of facemasks and sanitizers, was deployed via social and mass media networks. A total of 3787 Iranians participated in the study where the majority of the participants were females (67.4%), employed (56.1%), from developed provinces (81.6%), without chronic diseases (66.6%), and with &#8805;13 years of formal education (87.9%). The mean age of study participants was 34.9 years (range = 12-73), and the average stress score was 3.33 (SD = 1.02). Stress score was significantly higher for females, those who were 30-39 years old, housewives, those with chronic diseases, individuals who were aware that there is no vaccine to prevent COVID-19, those who could not get facemasks or sanitizers, and individuals with higher knowledge about at-risk groups (p < 0.05). There was a significant correlation of stress scores with knowledge about prevention methods for COVID-19 (r = 0.21, p = 0.01) and trust in sources of information about COVID-19 (r = -0.18, p = 0.01). All of the predictors, except knowledge of two important at-risk groups and education, had a significant effect on stress scores based on a multivariate regression model. The COVID-19 outbreak could increase stress among all population groups, with certain groups at higher risk.

Such exogenous diseases later manifest multi-system presentation according to involvement of different 'Dosha' and derangement of 'Agni'. The pathology of COVID-19 is primarily that of Sannipata Jwara (fever) with involvement of respiratory system. Secondary manifestations include coagulopathies, cardiovascular, neural, and renal complications.

The aim of this study was to identify viruses in children hospitalized for ALRIs and to demonstrate epidemiologic and clinical characteristics in Japan. METHODS During a 2-year period from February 2013 to January 2015, we collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens from almost all hospitalized children with ALRIs in Nagasaki, a regional city of Japan, and its environs. Viruses were detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction from these samples. RESULTS We detected one or more viruses from 259 (69%) of 374 patients, 227 of whom were infected with a single virus, 30 with 2, and 2 with 3 viruses. Detected viruses in this study were rhinovirus (46.4%), respiratory syncytial virus (29.7%), human metapneumovirus (6.8%), parainfluenza virus (5.5%), enterovirus D68 (3.4%), influenza virus (2.7%), adenovirus (2.4%), bocavirus (2.0%) and Coxsackie virus (1.0%). We detected a seasonal shift in respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks from the 2013-2014 to the 2014-2015 seasons. There was no significant difference in clinical course and severity among those viruses. Patients with a history of asthma or underlying diseases were older and more frequently required oxygen therapy than previously healthy patients. CONCLUSIONS Viral etiology in hospitalized children with ALRIs in Nagasaki, Japan, was similar to that in many other countries. Enterovirus D68, which was recently recognized as a causative agent of severe ALRIs, was also identified in this study area. Severity of ALRIs may depend on underlying disease rather than type of etiological virus.","output":"Viral Etiology of Acute Lower Respiratory Tract Infections in Hospitalized Children in Nagasaki, a Regional City of Japan in 2013-2015."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND We proposed a new chest physiotherapy (CPT) secretion clearance method to treat respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in infants.

We used the Wang clinical severity scoring system (which assesses wheezing, respiratory rate, retractions, and general condition) and measured S(pO(2)) and heart rate before each CPT session (T0), immediately after the 30-min session (T30), and 120 min after the session (T150). RESULTS Within the groups: in the first group, Wang score was significantly lower at T150 than at T0: 4.6 vs 5.0 (P = .008). In the new-method-CPT group, Wang score was significantly lower at T30 (3.6 vs 4.3, P = .001) and at T150 (3.7 vs 4.3, P = .002). Wheezing score was significantly lower at T150 than at T0 (1.1 vs 1.2, P = .02) in the first group, and in the new-method-CPT group at T30 than at T0 (0.8 vs 1.3, P = .001) and at T150 than at T0 (0.9 vs 1.3, P = .001). Between the groups: at T30 the improvement was significantly better in the new-method-CPT group for overall Wang score (P = .02), retractions (P = .05), respiratory rate (P = .001), and heart rate (P < .001). At T150 the Wang score was not significantly different between the groups. At T30 (versus T0) the difference in percent gain between the groups was significant for Wang score (P = .004), wheezing (P = .001), and heart rate (P = .02). Over 5-hospital days, the daily baseline (T0) Wang score decreased significantly in the new-method-CPT group (P = .002), whereas it did not in the first group. There were no adverse events.

Economic epidemiological models often find that individual and group optimal strategies are very different.

For more limited regimes where disagreement does occur, the disagreement is (i) generally very extreme; (ii) highly sensitive to small changes in infection transmissibility and visitor costs/benefits; and (iii) can manifest either in a higher travel volume for individual optimal than group optimal strategies, or vice versa. The simulations show qualitative agreement with the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Beijing, China.

Many countries have postponed vaccination campaigns out of concern about infection risks to the staff delivering vaccination, the children being vaccinated, and their families. The World Health Organization recommends considering both the benefit of preventive campaigns and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission when making decisions about campaigns during COVID-19 outbreaks, but there has been little quantification of the risks. METHODS: We modelled excess SARS-CoV-2 infection risk to vaccinators, vaccinees, and their caregivers resulting from vaccination campaigns delivered during a COVID-19 epidemic. Our model used population age structure and contact patterns from three exemplar countries (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Brazil). It combined an existing compartmental transmission model of an underlying COVID-19 epidemic with a Reed-Frost model of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk to vaccinators and vaccinees. We explored how excess risk depends on key parameters governing SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, and aspects of campaign delivery such as campaign duration, number of vaccinations, and effectiveness of personal protective equipment (PPE) and symptomatic screening. RESULTS: Infection risks differ considerably depending on the circumstances in which vaccination campaigns are conducted. A campaign conducted at the peak of a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic with high prevalence and without special infection mitigation measures could increase absolute infection risk by 32 to 45% for vaccinators and 0.3 to 0.5% for vaccinees and caregivers. However, these risks could be reduced to 3.6 to 5.3% and 0.1 to 0.2% respectively by use of PPE that reduces transmission by 90% (as might be achieved with N95 respirators or high-quality surgical masks) and symptomatic screening. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection risks to vaccinators, vaccinees, and caregivers during vaccination campaigns can be greatly reduced by adequate PPE, symptomatic screening, and appropriate campaign timing. Our results support the use of adequate risk mitigation measures for vaccination campaigns held during SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, rather than cancelling them entirely.

In fact, many currently tested drugs show unknown efficacy and unpredictable drug interactions, such that interventions are needed to guarantee access to effective and safe medicines. Anti-inflammatory therapy has proven to be effective in preventing further injury in COVID-19 patients, but the benefit comes at a cost, as targeting inflammatory pathways can imply an increased risk of infection. Thus, optimization of the risk/benefit ratio is required in the anti-inflammatory strategy against COVID-19, which accounts for drug formulations and delivery towards regionalization and personalization of treatment approaches.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study including 13 young patients died of COVID\\\\19 and 40 matched survivors. Logistic regression was employed to characterize the risk factors of mortality in young obese COVID\\\\19 patients. RESULTS: Most of the young deceased COVID\\\\19 patients were mild cases at the time of admission, but the disease progressed rapidly featured by the higher severity of Patchy shadows (100.00% vs. 48.70%, P = 0.006), pleural thickening (61.50% vs. 12.80%, P = 0.012), mild pericardial effusion (76.90% vs. 0.00%, P < 0.001). Most importantly, the deceased patients manifested higher BMI (OR = 1.354, 95% CI = 1.075\\\\1.704, P = 0.010), inflammatory\\\\related index CRP (OR = 1.014, 95% CI = 1.003\\\\1.025, P = 0.014), cardiac injury biomarker hs\\\\cTnI (OR = 1.420, 95% CI = 1.112\\\\1.814, P = 0.005), and increased coagulation activity biomarker D\\\\Dimer (OR = 418.7, P = 0.047), as compared to that of survivors.

This can adversely affect nurses both psychologically and physically. Burnout is caused by prolonged stress during work. In the nursing profession, burnout is common, potentially affecting the well-being of nurses and their productivity. The identification of factors that may contribute to maintaining mental health and reducing burnout among frontline nurses during a pandemic is essential. PurposeThe purpose of this study was to explore how personal resilience, social support, and organizational support impact burnout among frontline staff nurses. MethodsThis study involved 129 registered nurses from a COVID-19 designated hospital using four standardized scales. ResultsThe mean age of the respondents was 29.46 years (standard deviation = 4.89). The mean number of years respondents worked in this organization was 5.60 years and the nursing profession was 4.16 years. Most of the respondents were female and held a bachelors degree in nursing. Multiple regression analysis was performed to predict burnout. Burnout was statistically significantly predicted by the multiple regression model (R2 = .420, F (3, 125) = 10.941, p < .0001; adjusted R2 = .406). Personal resilience, social support, and organizational support added statistically significantly to the prediction of burnout (p < .05). ConclusionFindings from multiple regression analysis showed that nurses with low resilience and those who perceived inadequate social and organizational support had a higher risk of reporting more burnout. As a result of a bivariate analysis, there was no significant correlation between nurse variables and burnout level, except for age, which was negatively correlated with burnout level. Accordingly, young nurses tend to experience burnout, and nurse directors and managers must address this problem.","output":"Personal Resilience, Social Support, and Organizational Support Impact Burnout among Nurses During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of new technologies, especially digital transformation, influences the entire society, including the medical aspects.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia is an important factor that can affect the health and work quality of nurses. However, there is a lack of big-sample studies exploring factors that affect the insomnia of nurses fighting against COVID-19. METHOD: This cross-sectional study using the Ascension Insomnia Scale, Fatigue Scale-14 and Perceived Stress Scale took place in March 2020. Participants were 1,794 front-line nurses from four tertiary-level general hospitals. RESULTS: The prevalence of insomnia among participants was 52.8%. Insomnia was predicted by gender, working experience, chronic diseases, midday nap duration, direct participation in the rescue of patients with COVID-19, frequency of night shifts, professional psychological assistance during the pandemic, negative experiences (such as family, friends or colleagues being seriously ill or dying due to COVID-19), the degree of fear of COVID-19, fatigue and perceived stress. CONCLUSION: The level of insomnia among participants was higher than the normal level. Interventions based on influencing factors should be implemented to ensure nurses' sleep quality.

This concept is a novel approach to chemicals management that determines whether using substances of concern, such as PFAS, is truly essential for a given functionality. To assess the essentiality of a particular use case, three considerations need to be addressed: (1) the function (chemical, end use and service) that the chemical provides in the use case, (2) whether the function is necessary for health and safety and critical for the functioning of society and (3) if the function is necessary, whether there are viable alternatives for the chemical for this particular use.

Whether current measures alone will lead to behavioral change such as social distancing, washing hands, and wearing a facemask is not well understood. The objective of this study is to better understand individual variation in behavioral responses to COVID-19 by exploring the influence of beliefs, motivations and policy measures on public health behaviors. We do so by comparing The Netherlands and Flanders, the Dutch speaking part of Belgium. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our final sample included 2,637 respondents from The Netherlands and 1,678 from Flanders. The data was nationally representative along three dimensions: age, gender, and household income in both countries. Our key outcome variables of interest were beliefs about policy effectiveness; stated reasons for complying with public rules; and changes in behavior. For control variables, we included a number of measures of how severe the respondent believed Covid-19 to be and a number of negative side effects that the person may have experienced: loneliness, boredom, anxiety, and conflicts with friends and neighbors. Finally, we controlled for socio-demographic factors: age, gender, income (categorical), education (categorical) and the presence of Covid-19 risk factors (diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, allergies). The dependent variable for each of the estimation models is dichotomous, so we used Probit models to predict the probability of engaging in a given behavior. We found that motivations, beliefs about the effectiveness of measures, and pre-pandemic behavior play an important role. The Dutch were more likely to wash their hands than the Flemish (15.4%, p<0.01), visit family (15.5%, p < .01), run errands (12.0%, p<0.05) or go to large closed spaces such as a shopping mall (21.2%, p<0.01). The Dutch were significantly less likely to wear a mask (87.6%, p<0.01). We also found that beliefs about the virus, psychological effects of the virus, as well as pre-pandemic behavior play a role in adherence to recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that policymakers should consider behavioral motivations specific to their country in their COVID-19 strategies. In addition, the belief that a policy is effective significantly increased the probability of the behavior, so policy measures should be accompanied by public health campaigns to increase adherence.","output":"Adherence to COVID-19 policy measures: Behavioral insights from The Netherlands and Belgium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, tolerable, and acceptable technique in adults.

Unfortunately, there are no concrete treatment options available which has severely hampered the pharmacotherapy of this devastating infection. This calls for an urgent need to consider alternative strategies which can be employed quickly, as discovering new drugs for SARS-CoV-2 infections is a time consuming and expensive proposition. In this regard, drug repurposing is an appealing approach which can provide rapid access to therapeutics with proven record of safety and efficacy. Accordingly, we investigated the drug repurposing potential of a library of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors which are currently marketed for type-2 diabetes, to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. Computational studies were conducted in the crystal structure of the substrate binding site of viral protease, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro dimer, which led to the identification of three marketed DPP4 inhibitors;gemigliptin, linagliptin and evogliptin exhibiting favorable binding, in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro dimer, viral protease. These studies support the repurposing of DPP4 class of inhibitors in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially in elderly patients with type-2 diabetes, who are at a greater risk of suffering from increased disease severity and mortality.","output":"Drug repurposing: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitors as potential agents to treat SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCov) infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: and study aims The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had considerable effects on health care services given the need for re-allocation of resources and interruption of medical care. COVID-19 poses a challenge to patients with liver disease who are at risk of infection and more severe disease course. The current study aimed to assess the incidence of COVID-19 in children with liver diseases and evaluate the extent to which health care delivery was affected during lockdown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional analytical study conducted at the Pediatric Hepatology Unit, Cairo University Childrens Hospital utilized a questionnaire to determine the incidence of COVID-19 in patients with liver diseases and the impact of COVID-19 on the patients liver condition and health care service delivery. A presumed score was implemented to identify patients with probable COVID-19. RESULTS: Data from 349 children with liver diseases were analyzed. The overall incidence of COVID-19 was 8%. Patients with documented and probable COVID-19 were compared to improbable COVID-19 cases. Notably, COVID-19 cases were younger and had higher incidence rates of cholestatic liver diseases. COVID-19 patients experienced significantly higher rates of hepatic complications (43%) and had significantly greater need for medical services during the lockdown. All COVID-19 patients recovered after a median (IQR) duration of 3 (4) days, except for one patient who succumbed to COVID-19 and hepatic complications. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 affected the younger hepatic patients with cholestatic disorders of infancy. Hepatic complications were more common among COVID-19 infected children.

In this paper, effectiveness of various cost functions, namely universal image quality index (UIQI), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), mean absolute error (MAE), relative squared error (RSE), relative absolute error (RAE), and root-mean-squared logarithmic error (RMSLE), has been critically analyzed and evaluated for ultralow-dose X-ray CT of patients with COVID-19. For sensitivity analysis of this ill-posed problem, the stochastically estimated images of lung phantom have been reconstructed.

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) associated with bacterial infection is a hallmark of sepsis. Sepsis in neonatal foals is a common sequela of failure of passive transfer and, in addition to development of SIRS, may be characterised by bacteraemia, pneumonia, enterocolitis, omphalophlebitis, meningoencephalitis or arthritis. Sepsis in mature horses is most commonly observed secondary to gastrointestinal lesions that result in disrupted mucosa and bacterial translocation into circulation (endotoxaemia). Pleuropneumonia and metritis may also cause sepsis in mature horses. Diagnosis of sepsis is based on SIRS criteria as well as suspected or confirmed infection. Due to the relatively low sensitivity of microbial culture and the subjectivity of sepsis scoring, many sepsis biomarkers are being studied for their usefulness in diagnosis and prognostication of sepsis in horses. Treatment of sepsis requires an intensive care approach that includes antimicrobial drug administration, fluid resuscitation and pressure support, and treatment for inflammation, endotoxaemia and coagulopathy. Early recognition of sepsis and prompt antimicrobial drug treatment are critical for a successful outcome. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome may occur in severe cases of sepsis, with common manifestations including laminitis and coagulopathies.

METHODS: Archived human sera (7461) collected between 2011 and 2016 from healthy adult blood donors from 50 different nationalities in the western part of Saudi Arabia were obtained for MERS-CoV seroprevalence investigation. Samples were tested for MERS-CoV S1-specific antibodies (Abs) by ELISA and confirmed by testing for neutralizing Abs (nAbs) using both pseudotyped and live virus neutralization assays. RESULTS: Out of 7461 samples, 174 sera from individuals with 18 different nationalities were ELISA positive (2.3%, 95% CI 2.0C2.7). Presence of nAbs was confirmed in 17 samples (0.23%, 95% CI 0.1C0.4) of which one sample exhibited positivity in both neutralization assays. Confirmed seropositivity was identified in young (15C44 years) men and women from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yemen, Pakistan, Palestine, Sudan, and India without significant preference. CONCLUSIONS: An increasing trend of MERS-CoV seroprevalence was observed in the general population in western Saudi Arabia, suggesting that asymptomatic or mild infections might exist and act as an unrecognized source of infection.

Several studies focusing on the patient's perspective have illustrated that telemedicine is comparable to traditional office visits in terms of cost, communication, and overall satisfaction. However, there is sparse data on the provider's experience. METHODS: With IRB approval, we assessed provider satisfaction with telemedicine at Urology programs in the U.S. through an electronic survey. The 25-question survey was based on the PACT which is a validated 33 question instrument that has been utilized to assess the quality of patient-provider communication in telemedicine. Experience with telemedicine was assessed in two categories: technical aspects and communication with patients. Variables were rated using a 5-point Likert Scale. RESULTS: There were 144 responses to the survey. 50% of providers reported not receiving any formal training in using telemedicine. This differed significantly by training level with 55% of attendings having had received training vs 20% of residents. Providers felt they would most benefit from training in billing (52%) rather than equipment use (33%) or communication (28%). 87% of providers felt comfortable discussing sensitive topics while only 55% felt comfortable using telehealth to schedule surgery (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Urology providers are generally satisfied with their experience communicating with patients via telemedicine and the majority would opt to continue utilizing telemedicine.

However, insufficient data exist on the wider context of infectious diseases in people with NCDs. We aimed to investigate the association between NCDs and the risk of death from any infection before the COVID-19 pandemic (up to Dec 31, 2019). METHODS: For this observational study, we used data from the UK Biobank observational cohort study to explore factors associated with infection death. We excluded participants if data were missing for comorbidities, body-mass index, smoking status, ethnicity, and socioeconomic deprivation, and if they were lost to follow-up or withdrew consent. Deaths were censored up to Dec 31, 2019. We used Poisson regression models including NCDs present at recruitment to the UK Biobank (obesity [defined by use of body-mass index] and self-reported hypertension, chronic heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack, other neurological disease, psychiatric disorder, and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatological disease), age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, and socioeconomic deprivation. Separate models were constructed with individual NCDs replaced by the total number of prevalent NCDs to define associations with multimorbidity. All analyses were repeated with non-infection-related death as an alternate outcome measure to establish differential associations of infection death and non-infection death. Associations are reported as incidence rate ratios (IRR) accompanied by 95% CIs. FINDINGS: After exclusion of 9210 (18%) of the 502a505 participants in the UK Biobank cohort, our study sample comprised 493a295 individuals. During 5a273a731 person-years of follow-up (median 109 years [IQR 101-116] per participant), 27a729 deaths occurred, of which 1385 (5%) were related to infection. Advancing age, male sex, smoking, socioeconomic deprivation, and all studied NCDs were independently associated with the rate of both infection death and non-infection death. Compared with White ethnicity, a pooled Black, Asian, and minority ethnicity group was associated with a reduced risk of infection death (IRR 064, 95% CI 046-087) and non-infection death (080, 075-086). Stronger associations with infection death than with non-infection death were observed for advancing age (age 65 years vs 45 years: 759, 95% CI 592-973, for infection death vs 521, 497-548, for non-infection death), current smoking (vs never smoking: 369, 319-426, vs 252, 244-261), socioeconomic deprivation (most vs least deprived quintile: 213, 178-256, vs 138, 133-143), class 3 obesity (vs non-obese: 221, 174-282, vs 155, 144-166), hypertension (136, 122-153, vs 115, 112-118), respiratory disease (221, 196-250, vs 128, 124-132), chronic kidney disease (504, 428-731, vs 250, 220-284), psychiatric disease (156, 130-186, vs 123, 118-129), and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatological disease (245, 199-302, vs 141, 132-151). Accrual of multimorbidity was also more strongly associated with risk of infection death (five or more comorbidities vs none: 953, 697-1303) than of non-infection death (526, 484-572). INTERPRETATION: Several NCDs are associated with an increased risk of infection death, suggesting that some of the reported associations with COVID-19 mortality might be non-specific. Only a subset of NCDs, together with the accrual of multimorbidity, advancing age, smoking, and socioeconomic deprivation, were associated with a greater IRR for infection death than for other causes of death. Further research is needed to define why these risk factors are more strongly associated with infection death, so that more effective preventive strategies can be targeted to high-risk groups.

It was initially detected in Wuhan, China and spread to other cities of China and all countries. It has caused many deaths and the number of infections became greater than 18 million as of 5 August 2020. This study aimed to analyze the situation of COVID-19 in Thailand and the challenging disease control by employing a dynamic model to determine prevention approaches. We employed a statistical technique to analyze the ambient temperature influencing the cases. We found that temperature was significantly associated with daily infected cases (p-value <0.01). The SEIR (Susceptible Exposed Infectious and Recovered) dynamic approach and moving average estimation were used to forecast the daily infected and cumulative cases until 16 June as a base run analysis using STELLA dynamic software and statistical techniques. The movement of people, both in relation to local (Thai people) and foreign travel (both Thai and tourists), played a significant role in the spread of COVID-19 in Thailand. Enforcing a state of emergency and regulating social distancing were the key factors in reducing the growth rate of the disease. The SEIR model reliably predicted the actual infected cases, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 12.8. In case of moving average approach, RMSE values were 0.21, 0.21, and 0.35 for two, three and five days, respectively. The previous records were used as input for prediction that caused lower values of RMSE. Two-days and three-days moving averages gave the better results than SEIR model. The SEIR model is suitable for longer period prediction, whereas the moving average approach is suitable for short term prediction.

With regards to immunotherapy, there is uncertainty about its effect in the context of COVID-19 in terms of probability and course of viral infection. Herein, we retrospectively report data of patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) treated with immunotherapy at five Italian referral cancer centers during the pandemic. cSCC is a disease poorly represented in the literature, typically affecting fragile, elderly patients, with multiple comorbidities and often immunosuppressed. Overall, 54 patients were identified, most of them coming from Lombardy and Piedmont, the two regions hit hardest by COVID in Italy. In most cases, our choice was to continue treatment, reserving temporary interruptions only to patients considered particularly at risk for age and comorbidity. A total of 9% of patients developed new-onset symptoms or had chest radiological assessment potentially related to COVID-19. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in all suspicious cases and two hospitalized patients were found to be positive. In conclusion, the outbreak of COVID-19 is a major worldwide health concern. Our data indicate that COVID-19 mortality in patients with cancer may be principally driven by advancing age, the presence of other comorbidities, and other cancer-related conditions (i.e. hospitalization). Our data further suggests the safety of continued use of PD-1 blockade during the COVID-19 pandemic (obviously implementing all the safety measures in the hospital environment) also considering the possible negative effects of a prolonged suspension on the course of the tumor evolution.

However, this parameter is difficult to estimate in the presence of silent transmission and/or significant temporal variation in case reporting. This variation can occur due to the lack of timely or appropriate testing, public health interventions and/or changes in human behavior during an epidemic. This is exactly the situation we are confronted with during this COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we propose to estimate Reff for the SARS-CoV-2 (the etiological agent of the COVID-19), based on a model of its propagation considering a time-varying transmission rate. This rate is modeled by a Brownian diffusion process embedded in a stochastic model. The model is then fitted with Bayesian inference (PMCMC) using multiple well-documented hospital datasets from several regions in France and in Ireland. This mechanistic modeling framework enables us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the transmission rate of the COVID-19 based only on the available data, without any specific hypothesis on its evolution. This approach allows us to follow both the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and the temporal evolution of its Reff(t).

However, while there is evidence documenting the growth in discrimination and xenophobia, little is known about how the COVID-19 outbreak is activating the expression of such negative attitudes. The goal of the current paper therefore was to investigate what aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to this rise in expressions of prejudice and xenophobia. More specifically, this study used an experimental design to assess the effects of using stigmatized language to describe the virus as well as the threat to physical health and economic wellbeing posed by the virus on COVID-19 prejudice. Data were collected from a national sample of 1451 adults residing within the United States. Results from 2  2 x 2 between-subjects analyses of covariance demonstrated that emphasizing the connection between China and COVID-19, rather than framing the virus neutrally, increased negative attitudes toward Asian Americans, beliefs that resources should be prioritized for Americans rather than immigrants, and general xenophobia. Emphasizing the severity of the economic impact of the virus also increased beliefs that Asian Americans are a threat to resources and general xenophobia. In contrast, messages which emphasized the serious health risks of COVID-19 did not increase bias toward Asian Americans or xenophobia. Our findings suggest that specific types of public health messaging related to infectious diseases, especially framing the virus in terms of its country of origin or its likely economic impact, may elicit prejudice and xenophobia. Public health campaigns that emphasize the severity of the virus, however, are not likely to trigger the same negative attitudes. Implications for public health responses to health crises are discussed.","output":"Why public health framing matters: An experimental study of the effects of COVID-19 framing on prejudice and xenophobia in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) is an unprecedented threat to human health and society across the globe. In this context, development of suitable interventions is the need of the hour. The viral spike protein (S Protein) and the cognate host cell receptor ACE2 can be considered as effective and appropriate targets for interventions. It is evident from the present computational study, that catechin and curcumin, not only exhibit strong binding affinity to viral S Protein and host receptor ACE2 but also to their complex (receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 and ACE2; RBD/ACE2-complex). The binding affinity values of catechin and curcumin for the S protein, ACE2 and RBD/ACE2-complex are - 10.5 and - 7.9 kcal/mol; - 8.9 and - 7.8 kcal/mol; and - 9.1 and - 7.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Curcumin directly binds to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of viral S Protein. Molecular simulation study over a period of 100 ns further substantiates that such interaction within RBD site of S Protein occurs during 40-100 ns out of 100 ns simulation trajectory. Contrary to this, catechin binds with amino acid residues present near the RBD site of S Protein and causes fluctuation in the amino acid residues of the RBD and its near proximity. Both catechin and curcumin bind the interface of 'RBD/ACE2-complex' and intervene in causing fluctuation of the alpha helices and beta-strands of the protein complex. Protein-protein interaction studies in presence of curcumin or catechin also corroborate the above findings suggesting the efficacy of these two polyphenols in hindering the formation of S Protein-ACE2 complex. In conclusion, this computational study for the first time predicts the possibility of above two polyphenols for therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV2.","output":"Catechin and curcumin interact with S protein of SARS-CoV2 and ACE2 of human cell membrane: insights from computational studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibiotic resistance continues to be a most serious threat to public health.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The research method included developing a research tool in the form of a survey questionnaire, validating the tool, conducting Phase I and II of the survey, and evaluating the performance of the outpatient specialty care subsystem. The analysis of the research results was directed at developing the assumptions of a model for restoring functionality and increasing resilience of the healthcare system. Findings: It was found that the level ofpatient satisfaction with the functioning of the health care system during a pandemic, both in the form of medical tele-consultation and in the form of direct contact with personnel in a health care facility, depends on the age and the level of education. There were no differences in terms of sex and place of residence (town, village). It was also found that the very limited availability of advanced diagnostic methods, showing an unfavorable trend in the period preceding the outbreak of the pandemic, deteriorated further and poses a critical threat to the functioning of the health care system for patients with chronic diseases (oncological, neurodegenerative etc.). Practical Implications: The results of the research will be used to construct a model for the reconstruction and revitalization of the health care system in the Lubelskie Voivodeship after the pandemic.

DESIGN: A retrospective observational study based on electronic health record data. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals 14 years old with a positive PCR or serology test, between 28 February and 31 May 2020, belonging to the Basque Country (Spain) public health system. Institutionalised and individuals admitted to a hospital at home unit were excluded from the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Three severity categories were established: primary care, hospital/intensive care unit admission and death. RESULTS: A total of n=14 197 cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most variables presented statistically significant associations with the outcome (p<0.0001). The Classification and Regression Trees recursive partitioning methodology (based on n=13 792) suggested that among all associations, those with, age, sex, stratification of patient healthcare complexity, chronic consumption of blood and blood-forming organ, and nervous system drugs, as well as the total number of chronic Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical types were the most relevant. Psychosis also emerged as a potential factor. CONCLUSIONS: Older cases are more likely to experience more severe outcomes.

The continuous rapid evolution of these subtypes and the emergence of new variants influence the ability to undertake effective surveillance. Retroviral pseudotypes bearing influenza haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) envelope glycoproteins represent a flexible platform for sensitive, readily standardized influenza serological assays. We describe a multiplex assay for the study of neutralizing antibodies that are directed against both influenza H5 and H7 HA. This assay permits the measurement of neutralizing antibody responses against two antigenically distinct HAs in the same serum/plasma sample thus increasing the amount and quality of serological data that can be acquired from valuable sera. Sera obtained from chickens vaccinated with a monovalent H5N2 vaccine, chickens vaccinated with a bivalent H7N1/H5N9 vaccine, or turkeys naturally infected with an H7N3 virus were evaluated in this assay and the results correlated strongly with data obtained by HI assay. We show that pseudotypes are highly stable under basic cold-chain storage conditions and following multiple rounds of freeze-thaw.

The empirical inputs from lawyers and judges, and the experiences of litigants on moving courts for justice in matters of health care, provide the key insights of this chapter. It will briefly delve into the challenges of the processes involved in achieving the right to health care jurisprudence on the one hand, and, will critically analyse the contemporary juridico-legal mechanisms through which such jurisprudence is transformed into health justice for the marginalisedcitizens. Literature points to two key factors that stand out in understanding the processes of health care litigations. One, understanding the phenomena of health care litigations constitutive of its drivers, outcomes, and impact on health policy and programming in a given country. Two, a less explored dimension of processing health care litigations in (Indian) courts (as institutions) and the interface of judicial-administrative and socio-political processes in legalising entitlements.

This case series highlights the need for awareness of fogging and improper face mask fit as causes of standard automated perimetry artifacts in patients with ocular hypertension and glaucoma. CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS Six patients with the diagnosis of ocular hypertension, glaucoma suspect, or glaucoma underwent standard automated perimetry (24-2 or 10-2 SITA, Humphrey Field Analyzer) while wearing ear-loop surgical face masks. Due to patient complaints of fogging during the testing, low test reliability, and unexpected results, the tests were repeated after taping securely the mask to the bridge of the nose. CLINICAL FINDINGS Fogging may reduce visual field (VF) test reliability and induce artifacts that mimic glaucomatous defects. VF test reliability can be improved and artifacts minimized following mask taping. In 1 case there was worsening of VF defects after mask taping. This suggests that fogging may also disguise true VF defects. CONCLUSIONS Fogging can result in unreliable VF testing with glaucoma-like artifacts. Secure taping of the face mask to the nose bridge may minimize this problem and reduce unnecessary additional testing and follow-up visits.","output":"Visual Field Artifacts in Glaucoma With Face Mask Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (PIMS-TS) is a novel condition with persistent fever, inflammation, and single or multiorgan dysfunction.

Court diversion interventions aim to reduce the negative consequences of formal criminal justice sanctions and focus resources on addressing the root causes of offending. Although diversions are widely used, evidence of their effectiveness has not yet been established. Hampshire Constabulary, working together with local charities, have developed the Gateway programme, an out-of-court intervention aimed at improving the life chances of young adults. Issued as a conditional caution, participants undertake a health and social care needs assessment, attend workshops encouraging analysis of own behaviour and its consequences and agree not to re-offend during the 16-week caution. METHODS: This is a pragmatic, multi-site, parallel-group, superiority randomised controlled trial with a target sample size of 334. Participants are aged 18C24, reside in Hampshire and Isle of Wight and are being questioned for an eligible low-level offence. Police investigators offer potential participants a chance to receive the Gateway caution, and those interested are also invited to take part in the study. Police officers obtain Stage 1 consent and carry out an eligibility check, after which participants are randomised on a 1:1 basis either to receive Gateway or follow the usual process, such as court appearance or a different conditional caution. Researchers subsequently obtain Stage 2 consent and collect data at weeks 4 and 16, and 1 year post-randomisation. The primary outcome is the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS). Secondary outcomes include health status, alcohol and drug use, recidivism and resource use. The primary analysis will compare the WEMWBS score between the two groups at 12 months. DISCUSSION: This pioneering trial aims to address the evidence gap surrounding diversion in 18C24-year-olds. The findings will inform law enforcement agencies, third sector organisations, policymakers and commissioners, as well as researchers working in related fields and with vulnerable target populations.

We sought to perform a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules present after vitamin D supplementation (when plasma vitamin D level was sufficient) which were absent before supplementation, and then to identify influential genes in those modules. The transcriptome from normal rectal mucosa biopsies of 49 individuals free from CRC were assessed before and after 12 weeks of 3200IU/day vitamin D (Fultium-D3) supplementation using paired-end total RNAseq. While the effects on expression patterns following vitamin D supplementation were subtle, WGCNA identified highly correlated genes forming gene modules. Four of the 17 modules identified in the post-vitamin D network were not preserved in the pre-vitamin D network, shedding new light on the biochemical impact of supplementation. These modules were enriched for GO terms related to the immune system, hormone metabolism, cell growth and RNA metabolism. Across the four treatment-associated modules, 51 hub genes were identified, with enrichment of 40 different transcription factor motifs in promoter regions of those genes, including VDR:RXR. Six of the hub genes were nominally differentially expressed in studies of vitamin D effects on adult normal mucosa organoids: LCN2, HLA-C, AIF1L, PTPRU, PDE4B and IFI6.

In December 2019, we conducted an assessment of Missed Opportunities for Vaccination (MOV) in Ondo State, in Southwest Nigeria. The objectives were to determine the magnitude of, explore the reasons for, as well as possible solutions for reducing MOV in the State. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using a mixed-methods approach. We purposively selected 66 health facilities in three local government authorities, with a non-probabilistic sampling of caregivers of children 0C23 months for exit interviews, and health workers for knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) surveys. Data collection was complemented with focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with caregivers and health workers. The proportion of MOV among children with documented vaccination histories were determined and thematic analysis of the qualitative data was carried out. RESULTS: 984 caregivers with children aged 0C23 months were interviewed, of which 869 were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. The prevalence of MOV was 32.8%. MOV occurred among 90.8% of children during non-vaccination visits, and 7.3% during vaccination visits. Vaccine doses recommended later in the immunization series were given in a less timely manner. Among 41.0% of health workers, they reported their vaccination knowledge was insufficient. Additionally, 57.5% were concerned about and feared adverse events following immunization. Caregivers were found to have a low awareness about vaccination, and issues related to the organization of the health system were found to contribute towards MOV.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in: 4/24(16.7%) patient samples, 5/60(8.3%) floor, 1/54(1.9%) air, 10/23(43.5%) surgical instruments/equipment, 0/24 cautery filters and 0/143 inner surface of mask samples. Conclusions While there is evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the surgical and obstetrical operative environment (6% of samples taken), the finding of no detectable virus inside the masks worn by the medical teams would suggest a low risk of infection for our health care workers using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).","output":"Detection of SARS CoV-2 contamination in the Operating Room and Birthing Room Setting: Risks to attending health care workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fog of war is a major obstacle for a fighting force trying to accomplish a goal, and it has been a significant barrier in the fight against COVID-19.

With exposure to toxic levels of ammonium, the shoot GLN2 reaction produced an abundance of protons within cells, thereby elevating shoot acidity and stimulating expression of acidic stress-responsive genes. Application of an alkaline ammonia solution to the ammonium medium efficiently alleviated the ammonium toxicity with a concomitant reduction in shoot acidity.

We hypothesized that enabling these interactions through viral ligands enhances intercellular proteopathic seed transmission.

METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 3325 patients with lower respiratory infection (LRI) [bronchiolitis (42%), pneumonia (38%) and croup (12%)] were identified. It is estimated that 545,000 LRI hospitalizations occur each year in the United States in children younger than 18 years old (viral, 428,000; pneumonia, 221,000; bronchiolitis, 222,000; croup, 65,000), including a continued increase in bronchiolitis hospitalizations (47.8/1000; <1 year). The most common viruses detected each year in hospitalized children included respiratory syncytial virus (A and B; 117,000), parainfluenza virus (PIV-1 and -2, 48 000; PIV-3, 18,000) and influenza (A and B, 39,000). With multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (MPCR), different patient populations demonstrated different LRI epidemiology in relation to specific syndromes and viral causes. At least 21% of LRI hospitalizations were in children with significant medical problems.PIVs were detected much more frequently in immunocompromised children than in previously healthy children (33% vs. 16%). Similarly 15% of respiratory syncytial virus was detected between May and October, mostly in immunocompromised children. Influenza caused 19% of bronchiolitis in previously healthy children, and no virus could be reliably predicted based on clinical presentation, including wheezing. Of children hospitalized for LRI, 40% tested positive for the seven most common respiratory viruses by MPCR.

Hemato-oncological patients are particularly vulnerable to infection, requiring decisive recommendations on treatment and triage. The aim of this survey amongst experts on radiation therapy (RT) for lymphoma and leukemia is to delineate typical clinical scenarios and to provide counsel for high-quality care. METHODS: A multi-item questionnaire containing multiple-choice and free-text questions was developed in a peer-reviewed process and sent to members of the radiation oncology panels of the German Hodgkin Study Group and the German Lymphoma Alliance. Answers were assessed online and analyzed centrally. RESULTS: Omission of RT was only considered in a minority of cases if alternative treatment options were available. Hypofractionated regimens and reduced dosages may be used for indolent lymphoma and fractures due to multiple myeloma. Overall, there was a tendency to shorten RT rather than to postpone or omit it. Even in case of critical resource shortage, panelists agreed to start emergency RT for typical indications (intracranial pressure, spinal compression, superior vena cava syndrome) within 24a?h. Possible criteria to consider for patient triage are the availability of (systemic) options, the underlying disease dynamic, and the treatment rationale (curative/palliative). CONCLUSION: RT for hemato-oncological patients receives high-priority and should be maintained even in later stages of the pandemic. Hypofractionation and shortened treatment schedules are feasible options for well-defined constellations, but have to be discussed in the clinical context.","output":"Radiation treatment of hemato-oncological patients in times of the COVID-19 pandemic : Expert recommendations from the radiation oncology panels of the German Hodgkin Study Group and the German Lymphoma Alliance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Marine pollution impacts coastal nations around the world, and more so: (a) in confined maritime areas with significant marine traffic, (b) where exploitation of natural and mineral resources is taking place, or (c) in regions witnessing pressure from tourism, local population growth, and industry.

Sensitive measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies would provide new insight into pre-existing immunity, virus transmission dynamics, and the nuances of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. To date, existing SARS-CoV-2 serology tests have limited utility due to insufficient reliable detection of antibody levels lower than what is typically present after several days of symptoms. To measure lower quantities of SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA with higher resolution than existing assays, we developed a new ELISA protocol with a distinct plate washing procedure and timed plate development via use of a standard curve. Very low optical densities from samples added to buffer coated wells at as low as a 1:5 dilution are reported using this 'BU ELISA' method. Use of this method revealed circulating SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N) reactive antibodies (IgG, IgM, and/or IgA) in 44 and 100 percent of pre-pandemic subjects, respectively, and the magnitude of these antibodies tracked with antibody levels of analogous viral proteins from endemic coronavirus (eCoV) strains. The disease status (HIV, SLE) of unexposed subjects was not linked with SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibody levels; however, quantities were significantly lower in subjects over 70 years of age compared with younger counterparts. Also, we measured SARS-CoV-2 RBD- and N- specific IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies from 29 SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at varying disease states, including 10 acute COVID-19 hospitalized subjects with negative serology results by the EUA approved Abbott IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RBD- and N- specific IgM, IgG, IgA levels measured by the BU ELISA revealed higher signal from 9 of the 10 Abbott test negative COVID-19 subjects than all pre-pandemic samples for at least one antibody specificity/isotype, implicating improved serologic identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection via multi-parameter, high sensitive antibody detection.

We assessed Crs, degree of hypoxemia, and associated Crs-based phenotypic patterns with their characteristics and outcomes.Measurements and Main Results: Among 1,117 patients with ARDS who met inclusion criteria, the median Crs was 30 (interquartile range, 23-40) ml/cm H2O. One hundred thirty-six (12%) patients had preserved Crs (&#8805;50 ml/cm H2O; phenotype with low elastance [\\"phenotype L\\"]), and 827 (74%) patients had poor Crs (<40 ml/cm H2O; phenotype with high elastance [\\"phenotype H\\"]). Compared with those with phenotype L, patients with phenotype H were sicker and had more comorbidities and higher hospital mortality (32% vs. 45%; P < 0.05). A near complete dissociation between PaO2/FiO2 and Crs was observed. Of 136 patients with phenotype L, 58 (43%) had a PaO2/FiO2 < 150.

However, the elicitation of b12 or b12-like antibodies in vivo by vaccine immunogens based on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) has not been successful. B12 is highly divergent from the closest corresponding germline antibody while X5 is less divergent. We have hypothesized that the relatively high degree of specific somatic hypermutations may preclude binding of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) to closest germline antibodies, and that identifying antibodies that are intermediates in the pathways to maturation could help design novel vaccine immunogens to guide the immune system for their enhanced elicitation. In support of this hypothesis we have previously found that a germline-like b12 (monovalent and bivalent scFv as an Fc fusion protein or IgG) lacks measurable binding to an Env as measured by ELISA with a sensitivity in the M range [1]; here we present evidence confirming and expanding these findings for a panel of Envs. In contrast, a germline-like scFv X5 bound Env with high (nM) affinity. To begin to explore the maturation pathways of these antibodies we identified several possible b12 intermediate antibodies and tested their neutralizing activity. These intermediate antibodies neutralized only some HIV-1 isolates and with relatively weak potency. In contrast, germline-like scFv X5 neutralized a subset of the tested HIV-1 isolates with comparable efficiencies to that of the mature X5. These results could help explain the relatively high immunogenicity of the coreceptor binding site on gp120 and the abundance of CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies in HIV-1-infected patients (X5 is a CD4i antibody) as well as the maturation pathway of X5.

While the focus is currently on recovery from the pandemic, the disease has significantly changed the way we practice medicine and neurosurgery in New York City and the United States. Apart from the emergency cases, several health systems across the country have similarly started to perform elective surgeries. Although COVID-19 screening and testing guidelines have been proposed and adopted by many hospitals, these may not adequately protect the operating room personnel who are in proximity to the patient for prolonged periods. There are concerning reports of especially high transmission rates of COVID-19 in transmucosal head and neck procedures conducted by otolaryngologists and neurosurgeons, despite attempts at wearing what constitutes appropriate personal protective equipment. METHODS: Here, we describe a simple technique of additional draping that can be used for all cranial, endonasal, spinal, and neurointerventional cases to limit the transmission of coronavirus. RESULTS: The proposed technique offers a simple, commonly available, cost-effective alternative that avoids the use of additional retractor systems. Moreover, this technique can be used in all neurosurgical procedures. CONCLUSIONS: With the rising concerns regarding airborne spread of the virus, we expect that these precautions will prove highly useful as we enter the recovery phase of this pandemic and hospitals attempt to prevent a return to widespread infection. In addition, its availability and cost effectiveness make this technique especially attractive to practical use in centers with limited resources.","output":"Coronavirus Neurosurgical/Head and Neck Drape to Prevent Aerosolization of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): The Lenox Hill Hospital/Northwell Health Solution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is having an unprecedented and unpredictable impact on the world's economy.

Raw time series data is not enough in some cases to understand the type of fault or how it is progressing. The conversion of data from the time domain to the frequency domain assists researchers in making a more discernible difference for detecting failures, but depending on the manufacturing equipment type and complexity, there is still a possibility for inaccurate results. This research explores a method of classifying rolling bearing faults utilizing the total energy gathered from the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Using a spectrogram over an entire process cycle, the PSD is swept through time and the total energy is computed and plotted over the periodic machine cycle. Comparing with a baseline set of data, classification patterns emerge, giving an indication of the type of fault, when a fault begins and how the fault progresses. There is a separable difference in each type of fault and a measurable change in the distribution of accumulated damage over time. A roller bearing is used as a validating component, due to the known types of faults and their classifications. Traditional methods are used for comparison and the method verified using experimental and industrial applications.

Further, the impact on older children and during the perinatal time is becoming better studied. As community spread increases, it is important to recognize that neonates are vulnerable to community spread as well. The impact that community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 has in the neonatal time period is unclear, as this population has unique immunity considerations. OBJECTIVE: To report on a case series of SARS-CoV-2 in neonates through community acquisition in the USA. DESIGN: This is an early retrospective study of patients admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) identified as having SAR-CoV-2 through positive real-time polymerase chain reaction assay of nasopharyngeal swabs. FINDINGS: Three patients who required admission to the NICU between the ages of 17 and 33 days old were identified. All 3 had ill contacts in the home or had been to the pediatrician and presented with mild to moderate symptoms including fever, rhinorrhea, and hypoxia, requiring supplemental oxygen during their hospital stay. One patient was admitted with neutropenia, and the other 2 patients became neutropenic during hospitalization. None of the patients had meningitis or multiorgan failure. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Infants with community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 may require hospitalization due to rule-out sepsis guidelines if found to have fever and/or hypoxia. Caregivers of neonates should exercise recommended guidelines before contact with neonates to limit community spread of SARS-CoV-2 to this potentially vulnerable population, including isolation, particularly as asymptomatic cases become prevalent.","output":"Neonates Hospitalized with Community-Acquired SARS-CoV-2 in a Colorado Neonatal Intensive Care Unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study was performed to compare the viral load and kinetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in saliva with those in standard nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs. METHODS: Fifteen patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from four hospitals were prospectively enrolled and matched samples of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs and saliva were collected at Day 1 of admission and every other day till consequently negative for two times. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was performed to detect the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) genes. RESULTS: The cycle threshold values of saliva were comparable to those of NP/OP swabs overall (P = 0.720, MannCWhitney U test). However, the overall sensitivity of rRT-PCR using saliva was 64% (34/53), which is lower than the 77% (41/53) using NP/OP swabs. The sensitivity of rRT-PCR using saliva was especially lower in early stage of symptom onset (1C5 days; 8/15; 53%) and in patients who did not have sputum (12/22; 55%). CONCLUSION: Saliva sample itself is not appropriate for initial diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to replace NP/OP swabs, especially for the person who does not produce sputum.

Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) protocols are widely used in adult emergency situations to diagnose and guide treatment, but none has been specifically developed for the neonate. We propose a targeted diagnostic ultrasound protocol for the suddenly decompensating infant in the NICU for rapid screening for the most common life-threatening complications needing immediate attention. We integrated current knowledge on the use of POCUS for diagnosis of the most critical neonatal complications into the SAFE-R protocol (Sonographic Assessment of liFe-threatening Emergencies  Revised). The ultrasound algorithm was evaluated at the bedside for suitability and ease of use. Main features of SAFE-R are the use of standardized ultrasound points and a simple one-probe rule-in/rule-out approach. The flowchart is designed by order of urgency and priority is given to treatable causes. Hence, ruling out cardiac tamponade is the first step in the decision tree, followed by pneumothorax, pleural effusion, then acute critical aortic occlusion, acute abdominal complications, and severe intraventricular hemorrhage. Conclusion: SAFE-R is the first ultrasound algorithm specifically conceived for use in the NICU to screen for the most common urgent neonatal complications leading to sudden deterioration, thereby providing critical information within minutes.

Methods The study was conducted at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA) from 9/15/20-1/26/21. Sampling of 20cm2 surfaces in staff common areas (breakroom high-touch surfaces comprising tables and microwave/refrigerator handles;bathroom surfaces comprising toilet, sink, and doorknob;and floors), nurse workstations (computer mice and floors), and COVID-19 patient rooms (high-touch surfaces comprising bedrail, computer mice/keyboards, and doorknobs;bathroom surfaces;and floors) was performed using flocked swabs one or more times per week. Specimens underwent RNA extraction and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect the SC2 N1 region. Median comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Trends in odds were evaluated using Score test. Results Proportions of surface specimens with detectable SC2 RNA are summarized in Table 1. Median copy numbers were lower among staff toilets compared to COVID-19 patient toilets (135.6 vs. 503.8 copies/specimen, p=0.02), lower among staff breakroom compared to patient room high-touch surfaces (104.3 vs. 220.3 copies/specimen, p=0.007), and similar between staff and patient room samples from sinks and floors. At nurse workstations, SC2 RNA was detected among 22/177 (12.4%) computer mouse and 147/178 (82.6%) floor samples. Odds of SC2 detection increased by study week among common area (p< 0.001) and nurse workstation samples (p< 0.001) (Figures 1 and 2). Table 1.

Initial work showed that the capacity (MRI machines and staff) actually outstripped demand, which challenged pre-existing assumptions. This became the basis for interventions to improve efficiency in the department. Interventions undertaken can be split into three distinct categories: (1) matching capacity to demand, (2) waiting list segmentation and (3) redesigning operational systems. METHODS A capacity and demand time series during 2019 and 2020 was used as the basis for improving waiting list and operational systems. A combination of the Model for Improvement and Lean principles were used to embed operational improvements. Multiple small tests of change were implemented to various aspects of the MRI waiting list process. Staff engagement was central to the success of the quality improvement (QI) initiatives. The radiological information system (RIS) provided the bulk of the data, and this was supplemented with manual data collection. RESULTS The number of people waiting for an MRI scan decreased from 1,954 at the start of the project to 413 at its conclusion-an overall reduction of 75%. Moreover, the average waiting time reduced from 96.4 days to 23.1. Achieving the Ministry of Health's (MoH) Priority 2 (P2) target increased from 23% to 87.5%.

We compared the preinvasive lesion rates and the invasive cervical cancer rates of women with HPV 16/18 between the negative and the abnormal cytology group. RESULTS: Of the 1647 women, 1105 (67.1%) had negative cytology and 542 (32.9%) had abnormal cytology. Among women with initial negative cytology, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2+ lesion was detected in 205 (18.6%) women. The rate of CIN 2+ lesion in women with abnormal cytology was 28%. There was a significant difference between negative and abnormal cytology group in terms of CIN 2+ lesion rates (P < .001).

Our lab has recently linked the chronic inflammation in diabetes to poor functional outcomes and exacerbated cognitive impairment, also known as post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). Although we have shown that the development of PSCI in diabetes is associated with the upregulation and the activation of pro-inflammatory microglia, we have not established direct causation between the two. To this end, we evaluated the role of microglia in the development of PSCI. METHODS At 13 weeks of age, diabetic animals received bilateral intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral particles targeting the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). After 14 days, animals were subjected to 60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham surgery. Adhesive removal task (ART), novel object recognition (NOR), and 2-trial Y-maze were utilized to evaluate sensorimotor and cognitive function. Tissue from freshly harvested brains was analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS CSF1R silencing resulted in a 94% knockdown of residential microglia to relieve inflammation and improve myelination of white matter in the brain. This prevented cognitive decline in diabetic animals. CONCLUSION Microglial activation after stroke in diabetes may be causally related to the development of delayed neurodegeneration and PSCI.","output":"Microglia knockdown reduces inflammation and preserves cognition in diabetic animals after experimental stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human parechovirus (PeV-A), one of the species within the Picornaviridae family, is known to cause disease in humans. The most commonly detected genotypes are PeV-A1, associated with mild gastrointestinal disease in young children, and PeV-A3, linked to severe disease with neurological symptoms in neonates. As PeV-A are detectable in stool and nasopharyngeal samples, entry is speculated to occur via the respiratory and gastro-intestinal routes. In this study, we characterized PeV-A1 and PeV-A3 replication and tropism in the intestinal epithelium using a primary 2D model based on human fetal enteroids. This model was permissive to infection with lab-adapted strains and clinical isolates of PeV-A1, but for PeV-A3, infection could only be established with clinical isolates. Replication was highest with infection established from the basolateral side with apical shedding for both genotypes. Compared to PeV-A1, replication kinetics of PeV-A3 were slower. Interestingly, there was a difference in cell tropism with PeV-A1 infecting both Paneth cells and enterocytes, while PeV-A3 infected mainly goblet cells. This difference in cell tropism may explain the difference in replication kinetics and associated disease in humans.","output":"Parechovirus A Infection of the Intestinal Epithelium: Differences Between Genotypes A1 and A3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in pets has been widely documented during the last year.

Subjects were placed into two groups based on age - those 60 and above and those less than 60. Patients were questioned regarding their demographics, behavioral practices, and their primary news source related to the pandemic. Traditional news sources were defined as TV, radio, or newspaper. Modern news sources included any form of social media. Results: Of the 115 subjects eligible for this study, 49 agreed to participate (42.6%). Of these, 27 (55%) were age 60 and above and 22 were under the age of 60 (45%). In the older group, all subjects reported using traditional media while only eight subjects (30%) also reported obtaining healthcare information from modern news sources. In the younger group, 16 subjects (73%) reported using traditional media while 14 (63%) simultaneously reported using modern media. When comparing the groups, there was no statistically significant difference in utilization of traditional news sources by age, however, the older group was much less likely to receive their information from modern media (P &lt; 0.001).

Surgical specialties have seen severe alterations or reductions to practice, neurosurgery being one example where staff and resource reallocation has occurred to meet wider public health needs. This review summaries the published evidence detailing early experiences and changes to neurosurgical practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods A systematic review was conducted up until 21st April in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, searching Medline, EMBASE, Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane Central and Web of Science Core Collection databases. Individual studies were qualitatively assessed to outline core themes detailing changes to practice. Iterative analysis allowed themes to be developed and applied to all studies included in the review. Results 13 themes from 18 studies were identified, grouped into three overriding themes: logistics, human resources and clinical delivery. Studies originated from three of the most affected countries (USA, China and Italy), comprising of expert opinions, letters to the editor, editorials, case reports or perspective pieces. The commonest themes discussed include cancellation of elective operations, reduction in outpatient services and pandemic rotas. Discussion This review summaries the early responses of the neurosurgical community to the COVID-19 pandemic and presents a menu of interventions to be considered in future pandemic response, or in recurrent outbreaks of COVID-19. Whilst our review is limited by the low quality of evidence and rapid rate of change in our understanding of COVID-19, it provides a valuable summary of initial responses by the neurosurgical community to a global pandemic.","output":"Early responses of neurosurgical practice to the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To describe the technique of percutaneous stereotactic radiofrequency ablation (SRFA) and its application in a patient with an unresectable multifocal intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).

To produce overlapping ablation areas and cover the entire tumor volume, 18 paths for the placement of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) probes at multiple locations were planned on 2D and 3D reconstructions of the computed tomographic (CT) data. The 15-gauge coaxial needles were advanced through the aiming device to the preplanned depth. A control CT fused to the planning CT data confirmed correct needle placements. RFA was performed with an impedance-based multiple-electrode RFA system. Fusion of the contrast-enhanced control CT with the planning CT showed an appropriate zone of ablation. RESULTS Besides a mild asymptomatic pleural effusion, no complications occurred. Twenty-seven months after the first RFA, two new small distant liver metastases were successfully treated by SRFA. Currently, 38 months after diagnosis and 36 months after the first SRFA, the patient is free of detectable disease.

METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study concerning women who delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic first lockdown period in Israel. Postpartum women were approached and asked to complete a comprehensive online questionnaire. Impact of PPE was graded on a scale of 1C5, and Impact of PPE 4 was considered high. PPD and PTSS were assessed using the EPDS and City BiTS questionnaires. RESULTS: Of 421 parturients, 36 (9%) reported high Impact of PPE. Parturients with high Impact of PPE had significantly higher PPD and PTSS scores)EPDS 8.4  5.8 vs. 5.7  5.3; City BiTS 9.2  10.3 vs. 5.8  7.8, p < 0.05 for both).

OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to determine the effect of adjunctive ergocalciferol on residual -cell function (RBCF) and PR in youth with newly diagnosed T1D who were maintained on a standardized insulin treatment protocol. The hypothesis was that ergocalciferol supplementation increases RBCF and prolongs PR. METHODS: A 12-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted of 50 000 IU of ergocalciferol per week for 2 months, and then once every 2 weeks for 10 months, vs placebo in 36 individuals aged 10 to 21 years, with T1D of less than 3 months and a stimulated C-peptide (SCP) level greater than or equal to 0.2 nmol/L ( 0.6 ng/mL).

The underlying COVID-19 mechanisms engaged by these extra-pulmonary organ systems are largely unknown. We approached this knowledge gap by recognizing that neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 (alternately called NBB, B, B0 in the literature) is a common denominator expressed nearly exclusively by three particular cell types: intestinal epithelia, renal proximal tubule epithelium, and cardiomyocytes. B0AT1 provides uptake of glutamine and tryptophan. The gut is the main depot expressing over 90% of the bodys entire pool of SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and B0AT1. Recent cryo-EM studies established that ACE2 forms a thermodynamically favored dimer-of-heterodimers complex with B0AT1 assembled in the form of a dimer of two ACE2:B0AT1 heterodimers anchored in plasma membranes. Prior epithelial cell studies demonstrated ACE2 chaperone trafficking of B0AT1. This contrasts with monomeric expression of ACE2 in lung pneumocytes, in which B0AT1 is undetectable. The cell types in question also express a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17) known to cleave and shed the ectodomain of monomeric ACE2 from the cell surface, thereby relinquishing protection against unchecked renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) events of COVID-19. The present study employed molecular docking modeling to examine the interplaying assemblage of ACE2, ADAM17 and B0AT1. We report that in the monomer form of ACE2, neck region residues R652-N718 provide unimpeded access to ADAM17 active site pocket, but notably R708 and S709 remained >10-15 ? distant. In contrast, interference of ADAM17 docking to ACE2 in a dimer-of-heterodimers arrangement was directly correlated with the presence of a neighboring B0AT1 subunit complexed to the partnering ACE2 subunit of the 2ACE2:2B0AT1] dimer of heterodimers, representing the expression pattern putatively exclusive to intestinal, renal and cardiomyocyte cell types. The monomer and dimer-of-heterodimers docking models were not influenced by the presence of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) complexed to ACE2. The results collectively provide the underpinnings for understanding the role of B0AT1 involvement in COVID-19 and the role of ADAM17 steering ACE2 events in intestinal and renal epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, with implications useful for consideration in pandemic public hygiene policy and drug development.","output":"Amino acid transporter B0AT1 influence on ADAM17 interactions with SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 putatively expressed in intestine, kidney, and cardiomyocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Rapidly evolving genomics technologies, in particular comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS), have led to exponential growth in the understanding of cancer biology, shifting oncology toward personalized treatment strategies. However, comprehensive NGS approaches, such as whole-exome sequencing, have limitations that are related to the technology itself as well as to the input source. Hence, clinical implementation of comprehensive NGS in a quality-controlled diagnostic workflow requires both the standardization of sequencing procedures and continuous validation of sequencing results by orthogonal methods in an ongoing program to enable the determination of key test parameters and continuous improvement of NGS and bioinformatics pipelines. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present validation data on 220 patients who were enrolled between 2013 and 2016 in a multi-institutional, genomics-guided precision oncology program (Molecularly Aided Stratification for Tumor Eradication Research) of the National Center for Tumor Diseases Heidelberg and the German Cancer Consortium. RESULTS: More than 90% of clinically actionable genomic alterations identified by combined whole-exome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing were successfully validated, with varying frequencies of discordant results across different types of alterations (fusions, 3.7%; single-nucleotide variants, 2.6%; amplifications, 1.1%; overexpression, 0.9%; deletions, 0.6%).

Evidence comparing clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19 receiving therapeutic compared to prophylactic dose anticoagulation is limited. We evaluated whether therapeutic anticoagulation (tAC) is associated with improved survival compared to prophylactic (pAC) and no anticoagulation (AC) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: This was a retrospective, multi-center cohort study of consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted between March 13th, 2020 and May 5th, 2020 to eight hospitals within a large academic system in Southeast Michigan, USA. Participants were assigned to three groups based on whether they received no AC, pAC throughout most of their hospitalization, or at least 3 days of tAC. Major bleeding was defined as transfusion of five or more units of packed red blood cells within 48 hours regardless of hemoglobin level, hemoglobin < 7g/dL and any red blood cell transfusion or a diagnosis code for major bleeding during the hospitalization or radiological evidence of intracranial hemorrhage Results: A total of 3480 patients were included (mean age, 64.5 years [17.0]; 51.5% female; 52.1% black and 40.6% white). 18.5% (n=642) were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). 60.9% received pAC (n=2121), 28.7% received at least 3 days of tAC (n=998), and 10.4% (n=361) did not receive AC. Propensity score (PS) weighted Kaplan-Meier plot demonstrated a statistical difference in the 25-day survival probability in the tAC group compared to the pAC group (57.5% vs 50.7%, Figure). In a PS weighted multivariate proportional hazards model adjusting for age, body mass index and ICU status, AC was associated with a reduced risk of death at both prophylactic (hazard ratio [HR] 0.35 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.22-0.54]) and therapeutic doses (HR 0.14 [95% CI 0.05-0.23]) compared to no AC. Major bleeding occurred more frequently among tAC patients (81 [8.1%]) compared to those who received no AC (20 [5.5%]) or pAC (46 [2.2%]). Conclusions: Higher doses of AC are associated with lower mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The lowest hazard ratio was observed in ICU patients, but risk was also significantly lower in non-ICU hospitalized patients. Bleeding occurred more frequently with higher doses of anticoagulation. Ongoing randomized trials are warranted to prospectively evaluate efficacy and risk of tAC in patients with COVID-19.

Earlier demand and access barriers have seemingly been addressed with more free and accessible vaccines now available for a wide variety of ages. While rates of COVID-19 have decreased overall, some geographic areas continue to experience rapid outbreaks. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between vaccination uptake and weekly COVID-19 cases throughout locations in the state of Missouri. Methods Among all Missouri counties and two cities (n=117), weekly COVID-19 incidence and cumulative proportion of residents fully vaccinated were abstracted from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services during a 25-week period from January 4 to Jun 26, 2021. Additional ecological variables known to be associated with COVID-19 incidence and prevalence were collected from the U.S. Census Bureau and integrated into data: total population, proportion of nonwhite residents, annual median household income, proportion of residents working in public facing occupations. Descriptive and inferential statistics were completed which included the calculation of both linear and nonlinear models using repeated measure data to determine the quantitative association between vaccination uptake and reported COVID-19 cases in the presence of location characteristics. Results Throughout the 25 weeks of observations, the average weekly number of COVID-19 cases reported was 66.1 (SD=260.8) while the average cumulative proportion vaccinated individuals at the end of the 25 weeks was 25.8% (SD=6.8%) among study locations. While graphing seemed to suggest a more nonlinear relationship between COVID-19 incidence and proportion vaccinated, comparison of crude linear and nonlinear models pointed to the relationship likely being linear during study period. The final adjusted linear model exhibited a significant relationship between COVID-19 cases and proportion vaccinated, specifically every percent increase in population vaccinated resulted in 3 less weekly COVID-19 cases being reported ({beta} -3.74, p<0.001. Additionally, when controlling for other factors, the adjusted model revealed locations with higher proportions of nonwhite residents were likely to experience less weekly COVID-19 cases ({beta} -1.48, p=0.037). Discussion Overall, this study determined that increasing the proportion of residents vaccinated decreases COIVD-19 cases by a substantial amount over time. These findings provide insights into possible messaging strategies that can be leveraged to develop more effective implementation and uptake. As the COVID-19 pandemic persists and vaccination numbers begin to plateau, diverse communication strategies become a critical necessity to reach a wider population.","output":"Examining the Relationship between COVID-19 Vaccinations and Reported Incidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"College students with children are a unique subset of emerging adults, whose lives were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, challenging their pursuit for education and financial independence.

It is particularly important to understand the extent to which teacher's psychological wellbeing has been affected by this global health crisis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis was twofold: 1) ascertain the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression among teachers during the COVID-19 outbreak; 2) identify the associated factors of these psychological wellbeing domains of the teachers. METHODS: Academic Search Premier, Eric, PsycInfo, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for articles published from December 2019 and July 2021, using search terms including \\"COVID-19\\" \\"anxiety\\" \\"depression\\" \\"stress\\", and \\"teachers\\". RESULTS: This study included 54 studies synthesising data from 256,896 teachers across 22 countries. The meta-analysis showed higher prevalence of stress (62.6%, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 46.1-76.6), compared to anxiety (36.3%, 95% CI: 28.5-44.9) and depression (59.9%, 95% CI: 43.4-74.4) among teachers. Teachers' experiences of these psychological issues were associated with various socio-demographic and institutional factors, including gender, nature of online teaching, job satisfaction, teaching experience, and the volume of workload. Additionally, several protective factors, such as regular exercises and provision of technical support for online teaching, reduced teachers' negative psychological experiences. CONCLUSION: There is a need for authorities to formulate educational policies to improve teachers' wellbeing at the time of global crisis. Special attention should be paid to assist female teachers in overcoming physical and mental stressors.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic-related anxiety, stress, and depression among teachers: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To establish a new predictive score for the diagnosis of septic arthritis (SA) according to different synovial fluid (SF) variables. METHODS: First, we analysed the different clinical, biological and SF variables associated with the diagnosis of SA (according to the Newman's criteria) in a monocentric cohort of acute arthritis (<30 days) (n = 233) (SYNOLACTATE cohort). A new score predictive of SA (RESAS) was created using the independent discriminant variables after multivariate analysis. A value was attributed to each variable of the score according to the weighting based on their likelihood ratio for the diagnosis of SA. RESAS performance was then tested on the first cohort (internal validation) and then checked on a second independent cohort (n = 70) (external validation). RESULTS: After multivariate analysis, four independent variables of the SF were included for RESAS: (i) purulent SF or white blood cells count &#8805;70 000/mm3; (ii) absence/presence of crystals; (iii) lactate; and (iv) glucose synovial level. RESAS ranged between -4 and +13 points. The performance of RESAS to predicted SA was excellent with area under the curve (AUC)=0.928 (0.877-0.980) in internal validation and AUC=0.986 (0.962-1.00) in external validation. For a RESAS threshold &#8805;+4, SA was diagnosed with Se=56.0% (0.371-0.733), Sp=98.1% (0.952-0.993), LR+=29.1 (10.4-81.6) in the first cohort and with Se=91.7% (0.646-0.985), Sp=98.3% (0.909-0.997), LR+=53.2 (7.56-373) in the second cohort.

This paper aims to determine the impact of COVID-19 on colorectal cancer diagnosis and management in Australia and New Zealand. METHODS This is a multicentre retrospective cohort study using the prospectively maintained Binational Colorectal Cancer Audit (BCCA) registry. Data is contributed by over 200 surgeons in Australia and New Zealand. Patients receiving colorectal cancer surgery during the pandemic were compared to averages from the same period over the preceding three years. RESULTS There were fewer operations in 2020 than the historical average. During April to June patients were younger, more likely to have operations in public hospitals and more likely to have urgent or emergency operations. By October to December proportionally less patients had stage I disease, proportionally more had stage II or III disease and there was no difference in stage IV disease. Patients were less likely to have rectal cancer, were increasingly likely to have urgent or emergency surgery and more likely to have a stoma created. CONCLUSION This study shows that the response to COVID-19 has had measurably negative effects on the diagnosis and management of colorectal cancer in two countries that have had significantly fewer COVID-19 cases than many other countries.

Earlier studies assessed the risk of school reopening by modeling transmission across schools and communities; however, it remains unclear whether the risk is due to increased transmission in adults or children. The empirical findings of the impact of school closures on COVID-19 outbreaks suggest no clear effect, likely because of heterogeneity in community infection pressure, differences in school closure strategies, or the use of multiple interventions. The benefits of school closings are unclear and not readily quantifiable; however, they must be weighed against the potential high social costs, which can also negatively affect the health of this generation.","output":"School closures during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to review the important roles of health knowledge organization systems (KOSs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Different types of knowledge organization systems, including term lists, synonym rings, thesauri, subject heading systems, taxonomies, classification schemes, and ontologies are widely recognized and applied in both modern and traditional information systems. Apart from their usage in the management of data, information, and knowledge, KOSs are seen as valuable components for large information architecture, content management, findability improvement, and many other applications. After introducing the challenges of information overload and semantic conflicts, the article reviews the efforts of major health KOSs, illustrates various health coding schemes, explains their usages and implementations, and reveals their implications for health information exchange and communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some general examples of the applications, services, and analysis powered by KOSs are presented at the end. As revealed in this article, they have become even more critical to aid the frontline endeavors to overcome the obstacles due to information overload and semantic conflicts that can occur during devastating historic and worldwide events like the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Implications of Knowledge Organization Systems for Health Information Exchange and Communication during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various animal models of lung injury exist to study the complex pathomechanisms of human acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and evaluate future therapies. Severe lung injury with a reproducible deterioration of pulmonary gas exchange and hemodynamics can be induced in anesthetized pigs using repeated lung lavages with warmed 0.9% saline (50 ml/kg body weight). Including standard respiratory and hemodynamic monitoring with clinically applied devices in this model allows the evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies (drugs, modern ventilators, extracorporeal membrane oxygenators, ECMO), and bridges the gap between bench and bedside. Furthermore, induction of lung injury with lung lavages does not require the injection of pathogens/endotoxins that impact on measurements of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. A disadvantage of the model is the high recruitability of atelectatic lung tissue. Standardization of the model helps to avoid pitfalls, to ensure comparability between experiments, and to reduce the number of animals needed.","output":"Lavage-induced Surfactant Depletion in Pigs As a Model of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a leading cause of morbidity for both males and females.

Government-imposed restrictive measures continue with undetermined effects on physical and mental health. AIMS: To compare child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) referrals over 11 months (JanuaryCNovember) in 2020, 2019 and 2018 and examine any impact the different phases of the COVID-19 restrictions might have on referral rates. METHOD: Monthly CAMHS Health Service Executive data were examined, covering a catchment population of 260 560 or 12.7% of all youth (age group 0C18 years) in Ireland. The total number of urgent and routine referrals, appointments offered, rates of non-attendances and discharge outcome are presented. RESULTS: There was a significant drop in referrals in 2020, compared with prior years ((2) = 10.3, d.f. = 2, P = 0.006). Referrals in 2020 dropped from March to May by 11% and from June to August by 10.3%. From September, both routine and urgent referrals increased by 50% compared with previous years (2018/2019), with the highest increase in November 2020 (180%). Clinic activity also increased from September, with double the number of out-patient appointments offered, compared with previous years ((2) = 5171.72, d.f. = 3, P < 0.001) and lower (6.6%) rates of non-attendance ((2) = 868.35, d.f. = 3, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In 2020, following an initial decline, referrals to CAMHS increased consistently from September. Such unprecedented increase in referrals places further strain on services that are already underresourced and underfunded, with the likelihood of increased waiting lists post COVID-19. It is envisaged that once the pandemic is over, resources will be even more constrained, and CAMHS will be urgently in need of additional ring-fenced funding.","output":"Referral patterns for specialist child and adolescent mental health services in the Republic of Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with 2019 and 2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we estimate the time-varying COVID-19 contact rate of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model.

In the present study, we present a new strategy to improve the sensitivity of a nucleic acid assay by detecting the presence of a multi-copy gene. By using Brucella as a test model, we screened the genome and identified IS711 as a multiple copy gene. Distribution analysis of insertion sequence IS711 among different species and strains showed that each of the strains have 5 to 13 copies of IS711. Compared with the BMEI1001, BMEI0775 and BMEI0027, the assays of high copy genes IS711 showed higher sensitivity and is an ideal high copy signature gene for Brucella. Detection of clinical samples with assays targeting the signature genes showed that IS711 exist in higher concentrations than BMEI1001, BMEI0775 and BMEI0027. In addition, IS711 assay is more sensitive than other signature genes assay. Analysis of several other pathogenic bacteria successfully identified high copy number genes that could be used as signature genes.

This neurotransmitter may be directly related to the respiratory illness as is in COVID-19 infection.

PURPOSE: As part of the process evaluation, this study aimed to explore experiences, attitudes and perspectives of the oncological department on sharing patient consultations with GPs using video. METHODS: Four semistructured interviews with five oncologists and four nurse specialists were conducted in February 2020. We focused on the informants' experiences and reflections on the potential of future implementation of the concept 'inviting the GP for a shared consultation by video'. The analyses were based on an inductive, open-minded, hermeneutic phenomenological approach. RESULTS: A total of six overall themes were identified: structuring consultation and communication, perceptions of GP involvement in cancer care, stressors, making a difference, alternative ways of cross-sector communication and needs for redesigning the model. The concept made sense and was deemed useful, but solving the many technical and organisational problems is pivotal. Case-specific tasks and relational issues were targeted by pragmatically rethinking protocol expectations and the usual way of communication and structuring patient encounters. Case selection was discussed as one way of maturing the concept.

This study examines the joint and mediating role of diabetes and weight in COVID-19 severity and mortality in a large sample of patients treated in a large urban hospital located in Southern California.Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 8, 2020 and January 25, 2021 was implemented. Participants were patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection who received care within the Cedars-Sinai Health System in Los Angeles, CA. Inclusion criteria required objectively measured height, weight, and diabetic status to be present in the patients medical record (N=4224). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify associated risk factors, and a regression causal mediation analysis examined the role of diabetes in the association between obesity and illness severity. All analyses were stratified by age (<65 and 65).Findings: Among individuals younger than 65yo, diabetes accounted for 19-30% of the associations between obesity and COVID-19 illness severity. In both age groups, those with both obesity and diabetes had the highest odds of increased disease severity.

These are the same systematic failures that have always harmed and killed the nation's most vulnerable. While everyone wishes for an end to this national tragedy, the authors believe a new normal must be defined for the postpandemic period.In the postpandemic period, policies that were once labeled radical and impossible will be urgent and necessary. Examples of such policies include providing universal health care, dismantling the structures that propagate racism and injustice, and reinvesting in public health. Previous research by the authors has shown that their medical student colleagues recognize that it is their responsibility to address policies that harm patients and to support reforms at the scale the authors propose. This commitment to a better future is reflected in the widespread mobilization of medical students seen across the United States. Recognizing that the old normal is unsustainable, the authors call on those who previously benefited from the status quo to instead seek a new postpandemic normal that works for all.","output":"COVID-19 and Public Policy Imperatives: A Trainee Call to Action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a new human pathogen in late 2019 and it has infected over 100 million people in less than a year. There is a clear need for effective antiviral drugs to complement current preventive measures, including vaccines. In this study, we demonstrate that berberine and obatoclax, two broad-spectrum antiviral compounds, are effective against multiple isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Berberine, a plant-derived alkaloid, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations and obatoclax, which was originally developed as an anti-apoptotic protein antagonist, was effective at sub-micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition studies indicated that berberine acts on the late stage of the viral life cycle. In agreement, berberine mildly affected viral RNA synthesis, but it strongly reduced infectious viral titers, leading to an increase in the particle-to-pfu ratio. In contrast, obatoclax acted at the early stage of the infection, which is in line with its activity to neutralize the acidic environment in endosomes. We assessed infection of primary human nasal epithelial cells that were cultured on an air-liquid interface and found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced and repressed expression of specific sets of cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, both obatoclax and berberine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in these primary target cells. We propose berberine and obatoclax as potential antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that could be considered for further efficacy testing.","output":"Berberine and Obatoclax Inhibit SARS-Cov-2 Replication in Primary Human Nasal Epithelial Cells In Vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current dramatic context of COVID-19 has urged academics and practitioners to tackle the topic of the pandemic not only regarding its medical side but from the perspective of social sciences, accounting and accountability as well In this sense, our paper moves from the pivotal work of Higgins and Walker (2012) and Merkl-Davies and Brennan (2017) and tries to trace the use and the extent of accounting communication by companies during the peculiar context of the pandemic Considering the nature of the elements to be evaluated, we applied a manual content analysis, a more suitable technique than software to capture subjective and emotional elements Among the main preliminary results of the paper, the volume and the importance of emotional content come to the surface, such as self-assessment and emotional tone The paper confirms the important role of rhetorical analysis in understanding the quality and the meaning of the information provided by companies and contributes to the stream of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) studies on corporate reporting","output":"Rhetoric, Accounting and Accountability: COVID-19 and the Case of Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has caused shockwaves throughout the US healthcare system.

The use of ketorolac in spinal fusion is limited due to the risk of pseudarthrosis. However, recent literature suggests it may not affect fusion rates with short-term use and low doses. PURPOSE We sought to demonstrate non-inferiority regarding fusion rates in patients who received ketorolac after undergoing minimally invasive (MIS) posterior lumbar interbody fusion. Additionally, we sought to demonstrate ketorolac's opioid-sparing effect on analgesia in the immediate postoperative period. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. We are reporting our interim analysis. PATIENT SAMPLE Adults with degenerative spinal conditions eligible to undergo a one to three-level MIS transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF). OUTCOME MEASURES Six-month and 1-year radiographic fusion as determined by Suk criteria, postoperative opioid consumption as measured by intravenous Milligram Morphine Equivalent (MME), length of stay, and drug-related complications. Self-reported and functional measures include validated visual analogue scale (VAS), short-form 12 (SF-12), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). METHODS A double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled, non-inferiority trial of patients undergoing 1 to 3-level MIS TLIF was performed with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Patients were randomized to receive a 48-hour scheduled treatment of either intravenous ketorolac (15 mg every 6 hours) or saline in addition to a standardized pain regimen. The primary outcome was fusion. Secondary outcomes included 48-hour and total postoperative opioid use demonstrated as milligram morphine equivalence, pain scores, length of stay (LOS), and quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes. Univariate analyses were performed. The present study provides results from a planned interim analysis. RESULTS Two hundred and forty-six patients were analyzed per protocol. Patient characteristics were comparable between the groups. There was no significant difference in 1-year fusion rates between the two treatments (p=0.53). The difference in proportion of solid fusion between the ketorolac and placebo groups did not reach inferiority (p=0.072, 95% CI, -.07-.21). There was a significant reduction in total/48-hour mean opioid consumption (p<.001) and LOS (p=0.001) for the ketorolac group while demonstrating equivalent mean pain scores in 48 hours postoperative (p=0.20). There was no significant difference in rates of perioperative complications. CONCLUSION Short-term use of low-dose ketorolac in patients who have undergone MIS TLIF with BMP demonstrated non-inferior fusion rates. Ketorolac safely demonstrated a significant reduction in postoperative opioid use and LOS while maintaining equivalent postoperative pain control.","output":"The Effect of Ketorolac on Posterior Minimally Invasive Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion: an interim analysis from a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite the vast majority of individuals succumbing to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are elderly, infection fatality rate (IFR) estimates for the age group 70 years older are still scarce. To this end we assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among retired blood donors and combined it with national COVID-19 survey data to provide reliable population-based IFR estimates for this age group. METHODS: We identified 60,926 retired blood donors age 70 years or older in the rosters of three region-wide Danish blood banks and invited them to fill in a questionnaire on COVID-19 related symptoms and behaviours. Among 24,861 (40.8%) responders, we invited a random sample of 3,200 individuals for blood testing. Overall, 1,201 (37.5%) individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Wantai) and compared to 1,110 active blood donors age 17-69 years. Seroprevalence 95% confidence intervals (CI) were adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Among retired (age 70 years or older) and active (age 17-69 years) blood donors, adjusted seroprevalences were 1.4% (95% CI: 0.3%-2.5%) and 2.5% (95% CI: 1.3%-3.8%), respectively. Using available population data on COVID-19 related fatalities, IFRs for patients age 70 years or older and for 17-69 years were estimated at 5.4% (95% CI: 2.7%C6.4%) and 0.083% (95% CI: 0.054%-0.18%), respectively. Only 52.4% of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive retired blood donors reported having been sick since the start of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 IFR in the age group above 69 years is estimated to be 65 times as high as the IFR for people age 18-69 years.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality rate among elderly retired Danish blood donors - A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We investigated the prevalence of anosmia and ageusia in adult patients with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory distress s","output":"New Onset Anosmia and Ageusia in Adult Patients Diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 in a London Community and Secondary Care Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human risk has further increased within the global maritime industry because of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

The assessment of five indicators that characterize the opinions of adults living in different countries about a strong decrease, a small decrease, preservation, a small increase and a strong increase in their income in 2020 was considered. The initial data were the results of a survey of the economically active population in 43 countries, in the process of implementing the Global Entrepreneurship Monitoring project. The five indicators were evaluated using the density functions of the normal distribution. It is proved that for the majority (53%) of households, due to the pandemic, there was a decrease in household income. It shows the preservation of income in a significant (40%) number of households in the countries under consideration. It is shown that the increase in income in 2020 was observed only in a small number (less than 4%) of households. It is proved that the values of each of the five indicators under consideration had a significant differentiation by country.

We aimed to investigate changes in physician visits and medication prescriptions for chronic diseases before and during the COVID-19 pandemic at the population level. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Nationwide claims data in Japan, 2018C2020. PARTICIPANTS: Working-age population (aged 18C74 years) who visited physicians and received any prescriptions for major chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemia) before the pandemic. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes were the monthly number of physician visits, the monthly proportion of physician visits and the monthly proportion of days covered by prescribed medication (PDC) during the pandemic (AprilCMay 2020, as the first state of emergency over COVID-19 was declared on 7 April, and withdrawn nationally on 25 May). RESULTS: Among 10 346 patients who visited physicians for chronic diseases before the pandemic, we found a temporary decline in physician visits (mean number of visits was 1.9 in March vs 1.7 in April; p<0.001) and an increase in the proportion of patients who did not visit any physicians during the pandemic (15% in March vs 24% in April; p<0.001). Physician visits returned to the baseline in May (the mean number of visits: 1.8, and the proportion of patients who did not visit any physicians: 9%).

Robotic devices, in addition to telerehabilitation, are increasingly being used to train the upper limbs after stroke, and their use at home allows us to extend institutional rehabilitation by increasing and prolonging therapy. The aim of this study is to assess the usability of the MERLIN robotic system based on serious games for upper limb rehabilitation in people with stroke in the home environment. METHODS: 9 participants with a stroke in three different stages of recovery (subacute, short-term chronic and long-term chronic) with impaired arm/hand function, were recruited to use the MERLIN system for 3 weeks: 1 week training at the Maimonides Biomedical Research Institute of Cordoba (IMIBIC), and 2 weeks at the patients homes. To evaluate usability, the System Usability Scale (SUS), Adapted Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with assistive Technology (QUEST), and the ArmAssist Usability Assessment Questionnaire were used in the post-intervention. Clinical outcomes for upper limb motor function were assessed pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: 9 patients participated in and completed the study. The usability assessment reported a high level of satisfaction: mean SUS score 71.94 % (SD = 16.38), mean QUEST scale 3.81 (SD = 0.38), and mean Adapted IMI score 6.12 (SD = 1.36). The results of the ArmAssist Questionnaire showed an average of 6 out of 7, which indicates that MERLIN is extremely intuitive, easy to learn and easy to use.

To disentangle different cognitive processes that unfold throughout a trial, we applied an unsupervised machine learning method to electroencephalogram (EEG) data continuously recorded while 39 participants attempted 153 Compound Remote Associates problems (CRA). CRA problems are verbal puzzles that can be solved in either insight-leaning or analysis-leaning manner. We fitted a Hidden Markov Model to the time-frequency transformed EEG signals and decoded each trial as a time-resolved state sequence. The model characterizes hidden brain states with spectrally resolved power topography. Seven states were identified with distinct activation patterns in the theta (4-7Hz), alpha (8-9 Hz and 10-13 Hz), and gamma (25Hz - 50Hz) bands. Notably, a state featuring widespread activation only in alpha-band frequency emerged, from this data-driven approach, which exhibited dynamic characteristics associated with specific temporal stages and outcomes (whether solved with insight or analysis) of the trials. The state dynamics derived from the model overlap and extend previous literature on the cognitive function of alpha oscillation: the \\"alpha-state\\" probability peaks before stimulus onset and decreases before response. In trials solved with insight, relative to solved with analysis, the alpha-state is more likely to be visited and maintained during preparation and solving periods, and its probability declines more sharply immediately preceding a response.

Measurement and Main Results: The mEP respirator removed particles (96.5+/-0.4%) approximating efficiencies of the N95 (96.9+/-0.6%). The mEP respirator similarly decreased SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (99.792%) when compared to N95 removal (99.942%) as a function of particle removal from the airstream distal to the breathing zone of each respirator. Conclusions: The mEP respirator approximated performance of a filter-based N95 respirator for particle removal and viral RNA as a constituent of the SARS-CoV-2 bioaerosols generated for this evaluation. In practice, the mEP respirator would provide equivalent protection from ambient infectious bioaerosols as the N95 respirator without undue pressure drop to the wearer, thereby facilitating long-term use in an unobstructed breathing configuration.","output":"A Micronized Electrostatic Precipitator Respirator Effectively Removes Ambient SARS-CoV-2 Bioaerosols"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Partial adrenalectomy has been widely performed in the last decades in order to diminish the number of patients who would become lifetime dependent of hormonal replacement. Method: between 2016 and 2018 seven patients were submitted to minimally invasive partial adrenalectomy in Ponderas Academic Hospital. Results: the median age at the time of surgery was 56 years (range 42-67 years) while the indications for partial adrenalectomy (PA) were represented by Conn's syndrome in four cases, bilateral pheochromocytoma in one cases and nonfunctional adrenal tumors in two cases. Preoperatively successful adrenal vein sampling was performed in one case. The indocyanine green test (ICG) as well as intraoperative ultrasound were used each in three cases. The transperitoneal approach was used for PA in all patients, laparoscopic in five and robotic assisted in two patients. No conversion to open surgery or to total suprarenalectomy was encountered. Conclusions: minimally invasive surgery seems to be a safe and effective method to perform partial adrenalectomy.

Being homebound is associated with decreased access to medical services, poor health outcomes, and increased mortality. Yet, it is unknown what factors, in particular socioeconomic factors, are associated with new onset of homebound status. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between income and risk of becoming homebound. DESIGN Observational cohort study using 2011 to 2018 data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. SETTING Population-based study in the United States. PARTICIPANTS A total of 7,042 initially nonhomebound community-dwelling older adults. EXPOSURE Total annual household income at baseline (in 2011) measured via self-report. OUTCOME Annual measure of homebound status, defined as leaving home an average of 1 d/wk or less. RESULTS Over 7 years, 15.81% of older adults in the lowest income quartile ($15,003) became homebound, compared with only 4.64% of those in the highest income quartile (>$60,000). In a competing risks analysis accounting for risks of death and nursing home admission, and adjusted for clinical and demographic characteristics, those in the lowest income quartile had a substantially higher subhazard of becoming homebound than those in the highest income quartile (1.65; 95% confidence interval = 1.20-2.29). Moreover, we see evidence of a gradient in risk of homebound status by income quartile. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Our work demonstrates that financial resources shape the risk of becoming homebound, which is associated with negative health consequences.

METHODS: We studied in 565 patients with type 2 diabetes in the CovidPredict Clinical Course Cohort whether use of a DPP-4 inhibitor prior to hospital admission due to COVID-19 was associated with improved clinical outcomes. Using crude analyses and propensity score matching (on age, sex and BMI), 28 patients using a DPP-4 inhibitor were identified and compared to non-users. RESULTS: No differences were found in the primary outcome mortality (matched-analysis = odds-ratio: 0,94 [95% confidence interval: 0,69 C 1,28], p-value: 0,689) or any of the secondary outcomes (ICU admission, invasive ventilation, thrombotic events or infectious complications). Additional analyses comparing users of DPP-4 inhibitors with subgroups of non-users (subgroup 1: users of metformin and sulphonylurea; subgroup 2: users of any insulin combination), allowing to correct for diabetes severity, did not yield different results.

While early detection and isolation were identified as important non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures for containing the disease spread, this may not have been pragmatically implementable in developing countries due to social and economic reasons (i.e., poor education, less public awareness, massive unemployment). Hence, to elucidate COVID-19 transmission dynamics with respect to the NPI statuse.g., social distancingthis study conducted spatio-temporal analysis using the prospective scanning statistic at district and sub-district levels in Bangladesh and its capital, Dhaka city, respectively. Dhaka megacity has remained the highest-risk active cluster since early April. Lately, the central and south eastern regions in Bangladesh have been exhibiting a high risk of COVID-19 transmission. The detected space-time progression of COVID-19 infection suggests that Bangladesh has experienced a community-level transmission at the early phase (i.e., March, 2020), primarily introduced by Bangladeshi citizens returning from coronavirus epicenters in Europe and the Middle East. Potential linkages exist between the violation of NPIs and the emergence of new higher-risk clusters over the post-incubation periods around Bangladesh.

We estimate variation in deaths arising due to a simulated random infection of 10% of the population living in private households and subsequent within-household transmission of the virus. The age structures of European and North American countries increase their vulnerability to COVID-related deaths in general. The coresidence patterns of elderly persons in Africa and parts of Asia increase these countries' vulnerability to deaths induced by within-household transmission of COVID-19. Southern European countries, which have aged populations and relatively high levels of intergenerational coresidence, are, all else equal, the most vulnerable to outbreaks of COVID-19. In a second step, we estimate to what extent avoiding primary infections for specific age groups would prevent subsequent deaths due to within-household transmission of the virus. Preventing primary infections among the elderly is the most effective in countries with small households and little intergenerational coresidence, such as France, whereas confining younger age groups can have a greater impact in countries with large and intergenerational households, such as Bangladesh.","output":"National age and coresidence patterns shape COVID-19 vulnerability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives In the United States, nursing facility residents comprise less than 1% of the population but over 40% of deaths due to COVID-19. Mitigating the enormous risk of COVID-19 to nursing home residents requires adequate data. The widely used CMS COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset contains two derived statistics: Total Resident Confirmed COVID-19 Cases per 1,000 Residents and Total Resident COVID-19 Deaths per 1,000 Residents. These metrics provide a misleading picture, as facilities report cumulative counts of cases and deaths over different time periods but use a point-in-time measure as proxy for number of residents (number of occupied beds in a week), resulting in inflated statistics. We propose an alternative statistic to better illustrate the burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths across nursing facilities. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting and Participants Using the CMS Nursing Home Compare and COVID-19 Nursing Home Datasets, we examined facilities with star ratings and COVID-19 data passing quality assurance checks for each reporting period from May 31-August 16, 2020 (n=11,115). Methods We derived an alternative measure of the number of COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents using the net change in weekly census. For each measure, we compared predicted number of cases/deaths by overall star rating using negative binomial regression with constant dispersion, controlling for county-level cases per capita and nursing home characteristics. Results The average number of cases per 1,000 estimated residents using our method is lower compared to the metric using occupied beds as proxy for number of residents (44.8 compared to 66.6). We find similar results when examining number of COVID-19 deaths per 1,000 residents.

In humans, CoVs can cause respiratory, kidney, heart, brain, and intestinal infections that can range from mild to lethal.

Some researchers believe that interactions between HIV-1 Gag-Pol molecules trigger the activation of embedded PR (which mediates Gag and Gag-Pol cleavage), and that Gag-Pol assembly domains outside of PR may contribute to PR activation by influencing PR dimer interaction in a Gag-Pol context. To determine if the enhancement of PR dimer interaction facilitates PR activation, we placed single or tandem repeat leucine zippers (LZ) at the PR C-terminus, and looked for a correlation between enhanced Gag processing efficiency and increased Gag-PR-LZ multimerization capacity. We found significant reductions in virus-like particles (VLPs) produced by HIV-1 mutants, with LZ fused to the end of PR as a result of enhanced Gag cleavage efficiency. Since VLP production can be restored to wt levels following PR activity inhibition, this assembly defect is considered PR activity-dependent. We also found a correlation between the LZ enhancement effect on Gag cleavage and enhanced Gag-PR multimerization. The results suggest that PR dimer interactions facilitated by forced Gag-PR multimerization lead to premature Gag cleavage, likely a result of premature PR activation. Our conclusion is that placement of a heterologous dimerization domain downstream of PR enhances PR-mediated Gag cleavage efficiency, implying that structural conformation, rather than the primary sequence outside of PR, is a major determinant of HIV-1 PR activation.","output":"Placement of Leucine Zipper Motifs at the Carboxyl Terminus of HIV-1 Protease Significantly Reduces Virion Production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown have had a negative impact on global mental health.

Patients from ethnic minority backgrounds are particularly vulnerable to unsafe care, but current engagement strategies have not been developed specifically for (and with) this population. Using an adapted approach to experience-based codesign (EBCD) to support the target population, the aim of the project is to codesign consumer engagement interventions to increase consumer engagement and safety in New South Wales and Victorian cancer inpatient, outpatient and day procedure services. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A mixed-method project will be undertaken at six study sites. Our EBCD approach includes a preparatory phase in which we will provide training and support to the codesign participants, in addition to recruiting and training consumer cofacilitators for the codesign workshops. The project will follow the EBCD process of gathering and synthesising observational data from each cancer service, with interview data from consumers and staff. With the resulting in-depth understanding of the safety threats commonly experienced by ethnic minority consumers in each site, we will work through feedback events and codesign groups with consumers and staff to determine how they can be more involved with their care to minimise the potential for patient harm.

METHODS: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted between January 18 and March 20, 2020, including people with confirmed COVID-19 from 56 hospitals officially designated in 3 Chinese regions; data were extracted from medical records. New-onset neurologic events as assessed by neurology consultants based on manifestations, clinical examination, and investigations were noted, in which critical events included disorders of consciousness, stroke, CNS infection, seizures, and status epilepticus. RESULTS: We enrolled 917 people with average age 48.7 years and 55% were male. The frequency of new-onset critical neurologic events was 3.5% (32/917) overall and 9.4% (30/319) among those with severe or critical COVID-19. These were impaired consciousness (n = 25) or stroke (n = 10). The risk of critical neurologic events was highly associated with age above 60 years and previous history of neurologic conditions.

Two observers independently assessed the identified papers for eligibility according to PRISMA guidelines. The inclusion criteria were trismus after head and neck squamous cell cancer with consecutive treatment, detailed description of the surgical procedure for trismus release, description of the initial treatment, at least 6 months between initial cancer treatment and trismus release surgery, a minimal follow-up (FU) of 6 months, and availability of full text. The quality was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A subanalysis of the maximal mouth opening (MMO) was performed using a mixed-effect model. Results A total of 8,607 unique articles were screened for eligibility, 69 full texts were reviewed, and 3 studies, with a total of 46 cases, were selected based on the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three treatment strategies were identified for trismus release (1) free flap reconstruction (FFR), (2) coronoidectomy (CN), and (3) myotomy (MT). There was a clear improvement for all treatment modalities. A quantitative analysis showed a beneficial effect of CN (mean 24.02  15.02 mm) in comparison with FFR (mean 19.88  13.97 mm) and MT (mean 18.38  13.22 mm) (P < 0.01*).

RESULTS: No significant difference in the proportion of infection was noted among various lung lobes (P > 0.05). The POI of total lung was negatively correlated with the peripheral blood lymphocyte percentage (L%) (r = ? 0.633, P < 0.001) and lymphocyte (LY) count (r = ? 0.555, P = 0.001) but positively correlated with the neutrophil percentage (N%) (r = 0.565, P = 0.001). Otherwise, the POI was not significantly correlated with the peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) count, monocyte percentage (M%) or haemoglobin (HGB) content. In some patients, as the infection progressed, the L% and LY count decreased progressively accompanied by a continuous increase in the N%. CONCLUSIONS: Lung lesions in COVID-19 patients are significantly correlated with the peripheral blood lymphocyte and neutrophil levels, both of which could serve as prognostic indicators that provide warning implications, and contribute to clinical interventions in patients.

While many initial screening protocols centered around laboratory detection of the virus, early testing assays were thought to be poorly sensitive in comparison to chest computed tomography (CT), especially in asymptomatic disease. Coupled with shortages of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing kits in many parts of the world, these regions instead turned to the use of advanced imaging as a first-line screening modality. Curiously, in contrast to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome epidemics, chest X-ray has not demonstrated optimal sensitivity to be of much utility in first-line screening protocols. Though current national and international guidelines recommend for the use of RT-PCR as the primary screening tool for suspected cases of COVID-19, institutional and regional protocols must consider local availability of resources when issuing universal recommendations. Successful containment and social mitigation strategies worldwide have been thus far predicated on unified governmental responses, though the underlying ideologies of these practices may not be widely applicable in many Western nations. As the strain on the radiology workforce continues to mount, early results indicate a promising role for the use of machine-learning algorithms as risk stratification schema in the months to come.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostic technologies: A country-based retrospective on screening and containment procedures during the first wave of the pandemic()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Three-dimensional phase contrast imaging of multiply-scattering samples in X-ray and electron microscopy is extremely challenging, due to small numerical apertures, the unavailability of wavefront shaping optics, and the highly nonlinear inversion required from intensity-only measurements.

Measures of obligatory medical confinement were suspensions of scheduled non-emergent surgical procedures and outpatients clinics as well as overall access restrictions to hospitals and medical practices. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess if the obligatory confinement (lockdown) had an effect on the number of appendectomies (during and after the period of lockdown). METHODS: This retrospective study was based on anonymized nationwide administrative claims data of the German Local General Sickness Fund (AOK). Patients admitted for diseases of the appendix (ICD-10: K35-K38) or abdominal and pelvic pain (ICD-10: R10) who underwent an appendectomy (OPS: 5-470) were included. The study period included 6 weeks of German lockdown (16 MarchC26 April 2020) as well as 6 weeks before (03 FebruaryC15 March 2020) and after (27 AprilC07 June 2020). These periods were compared to the respective one in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: The overall number of appendectomies was significantly reduced during the lockdown time in 2020 compared to that in 2018 and 2019. This decrease affects only appendectomies due to acute simple (ICD-10: K35.30, K35.8) and non-acute appendicitis (ICD-10: K36-K38, R10). Numbers for appendectomies in acute complex appendicitis remained unchanged. Female patients and in the age group 1C18 years showed the strongest decrease in number of cases. CONCLUSION: The lockdown in Germany resulted in a decreased number of appendectomies. This affected mainly appendectomies in simple acute and non-acute appendicitis, but not complicated acute appendicitis. The study gives no evidence that the confinement measures resulted in a deterioration of medical care for appendicitis.","output":"Influence of COVID-19 confinement measures on appendectomies in Germanya claims data analysis of 9797 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Plans for allocation of scarce life-sustaining resources during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic often include triage teams, but operational details are lacking, including what patient information is needed to make triage decisions.

This study provides original data about the change in proportion of individuals showing immune response to COVID-19 between beginning of July and end of December 2020. Methods: The study was conducted in two rounds, 27 June -3 July, and 21-28 December 2020, using two independently selected samples of individuals 20-70 years old. Study participants were randomly selected from lists of the inhabitants of the catchment communities of four primary health care centers in Tirana City. Serological testing was performed by an ELISA method which determines IgG class antibodies anti S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The validity of the method was tested in a sample of blood donors sera of 2018. Results: The proportion of individuals classified as seropositive during the first round, in early July was 7.5% (95% CI: 4.3% - 10.7%). The proportion rose sharply in the second round, by late December 2020, reaching 48.2% (95% CI: 44.8% - 51.7%). The same increasing pattern was observed in all studied categories. No statistical significance was found between men and women and between age categories. The prevalence of seropositive individuals was always significantly higher among those who reported symptoms and those who had done the molecular test. Conclusion: The ratio of total infected cases over confirmed cases was estimated to be higher than 10 to 1 in Albania. The rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence observed in Tirana City may have been facilitated by a number of factors, including the very low infection exposure during the period March - May 2020, and the consecutive high susceptibility in population.

The technology assessment revealed that older age was strongly associated with less technology familiarity, less frequent engagement with technology, and higher difficulty ratings. Despite this, the majority (86.5%) of older adults elected to participate in the smartphone study and showed exceptional adherence (85.7%). Furthermore, among those enrolled, neither technology familiarity, knowledge, perceived difficulty, nor gender, race, or education were associated with adherence. These results suggest that while older adults remain significantly less familiar with technology than younger generations, with thoughtful study planning that emphasizes participant support and user-centered design, they are willing and capable participants in technology-enabled studies.

We present an 18-month-old boy initially admitted with fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea with rapid progression to respiratory failure. He was found to have a significant pleural effusion accompanying a large solitary liver lesion with abdominal ascites. There was no infectious exposure history or travel history, and thus pyogenic liver abscess was suspected, and aspiration performed while he was on empiric antimicrobials. The bacterial culture was negative. Molecular testing with 16 s and 18 s rRNA PCR on the fluid were non-diagnostic. The diagnosis of Entamoeba histolytica was confirmed within 48 hrs via plasma next-generation sequencing. Serum IgG for E histolytica resulted positive multiple weeks after the patient was discharged. The patient made a full recovery after metronidazole and paromomycin. This case illustrates the need to maintain ALA in the differential diagnosis for liver abscess in an infant even in the absence of risk factors.

METHODS: We searched the Qimai(TM) mobile application data analysis platform and the Aladdin(TM) WeChat applet data analysis platform with keywords and quantified the search results based on the search index, relevance, and the Aladdin index to identify apps with high public popularity. The quality of the apps was rated by 2 independent raters using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between raters was used as a measure of interrater reliability. RESULTS: All 20 of the included apps had acceptable quality.

We observed more customers vaping at shops with e-cigarette safety displays (p = .024) and more customers purchasing e-liquid at shops with quit smoking signage (p = .004). Point-of-sale displays were not associated with either customer vaping or purchasing behaviors observed at the shop. Displays of state-regulated and nonregulated (i.e., tobacco industry) age-of-sale compliance signs, Ask4ID and WeCard, were not significantly associated with customer vaping or purchase behaviors.

Human cases of SEOV virus infection have most recently been reported in the USA, United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands and were primarily associated with contact with pet rats and feeder rats. Infection of rats results in an asymptomatic but persistent infection. Little is known about the cell tropism of SEOV in its reservoir and most available data is based on experimental infection studies in which rats were inoculated via a route which does not recapitulate virus transmission in nature. Here we report the histopathological analysis of SEOV cell tropism in key target organs following natural infection of a cohort of feeder rats, comprising 19 adults and 11 juveniles. All adult rats in this study were positive for SEOV specific antibodies and viral RNA in their tissues. One juvenile rat was seropositive, but negative in the rRT-PCR.

It is time for academia and industry to shift their attention towards the next generation. At this crossroad, an overview of the current state of the art and a vision of future communications are definitely of interest. This article thus aims to provide a comprehensive survey to draw a picture of the sixth generation (6G) system in terms of drivers, use cases, usage scenarios, requirements, key performance indicators (KPIs), architecture, and enabling technologies. First, we attempt to answer the question of\\"Is there any need for 6G?\\"by shedding light on its key driving factors, in which we predict the explosive growth of mobile traffic until 2030, and envision potential use cases and usage scenarios. Second, the technical requirements of 6G are discussed and compared with those of 5G with respect to a set of KPIs in a quantitative manner. Third, the state-of-the-art 6G research efforts and activities from representative institutions and countries are summarized, and a tentative roadmap of definition, specification, standardization, and regulation is projected. Then, we identify a dozen of potential technologies and introduce their principles, advantages, challenges, and open research issues. Finally, the conclusions are drawn to paint a picture of\\"What 6G may look like?\\".

Here, we report on detailed classical and mixed-solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease (Mpro) enriched by evolutionary and stability analysis of the protein. The results were compared with those for a highly similar severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Mpro protein. In spite of a high level of sequence similarity, the active sites in both proteins showed major differences in both shape and size, indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile. Furthermore, analysis of the binding sites conformational changes during the simulation time indicated its flexibility and plasticity, which dashes hopes for rapid and reliable drug design. Conversely, structural stability of the protein with respect to flexible loop mutations indicated that the virus mutability will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors. However, few residues contribute significantly to the protein stability and thus can be considered as key anchoring residues for Mpro inhibitor design.","output":"Structural and Evolutionary Analysis Indicate That the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro Is a Challenging Target for Small-Molecule Inhibitor Design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Many patients with cancer, often those with rare cancers such as sarcomas, travel long distances to access expert care. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated widespread changes in delivery of cancer care, including rapid adoption of telemedicine-based care. We aimed to evaluate the impact of telemedicine on patients, clinicians, and care delivery at the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) Sarcoma Unit during the pandemic. METHODS: Data were extracted from patient records for all planned outpatient appointments at the RMH Sarcoma Unit from March 23 to April 24, 2020. Patients and clinicians completed separate questionnaires to understand their experiences. RESULTS: Of 379 planned face-to-face appointments, 283 (75%) were converted to telemedicine. Face-to-face appointments remained for patients who needed urgent start of therapy or performance status assessment. Patients lived on average > 1.5 hours from RMH. Patient satisfaction (n = 108) with telemedicine was high (mean, 9/10), and only 48% (n = 52/108) would not want to hear bad news using telemedicine. Clinicians found telemedicine efficient, with no associated increased workload, compared with face-to-face appointments. Clinicians indicated lack of physical examination did not often affect care provision when using telemedicine. Most clinicians (n = 17; 94%) believed telemedicine use was practice changing; congruently, 80% (n = 86/108) of patients desired some telemedicine as part of their future care, citing reduced cost and travel time. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine can revolutionize delivery of cancer care, particularly for patients with rare cancers who often live far away from expert centers.

Flawed methodology or publication bias in animal studies may explain the dicrepancy. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate whether publication of the randomized controlled trials Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study and Women's Health Initiative influenced study authors' assessment of research findings (confirmation bias) as well as to investigate publication bias and small-study effects in animal studies of estrogen effects on atherosclerosis. Methods The data source for this study was PubMed from inception to 2018. We selected animal studies with cardiovascular outcomes comparing 17--estradiol, its natural metabolites, or conjugated equine estrogen with control. Qualitative data were extracted on authors' conclusions about estrogen effects on cardiovascular disease, as well as quantitative data for atherosclerosis outcomes. Fixed- and random-effects meta-analyses were used. Publication bias/small-study effects were assessed using funnel plots and Egger's regression. Trim-and-fill plots and extrapolation from Egger's regression were used to adjust for publication bias. The main outcomes and measures were the primary study authors' interpretation of their own results, and estrogen effects on cardiovascular disease in general before and after publication of the Women's health Initiative study (2003). The effects of estrogens on atherosclerosis were measured as standardized mean difference between intervention and control. Results Of 1925 studies retrieved, 360 were eligible for analyses. Study-specific statements concluded that estrogens were protective against cardiovascular disease in 75% of studies before 2003 and 78% after, but the percentage of general statements about estrogens being cardioprotective changed from 70% to 40%. Meta-analyses showed less atherosclerosis in estrogen-treated animals. Extremely skewed funnel plots and P < .01 in Egger's regression suggested publication bias and/or exaggerated effects in small studies, which was more pronounced after 2002. There was substantial heterogeneity of effects (I 2 = 68%-86%) overall and in all subgroups except cynomolgus monkeys (I 2 = 9%), the only animal subgroup without clear bias. Adjusting for publication bias, overall estimates of estrogen effects on atherosclerosis were close to null effect. Conclusions We found substantial evidence of publication bias but not of confirmation bias. Publication bias and flawed small studies may partly explain why findings differ between animal studies and clinical trials on the effect of estrogens on cardiovascular disease.","output":"Bias in animal studies of estrogen effects on cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effective data mining of social media has become increasingly recognized for its value in informing decision makers of public welfare.

Sometimes, an aortic arch can be anatomically unfavourable for CAS. Herein we report our experience in a case of CAS with transcervical approach. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 77-year-old male was referred to our hospital for severe subtotal occlusion of the left internal carotid artery. He had a past medical history of radiation to the head and neck for laryngeal cancer. Previous CT-angiography had shown a type III aortic with bovine arch. CAS via transcervical approach was performed with transitory reversal flow during the placement of RX Spider Filter 6 Fr (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). After release of 7  30 mm RX Xact carotid stent (Abbott Vascular, Chicago, IL) and ballooning with a 5.5  30 mm Rx Submarine balloon catheter (Medtronic Minneapolis, MN), angiography check showed a good result. DISCUSSION: The transcervical approach is an innovative technique where usually a shunt is created, either between the common carotid artery and the internal jugular vein or between the common carotid artery and the common femoral vein. This flow reversal reduces the risk of periprocedural embolic events. In our experience a short proximal clamping with transitory reversal flow, reduces the invasiveness of procedure with good outcomes.

RECENT FINDINGS: Risk assessment tools can assist surgeons and other healthcare providers in identifying the benefit-risk ratio of surgical candidates. These tools gather demographic, medical history, and other pertinent patient-reported measures to calculate a probability utilizing regression or machine learning statistical foundations. Currently, much is still unknown about the use of these tools to predict quality of life, disability, and other factors following spine surgery. A systematic review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines that identified risk assessment tools that utilized patient-reported outcome measures as part of the calculation. From 8128 identified studies, 13 articles met inclusion criteria and were accepted into this review. The range of c-index values reported in the studies was between 0.63 and 0.84, indicating fair to excellent model performance.

We aimed to investigate this association using the population-based National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) data in the USA. METHODS: We included all adult (aged 18 years) COVID-19 cases with any health-care encounter from 54 clinical sites in the USA, with data being deposited into the N3C. The outcomes were COVID-19 disease severity, hospitalisation, and mortality. Encounters in the same health-care system beginning on or after January 1, 2018, were also included to provide information about pre-existing health conditions (eg, comorbidities). Logistic regression models were employed to estimate the association of HIV infection and HIV markers (CD4 cell count, viral load) with hospitalisation, mortality, and clinical severity of COVID-19 (multinomial). The models were initially adjusted for demographic characteristics, then subsequently adjusted for smoking, obesity, and a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess moderation effects by demographic characteristics. FINDINGS: In the harmonised N3C data release set from Jan 1, 2020, to May 8, 2021, there were 1 436 622 adult COVID-19 cases, of these, 13 170 individuals had HIV infection. A total of 26 130 COVID-19 related deaths occurred, with 445 among people with HIV. After adjusting for all the covariates, people with HIV had higher odds of COVID-19 death (adjusted odds ratio 129, 95% CI 116C144) and hospitalisation (120, 115C126), but lower odds of mild or moderate COVID-19 (061, 059C064) than people without HIV. Interaction terms revealed that the elevated odds were higher among older age groups, male, Black, African American, Hispanic, or Latinx adults. A lower CD4 cell count (<200 cells per L) was associated with all the adverse COVID-19 outcomes, while viral suppression was only associated with reduced hospitalisation. INTERPRETATION: Given the COVID-19 pandemic's exacerbating effects on health inequities, public health and clinical communities must strengthen services and support to prevent aggravated COVID-19 outcomes among people with HIV, particularly for those with pronounced immunodeficiency.

Daily data on confirmed cases of COVID-19 from March 13, 2020 to April 21, 2020 were obtained from the official website of Our World in Data (OWID) dedicated to COVID-19 while satellite climate data for the same period was obtained from the official website of NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) project. Considering the nature of the data and the objectives of the study, a time series generalized linear model which allows for regressing on past observations of the response variable and covariates was used for model fitting. The results indicate significant effects of maximum temperature, relative humidity and precipitation in predicting new cases of the disease. Also, results of the intervention analysis indicate that the null hypothesis of no significant effect of the specific policy intervention of partial lockdown should be rejected (p-value=0.0164) at a 5\\\\% level of significance.

First, we undertook a comparative study to assess how the adoption and usage of the COVID Alert app compared to those of similar apps deployed in other regions. Next, we used data from the COVID Alert server and a range of plausible parameter values to estimate the numbers of infections and deaths averted in Canada using a model that combines information on number of notifications, secondary attack rate, expected fraction of transmissions that could be prevented, quarantine effectiveness, and expected size of the full transmission chain in the absence of exposure notification. The comparative analysis revealed that the COVID Alert app had among the lowest adoption levels among apps that reported usage. Our model indicates that use of the COVID Alert app averted between 6,284 and 10,894 infections across the six Canadian provinces where app usage was highest during the March - July 2021 period. This range is equivalent to 1.6%-2.9% of the total recorded infections across Canada in that time. Using province-specific case fatality rates, 57-101 deaths were averted during the same period. The number of cases and deaths averted was greatest in Ontario, whereas the proportion of cases and death averted was greatest in Newfoundland and Labrador. App impact measures were reported so rarely and so inconsistently by other countries that the relative assessment of impact is inconclusive. While the nationwide rates are low, provinces with widespread adoption of the app showed high ratios of averted cases and deaths (upper bound was greater than 60% of averted cases).

Mortalities can reach 100% and have resulted in an 80% decline in the number of hatcheries actively producing M. rosenbergii. To investigate a causative agent for the mortalities, a disease challenge was carried out using infected material from a hatchery experiencing mortalities. Moribund larvae from the challenge were prepared for metatranscriptomic sequencing. De novo virus assembly revealed a 29 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with similarities in key protein motif sequences to yellow head virus (YHV), an RNA virus that causes mass mortalities in marine shrimp aquaculture, and other viruses in the Nidovirales order. Primers were designed against the novel virus and used to screen cDNA from larvae sampled from hatcheries in the South of Bangladesh from two consecutive years. Larvae from all hatcheries screened from both years were positive by PCR for the novel virus, including larvae from a hatchery that at the point of sampling appeared healthy, but later experienced mortalities. These screens suggest that the virus is widespread in M. rosenbergii hatchery culture in southern Bangladesh, and that early detection of the virus can be achieved by PCR. The hypothesised protein motifs of MrGV suggest that it is likely to be a new species within the Nidovirales order. Biosecurity measures should be taken in order to mitigate global spread through the movement of post-larvae within and between countries, which has previously been linked to other virus outbreaks in crustacean aquaculture.","output":"A novel RNA virus, Macrobrachium rosenbergii Golda virus (MrGV), linked to mass mortalities of the larval giant freshwater prawn in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has had the world on high alert since December 2019 Pregnancy is associated with various physiolo","output":"SARS-CoV-2 in Pregnancy: Where and What Is the Evidence?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The concept of new and emerging diseases has captured the public interest and has revitalized the public health infectious disease research community. This interest has also resulted in competition for funding and turf wars between animal health and public health scientists and public officials and, in some cases, has delayed and hindered progress toward effective prevention, control and biodefense. There is a dynamic list of outbreaks causing substantial morbidity and mortality in humans and often in the reservoir animal species. Some agents have the potential to grow into major epidemics. There are many determinants that influence the emergence of diseases of concern that require the use of current understanding of the nature of agent persistence and spread. Additional factors that are global must be added to plans for prevention and control. To this complex mix has been added the potential for accidental or malicious release of agents. The nature of emerging infectious agents and their impact is largely unpredictable. Models that strive to predict the dynamics of agents may be useful but can also blind us to increasing disease risks if it does not match a specific model. Field investigations of early events will be critical and should drive prevention and control actions.

Here we present data from over 360 patients to characterize the complex sequence diversity of individual infections identified during multiple variant surges (e.g., Alpha and Delta; requiring  80% genome coverage and 100X read depth). Across our survey, we observed significantly increasing SARS-CoV-2 sequence diversity during the pandemic and frequent occurrence of multiple biallelic sequence polymorphisms in all infections. This sequence polymorphism shows that SARS-CoV-2 infections are heterogeneous mixtures. Convention for reporting microbial pathogens guides investigators to report a majority consensus sequence. In our study, we found that this approach would under-report at least 79% of the observed sequence variation. As we find that this sequence heterogeneity is efficiently transmitted from donors to recipients, our findings illustrate that infection complexity must be monitored and reported more completely to understand SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission dynamics involving both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Many of the nucleotide changes that would not be reported in a majority consensus sequence have now been observed as lineage defining SNPs in Omicron BA.1 and/or BA.2 variants. This suggests that minority alleles in earlier SARS-CoV-2 infections may play an important role in the continuing evolution of new variants of concern. AUTHOR SUMMARY Evolution of the virus causing COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with significant transmission surges. With evolution of SARS-CoV-2, evidence has accumulated regarding increased transmissibility of lineages, varying severity of illness, evasion of vaccines and diagnostic tests. Continuous tracking of SARS-CoV-2 lineage evolution distills very large and complex viral sequence data sets down to consensus sequences that report the majority nucleotide at each of over 29,000 positions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observe that this eliminates considerable sequence variation and leads to a significant underestimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection diversity and transmission complexity. Additionally, concentration on the majority consensus sequence diverts attention from genetic variation that may contribute significantly to the continuing evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 Infection and Transmission Includes Complex Sequence Diversity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, is thought to release its RNA genome at either the cell surface or within endosomes, the balance being dependent on spike protein stability, and the complement of receptors, co-receptors and proteases. To investigate possible mediators of pH-dependence, pKa calculations have been made on a set of structures for spike protein ectodomain and fragments from SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Dominating a heat map of the aggregated predictions, three histidine residues in S2 are consistently predicted as destabilizing in pre-fusion (all three) and post-fusion (two of the three) structures. Other predicted features include the more moderate energetics of surface saltCbridge interactions and sidechainCmainchain interactions. Two aspartic acid residues in partially buried salt-bridges (D290CR273 and R355CD398) have pKas that are calculated to be elevated and destabilizing in more open forms of the spike trimer. These aspartic acids are most stabilized in a tightly closed conformation that has been observed when linoleic acid is bound, and which also affects the interactions of D614. The D614G mutation is known to modulate the balance of closed to open trimer. It is suggested that D398 in particular contributes to a pH-dependence of the open/closed equilibrium, potentially coupled to the effects of linoleic acid binding and D614G mutation, and possibly also A570D mutation. These observations are discussed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, mutagenesis studies, and other human coronaviruses.","output":"A model for pH coupling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein open/closed equilibrium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundDaily testing using a rapid Lateral Flow Device (LFD) has been suggested as an alternative to self-isolation. A randomised trial comparing daily contact testing (DCT) in schools with self-isolation found that SARS-CoV-2 transmission within school was comparable and low in both groups. However, if this approach is to be adopted widely, it is critical that we understand the perspective of those who will be delivering and receiving DCT. The aim of this qualitative process study embedded in the randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to improve understanding of a range of behavioural factors that could influence implementation. MethodsInterviews were conducted with 63 participants, including staff, students, and parents of students who had been identified as being in close contact with someone with COVID-19. The topic guide explored perceptions of daily testing, understanding of positive and negative test results, and adherence to guidance. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. ResultsResults were organised under three main headings: (1) factors influencing daily testing (2) interpretation of test results (3) behaviour during testing period. Participants recognized that daily testing may allow students to remain in school, which was viewed as necessary for both education and social needs. Whilst some felt safer as a result of daily testing, others raised concerns about safety. Participants did not always understand how to interpret and respond to test results, and although participants reported high levels of adherence to the guidance, improved communications were desired. ConclusionDaily testing may be a feasible and acceptable alternative to self-isolation among close contacts of people who test positive. However, improved communications are needed to ensure that all students and parents have a good understanding of the rationale for testing, what test results mean, how test results should be acted on, and how likely students are to test positive following close contact.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore and compare the community pharmacists' roles, practices, implemented safety measures, and psychological toll in Croatia and Serbia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study employing an online survey was conducted in 2 countries over a period of 6 weeks during 2020. The survey consisted of 65 items that explored sociodemographic characteristics of participants and their workplaces, including safety measures, pharmaceutical care, and their psychology while working during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 574 pharmacists participated in the study, of which, 90% were female, with a mean age of 38 years (interquartile range 30.5-47). The study identified new pharmacists' roles that evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic: manufacturing hand sanitizers in community pharmacies, online patient counseling, and home delivery of medicines. Croatian and Serbian pharmacists exhibited disparities in their incorporated safety measures (higher for Croatia; P &#8804; 0.001) and satisfaction with work organization and counseling activities (higher for Serbia; P < 0.001). Serbian participants were less satisfied with the public perception of their role during the pandemic, and overall satisfaction was low, with a negative impact on mood and productivity. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed the implications for community pharmacists during the pandemic in both countries. The extent of systematic and logistical support provided to them during the pandemic could be an explanation for the highlighted differences.

Here, as SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, we developed a lung organoid model using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-LOs). The hPSC-LOs (particularly alveolar type-II-like cells) are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and showed robust induction of chemokines following SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to what is seen in patients with COVID-19. Nearly 25% of these patients also have gastrointestinal manifestations, which are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes1. We therefore also generated complementary hPSC-derived colonic organoids (hPSC-COs) to explore the response of colonic cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that multiple colonic cell types, especially enterocytes, express ACE2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using hPSC-LOs, we performed a high-throughput screen of drugs approved by the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) and identified entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, including imatinib, mycophenolic acid and quinacrine dihydrochloride. Treatment at physiologically relevant levels of these drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of both hPSC-LOs and hPSC-COs. Together, these data demonstrate that hPSC-LOs and hPSC-COs infected by SARS-CoV-2 can serve as disease models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a valuable resource for drug screening to identify candidate COVID-19 therapeutics.","output":"Identification of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors using lung and colonic organoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The B.1.1.7 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus shows enhanced infectiousness over the wild type virus, leading to increasing patient numbers in affected areas. A number of single amino acid exchanges and deletions within the trimeric viral spike protein characterize this new SARS-CoV-2 variant. Crucial for viral entry into the host cell is the interaction of the spike protein with the cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as well as integration of the viral fusion peptide into the host membrane. Respective amino acid exchanges within the SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 affect inter-monomeric contact sites within the spike protein (A570D and D614G) as well as the ACE2-receptor interface region (N501Y), which comprises the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein. However, the molecular consequences of mutations within B.1.1.7 on spike protein dynamics and stability, the fusion peptide, and ACE2 binding are largely unknown. Here, molecular dynamics simulations comparing SARS-CoV-2 wild type with the B.1.1.7 variant revealed inter-trimeric contact rearrangements, altering the structural flexibility within the spike protein trimer. In addition to reduced flexibility in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein, we found increased flexibility in direct spatial proximity of the fusion peptide. This increase in flexibility is due to salt bridge rearrangements induced by the D614G mutation in B.1.1.7 found in pre- and post-cleavage state at the S2 site. Our results also imply a reduced binding affinity for B.1.1.7 with ACE2, as the N501Y mutation restructures the RBD-ACE2 interface, significantly decreasing the linear interaction energy between the RBD and ACE2. Our results demonstrate how mutations found within B.1.1.7 enlarge the flexibility around the fusion peptide and change the RBD-ACE2 interface, which, in combination, might explain the higher infectivity of B.1.1.7. We anticipate our findings to be starting points for in depth biochemical and cell biological analyses of B.1.1.7, but also other highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants, as many of them likewise exhibit a combination of the D614G and N501Y mutation.","output":"Mutations in the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein reduce receptor-binding affinity and induce a flexible link to the fusion peptide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this paper is to quantify the economic loss of the dairy farms due to the pandemic novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection by analyzing the real-time data of two typical farms (BD-2 and BD-14 cow) in Bangladesh and propose a strategic plan of action to make policy decisions in order to support the dairy industry. The International Farm Comparison Network (IFCN) Farm Simulation Approach and Technology Impact Policy Impact Calculations (TIPICAL) model was used considering with Corona (WC) and without Corona (WOC). The Integrated Dairy Research Network (IDRN) database (January 2019 to July 2020) was used for simulation of IFCN two typical farms. The milk price is decreased by 17% and feed price is increased by 3.7% due to COVID-19 in March which was used as the base for farm simulation. This resulted in a decrease in milk yield by 7.9% and 8.9% for small household and family farms, respectively. The cost of milk production increased by 19.10% and 10.9% for household and family farms, respectively. This has an overall negative impact on farm income which accounted for national economic loss from dairy farms in Bangladesh to 4.43 million USD/day (36.84 crore BDT). This loss has been fluctuated from April onward and was higher in June (3.83 million USD/day) due to a combination of COVID-19, flood, and seasonality effect on lowering milk production. At the same time, the farmers' response to the resilience capacity (liquidity, operating profit margin, and financial performance) to combat COVID-19-induced situation has been declined substantially. Based on this, we conclude that the government might take a strategy to support farmers by providing financial support for increasing the operating capital and decreasing the cost of milk production.

University students (N = 398) completed a web-based survey measuring COVID-19 anxiety, general health anxiety, uncertainty intolerance, interpersonal trust, depression, and COVID-19-related panic shopping. The participants also responded to two additional questions: Do you personally know of anyone who was suspected of having been infected with COVID-19? and Did you get sick in the past year? Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, Pearson correlation, multiple regression analysis, multivariate regression analysis, and 2  2 factorial ANOVA were used to analyze data. Health anxiety, uncertainty intolerance, and interpersonal trust were significantly associated with COVID-19 anxiety. COVID-19 anxiety was a significant predictor of depression and panic shopping. Participants who knew someone with COVID-19 and those who reported being sick in the past year experienced more COVID-19 anxiety.

METHODS: We included na=a511 (pre-)dementia patients and na=a826 caregivers from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort and via Alzheimer Nederland. All respondents completed a self-designed survey on psychosocial effects of COVID-19. We examined relations between experienced support and psychosocial and behavioral symptoms using logistic regression. In a subset of patients and caregivers we compared responses between first and second lockdown using generalized estimating equation (GEE). RESULTS: The majority of patients (58%) and caregivers (60%) reported that family and friends, hobbies, and music helped them cope. Support from family and friends was strongly related to less negative feelings in patients (loneliness: ORa=a0.3[0.1-0.6]) and caregivers (loneliness: ORa=a0.2[0.1-0.3]; depression: ORa=a0.4[0.2-0.5]; anxiety: ORa=a0.4[0.3-0.6]; uncertainty: ORa=a0.3[0.2-0.5]; fatigue: ORa=a0.3[0.2-0.4]; stress: ORa=a0.3[0.2-0.5]). In second lockdown, less psychosocial and behavioral symptoms were reported compared to first lockdown (patients; e.g., anxiety: 22% versus 13%, pa=a0.007; apathy: 27% versus 8%, pa<a0.001, caregivers; e.g., anxiety: 23% versus 16%, pa=a0.033; patient's behavioral problems: 50% versus 35%, pa<a0.001).

Cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis is a rare condition which can be idiopathic or secondary to underlying infections, connective tissue disorders, malignancy, and medications. The pathogenesis involves immune complex deposition in small blood vessels, leading to activation of the complement system and recruitment of leukocytes. Exacerbation of small-vessel vasculitis has been reported following the administration of various vaccines, particularly influenza vaccine. It is expected that SARS-CoV-2 vaccine results in the activation of B- and T-cells and antibody formation.

The Kenyan government embarked to fill capacity gaps in essential and advanced critical care (ACC) needed for the management of severe and critical COVID-19. However, given scarce resources, gaps in both essential and ACC persist. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of investments in essential and ACC to inform the prioritisation of investment decisions. METHODS: We employed a decision tree model to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of investment in essential care (EC) and investment in both essential and ACC (EC +ACC) compared with current healthcare provision capacity (status quo) for COVID-19 patients in Kenya. We used a health system perspective, and an inpatient care episode time horizon. Cost data were obtained from primary empirical analysis while outcomes data were obtained from epidemiological model estimates. We used univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The status quo option is more costly and less effective compared with investment in EC and is thus dominated by the later. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of investment in essential and ACC (EC+ACC) was US$1378.21 per disability-adjusted life-year averted and hence not a cost-effective strategy when compared with Kenyas cost-effectiveness threshold (US$908). CONCLUSION: When the criterion of cost-effectiveness is considered, and within the context of resource scarcity, Kenya will achieve better value for money if it prioritises investments in EC before investments in ACC.

Evidence suggests that mosquitoes have found a new alliance with the globalization of trade and climate change, leading to an upsurge of malaria parasite transmission around airports. The resulting locally acquired form of malaria is called Airport malaria. However, piecemeal information is available, regarding its epidemiological and entomological patterns, as well as the challenges in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Understanding these issues is a critical step towards a better implementation of control strategies. To cross reference this information, we conducted a systematic review on 135 research articles published between 1969 (when the first cases of malaria in airports were reported) and 2020 (i.e., 51 years later). It appears that the risk of malaria transmission by local mosquito vectors in so called malaria-free countries is not zero; this risk is more likely to be fostered by infected vectors coming from endemic countries by air or by sea. Furthermore, there is ample evidence that airport malaria is increasing in these countries. From 2010 to 2020, the number of cases in Europe was 7.4 times higher than that recorded during the 2000C2009 decade. This increase may be associated with climate change, increased international trade, the decline of aircraft disinsection, as well as delays in case diagnosis and treatment. More critically, current interventions are weakened by biological and operational challenges, such as drug resistance in malaria parasites and vector resistance to insecticides, and logistic constraints. Therefore, there is a need to strengthen malaria prevention and treatment for people at risk of airport malaria, and implement a rigorous routine entomological and epidemiological surveillance in and around airports.","output":"Airport Malaria in Non-Endemic Areas: New Insights into Mosquito Vectors, Case Management and Major Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19 declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization has become the present wellbeing worry to the whole world.

Patients will be 1:1 block-randomised by sex to either a supervised HIIT exercise group or standard care (control group). The main hypothesis is that a 12-week HIIT scheme is a safe way to improve loss of cardiac mass and associated cardiorespiratory fitness, despite hypothesised limited HIIT-induced changes in conventional lung function indices per se. Ultimately, we hypothesise that the HIIT scheme will reduce post-COVID-19 symptoms and improve quality of life.

Results There were 197 adult discharged patients with COVID-19 in this study. Statistical analysis indicated that the average age was 55.94 years, and female patients were 50.3%. Those patients mainly resided in urban with exposure history in 2 weeks. Fever, cough and weakness were the common symptoms. Leucocytes were mainly normal or decreased in 185 patents, both lymphocytes and eosinophils reduced, the ratios were 56.9% and 50.3%, respectively. On the contrary, lactate dehydrogenases raised in 65 patients. C-reactive protein elevated in the most of patients. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 63.5%. Chest CT indicated that bilateral patchy shadows were the most common imaging manifestations.169 patients recovered and transferred to a designated hospital for observation, and the others turned worst and died of acute respiratory failure. Conclusion COIVD-19 infection have become a life-threaten public health problem, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was limited. Chest CT scan was recommended for the suspected patients. Moreover, lymphocytopenia and eosinophils declining without leukocytes increasing may be considered as a useful evidence for the diagnosis.","output":"Clinical features and outcomes of 197 adult discharged patients with COVID-19 in Yichang, Hubei"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background It is increasingly recognized that childrens physical activity behaviors are shaped by neighborhood environment factors and their parents support. However, these factors have been scarcely studied among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a population at risk of inactivity. Objective This cross-sectional survey study was designed to examine how neighborhood environmental factors and parental support are related to physical activity levels of children with ASD. Also, this study examined if the relationship between the environment and physical activity is modified by demographic factors and COVID-19 related concerns. Methods An online survey was completed by parents of children with ASD aged 10 to 17 years. The questionnaire included items related to environmental factors (i.e., distance to school, distance to park, existence of sidewalks, walkability), parent support for physical activity (i.e., encouraging, watching, and providing transportation), childs physical activity, and demographic characteristics. The instrument also queried parental concerns about COVID-19 and their childs physical activity participation. Results The results indicate that proximity to a local park and to school is positively associated with physical activity. Parents encouraging behavior correlated with and predicted childrens physical activity levels. Also, higher levels of COVID-19 related concerns among parents were related to decreased physical activity supporting behaviors. Conclusions This study demonstrated that the neighborhood environment, in particular the distance between home and parks and schools, and parent support behavior are influential factors that may shape physical activity behaviors for children with ASD.","output":"Environmental and Social Determinants of Leisure-Time Physical Activity in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sin embargo, una sensacin de invulnerabilidad ha prevalecido en Occidente Como muestran dos historias recientes de pandemias, invariablemente es slo cuestin de tiempo antes de que un virus, bacteria u organismo parasitario salte de algunas especies no humanas a la nuestra Lejos de ser la reserva exclusiva de las sociedades \\"atrasadas\\", los brotes de enfermedades mortales son, en todo caso, un subproducto negativo del progreso humano Un ejemplo tpico fue la procesin al aire libre a un santuario sagrado en medio de rogaciones y confesiones, como las organizadas por los Flagelantes que viajaron por Europa antes de ser perseguidos por la Inquisicin","output":"Los asesinos invisibles *"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid19 pandemic has affected all sectors including academic institutions In countries like India, population is at peak and risk factor for infection is high if government allows to start the institute in full fledge It is stressful for students and researchers to work without any hardware support The goal of the paper is to help the academicians and researchers by looking into the system with new simulation techniques Various experiments related to embedded system are simulated and working is demonstrated through the help of online simulation tools All important analog interface sensors are demonstrated with this online tool Various issues occurred during simulations, block diagram, algorithms and results are also discussed By studying these issues students can able to learn the basic concepts and fundamentals related to interfacing devices and components with your embedded system As the simulation system is online The reliability and flexibility issues are also considered Simulation tool uses all virtual electronics components like analog and digital sensors, Controllers (Arduino), switches, LED and LCD displays and many more ? 2021 IEEE","output":"COVID19 remote engineering education: Learning of an embedded system with practical perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considerable evidence has demonstrated that gender influences interactions during in-person meetings, most commonly, negatively impacting women and persons of color.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of tocilizumab on the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia by using propensity-score-matching (PSM) analysis. Methods A retrospective observational analysis of hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients admitted to the Vall dHebron Hospital was performed between March and April 2020. We used the logistic regression to analyze the effect of tocilizumab on mortality, as main outcome, and PSM analysis to further validate their effect. Secondary outcomes were length-of-stay (LOS) and intensive-care-unit (ICU) stay. Same outcomes were also assessed for early tocilizumab administration, within 72 h after admission. Patients were selected by matching their individual propensity for receiving therapy with tocilizumab, conditional on their demographic and clinical variables. Results A total of 544 COVID-19 patients were included, 197 (36.2%) were treated with tocilizumab of whom 147 were treated within the first 72 h after admission;and 347 were included in the control group.

Articles of HOCI surveillance systems were included. Data describing HOCI definitions, HOCI incidence, types of HOCI identification surveillance systems, and level of system implementation were extracted. A total of 292 citations were identified. Nine studies on HOCI surveillance were included. Six studies reported on the proportion of HOCI among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which ranged from 0 to 15.2%. Six studies provided HOCI case definitions. Standardized national definitions provided by the UK and US governments were identified. Four studies included healthcare workers in the surveillance. One study articulated a multimodal strategy of infection prevention and control practices including HOCI surveillance. All identified HOCI surveillance systems were implemented at institutional level, with eight studies focusing on all hospital inpatients and one study focusing on patients in the emergency department. Multiple types of surveillance were identified. Four studies reported automated surveillance, of which one included real-time analysis, and one included genomic data. Overall, the study quality was limited by the observational nature with short follow-up periods. In conclusion, HOCI case definitions and surveillance methods were developed pragmatically.

Furthermore, we show that these results continue to hold even when the convex sub-problems are inexactly solved if the optimality gaps are uniformly summable against initialization. A key idea is to restrict the parameter search within a diminishing radius to promote stability of iterates. As an application, we provide an alternating least squares algorithm with diminishing radius for nonnegative CP tensor decomposition that converges to the stationary points of the reconstruction error with the same robust worst-case convergence rate and complexity bounds.

The CCV strains were: two ATCC reference strains, the Insavc-1 vaccine strain, the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (Ames, IA) challenge strain, and two California field isolates (UCD-1 and UCD-2) from the 1970s. All six strains, downstream of the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene, had sufficient size for an ORF 7b, and thus, none were transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-like since TGEV lacks ORF 7b. By sequence analysis of the variable domain at the 5 end of the S gene, five of the six CCV strains had a high degree of identity with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). However, one CCV field isolate (UCD-1) was different and had a high degree of identity with the 5 end of the TGEV S gene. This suggests that RNA recombination occurred at this site between antigenically related coronaviruses. The low passage field isolates, UCD-1 and UCD-2, varied in their initial infectivity for swine testicular cells suggesting that sequence differences in the variable domain of the S gene may account for biological variation among CCVs.","output":"The S gene of canine coronavirus, strain UCD-1, is more closely related to the S gene of transmissible gastroenteritis virus than to that of feline infectious peritonitis virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Newcastle disease (ND) has been defined by the World Organisation for Animal Health as infection of poultry with virulent strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Lesions affecting the neurological, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and reproductive systems are most often observed. The control of ND must include strict biosecurity that prevents virulent NDV from contacting poultry, and also proper administration of efficacious vaccines. When administered correctly to healthy birds, ND vaccines formulated with NDV of low virulence or viral-vectored vaccines that express the NDV fusion protein are able to prevent clinical disease and mortality in chickens upon infection with virulent NDV. Live and inactivated vaccines have been widely used since the 1950s. Recombinant and antigenically matched vaccines have been adopted recently in some countries, and many other vaccine approaches have been only evaluated experimentally. Despite decades of research and development towards formulation of an optimal ND vaccine, improvements are still needed. Impediments to prevent outbreaks include uneven vaccine application when using mass administration techniques in larger commercial settings, the difficulties associated with vaccinating free-roaming, multi-age birds of village flocks, and difficulties maintaining the cold chain to preserve the thermo-labile antigens in the vaccines. Incomplete or improper immunization often results in the disease and death of poultry after infection with virulent NDV. Another cause of decreased vaccine efficacy is the existence of antibodies (including maternal) in birds, which can neutralize the vaccine and thereby reduce the effectiveness of ND vaccines.

On a subset of the subjects that underwent bronchoscopy, we also quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral load, analyzed the microbiome of the lower airways by metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses and profiled the host immune response.

However, poor clinical outcome was associated with enrichment of the lower airway microbiota with an oral commensal ( Mycoplasma salivarium ), while high SARS-CoV-2 viral burden, poor anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response, together with a unique host transcriptome profile of the lower airways were most predictive of mortality.

Like several other viruses, LDV causes widespread and very rapid but transient activation of both B cells and T cells in lymphoid tissues and the blood. The mechanism of this activation has not been fully described and is the focus of the current studies. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A known inducer of early lymphocyte activation is IFN, a cytokine strongly induced by LDV infection. Neutralization of IFN in the plasma from infected mice ablated its ability to activate lymphocytes in vitro. Since the primary source of virus-induced IFN in vivo is often plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC's), we depleted these cells prior to LDV infection and tested for lymphocyte activation. Depletion of pDC's in vivo eradicated both the LDV-induced IFN response and lymphocyte activation. A primary receptor in pDC's for single stranded RNA viruses such as LDV is the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) pattern recognition receptor. Infection of TLR7-knockout mice revealed that both the IFN response and lymphocyte activation were dependent on TLR7 signaling in vivo. Interestingly, virus levels in both TLR7 knockout mice and pDC-depleted mice were indistinguishable from controls indicating that LDV is largely resistant to the systemic IFN response. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that LDV-induced activation of lymphocytes is due to recognition of LDV nucleic acid by TLR7 pattern recognition receptors in pDC's that respond with a lymphocyte-inducing IFN response.","output":"Lactate Dehydrogenase-Elevating Virus Induces Systemic Lymphocyte Activation via TLR7-Dependent IFN Responses by Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing development of liquid-phase electron microscopy methods-in which specimens are kept fully solvated in the microscope by encapsulation in transparent, vacuum-tight chambers-is making it possible to investigate a wide variety of nanoscopic dynamic phenomena at the single-particle level, and with nanometer to atomic resolution.

Two diagnostic entities are distinguished within PDOC: unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS, previously known as vegetative state) and minimally conscious state (MCS). Patients with PDOC may benefit from early intensive neurorehabilitation (EIN). In the Netherlands, the EIN programme is provided by one designated expert rehabilitation centre and forms the starting point of a dedicated chain of specialised rehabilitation and care for this group. This study project, called DOCTOR: Disorders of Consciousness; Treatment and Outcomes Registry, sets up a registry and systematically investigates multiple short- and long-term outcomes of patients with PDOC who receive EIN. METHODS: Single-centre prospective cohort study with a 2-year follow-up period. Patients with PDOC due to acute brain injury who receive EIN, aged 16 years and older are included. Measurements will take place at start EIN, in week 5, 10, and at discharge from the EIN programme (duration = max 14 weeks) and at week 28, 40, 52, and 104 after admission to the EIN programme, following patients through the health-care chain. Outcome measures are the changes over time in level of consciousness, using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised; the frequency and type of medical complications; the mortality rate; level of disability, including the level of motor, cognitive, behavioural and emotional functioning; participation; and quality of life. Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy of caregivers, caregivers strain and cost-effectiveness of the programme. DISCUSSION: The DOCTOR study will provide insight in the recovery patterns and predictors of recovery for multiple outcomes in PDOC patients after following EIN. The results of the study will enable us to benchmark and improve EIN and the organisation of the health-care chain, both for patients with PDOC and for their families.

Aims and Objectives: To study the effect of Remdesivir on Selective biomarkers namely C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), Serum Ferritin and D-dimer and their value in predicting the clinical outcome in patients with COVID-19 infection. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective observational study including 102 laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 patients of moderate and severe category who were subjected to complete blood count, liver function test, BUN, creatinine, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, serum ferritin, ECG, and chest X-ray. The association was analyzed using independent sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test. Patients were divided into two groups. Both received corticosteroids and anticoagulants. Group A also received remdesivir. Results: Of the 102 patients, 90.2% of the patients in the non-remdesivir group and 94.1% in the remdesivir group were discharged. The mortality rate was 9.8% in the non-remdesivir group versus 5.9% in the remdesivir group (P=0.71). There was no statistically significant difference in the decrease of the inflammatory markers overtime in both the groups, irrespective of whether they received remdesivir or not. Conclusion: High values of the inflammatory markers were seen at the time of admission. A 5 days course of remdesivir failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the decrease in the levels of the inflammatory markers. However, we have observed a possible clinical benefit of remdesivir among patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 disease, as there was a trend toward better clinical outcomes.

However, systematic reports of perspectives from patients in vulnerable communities regarding barriers are limited. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To better understand barriers, focus groups were conducted in Florida and California with adults 18 years old with type 1 diabetes with selection criteria including hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis, HbA(1c) >9%, and/or receiving care at a Federally Qualified Health Center. Sixteen focus groups were conducted in English or Spanish with 86 adults (mean age 42  16.2 years). Transcript themes and preCfocus group demographic survey data were analyzed. In order of frequency, barriers to diabetes technology and endocrinology care included 1) provider level (negative provider encounters), 2) system level (financial coverage), and 3) individual level (preferences). RESULTS: Over 50% of participants had not seen an endocrinologist in the past year or were only seen once including during hospital visits. In Florida, there was less technology use overall (38% used CGMs in FL and 63% in CA; 43% used pumps in FL and 69% in CA) and significant differences in pump use by SES (P = 0.02 in FL; P = 0.08 in CA) and race/ethnicity (P = 0.01 in FL; P = 0.80 in CA). In California, there were significant differences in CGM use by race/ethnicity (P = 0.05 in CA; P = 0.56 in FL) and education level (P = 0.02 in CA; P = 0.90 in FL).

They were especially confronted with several challenges regarding what medical training should look like and how to transfer medical training to integrate relevant skills like interpersonal or practical competencies. This study aimed to investigate the teachers perspectives on medical education and COVID-19 in general, including their distress level. Methods: This quantitative questionnaire study was distributed online among responsible lecturers of medical training at the Medical Faculty of Tuebingen. Teachers answered questions about the medical training, COVID-19 in general (on a seven point- Likert scale from not at all to completely) and their mental well-being (STAI). Descriptive data analysis and t-tests were performed. Results: The teachers reported being significantly (p<.01) more distressed regarding the medical training (M=4.63, SD=1.24) in comparison to their private lives (M=3.58, SD=1.38) or the clinical context (M=3.33, SD=1.95). They also felt significantly less informed about the medical training in times of COVID-19 (p<.001). They wished for more support and information from their medical faculty. When teachers were asked which teaching should be implemented in future, they reported the most the online lectures (87.5%), followed by collaborative working (75.5%), live broadcast (62.5%) and online chats (58.3%). Teachers also saw the current situation of COVID-19 as a chance for a digital transformation of the medical education (M=5.92, SD=0.95). Discussion: Teachers of the Medical Faculty of Tuebingen saw online-based teaching formats as a chance to meet the medical students needs regarding the medical education. Video-based formats like online lecturers and online chats with teachers might play a relevant role in order to impart knowledge. Furthermore, medical students should also be taught in digital formats like telehealth, including patient-physician distance interactions.","output":"Medical education in times of COVID-19: survey on teachers' perspectives from a German medical faculty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientific success is mainly supported by mentoring, which often occurs through face-to-face interactions.

Contextual factors such as living in a high-risk area might further increase the risk of health deterioration. Based on the Social Identity Approach, we argue that social identities can not only be local that are characterized by social interactions, but also be global that are characterized by a symbolic sense of togetherness and that both of these can be a basis for health. In line with these ideas, we tested how identification with one's family and with humankind relates to stress and physical symptoms while experiencing health-related anxiety and being exposed to contextual risk factors. We tested our assumptions in a representative sample (N = 974) two-wave survey study with a 4-week time lag. The results show that anxiety at Time 1 was positively related to stress and physical symptoms at Time 2. Feeling exposed to risk factors related to lower physical health, but was unrelated to stress. Family identification and identification with humankind were both negatively associated with subsequent stress and family identification was negatively associated with subsequent physical symptoms.

SFTSV was first isolated from patients who presented with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and multiorgan dysfunction in China. Subsequently, it was found to be widely distributed in Southeast Asia (Korea, Japan, and Vietnam). SFTSV can be transmitted not only from ticks but also from domestic animals, companion animals, and humans. Because the case fatality rate of SFTS is high (6C30%), development of specific and effective treatment for SFTS is required. Studies of potential antiviral drugs for SFTS-specific therapy have been conducted on existing or newly discovered agents in vitro and in vivo, with ribavirin and favipiravir being the most promising candidates. While animal experiments and retrospective studies have demonstrated the limited efficacy of ribavirin, it was also speculated that ribavirin would be effective in patients with a viral load <1  10(6) copies/mL. Favipiravir showed higher efficacy than ribavirin against SFTSV in in vitro assays and greater efficacy in animal models, even administrated 3 days after the virus inoculation. Although clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in SFTS patients in Japan are underway, this has yet to be confirmed. Other drugs, including hexachlorophene, calcium channel blockers, 2-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine, caffeic acid, amodiaquine, and interferons, have also been evaluated for their inhibitory efficacy against SFTSV. Among them, calcium channel blockers are promising because in addition to their efficacy in vitro and in vivo, retrospective clinical data have indicated that nifedipine, one of the calcium channel blockers, reduced the case fatality rate by >5-fold. Although further research is necessary to develop SFTS-specific therapy, considerable progress has been achieved in this area.

Social distancing measures complicate regular care and result in lifestyle changes, which may indirectly cause psychological stress and worsening of PD symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased psychological distress and decreased physical activity in PD, how these changes related to PD motor and non-motor symptom severity, and what frequency and burden of COVID-related stressors were. METHODS: We sent an online survey to the Personalized Parkinson Project (PPP) cohort (na=a498 PD patients) in the Netherlands. In the survey, we distinguished between COVID-related stressor load, psychological distress, PD symptom severity, and physical activity. We related inter-individual differences to personality factors and clinical factors collected before the pandemic occurred. RESULTS: 358 PD patients completed the survey between April 21 and May 25, 2020 (response rate 71.9%). Patients with higher COVID-related stressor load experienced more PD symptoms, and this effect was mediated by the degree of psychological distress. 46.6% of PD patients were less physically active since the COVID-19 pandemic, and reduced physical activity correlated with worse PD symptoms. Symptoms that worsened most were rigidity, fatigue, tremor, pain and concentration. Presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression) before the pandemic, as well as cognitive dysfunction and several personality traits predicted increased psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This research traces and reports analyses of those policy measures and their evolution in four Chinese cities: Zhengzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai and Chengdu. The theoretical framework stems from conceptualisations of urban governance and its role in public health emergencies, wherein crisis management and emergency response are highlighted. In all four cities, the trend curves of cumulative diagnosed cases, critical policies launched in key time nodes and local governance approaches in the first wave were identified and compared. The findings suggest that capable local leadership is indispensable for controlling the coronavirus epidemic, yet local governments? approaches are varied, contributing to dissimilar local epidemic control policy pathways and positive outcomes in the fight against COVID-19. The effectiveness of disease control is determined by how local governments? measures have adapted to geospatial and socioeconomic heterogeneity. The coordinated actions from central to local governments also reveal an efficient, top-down command transmission and execution system for coping with the pandemic.

Low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (also known as 'low-carb diets') continue to be widely promoted, marketed and commercialised as being more effective for weight loss, and healthier, than 'balanced'-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets to weight-reducing diets with balanced ranges of carbohydrates, in relation to changes in weight and cardiovascular risk, in overweight and obese adults without and with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection (Clarivate Analytics), ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 25 June 2021, and screened reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. Language or publication restrictions were not applied. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (18 years+) who were overweight or living with obesity, without or with T2DM, and without or with cardiovascular conditions or risk factors. Trials had to compare low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets to balanced-carbohydrate (45% to 65% of total energy (TE)) weight-reducing diets, have a weight-reducing phase of 2 weeks or longer and be explicitly implemented for the primary purpose of reducing weight, with or without advice to restrict energy intake. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and full-text articles to determine eligibility; and independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias using RoB 2 and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We stratified analyses by participants without and with T2DM, and by diets with weight-reducing phases only and those with weight-reducing phases followed by weight-maintenance phases. Primary outcomes were change in body weight (kg) and the number of participants per group with weight loss of at least 5%, assessed at short- (three months to < 12 months) and long-term ( 12 months) follow-up. MAIN RESULTS: We included 61 parallel-arm RCTs that randomised 6925 participants to either low-carbohydrate or balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets. All trials were conducted in high-income countries except for one in China. Most participants (n = 5118 randomised) did not have T2DM. Mean baseline weight across trials was 95 kg (range 66 to 132 kg). Participants with T2DM were older (mean 57 years, range 50 to 65) than those without T2DM (mean 45 years, range 22 to 62). Most trials included men and women (42/61; 3/19 men only; 16/19 women only), and people without baseline cardiovascular conditions, risk factors or events (36/61). Mean baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol across trials were within normal ranges. The longest weight-reducing phase of diets was two years in participants without and with T2DM. Evidence from studies with weight-reducing phases followed by weight-maintenance phases was limited. Most trials investigated low-carbohydrate diets (> 50 g to 150 g per day or < 45% of TE; n = 42), followed by very low ( 50 g per day or < 10% of TE; n = 14), and then incremental increases from very low to low (n = 5). The most common diets compared were low-carbohydrate, balanced-fat (20 to 35% of TE) and high-protein (> 20% of TE) treatment diets versus control diets balanced for the three macronutrients (24/61). In most trials (45/61) the energy prescription or approach used to restrict energy intake was similar in both groups. We assessed the overall risk of bias of outcomes across trials as predominantly high, mostly from bias due to missing outcome data. Using GRADE, we assessed the certainty of evidence as moderate to very low across outcomes. Participants without and with T2DM lost weight when following weight-reducing phases of both diets at the short (range: 12.2 to 0.33 kg) and long term (range: 13.1 to 1.7 kg). In overweight and obese participants without T2DM: low-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets compared to balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (weight-reducing phases only) probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight over three to 8.5 months (mean difference (MD) -1.07 kg, (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.55 to -0.59, I2 = 51%, 3286 participants, 37 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence) and over one to two years (MD -0.93 kg, 95% CI -1.81 to -0.04, I2 = 40%, 1805 participants, 14 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence); as well as change in DBP and LDL cholesterol over one to two years.

METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of adult COVID-19 hospitalized patients admitted in March 2020. We reported their demographic and clinical characteristics using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of 40 patients admitted, 23 (57.5%) were male and 19 (47.5%) were aged <60 years. Most (n = 27, 67.5%) had moderate-risk, 9 (22.5%) had high-risk, and 4 (10%) had low-risk COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 testing took 5.5 (range 1C10) days. Overall mortality rate was 6/40 (15.0%). Clinical cure was documented in all low-risk patients, 25 (92.6%) moderate-risk patients, and only 1 (11.1%) high-risk patient. In response to the surge, the hospital rapidly introduced one-way traffic systems, dedicated screening, triage and Emergency Department areas for COVID-19, a clinical pathway, engineering controls, patient cohorting, and strict infection prevention and control measures. CONCLUSION: Majority of patients recovered from COVID-19. Older age and high-risk pneumonia were associated with poor outcomes.

More specifically, we question the standard assumption in the literature on epidemiological models, where the incidence rate dictating propagation of infections is taken to be proportional to the product between the infected and susceptible sub-populations; a model that relies on strong mixing between the two groups and widespread contact between members of the groups. We contend, that contact between infected and susceptible individuals, especially during the early phases of an epidemic, takes place over a (possibly diffused) boundary between the respective sub-populations. As a result, the rate of transmission depends on the product of fractional powers instead. The intuition relies on the fact that infection grows in geographically concentrated cells, in contrast to the standard product model that relies on complete mixing of the susceptible to infected sub-populations. We validate the hypothesis of fractional exponents (1) by numerical simulation for disease propagation in graphs imposing a local structure to allowed disease transmissions and (2) by fitting the model to the JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data for the period Jan-22-20 to April-30-20, for the countries of Italy, Germany, France, and Spain.","output":"Fractional SIR epidemiological models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endotracheal intubation poses high risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens.

Initial excitement was often followed by disappointment as we learned more about the limited longevity of minimally invasive procedures and complications arising from various suture designs of the past. Some of the early designs, developed primarily for use in aesthetic facial procedures, included free-floating, bidirectionally barbed, nonabsorbable sutures; unidirectional barbed, nonabsorbable sutures; anchored, bidirectional, nonabsorbable double-threaded sutures; and a technology combining a nonabsorbable knotted thread and absorbable cones. More recently, a new, absorbable, unidirectional barbed suture design has become available. However, it should be noted that very limited data are available for any of the modified suture designs used in this field, and much of what has been published is based on the experience of a single user.

However, there is still a lack of an appropriate cell-based HTS specific for migratory cancer cells. In the study presented here, we created a novel assay (mHTS): a single-cell-level screening method targeting migratory cancer cells and can be applied in a high-throughput manner. This mHTS platform is based on microchannel devices (providing physical confinement during cell migration and limit migrating cells' proliferation rate) assembled 96-well plate (fitting to HTS manner). To determine the feasibility of this assay, we quantified the anti-migratory and anti-viability effects of several molecules (Cytochalasin D, Doxorubicin and AZD-6244) on migrating (creeping inside microchannel) glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells. After analyzing migration screening data that was collected on a single-cell-level, we were able to compare those drug's effects on cancer cells' migration velocity and uncovered the migration inhibiting potential of AZD (500nM and 1000nM). Viability data based on single-cell-level screening also allowed us to further understand the same drug's different lethality toward migrating and normal 2D cultured cancer cells. The Pre-classification of subpopulations enables us to study the heterogeneity of cancer and ensures our method's feasibility for a high-throughput manner.

There are several factors involved in the epidemic spreading, such as the individual characteristics of each city/country. The true shape of the epidemic dynamics is a large, complex system, considerably hard to predict. In this context, Complex networks are a great candidate for analyzing these systems due to their ability to tackle structural and dynamic properties. Therefore, this study presents a new approach to model the COVID-19 epidemic using a multi-layer complex network, where nodes represent people, edges are social contacts, and layers represent different social activities. The model improves the traditional SIR, and it is applied to study the Brazilian epidemic considering data up to 05/26/2020, and analyzing possible future actions and their consequences. The network is characterized using statistics of infection, death, and hospitalization time. To simulate isolation, social distancing, or precautionary measures, we remove layers and reduce social contacts intensity. Results show that even taking various optimistic assumptions, the current isolation levels in Brazil still may lead to a critical scenario for the healthcare system and a considerable death toll (average of 149,000). If all activities return to normal, the epidemic growth may suffer a steep increase, and the demand for ICU beds may surpass three times the countrys capacity. This situation would surely lead to a catastrophic scenario, as our estimation reaches an average of 212,000 deaths, even considering that all cases are effectively treated. The increase of isolation (up to a lockdown) shows to be the best option to keep the situation under the healthcare system capacity, aside from ensuring a faster decrease of new case occurrences (months of difference), and a significantly smaller death toll (average of 87,000).","output":"Social interaction layers in complex networks for the dynamical epidemic modeling of COVID-19 in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging and re-emerging viruses periodically cause outbreaks and epidemics all over the world, eventually leading to global events such as the current pandemic of the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection COVID-19.

Descriptive statistics for each variable were reported. A comparison of each covariate between the study cohorts was assessed in univariate and multivariate analysis. Cox proportional models were used to calculate hazard ratios. Additionally, the propensity score matching method was implemented to reduce treatment selection bias. RESULTS: Patients with triple-negative apocrine tumors were more likely to be older, Caucasian, and have smaller, moderately to well-differentiated tumors. Multivariable analysis noted a significantly improved survival for patients with triple-negative apocrine carcinoma (TNAC) vs triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma (TNBC) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.65 [95% confidence interval [CI] [0.53-0.81], P = 0 < .001). Propensity score matching analysis confirmed a significant difference in overall survival for patients with TNAC in comparison to TNBC (HR 0.79 [95% CI [0.63-1.00], P = .05). DISCUSSION: Triple-negative apocrine adenocarcinomas have a modestly improved long-term survival when compared with triple-negative invasive ductal cancers.","output":"Triple-negative apocrine carcinoma: A rare pathologic subtype with a better prognosis than other triple-negative breast cancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and bone mineral density (BMD) is poorly elucidated and has contradictory findings.

The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) COVID Registry was created to compare peripartum outcomes and anesthetic utilization in women with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection delivering at institutions with widespread testing. METHODS: Deliveries from 14 U.S. medical centers, March 19-May 31, 2020, were included. Peripartum infection was defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test within 14 days of delivery. Consecutive SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with randomly selected control patients were sampled (1:2 ratio) with controls delivering during the same day without a positive test. Outcomes were obstetric (e.g., delivery mode, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, delivery < 37 weeks), an adverse neonatal outcome composite measure (primary), and anesthetic utilization (e.g., neuraxial labor analgesia and anesthesia). Outcomes were analyzed using generalized estimating equations to account for clustering within centers. Sensitivity analyses compared symptomatic and asymptomatic patients to controls. RESULTS: 1454 peripartum women were included: 490 with SARS-CoV-2 infection [176 (35.9%) symptomatic]; 964 controls. SARS-CoV-2 patients were slightly younger, more likely non-nulliparous, non-white, and Hispanic than controls. They were more likely to have diabetes, obesity, or cardiac disease and less likely to have autoimmune disease. After adjustment for confounders, individuals experiencing SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited an increased risk for delivery < 37 weeks gestation compared to controls, 73 (14.8%) vs. 98 (10.2%) [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.47 95% CI (1.03-2.09)]. Effect estimates for other obstetric outcomes and the neonatal composite outcome measure were not meaningfully different between SARS-CoV-2-patients versus controls. In sensitivity analyses, compared to controls, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients exhibited: increases in cesarean delivery [aOR: 1.57 95% CI (1.09-2.27)]; postpartum length of stay [aOR 1.89 95% CI (1.18-2.60)]; delivery < 37 weeks gestation [aOR 2.08 95% CI (1.29-3.36)]. These adverse outcomes were not found in asymptomatic women versus controls. SARS-CoV-2 patients (asymptomatic and symptomatic) were less likely to receive neuraxial labor analgesia [aOR: 0.52 95% CI (0.35-0.75)] and more likely to receive general anesthesia for cesarean delivery [aOR: 3.69 95% CI (1.40-9.74)] due to maternal respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, multicenter U.S. cohort study of women with and without peripartum SARS-CoV-2 infection, differences in obstetric and neonatal outcomes seem to be mostly driven by symptomatic patients. Lower utilization of neuraxial analgesia in laboring patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic infection compared to patients without infection requires further investigation.","output":"The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) COVID-19 Registry: An analysis of outcomes among pregnant women delivering during the initial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 vaccines currently approved in the United States require two doses, administered three to four weeks apart. Constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity, together with the rise of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, have sparked a policy debate on whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose, or to continue with the recommended two-dose series as tested in clinical trials. We developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission to compare the impact of these two vaccination strategies, while varying the temporal waning of vaccine efficacy against disease following the first dose, vaccine efficacy against infection, and the level of pre-existing immunity in the population. Our results show that for Moderna vaccines with 80% efficacy following the first dose, a delay of 9C12 weeks could enhance the program effectiveness and prevent additional infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, compared to a 4-week interval between the doses. However, for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines with demonstrated efficacy of 52% after the first dose, there was no clear advantage for delaying the second dose beyond the 3-week tested schedule, unless the efficacy of the first dose did not wane over time.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 250 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. RT-PCR was used to detect influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial viruses. Chemiluminescence immunoassays were used to detect IgM antibodies for adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in the serum of patients. Based on these results, we divided the patients into two groups, the simple SARS-CoV-2-infected group and the coinfected SARS-COV-2 group. Coinfected patients were then further categorized as having a coinfection of viral pathogen (CoIV) or coinfection of atypical bacterial pathogen (CoIaB). RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found in age, gender, the time taken to return negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results, length of hospital stays, and mortality between the simple SARS-CoV-2 infection group and the coinfection group. Of the 250 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 39 (15.6%) tested positive for at least one respiratory pathogen in addition to SARS-CoV-2. A third of these pathogens were detected as early as the 1st week after symptom onset and another third were identified after more than three weeks. The most detected CAP pathogen was C. pneumoniae (5.2%), followed by the respiratory syncytial virus (4.8%), M. pneumoniae (4.4%) and adenovirus (2.8%). Patients coinfected with viral pathogens (CoIV) (n=18) had longer hospital stays when compared to patients coinfected with atypical bacterial pathogens (CoIaB) (n=21). Except for one fatality, the remaining 38 coinfected patients all recovered with favourable outcomes. CONCLUSION: Coinfections in COVID-19 patients are common.

These strategies, namely, prioritized, random, follow links and contact tracing, are compared across networks using extensive simulations with disease parameters relevant for viruses such as pandemic influenza H1N1/09. Two scenarios for a network SIR model are considered. First, a model with a given transmission rate is studied. Second, a model with a given initial growth rate is considered, because the initial growth rate is commonly used to impute the transmission rate from incidence curves and to predict the course of an epidemic. Since a vaccine may not be readily available for a new virus, the case of a delay in the start of vaccination is also considered in addition to the case of no delay. It is found that network topology can have a larger impact on the spread of the disease than the choice of vaccination strategy. Simulations also show that the network structure has a large effect on both the course of an epidemic and the determination of the transmission rate from the initial growth rate. The effect of delay in the vaccination start time varies tremendously with network topology. Results show that, without the knowledge of network topology, predictions on the peak and the final size of an epidemic cannot be made solely based on the initial exponential growth rate or transmission rate. This demonstrates the importance of understanding the topology of realistic contact networks when evaluating vaccination strategies.","output":"The importance of contact network topology for the success of vaccination strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context Most medical doctors are likely to work with patients experiencing mental health conditions.

Despite TND's potential to reduce unobserved differences in healthcare seeking behavior (HSB) between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects, it remains subject to various potential biases. First, residual confounding bias may remain due to unobserved HSB, occupation as healthcare worker, or previous infection history. Second, because selection into the TND sample is a common consequence of infection and HSB, collider stratification bias may exist when conditioning the analysis on testing, which further induces confounding by latent HSB.

We retrospectively evaluated all patients presenting with syncope during a 6-month period to the local emergency department, collecting incidence of syncopal cases associated with APDs, personal information, clinical features, and laboratory abnormalities, which were compared between syncopal patients with or without APDs. A syncope-associated APD could be diagnosed in 346/1279 patients (27.1%). In the majority of cases, the cause was a non-cardiovascular acute condition (67%), mostly non-life-threatening such as infectious diseases (34.4%) and acute diseases with pain, fluid loss or hypotension (23.7%).

However, their acceptance is only partial, with vaccine hesitancy and refusal representing a major health threat. Influenza vaccines have low compliance since repeated, annual vaccination is required. Influenza vaccines stimulate discussions both in the real world and online. Social media is currently a significant source of health and medical information. Elucidating the association between social media engagement and influenza vaccination is important and may be applicable to other vaccines, including ones against COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to characterize profiles of social media engagement regarding the influenza vaccine and their association with knowledge and compliance in order to support improvement of future web-associated vaccination campaigns. METHODS: A weblink to an online survey in Hebrew was disseminated over social media and messaging platforms. The survey answers were collected during April 2020. Anonymous and volunteer participants aged 21 years and over answered 30 questions related to sociodemographics; social media usage; influenza- and vaccine-related knowledge and behavior; health-related information searching, its reliability, and its influence; and COVID-19-related information searching. A univariate descriptive data analysis was performed, followed by multivariate analysis via building a decision tree to define the most important attributes associated with vaccination compliance. RESULTS: A total of 213 subjects responded to the survey, of whom 207 were included in the analysis; the majority of the respondents were female, were aged 21 to 40 years, had 1 to 2 children, lived in central Israel, were secular Israeli natives, had higher education, and had a salary close to the national average. Most respondents (128/207, 61.8%) were not vaccinated against influenza in 2019 and used social media. Participants that used social media were younger, secular, and living in high-density agglomerations and had lower influenza vaccination rates. The perceived influence and reliability of the information on social media about COVID-19 were generally similar to those perceptions about influenza. CONCLUSIONS: Using social media is negatively linked to compliance with seasonal influenza vaccination in this study. A high proportion of noncompliant individuals can lead to increased consumption of health care services and can, therefore, overload these health services. This is particularly crucial with a concomitant outbreak, such as COVID-19. Health care professionals should use improved and targeted health communication campaigns with the aid of experts in social media. Targeted communication, based on sociodemographic factors and personalized social media usage, might increase influenza vaccination rates and compliance with other vaccines as well.","output":"Social Media Engagement and Influenza Vaccination During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function.

Approach and Results: We searched the database of the SARS-RAS study (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04331574), a cross-sectional observational multicenter nationwide survey in Italy designed by the Italian Society of Hypertension. The database counts 2,377 charts of Italian COVID-19 patients in 26 hospitals. We calculated the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), which is associated with death in COVID-19 patients. In our population (n = 2,377, age 68.2  0.4 years, CCI: 3.04  0.04), we confirm that CCI is associated with increased mortality [OR: 1.756 (1.628-1.894)], admission to intensive care units [ICU;OR: 1.074 (1.017-1.134)], and combined hard events [CHE;OR: 1.277 (1.215-1.342)]. One hundred twenty-five patients were on cOACs (age: 79.3  0.9 years, CCI: 4.35  0.13);despite the higher CCI, cOACs patients presented with a lower risk of admissions to the ICU [OR 0.469 (0.250-0.880)] but not of death [OR: 1.306 (0.78-2.188)] or CHE [OR: 0.843 (0.541-1.312)]. In multivariable logistic regression, cOACs confirmed their protective effect on ICU admission and CHE. The CCI remains the most important risk factor for ICU admission, death, and CHE. Conclusions: Our data support a mechanism for the continuation of cOAC therapy after hospital admission for those patients who are on chronic treatment. Our preliminary results suggest the prophylactic use of direct cOACs in patients with elevated CCI score at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic even in absence of other risks of thromboembolism.","output":"Preexisting Oral Anticoagulant Therapy Ameliorates Prognosis in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines have been seen as the most important solution for ending the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic.

They received two doses of inactivated virus vaccine (CoronaVac). Serum samples were prospectively collected three times (Days 0, 28, 56). We measured SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 IgGsp antibodies quantitatively and neutralizing antibodies. After the first dose, antibody responses did not develop in 64.8% of the participants without prior COVID\\\\19 infection. All participants had developed antibody responses after the second dose. We observed that IgGsp antibody titers elicited by a single vaccine dose in participants with prior COVID\\\\19 infection were higher than after two doses of vaccine in participants without prior infection (geometric mean titer: 898 and 607 AU/ml). IgGsp antibodies, participants with prior COVID\\\\19 infection had higher antibody levels as geometric mean titers at all time points (p < 0.001). We also found a positive correlation between IgGsp antibody titers and neutralizing capacity (r (s) = 0.697, p < 0.001). Although people without prior COVID\\\\19 infection should complete their vaccination protocol, the adequacy of a single dose of vaccine is still in question for individuals with prior COVID\\\\19.

Design A cross-sectional, online survey was used. Setting and Participants All employees among six nursing homes in southwestern France (N=455) were solicited between November, 2020 and June, 2021. Methods The survey instrument was developed within the World Mental Health consortium to screen for COVID-related fears, probable generalized anxiety, panic attacks, depression, post-traumatic stress and substance use disorders in the past 30 days. Results The survey was completed by 127 workers (89.0% female, mean age = 43.42 years, SD=11.29), yielding a 28.5% response rate. Overall, 48.03% reported experiencing fear of infecting others at least most of the time. One in eight (14.96%) indicated that close others feared being infected by them. One third of the sample (34.65%) met criteria for at least one probable current mental disorder. Panic attacks (22.05%) were the most frequently-reported mental health problem, followed by depression (16.54%). In multivariate analyses, the only factor associated with having a current probable mental disorder was the presence of any pre-pandemic mental health problem (AOR=4.76, 95%CI=2.08-10.89). Type of employment contract, full-time status, or medical vs non-medical staff status were not significantly associated with mental health status. Conclusions and Implications The study reveals that one third of nursing home workers in the sample report current probable mental disorders, and these were largely associated with pre-pandemic mental health status.

The authors have used this approach for several thoracic surgical procedures. METHODS This prospective study compared 20 cases between standard three-port video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and the single-incision approach using a standard abdominal SILS system. In both groups, postsurgical analgesia was provided with 15 ml of bupivacaine 0.5% at 3 h intervals via a paravertebral catheter. The hospital length of stay and chest drain duration (in hours) were recorded as well as postoperative pain using an analogic visual pain scale (AVPS). A telephone survey was conducted for all the outpatients. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS This study of 20 procedures included 11 lung biopsies, 6 pneumothorax procedures, 2 mediastinic cystectomies, and 1 catamenial pneumothorax procedure. No statistically significant difference was reported in hospital length of stay or chest drain duration between the two groups. However, postoperative pain at 24 h was significantly less in the SILS group (AVPS, 4.40) than in the VATS group (AVPS, 6.20) (p = 0.035). The SILS group reported two minor surgical wound complications and one catamenial pneumothorax recurrence that did not require drainage. The VATS group reported one case of skin rash with no identifiable cause. CONCLUSIONS The use of the SILS port in thoracic surgery results in less postoperative pain. This is related to the port's protective effect over the periostium and the intercostal nerve, relieving them of direct contact with surgical instruments. However, the findings showed a higher incidence of surgical wound complications with the SILS port, which can be attributed to increased pressure on the skin and soft tissues surrounding the port and to the fact that this same incision was used for chest drain placement, thus increasing the risk for complications.","output":"A prospective study comparing three-port video-assisted thoracoscopy with the single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) port and instruments for the video thoracoscopic approach: a pilot study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is speculated to increase the likelihood of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) exacerbation.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compares the risk of relapse in RRMS patients with (n=56) and without COVID-19 (n=69). Incidence of relapse was recorded for six-month following contraction of COVID-19. Incidence of RRMS exacerbation in patients with COVID-19 was compared to patients without COVID-19 (the independent control group) and the same patients six months prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A lower incidence rate of RRMS exacerbation was observed in patients that contracted COVID-19 than in patients who did not contract COVID-19 (incidence rate ratio: 0.275; p=0.026). Self-controlled analysis showed no significant difference in relapse rates before the COVID-19 pandemic and after contracting COVID-19 (p=0.222).

RESULTS: Wide-ranging prevalence estimates (6% to 33%) across different dimensions of burnout were reported for 22 177 GPs across 29 countries were reported for 60 studies included in this review. Mean burnout estimates were: 16.43 for emotional exhaustion; 6.74 for depersonalisation; and 29.28 for personal accomplishment. Subgroup and meta-analyses documented that country-specific factors may be important determinants of the variation in GP burnout estimates. Moderate overall burnout cut-offs were found to be determinants of the variation in moderate overall burnout estimates. CONCLUSION: Moderate to high GP burnout exists worldwide.

Here we aim to investigate the importance of spillover transmission for explaining the number and the size of outbreaks. We propose a simple continuous time stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model with a recurrent infection of an incidental host from a reservoir (e.g. humans by a zoonotic species), considering two modes of transmission, (1) animal-to-human and (2) human-to-human. The model assumes that (i) epidemiological processes are faster than other processes such as demographics or pathogen evolution and that (ii) an epidemic occurs until there are no susceptible individuals left. The results show that during an epidemic, even when the pathogens are barely contagious, multiple outbreaks are observed due to spillover transmission.

Here, PM(2.5) pollution during the COVID-19 lockdown was traced and analyzed to clarify the sources and factors influencing PM(2.5) in Guangzhou, with an emphasis on heavy pollution. The lockdown led to large reductions in industrial and traffic emissions, which significantly reduced PM(2.5) concentrations in Guangzhou. Interestingly, the trend of PM(2.5) concentrations was not consistent with traffic and industrial emissions, as minimum concentrations were observed in the fourth period (3/01-3/31, 22.45 g?m(?3)) of the lockdown. However, the concentrations of other gaseous pollutants, e.g., SO(2), NO(2) and CO, were correlated with industrial and traffic emissions, and the lowest values were noticed in the second period (1/24-2/03) of the lockdown. Meteorological correlation analysis revealed that the decreased PM(2.5) concentrations during COVID-19 can be mainly attributed to decreased industrial and traffic emissions rather than meteorological conditions. When meteorological factors were included in the PM(2.5) composition and backward trajectory analyses, we found that long-distance transportation and secondary pollution offset the reduction of primary emissions in the second and third stages of the pandemic.

METHODS One hundred and forty-six patients were randomly allocated to receive either magnesium or dexamethasone. Before anesthetic induction, the magnesium group (n = 73) received magnesium sulphate 30 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg/h by continuous infusion until the end of surgery. The dexamethasone group (n = 73) received dexamethasone 8 mg. The primary endpoint was the overall incidence of POST, which was assessed serially over 48 hr postoperatively. The predefined margin of non-inferiority for magnesium against dexamethasone was 15%. RESULTS Overall incidences of POST at rest (50.7% versus 49.3% in the magnesium and dexamethasone group, respectively, p = 0.869) and swallowing (65.8% versus 61.6% in the magnesium and dexamethasone group, respectively, p = 0.606) were not different between the groups.

Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia presents particular challenges, as the diagnosis based on CT-findings as well as vascular management is more difficult; some recent evidence suggests a possible role of potentially treatable stenosis of superior mesenteric artery and beneficial effect of vasodilator therapy (intravenous or local intra-arterial). Medical management of AMI is supportive, including aiming of euvolemia and balanced systemic oxygen demand/delivery. Enteral nutrition should be withheld during ongoing ischemia-reperfusion injury and be started at low rate after revascularization of the (remaining) bowel is convincingly achieved. SUMMARY Clinical suspicion leading to tri-phasic CT-angiography is a mainstay for diagnosis. Diagnosis of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia and early intestinal injury remains challenging. Multidisciplinary team effort may improve the outcome of AMI.","output":"A clinical approach to acute mesenteric ischemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All measures of health status are ultimately derived from observations of individuals.

Therefore, we investigated the humoral immune response after BNT162b2-mRNA vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection in HIV-1(+) patients on antiretroviral therapy compared to HIV-1-uninfected subjects. Serum and saliva samples were analysed by SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG and IgA ELISAs and a surrogate neutralization assay. While all subjects developed anti-spike IgG and IgA and neutralizing antibodies in serum after two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, the HIV-1(+) subjects displayed significantly lower neutralizing capacity and anti-spike IgA in serum compared to HIV-1-uninfected subjects. Serum levels of anti-spike IgG and neutralizing activity were significantly higher in vaccinees compared to SARS-CoV-2 convalescents irrespective of HIV-1 status. Among SARS-CoV-2 convalescents, there was no significant difference in spike-specific antibody response between HIV-1(+) and uninfected subjects. In saliva, anti-spike IgG and IgA antibodies were detected both in vaccinees and convalescents, albeit at lower frequencies compared to the serum and only rarely with detectable neutralizing activity. In summary, our study demonstrates that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine induces SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in HIV-1-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy, however, lower vaccine induced neutralization activity indicates a lower functionality of the humoral vaccine response in HIV-1(+) patients.","output":"Characterization of Serum and Mucosal SARS-CoV-2-Antibodies in HIV-1-Infected Subjects after BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective In the Netherlands, the surgical mask is part of the standard surgical attire even for the non-sterile personnel in the operation theatre. Solid evidence on the effect on postoperative infection rates is missing. Due to a national scarcity in surgical masks during the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis the usage of these masks was decreased. In our tertiary referral centre for Surgical Oncology, this led to the decision that, for a period of ten weeks, the surgical masks were only being used by the sterile surgical team and not by non-sterile operation theatre personnel. This retrospective study evaluates the influence of this intervention in terms of postoperative wound infection rates. Design Retrospective cohort study. Method Consecutive patients undergoing surgery during the first COVID-19 wave (2-3-2020 until 11-05-2020) were compared with patients undergoing surgery in the same period a year earlier. Patients undergoing surgery for soft-tissue malignancies were included. Intra-abdominal surgery was excluded. Primary outcome measurement was wound infection rate within 30 days following surgery. Secondary, a cost reduction analysis was made. Results In the COVID-19 wave, a total of 219 patients underwent surgery for soft-tissue malignancies, compared to 241 a year earlier. The incidence of postoperative wound infection was 58/460 (12.6%) for the total cohort. There was no difference in infection rate between the COVID-19 period and the same period in 2019;25/219 (11,4%;95% CI: 7,8-16,4) vs. 33/241 (13,7%;95% CI: 9,8-18,6), p = 0,46 respectively. During the COVID-19 wave, a total of 6.400 of surgical masks were used by the personnel in the operation theatre complex, compared to a total of 11.000 in the same period in 2019. This resulted in a reduction of 42% in usage of surgical masks. Conclusion Based on this mono-centric, explorative retrospective cohort study, it seems that omitting the surgical mask for the non-sterile operation theatre personnel does not influence the postoperative wound infection rate. Despite the fact that our sample size is small, the impressive reduction in usage of 42% demands further research initiatives on a larger scale.","output":"Wearing surgical masks in the operation theatre: yes or no?

We sought to answer, whether a non-bleeding fluid deficit can be quantified through sonographic assessment of IVC diameter variability and related aortic parameters. Sport divers were used as human hypovolemic vasoconstriction models since immersion is known to cause relevant volume depletion through vasoconstriction and induced diuresis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one sport divers performed 342 single and repetitive dives to account for intra- and interindividual variability and were assessed for inferior Vena Cava and neighboring aortic diameters as well as their cardiac/respiratory variations. Dive-related weight loss was measured together with sonographic vessel diameter changes inferior to the right atrium. RESULTS: Highest correlation with dive-related weight loss of max. 2.9 kg per an average 47 minutes dive was found with r=0.34 for the difference of IVC maximum diameter related to minimum Aortic diameter. Single or combined parameters, as well as Collapsibility Index, showed lower or no correlations. Vascular parameters were able to explain 7.5% of the variance of fluid losses, whereas interindividual effects explained 10%. The remaining 82.5% is of mixed intraindividual counterregulatory effects. CONCLUSION: IVC diameter changes in immersion-induced hypovolemic centralization provides qualitative information on relevant fluid loss only. Confounding factors like inter and intraindividual variability prevent a sufficient correlation for useful quantification of the experienced non-bleeding fluid deficit in the clinical setting.","output":"Sonographic Estimation Rather Than Quantification of Fluid Status Using Inferior Vena Cava and Other Major Vessel Parameters in a Non-Bleeding Fluid Loss and Centralization Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of SARS-Coronavirus-2 (Coronavirus-19) has been progressing by the increasing trend of the cases as well as deaths with neither vaccine nor drug is rationally used to stop the viral spread over.

Various proinflammatory stimuli can promote thrombosis by inducing luminal endothelial expression of tissue factor (TF), which interacts with circulating coagulation factor VII to trigger extrinsic coagulation. The signalling mechanism whereby these stimuli evoke TF expression entails activation of NADPH oxidase, upstream from activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor that drives the induced transcription of the TF gene. When single-stranded RNA viruses are taken up into cellular endosomes, they stimulate endosomal formation and activation of NADPH oxidase complexes via RNA-responsive toll-like receptor 7. It is therefore proposed that SARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells evokes the expression of TF which is contingent on endosomal NADPH oxidase activation. If this hypothesis is correct, hydroxychloroquine, spirulina (more specifically, its chromophore phycocyanobilin) and high-dose glycine may have practical potential for mitigating the elevated thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19.","output":"Thrombotic complications of COVID-19 may reflect an upregulation of endothelial tissue factor expression that is contingent on activation of endosomal NADPH oxidase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the high workload, risk of infection, and safety issues for family members may pose a threat to the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) working in hospital settings. The study aimed to find out the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms were among HCWs, as well as the factors related to these mental health issues. Methods: : We conducted an online survey of HCWs employed in Dhaka city from June 6 to July 6, 2020. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder, the depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Insomnia Severity Index, respectively. The related factors of anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms were identified using three regression models. Results: : This research included responses from 294 HCWs (mean standard deviation age: 28.865.5 years;43.5% were female). Anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms were found in 20.7%, 26.5%, and 44.2% of HCWs, respectively. The variable financial difficulties was commonly found as an associated factor for anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms. Female HCWs were more prone to mental health symptoms and insomnia compared to male HCWs (Adjusted odds ratio- AOR=2.20, 95% CI=1.27 C 3.79). The depression symptoms among HCWs were found to be a factor for insomnia (AOR=6.321, 95% CI= 3.158 C 12.650). Conclusion: In the current pandemic, the high prevalence of mental health symptoms among HCWs indicates that this occupational group being associated with increased mental distress. Increasing financial support for HCWs and providing support to female workers in care facilities could help to alleviate the burden of mental illness. Supportive, training, and educational strategies, particularly through knowledge and communication platforms, could be recommended to the care facilities, which can reduce the burden of mental health symptoms among HCWs.","output":"Prevalence of mental health symptoms and its effect on insomnia among healthcare workers who attended hospitals during COVID-19 pandemic: A survey in Dhaka city"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While several studies have described the clinical course of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), direct comparisons with patients with seasonal influenza are scarce.

It is frequently caused by colon cancer. However, the common benign etiologies include volvulus, hernia, adhesions, and strictures. Imaging studies are essential to establish the diagnosis and identify the etiology. We present the case of a 44-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and distension for a one-week duration. The pain was associated with decreased bowel motions and vomiting. Her past medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and recurrent episodes of biliary colic. Upon examination, she had tachycardia, normal temperature, and normal blood pressure. Abdominal examination revealed a distended abdomen with generalized tenderness and increased intensity of bowel sounds. The laboratory markers were noncontributory. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with intravenous contrast demonstrated the presence of an oval-shaped hypodense intraluminal mass in the sigmoid colon where there was a transition point with proximal colonic dilatation. There was an abnormal communication between the gallbladder and the colon at the hepatic flexure, representing a cholecystocolic fistula tract. This represents a mechanical obstruction of the large bowel due to migrated gallstone through a cholecystocolic fistula tract. The patient was prepared for an emergency laparotomy. The gallstone was removed, and the sigmoid colon was sutured primarily. Resection of the gallbladder was made with the closure of the fistula tract.

METHODS We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to report literature searches in PubMed, Embase, Global Health, Scopus and ERIC. Our keywords included LMICs, low-income and middle-income countries, health research and writing/publication support interventions, with no restrictions on publication date. Our screening process consisted of title screening, abstract review and full-text review. We collected information about the content, implementation and evaluation of each intervention, if included. RESULTS We identified 20 interventions designed to strengthen capacity for scientific writing and publishing. We summarised information from the 14 interventions that reported submitted or published papers as outcomes separately, reasoning that because they provide quantifiable metrics of success, they may offer particular insights into intervention components leading to publication. The writing and publishing components in this 'Publications Reported' group were an average length of 5.4 days compared with 2.5 days in the other group we refer to as 'Other Interventions.' Whereas all 14 Publications Reported interventions incorporated mentors, only two of five in the Other Interventions group incorporated mentors.

The extent to which individuals comply with different policy designs can further influence how effective the policy responses are and how equitably their impacts are distributed in the population. Tools which allow policymakers to model different crisis trajectories, policy responses, and behavioral scenarios ex ante can provide crucial timely support in the decision-making process. Set in the context of COVID-19 shelter in place policies, in this paper we present the COVID-19 Policy Evaluation (CoPE) tool, which is an agent-based modeling framework that enables researchers and policymakers to anticipate the relative impacts of policy decisions. Specifically, this framework illuminates the extent to which policy design features and behavioral responsiveness influence the efficacy and equity of policy responses to shock events. We show that while an early policy response can be highly effective, the impact of the timing is moderated by other aspects of policy design such as duration and targeting of the policy, as well as societal aspects such as trust and compliance among the population. More importantly, we show that even policies that are more effective overall can have disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations. By disaggregating the impact of different policy design elements on different population groups, we provide an additional tool for policymakers to use in the design of targeted strategies for disproportionately affected populations.","output":"Policy and behavioral response to shock events: An agent-based model of the effectiveness and equity of policy design features"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergency use authorization of two COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in less than a year since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, represents a landmark in vaccinology1,2 Yet, how mRNA vaccines stimulate the immune system to elicit protective immune responses is unknown Here we used a systems biological approach to comprehensively profile the innate and adaptive immune responses in 56 healthy volunteers vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine Vaccination resulted in robust production of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against the parent strain and the variant of concern, B 1 351, but no induction of autoantibodies, and significant increases in antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 T cells after the second dose The innate response induced within the first 2 days of booster vaccination was profoundly increased, relative to the response at corresponding times after priming Thus, there was a striking increase in the: (i) frequency of CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes;(ii) concentration of IFN- y in the plasma, which correlated with enhanced pSTAT3 and pSTAT1 levels in monocytes and T cells;and (iii) transcriptional signatures of innate responses characteristic of antiviral vaccine responses against pandemic influenza, HIV and Ebola, within 2 days following booster vaccination compared to primary vaccination Consistent with these observations, single-cell transcriptomics analysis of 242,479 leukocytes demonstrated a ~100-fold increase in the frequency of a myeloid cluster, enriched in a signature of interferon-response transcription factors (TFs) and reduced in AP-1 TFs, one day after secondary immunization, at day 21 Finally, we delineated distinct molecular pathways of innate activation that correlate with CD8 T cell and nAb responses and identified an early monocyte-related signature that was associated with the breadth of the nAb response against the B1 351 variant strain Collectively, these data provide insights into the immune responses induced by mRNA vaccines and demonstrate their capacity to stimulate an enhanced innate response following booster immunization","output":"Systems biological assessment of human immunity to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We aimed to analyze the laboratory data of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients for clinical help, to overcome the vulnerabilities of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing for diagnosing COVID-19, and to reduce the number of negative results when diagnosing, particularly in global regions which are recognized to have limited resources. Materials and Methods: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, the authors performed a systematic literature review, using three databases to assess laboratory data of COVID-19-confirmed cases, and the articles that described significant laboratory irregularities were ultimately chosen. Crosschecking was performed on the references of these articles in order to identify further studies. The statistical software R version 3.6.1 was used for meta-analysis of COVID-19 studies. Results: A total of 13 relevant articles were included. They yielded a total of 2662 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19. The analysis results demonstrated that male patients comprised a more substantial proportion, accounting for 57.9% of the total.

The impact of case selection and experience, the presence of a cortical cuff between the tumor and surrounding vessels, and brain edema on morbidity and rates of gross-total resection (GTR) were examined. METHODS A retrospective review of a series of 46 skull base meningiomas from a prospective database was conducted. The series of cases were divided by location: olfactory groove (n = 15), tuberculum and planum (n = 20), sellar/cavernous (n = 9) and petroclival (n = 2). Gross-total resection was never intended in the sellar/cavernous tumors, which generally invaded the cavernous sinus. Clinical charts, volumetric imaging, and pathology were reviewed to assess the extent of resection and complications. Cases were divided based on a time point in which surgical technique and case selection improved into Group 1 (surgery prior to June 2008; n = 21) and Group 2 (surgery after June 2008; n = 25) and into those with and without a cortical cuff and with and without brain edema. RESULTS Improved case selection had the greatest impact on extent of resection. For the entire cohort, rates of GTR went from 38% to 76% (p = 0.02), and for cases in which GTR was the intent, the rates went from 63% to 84% (not significant), which was mostly driven by the planum and tuberculum meningiomas, which went from 75% to 91.7 % (nonsignificant difference). The presence of a cortical cuff and brain edema had no impact on outcomes. There were 3 CSF leaks (6.5%) but all were in Group 1. Hence, CSF leak improved from 14.2% to 0% with surgical experience. Lessons learned for optimal case selection are discussed. CONCLUSIONS Surgical outcome for endonasal endoscopic resection of skull base meningiomas depends mostly on careful case selection and surgical experience. Imaging criteria such as the presence of a cortical cuff or brain edema are less important.","output":"Endoscopic endonasal resection of skull base meningiomas: the significance of a \\"cortical cuff\\" and brain edema compared with careful case selection and surgical experience in predicting morbidity and extent of resection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 is arguably the number-one public health concern worldwide, and efforts are now escalating to control its spread. Objective: In this study, we undertake a meta-analysis to estimate the global and regional anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rates in humans and assess whether seroprevalence associates with geographical, climatic and socio-demographic factors. Data sources: We systematically reviewed PubMed, Scopus, Embase, medRxiv and bioRxiv for peer-reviewed articles or preprints (up to 14 August 2020). Study eligibility criteria: Population-based studies describing prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies in general people. Participants: general people who were tested for prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies. Interventions: There were no interventions. Methods: We used random-effects model to estimate pooled seroprevalence, and then extrapolated these findings to the global population (for 2020). Sub-group and meta-regression analyses explored potential sources of heterogeneity in the data and relationships between seroprevalence and socio-demographic, geographical and climatic factors. Results: In total, 47 serological studies involving 399,265 people from 23 countries met the inclusion criteria. The pooled seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in general people was estimated at 3.38% (95% CI, 3.05%-3.72%; 15,879/399,265). On a regional basis, we determined seroprevalence estimates of 5.27% (3.97-6.57%) in Northern Europe; 4.41% (2.20-6.61%) in Southern Europe; 4.41% (3.03-5.79%) in North America; 3.17% (1.96-4.38%) in Western Europe; 2.02% (1.56-2.49%) in the Eastern Asia; and 1.45% (0.95-1.94%) in South America. Extrapolating to the 2020 world population, we estimated that 263,565,606 individuals had been exposed or infected with SARS-CoV-2 at the first wave of the pandemic. A significantly higher seroprevalence was related to higher income levels and human development indices, higher geographical latitudes and lower mean environmental temperatures. Interpretation This study reinforces that SARS-CoV-2 infection is a very rapidly-spreading communicable disease and calls for routine surveys to constantly monitor temporal changes in seroprevalence around the globe.","output":"First snap-shot meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, testing, contact tracing and social restrictions are among the most powerful strategies adopted around the world to slow down the spread of the pandemic.

A thematic analysis of the Chatbox thread indicated the most pressing concerns and challenges educators were experiencing in having to adapt programmes and learning across the continuum of medical education and training. The main areas of concern were: campus-based teaching and learning; clinical teaching; selection and assessment, and educator needs. While there is clearly no one simple solution to the unprecedented issues medical education and training face currently, there were two over-arching messages.

SHORT CONCLUSION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed a large burden on hospitals and healthcare providers worldwide, which increases the risk of nosocomial transmission and outbreaks to non-COVID patients or residents, who represent the highest-risk population in terms of mortality, as well as HCWs. To date, there are several reports on nosocomial outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, and although the attack rate is variable, it can be as high as 60%, with high mortality. There is currently little evidence on transmission dynamics, particularly using genomic sequencing, and the role of HCWs in initiating or amplifying nosocomial outbreaks is not elucidated. There has been a paradigm shift in management practices of viral respiratory outbreaks, that includes widespread testing of patients (or residents) and HCWs, including asymptomatic individuals. These expanded testing criteria appear to be crucial in identifying and controlling outbreaks.","output":"Nosocomial transmission and outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019: the need to protect both patients and healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Redox dysregulation and oxidative stress have been implicated in asthma pathogenesis. Exercise interventions improve symptoms and reduce inflammation in asthma patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that a personalised exercise intervention would improve asthma control by reducing lung inflammation through modulation of local and systemic reactive species interactions, thereby increasing antioxidant capacity. We combined deep redox metabolomic profiling with clinical assessment in an exploratory cohort of six female patients with symptomatic asthma and studied their responses to a metabolically targeted exercise intervention over 12 weeks. Plasma antioxidant capacity and circulating nitrite levels increased following the intervention (p = 0.028) and lowered the ratio of reduced to oxidised glutathione (p = 0.029); this was accompanied by improvements in physical fitness (p = 0.046), symptoms scores (p = 0.020), quality of life (p = 0.046), lung function (p = 0.028), airway hyperreactivity (p = 0.043), and eosinophilic inflammation (p = 0.007). Increased physical fitness correlated with improved plasma antioxidant capacity (p = 0.019), peak oxygen uptake and nitrite changes (p = 0.005), the latter also associated with reductions in peripheral blood eosinophil counts (p = 0.038). Thus, increases in redox resilience may underpin the clinical benefits of exercise in asthma.

Objective To determine the mortality rate among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 stratified according to BMI. Methods The clinical files of all patients hospitalized from March to December 2020 with a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 discharged due to improvement or death, were analyzed. A mixed effects logistic regression was carried out to determine which clinical and biochemical characteristics and comorbidities were associated with in-hospital mortality. Results The cohort consisted of 608 patients with a median age of 59 years (interquartile ranges, IQR 46 ?69 years), median BMI of 28.7 kg/m2 (IQR 25.4-32.4 kg/m2), 65.5% were male. In-hospital mortality rate was 43.4%. Of the cohort 0.8% had low weight, 20.9% normal weight, 36.0% overweight, 26.5% obesity grade I, 10.2% obesity grade II and 5.6% obesity grade III.

Thus, we aimed to analyze the optimal radiotherapy dose for clinically positive LPLN from LARC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated distal LARC (i.e., within 8 cm from the anal verge) patients with clinically positive LPLN (i.e., 7 mm in the short axis). They were divided into two groups based on whether or not they received simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiation therapy (SIB-IMRT)Cbased chemoradiotherapy. The total radiotherapy dose on LPLN were 56-60Gy for SIB-IMRT group and 41.8Gy for non-SIB-IMRT group. The clinical parameters and regrowth rate of LPLN were then compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients were evaluated, and 83 and 68 patients were classified to the SIB-IMRT and non-SIB-IMRT group, respectively. The median follow-up period was 22.6 months, and the 2-year LPLN regrowth rate was significantly different between the SIB-IMRT group and the non-SIB-IMRT group (0% vs 10.8%, P=0.024). Further, SIB-IMRT yielded a significantly lower 2-year LPLN regrowth rate in patients whose LPLN measured 8 mm in the short axis (0% vs. 15.9%, P=0.019) or 10 mm in the long axis (0% vs. 17.6%, P=0.024) compared to patients who were in non-SIB-IMRT group. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference in grade II radiation-related toxicity (30.1% vs. 39.1%, P=0.217) and surgical complications (21.8% vs. 12.2%, P=0.198) between the two groups. CONCLUSION: SIB-IMRTCbased neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is beneficial for eliminating clinically positive LPLN from LARC without increasing the incidence of radiotherapy-related toxicity and surgical complications, and patients with larger LPLN may gain benefit from this technique.","output":"Simultaneous Integrated Boost Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy Can Benefit the Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Patients With Clinically Positive Lateral Pelvic Lymph Node"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted modern societies and their economies. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases as part of the second wave is observed across Europe and the Americas. The scientific response has enabled a complete structural characterization of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-novel Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Among the most relevant proteins required by the novel coronavirus to facilitate the cell entry mechanism is the spike protein. This protein possesses a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and then triggers the fusion of viral and host cell membranes. In this regard, a comprehensive characterization of the structural stability of the spike protein is a crucial step to find new therapeutics to interrupt the process of recognition. On the other hand, it has been suggested that the participation of more than one RBD is a possible mechanism to enhance cell entry. Here, we discuss the protein structural stability based on the computational determination of the dynamic contact map and the energetic difference of the spike protein conformations via the mapping of the hydration free energy by the Poisson-Boltzmann method.

RECENT FINDINGS: In the current SARS-CoV2 epidemiological environment, infection control and costs associated with healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are of paramount importance. Even before the onset of SARS-CoV2, HAIs affected nearly 2million patients a year in the USA and resulted in nearly 90,000 deaths, all of which resulted in a cost to hospitals ranging from US$28 billion to 45 billion. The onset SARS-CoV2, though not spread by an airborne route, has heightened infection control protocols in hospitals and, as such, cast a renewed focus on disinfectants and their utility across different settings and organisms.

Prior investigations have shown strong associations of social determinants of health with cardiovascular risk factors, imaging findings, and clinical events. However, limited data exist regarding the potential role of social vulnerability and related physiologic stressors on tissue-level pathology. Methods: We analyzed clinical data and linked autopsy reports from 853 decedent individuals who underwent autopsy from 4/6/2002 to 4/1/2021 at a large urban medical center. The mean age at death was 62.9 (SD = 15.6) and 49% of decedent individuals were men. The primary exposure was census-tract level composite social vulnerability index based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). Individuals were geocoded to census tracts and assigned SVI accordingly. Four myocardial tissue-level outcomes from autopsy were recorded as present or absent: any coronary atherosclerosis, severe/obstructive coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial fibrosis, and/or myopericardial inflammation. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were constructed with SVI as the primary exposure and covariates including age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, and hypertension. Additional analyses were performed stratified by clinical diagnoses of heart failure (HF) and coronary artery disease (CAD). Results: In the overall cohort, SVI was not associated with outcomes on cardiac pathology in multivariable-adjusted models. However, in stratified multivariable-adjusted analyses, higher SVI (higher social vulnerability) was associated with a higher odds of myocardial fibrosis among individuals without clinical diagnoses of HF. Conclusions: Higher indices of social vulnerability are associated with a higher odds of myocardial fibrosis at autopsy among individuals without known clinical diagnoses of HF.

Here, we synthesized a number of novel quinolinyl pyrimidines and investigated their properties. In terms of inhibition of the NDH-2 enzymes from M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis, the best compounds were of similar potency to previously reported inhibitors of the same class (half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values in the low-M range). However, a number of the compounds had much better activity against Gram-negative pathogens, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) as low as 2 g/mL. Multivariate analyses (partial least-squares (PLS) and principle component analysis (PCA)) showed that overall ligand charge was one of the most important factors in determining antibacterial activity, with patterns that varied depending on the particular bacterial species. In some cases (e.g., mycobacteria), there was a clear correlation between the IC(50) values and the observed MICs, while in other instances, no such correlation was evident. When tested against a panel of protozoan parasites, the compounds failed to show activity that was not linked to cytotoxicity. Further, a strong correlation between hydrophobicity (estimated as clog P) and cytotoxicity was revealed; more hydrophobic analogues were more cytotoxic.

If cognitive sciences could specify the optimal format for presenting learning materials, this would advance our understanding of human learning and have benefits for education and society. Online learning can vary in terms of how the material is presented (e.g. live/recorded), but we have only limited data on which is most effective. Here, we examine how young adults (aged 18-35) learn information about unknown objects in a 2x2 design, where learning conditions systematically varied in terms of social contingency (live vs recorded lecture) and social richness (viewing the teachers face/hands/slides). Recall was tested immediately and after 1 week delay. Experiment 1 (n=24 participants) showed better learning for live presentation and a full view of the teacher (hands & face). Experiment 2 (n=27 participants, pre-registered) replicated the live-presentation advantage. In both experiments, we found an interaction between social contingency and social richness, indicating that live social interaction with a full view of the teacher provides the optimal setting for learning new factual information. We suggest that being part of a genuine social interaction may catalyse learning, with greater gains than yoked observation of the same student-teacher interactions. Possible cognitive mechanisms underlying these effects include joint attention, formation of shared concepts and (inter-)active discussion.

This is typically caused by the data being restricted to people who have undergone COVID19 testing, among whom healthcare workers are overrepresented.

We extend the work of Griffith et al making more explicit use of graphical causal models to interpret observed data. We show that their smoking example can be clarified and improved using Bayesian network models with realistic data and assumptions. We show that there is an even more fundamental problem for risk factors like 'stress' which, unlike smoking, is more rather than less prevalent among healthcare workers;in this case, because of a combination of collider bias from the biased dataset and the fact that 'healthcare worker' is a confounding variable, it is likely that studies will wrongly conclude that stress reduces rather than increases the risk of COVID19. Indeed, \\"being in close contact with COVID19 people\\" reduces the risk of COVID19.

METHODS: This is a single-center prospective study, enrolling 29 non-metastatic PCa patients eligible to LHRH-antagonist from 2017 to 2019. All patients received monthly subcutaneous injection of Degarelix for 12 months. Changes in FBM and LBM between baseline and 12-month Degarelix, as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, were the co-primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints were changes in serum lipids, glucose profile and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Appendicular lean mass index (ALMI) and ALMI/FBM ratio were assessed as post-hoc analyses. Linear mixed models with random intercept tested for estimated least squared means differences (EMD). RESULTS: FBM significantly increased after 12 months (EMD +2920.7, +13.8%, p < 0.001), whereas LBM remained stable (EMD ?187.1, ?0.3%, p = 0.8). No differences occurred in lipid profile.

Abstract Based on the report on the situation of COVID-19 in Spain, dated April 3, 2020, the confirmed cases amount to 117,710, of which 343 are under 14 years of age (<1%). It is essential to know the specificity of this process in the child population, as well the specific recommendations for proper prevention and care of children during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our objective is to analyze the scientific evidence on the specific recommendations for pediatric care in cases of COVID-19 from the family and community settings. The main recommendations and preventive measures in primary health care settings and at home have been selected and analyzed from an integrative approach that includes the biopsychosocial aspects of the child during confinement. The importance of caring for children in the face of the disease lies above all in ensuring the correct measures for the prevention of contagion due to the condition of acting as possible carriers during an incubation period of up to 21 days. The recommendation is that children actively participate in routine preventive actions to contain the spread of the disease. At the household level, isolation is an important challenge for families where there are manifestations of uncertainty, fear and helplessness in the face of changes and among the recommendations are establishing routines and order through schedules of activities and leisure together with hygiene measures.

The decrease was statistically significant only for abdominal wall surgery. Interestingly, in 2020, there was an increase of three procedures: surgical intervention for acute mesenteric ischemia (p = 0.002), drainage of perianal abscesses (p = 0.000285), and cholecystostomy for acute cholecystitis (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: During the first COVID-19 pandemic wave in the metropolitan area of Milan, the number of patients operated for emergency diseases decreased by around 19%. We believe that this decrease is related either to the fear of the population to ask for emergency department (ED) consultation and to a shift towards a more non-operative management in the surgeons decision making process. The increase of acute mesenteric ischaemia and perianal abscess might be related to the modification of dietary habits and reduction of physical activity related to the lockdown.","output":"Impact of lockdown on emergency general surgery during first 2020 COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Empowerment is an activity in which a person could handle problems or from hard situation thus he has the power to move forward it could influence for his life in the environment.

In this perspective, we propose that CFTR therapeutics, which are safe and generally well-tolerated, may provide benefit to COVID-19 patients. Although CFTR therapeutics are currently only approved for treating cystic fibrosis, there are efforts to repurpose them for conditions with acquired CFTR dysfunction, for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition to targeting the primary lung pathology, CFTR therapeutics may possess value-added effects: their anti-inflammatory properties may dampen exaggerated immune cell responses and promote cerebrovascular dilation; the latter aspect may offer some protection against COVID-19 related stroke.","output":"A Scientific Rationale for Using Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Therapeutics in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has forced frontline health care teams to make radical and rapid adjustments.

The generation time, also known as the generation interval, is the time between infection events in an infector infectee pair. The serial interval and the generation time are key parameters for assessing the dynamics of a disease. A number of scientific papers reported information pertaining to the serial interval and/or generation time for COVID19. Objectives: Conduct a rapid review of available evidence to advise on appropriate parameter values for serial interval and generation time in national COVID19 transmission models for Ireland and on methodological issues relating to those parameters. Methods: A review of scientific literature was conducted covering the period between December 1, 2019 and April 27, 2020. Nineteen scientific papers were evaluated in detail from 27 papers that contained information on the serial interval and/or generation time for COVID19. Results: The mean of the serial interval ranged from 3.1 to 7.5 days, based on 22 estimates, and the median from 1.9 to 6.0 days (based on 7 estimates). Only three estimates were provided for the mean of the generation time. These ranged from 3.9 to 5.2 days. One estimate of 5.0 days was provided for the median of the generation time. Discussion: The values of the estimates for serial interval and generation time are heavily influenced by the contact rates between infectious and susceptible individuals. Mitigation measures that are introduced in a country or region are of paramount importance in this regard. The serial interval estimate of 6.6 days (95% confidence interval: 0.7, 19.0) from the paper by Cereda et al.[10] is likely to be the most relevant to European countries.

A plethora of facial coverings and respirators, both commercial and homemade, pervade the market, but the true filtration capabilities of many homemade measures against the virus are unclear and continue to be unexplored. In this work, we compare the efficacy of the following masks in keeping out particulate matter below 2.5 microns: N95 respirators, surgical masks, cloth masks, cloth masks with activated carbon air filters, cloth masks with HVAC air filters, lightly starch-enhanced cloth masks, and heavily-starched cloth masks. The experiments utilize an inhalation system and aerosol chamber to simulate a masked individual respiring aerosolized air. COVID-19 disproportionately affects people in low-income communities, who often lack the resources to acquire appropriate personal protective equipment and tend to lack the flexibility to shelter in place due to their public-facing occupations. This work tests low-cost enhancements to homemade masks to assist these communities in making better masks to reduce viral transmission. Experimental results demonstrate that the filtration efficacy of cloth masks with either a light or heavy starch can approach the performance of much costlier masks.

METHOD: A total of 145 children (aged 6C8 years) were formally registered and randomized to the intervention group (n = 73) and waitlist group (n = 72). The enrolled children received eight sessions of GEF-OPT treatment, which consists of a hospital-based children executive function (EF) training program and an online parent training program. Treatment outcome was assessed by a parent/teacher report questionnaire and neurophysiological experiment. RESULTS: After eight sessions of intervention, children in the intervention group showed a significant improvement in inattentive symptom compared to the waitlist group (14.70  4.35 vs. 16.03  2.93; p = 0.024), but an insignificant difference in hyperactive-impulsivity (9.85  5.30 vs. 10.69  5.10; p = 0.913).

The He-Jie-Shen-Shi decoction (HJSS), composed of Bupleurum chinense DC., Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Makino, Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. ex DC., and nine other herbs, has been used to treat severe COVID-19 in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacies of HJSS combination therapy and Western monotherapy against severe COVID-19 and to study the potential action mechanism of HJSS. From February 2020 to March 2020, 81 patients with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan Tongji Hospital were selected for retrospective cohort study. Network pharmacology was conducted to predict the possible mechanism of HJSS on COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Targets of active components in HJSS were screened using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) and PharmMapper databases. The targets of COVID-19 and ARDS were obtained from GeneCards and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man databases. The key targets of HJSS in COVID-19 and ARDS were obtained based on the proteinCprotein interaction network (PPI). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis (KEGG) was conducted to predict the pathways related to the targets of HJSS in COVID-19 and ARDS. A herb-ingredient-target-pathway network was established using Cytoscape 3.2.7. Results showed that the duration of the negative conversion time of nucleic acid was shorter in patients who received HJSS combination therapy. HJSS combination therapy also relieved fever in patients with severe COVID-19. Network pharmacology analysis identified interleukin (IL) 6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), catalase (CAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1, tumor protein p53 (TP53), CC-chemokine ligand (CCL2), MAPK3, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), and IL1B as the key targets of HJSS in COVID-19-related ARDS.

We estimated the risk of SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalisations after infection with omicron compared with the delta variant (B.1.617.2) in Denmark, a country with high mRNA vaccination coverage and extensive free-of-charge PCR testing capacity. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, we included all RT-PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Denmark, with samples taken between Nov 21 (date of first omicron-positive sample) and Dec 19, 2021. Individuals were identified in the national COVID-19 surveillance system database, which included results of a variant-specific RT-PCR that detected omicron cases, and data on SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalisations (primary outcome of the study). We calculated the risk ratio (RR) of hospitalisation after infection with omicron compared with delta, overall and stratified by vaccination status, in a Poisson regression model with robust SEs, adjusted a priori for reinfection status, sex, age, region, comorbidities, and time period. FINDINGS: Between Nov 21 and Dec 19, 2021, among the 188 980 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 38 669 (205%) had the omicron variant. SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalisations and omicron cases increased during the study period. Overall, 124 313 (658%) of 188 980 individuals were vaccinated, and vaccination was associated with a lower risk of hospitalisation (adjusted RR 024, 95% CI 022C026) compared with cases with no doses or only one dose of vaccine. Compared with delta infection, omicron infection was associated with an adjusted RR of hospitalisation of 064 (95% CI 056C075; 222 [06%] of 38 669 omicron cases admitted to hospital vs 2213 [15%] of 150 311 delta cases). For a similar comparison by vaccination status, the RR of hospitalisation was 057 (044C075) among cases with no or only one dose of vaccine, 071 (060C086) among those who received two doses, and 050 (032C076) among those who received three doses. INTERPRETATION: We found a significantly lower risk of hospitalisation with omicron infection compared with delta infection among both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, suggesting an inherent reduced severity of omicron.

With millions of people infected around the World and already thousands of deaths, there is still a great uncertainty on the actual evolution of the crisis, as well as on the possible post-crisis scenarios, which depend on a number of key variables and factors (e.g. a treatment, a vaccine or some kind of immunity). Despite the optimism enforced by the positive results recently achieved to produce a vaccine, uncertainty is probably still somehow the predominant feeling. From a more philosophical perspective, the COVID-19 drama is also a kind of stress-test for our global system and, probably, an opportunity to reconsider some aspects underpinning it, as well as its sustainability. In this article we focus on the pre-crisis situation by combining a number of selected global indicators that are likely to represent measures of different aspects of life. How was the World actually performing? We have defined 6 macro-categories and inferred their relevance from different sources. Results show that economic-oriented priorities correspond to positive performances, while all other distributions point to a negative performance.

With the uncertainty of developing a cure/vaccine for the infection in the near future, the onus currently lies on healthcare infrastructure, policies, government activities, and behaviour of the people to contain the virus. This research uses exponential growth modelling studies to understand the spreading patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and identifies countries that showed early signs of containment until March 26, 2020. Predictive supervised machine learning models are built using infrastructure, environment, policies, and infection-related independent variables to predict early containment. COVID-19 infection data across 42 countries are used. Logistic regression results show a positive significant relationship between healthcare infrastructure and lockdown policies, and signs of early containment. Machine learning models based on logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machines are developed and show accuracies between 76.2% and 92.9% to predict early signs of infection containment.

This reactivation is orchestrated by the interplay of sleep slow oscillations, spindles, and theta, which are in turn modulated by certain neurotransmitters like GABA to enable long-lasting plastic changes in the memory store. Here we asked whether the GABAergic system and associated changes in sleep oscillations are functionally related to memory reactivation during sleep. We administered the GABAA agonist zolpidem (10 mg) in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. To specifically focus on the effects on memory reactivation during sleep, we experimentally induced such reactivations by targeted memory reactivation (TMR) with learning-associated reminder cues presented during post-learning slow-wave sleep (SWS). Zolpidem significantly enhanced memory performance with TMR during sleep compared with placebo. Zolpidem also increased the coupling of fast spindles and theta to slow oscillations, although overall the power of slow spindles and theta was reduced compared with placebo. In an uncorrected exploratory analysis, memory performance was associated with slow spindle responses to TMR in the zolpidem condition, whereas it was associated with fast spindle responses in placebo. These findings provide tentative first evidence that GABAergic activity may be functionally implicated in memory reactivation processes during sleep, possibly via its effects on slow oscillations, spindles and theta as well as their interplay.","output":"The effect of zolpidem on targeted memory reactivation during sleep"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) includes multitarget stool DNA (mt-sDNA) testing as a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening option in average-risk individuals, but data on colonoscopy outcomes after positive mt-sDNA tests in community settings are needed. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate colonoscopy outcomes and quality following positive mt-sDNA in the population-based New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry. METHODS: We compared colonoscopy outcomes and quality between age-matched, sex-matched, and risk-matched patients from 30 endoscopy practices with and without a preceding positive mt-sDNA test. Main outcomes were colonoscopy findings of CRC, advanced noncancerous neoplasia, nonadvanced neoplasia, or normal examination. Quality measures included withdrawal time, bowel preparation quality, examination completion, and percentage of average-risk individuals with normal colonoscopies receiving a USPSTF-recommended 10 year rescreening interval. RESULTS: Individuals with positive mt-sDNA tests (N=306, average age 67.0 y; 61.8% female) were significantly more likely than colonoscopy-only patients (N=918, 66.2 y; 61.8% female) to have CRC (1.3% vs. 0.4%) or advanced noncancerous neoplasia (27.1% vs. 8.2%) (P<0.0001). Neoplasia was found in 68.0% of patients having colonoscopy after a positive mt-sDNA test, (positive predictive value, was 68.0%), versus 42.3% of patients with colonoscopy only (P<0.0001). No significant differences in colonoscopy quality measures were observed between cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Colonoscopy after a positive mt-sDNA test was more frequently associated with CRC and colorectal neoplasia than colonoscopy alone. Positive mt-sDNA tests can enrich the proportion of colonoscopies with clinically relevant findings. Follow-up recommendations suggest that endoscopists do not inappropriately shorten rescreening intervals in mt-sDNA-positive patients with normal colonoscopy.

We systematically reviewed the efficacy and safety of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapy in acutely ill adults. METHODS In the Improving Oxygen Therapy in Acute-illness (IOTA) systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, HealthSTAR, LILACS, PapersFirst, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry from inception to Oct 25, 2017, for randomised controlled trials comparing liberal and conservative oxygen therapy in acutely ill adults (aged 18 years). Studies limited to patients with chronic respiratory diseases or psychiatric disease, patients on extracorporeal life support, or patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy or elective surgery were excluded. We screened studies and extracted summary estimates independently and in duplicate. We also extracted individual patient-level data from survival curves. The main outcomes were mortality (in-hospital, at 30 days, and at longest follow-up) and morbidity (disability at longest follow-up, risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia, any hospital-acquired infection, and length of hospital stay) assessed by random-effects meta-analyses. We assessed quality of evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017065697. FINDINGS 25 randomised controlled trials enrolled 16 037 patients with sepsis, critical illness, stroke, trauma, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest, and patients who had emergency surgery. Compared with a conservative oxygen strategy, a liberal oxygen strategy (median baseline saturation of peripheral oxygen [SpO2] across trials, 96% [range 94-99%, IQR 96-98]) increased mortality in-hospital (relative risk [RR] 121, 95% CI 103-143, I2=0%, high quality), at 30 days (RR 114, 95% CI 101-129, I2=0%, high quality), and at longest follow-up (RR 110, 95% CI 100-120, I2=0%, high quality). Morbidity outcomes were similar between groups. Findings were robust to trial sequential, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses. INTERPRETATION In acutely ill adults, high-quality evidence shows that liberal oxygen therapy increases mortality without improving other patient-important outcomes. Supplemental oxygen might become unfavourable above an SpO2 range of 94-96%. These results support the conservative administration of oxygen therapy.

METHODS: Ex-vivo intra-hepatic lymphocytes from HCV mono-infected and HCV/HIV co-infected individuals were assessed for immune responses to HIV and HCV antigens by polychromatic flow cytometry. RESULTS: HCV/HIV liver biopsies had similar frequencies of lymphocytes but lower percentages of CD4(+) T-cells compared to HCV biopsies. In co-infection, intra-hepatic HIV-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cells producing IFN- and TNF- were detected and were comparable in frequency to those that were HCV-specific. In co-infected individuals, viral-specific CD8(+) T-cells produced more of the fibrogenic cytokine, TNF-. In both mono- and co-infected individuals, intra-hepatic HCV-specific T-cells were poorly functional compared to HIV-specific T-cells. In co-infection, HAART was not associated with a reconstitution of intra-hepatic CD4(+) T-cells and was associated with reduction in both HIV and HCV-specific intra-hepatic cytokine responses.

RESULTS: Twenty five Veterans (24 men) tested positive for SC2. Of these, 5 remained asymptomatic, 9 got hospitalized, 6 died. No coinfection with influenza or other respiratory viruses identified. 11 health care workers (HCW) tested positive. Figure 1 shows test results by date. Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics, medical history, and laboratory findings. The median age was 74 years, with no difference in age between recovered and deceased, 73 vs. 77, P:0.105. Simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II score was higher in the deceased group (P=0.001) and so were D-dimer (admission and peak levels), CRP, LDH, and peak ferritin/procalcitonin levels. There was no ICU admission. Figure 2 illustrates the CLC 1 and 2 outline of beds depicting positive cases in sequence of detection. Initial spread of the virus was fast, affecting residents and HCW. CLC visits were prohibited, floating of staff minimized, internal group activities halted, infection control measures and education on proper use of personal protective equipment provided. A SC2 (or COVID) unit was created in CLC1 and all patients and staff got tested. Withdrawal of isolation precautions required resolution of symptoms, and two sequential negative NP PCR tests which were obtained after 14 days from diagnosis.

METHODS: Swedish electronic health data for incident asthma patients, 18 years, with at least one ICS collection (index date) between 2006 and 2017 were included. Exacerbations were defined as hospitalizations, emergency visits, or collection of oral corticosteroids (OCS). Probability of an asthma-related regular follow-up visit and probability of a follow-up visit after an exacerbation, both within 15 months, were estimated using the cumulative incidence function, time-to-event analysis, and incident rate ratios. RESULTS: In 51,349 asthma patients (mean age 47.6 years, 63% females), 17,573 had a regular asthma visit in primary or secondary care within 15 months after the index, yielding an overall probability of a visit of 37.4%. Patients with a follow-up visit had higher ICS collection and lower OCS collection than patients without regular visits. Among 22,097 patients with acute exacerbations, the probability of a visit within 15 months after an exacerbation was 31.0%. The probability of having a visit increased during the study period.

The K18-hACE2 mouse model was used to investigate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy of astodrimer sodium formulated in a mucoadhesive nasal spray. Animals received astodrimer sodium 1% nasal spray or PBS intranasally, or intranasally and intratracheally, for 7 days, and they were infected intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 after the first product administration on Day 0. Another group was infected intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 that had been pre-incubated with astodrimer sodium 1% nasal spray or PBS for 60 min before the neutralisation of test product activity. Astodrimer sodium 1% significantly reduced the viral genome copies (>99.9%) and the infectious virus (~95%) in the lung and trachea vs. PBS. The pre-incubation of SARS-CoV-2 with astodrimer sodium 1% resulted in a significant reduction in the viral genome copies (>99.9%) and the infectious virus (>99%) in the lung and trachea, and the infectious virus was not detected in the brain or liver. Astodrimer sodium 1% resulted in a significant reduction of viral genome copies in nasal secretions vs. PBS on Day 7 post-infection. A reduction in the viral shedding from the nasal cavity may result in lower virus transmission rates. Viraemia was low or undetectable in animals treated with astodrimer sodium 1% or infected with treated virus, correlating with the lack of detectable viral replication in the liver. Similarly, low virus replication in the nasal cavity after treatment with astodrimer sodium 1% potentially protected the brain from infection. Astodrimer sodium 1% significantly reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1, IL-1, TNF and TGF and the chemokine MCP-1 in the serum, lung and trachea vs. PBS. Astodrimer sodium 1% nasal spray blocked or reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication and its sequelae in K18-hACE2 mice. These data indicate a potential role for the product in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection or for reducing the severity of COVID-19.","output":"Protective Effects of Astodrimer Sodium 1% Nasal Spray Formulation against SARS-CoV-2 Nasal Challenge in K18-hACE2 Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The N501Y mutation in SARS-CoV-2 variants found in several strains from the UK, South Africa and Brazil has been linked to increased transmission.

However, the literature on transmission routes and risk factors for COVID-19 in HCWs is limited. AIM: To examine the characteristics and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs in a university teaching hospital in London, UK. METHODS: Staff records and virology testing results were combined to identify staff sickness and COVID-19 rates from March to April 2020. Comparisons were made with staff professional groups, department of work and ethnicity. Analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel(TM). FINDINGS: COVID-19 rates in our HCWs largely rose and declined in parallel with the number of community cases. White and non-white ethnic groups among our HCWs had similar rates of infection. Clinical staff had a higher rate of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than non-clinical staff, but total sickness rates were similar. Doctors had the highest rate of infection, but took the fewest sickness days. Critical Care had lower rates than the Emergency Department (ED), but rates in the ED declined once all staff were advised to use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). CONCLUSION: These findings show that sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among our hospital staff did not occur, beyond the community outbreak, even in the absence of strict infection control measures in non-clinical areas. The results also suggest that current PPE is effective when used appropriately. In addition, our findings emphasise the importance of testing both clinical and non-clinical staff groups during a pandemic.","output":"Characteristics and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in healthcare workers at a London teaching hospital()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The contagion of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) led to a global lockdown that put governments in emergency mode. With the total number of positive cases worldwide exceeding the 97.46 million mark, social distancing appears to be the only effective strategy to contain the virus at the moment. As a result, companies face obstacles and find it difficult to respond to this current challenge of remote working. The impact of the novel COVID-19 has created many new challenges, and many of us have had to adopt new ways of working. With the need for accessing to critical applications and the scalability of the infrastructure, cloud computing is emerging as an underlying technology. The cloud technology had a major role in fighting the epidemic; it becomes a salvation for governments and organizations in numerous fields of life, education, health, industry, communication, remote surveillance, and more information. Therefore, this study presents the benefits, characteristics and applications of cloud computing and explains how the cloud contributes to improving life in all regions of the world during COVID-19. It shows that the cloud computing helps countries in combating COVID 19, in education and health sectors, also in the economic and commercial aspects. It investigates the current state by distributing an online questionnaire to various people of academic and non-academic backgrounds in different places over the world in the ICT and education sectors.

CHIPPS was a cluster randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of integrating pharmacist independent prescribers into care homes to assume central responsibility for medicines management. This paper reports the parallel mixed-methods process evaluation. METHOD: Intervention arm consisted of 25 triads: Care homes (staff and up to 24 residents), General Practitioner (GP) and Pharmacist Independent Prescriber (PIP). Data sources were pharmaceutical care plans (PCPs), pharmacist activity logs, online questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively. Qualitative data were analysed thematically. Results were mapped to the process evaluation objectives following the Medical Research Council framework. RESULTS: PCPs and activity logs were available from 22 PIPs. Questionnaires were returned by 16 PIPs, eight GPs, and two care home managers. Interviews were completed with 14 PIPs, eight GPs, nine care home managers, six care home staff, and one resident. All stakeholders reported some benefits from PIPs having responsibility for medicine management and identified no safety concerns. PIPs reported an increase in their knowledge and identified the value of having time to engage with care home staff and residents during reviews. The research paperwork was identified as least useful by many PIPs. PIPs conducted medication reviews on residents, recording 566 clinical interventions, many involving deprescribing; 93.8% of changes were sustained at 6 months. For 284 (50.2%) residents a medicine was stopped, and for a quarter of residents, changes involved a medicine linked to increased falls risk. Qualitative data indicated participants noted increased medication safety and improved resident quality of life. Contextual barriers to implementation were apparent in the few triads where PIP was not known previously to the GP and care home before the trial. In three triads, PIPs did not deliver the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was generally implemented as intended, and well-received by most stakeholders. Whilst there was widespread deprescribing, contextual factors effected opportunity for PIP engagement in care homes. Implementation was most effective when communication pathways between PIP and GP had been previously well-established.

Although the technique itself is decades old with reliable approaches (eg. TaqMan essay) in the diagnosis of pathogens many people showed distrust in it during the SARS-CoV2 outbreak. This came mainly from not understanding or misunderstanding the principles of qPCR. This situation motivated us to design a simple laboratory practical class, in which students have opportunities to understand the underlying principles of qPCR and its advantages in microbiological diagnosis. Moreover, during the exercise, students can develop skills such as handling experimental assays, and the ability to solve problems, discuss their observations.

However, failure to address the issue directly, or worse, ignoring it, could deepen such concerns, resulting in lower vaccination rates, leading to elevated rates of illness and vaccine-preventable deaths among older adults. The aim of this study was to explore the rate of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among older adults in Saudi Arabia, along with the associated predicting factors and reasons for hesitancy. This study extracted data from a cross-sectional online survey on the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination in Saudi Arabia, which was conducted from 8 to 14 December 2020. The sample of the study included 488 older adults aged 50 and older. The major data analytic tools employed in the study were bivariate and multivariable regression analyses. Among the 488 participants, 214 (43.85%) reported willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine when available. Older men were more likely to be willing to be vaccinated (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.277; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.092C4.745) than older women. High levels of education were significantly associated with willingness to be vaccinated. Older adults who had previously refused any vaccine were less likely to take the COVID-19 vaccine (aOR: 0.358; 95% CI: 0.154C0.830). Those who expressed a high or very high level of concern related to becoming infected were more likely to accept the vaccine against COVID-19 (aOR: 4.437; 95% CI: 2.148C9.168). Adverse side effects (27.01%), and safety and efficacy concerns (22.63%) were the most commonly cited reasons for vaccine hesitancy. The vaccination acceptance rate among older adults in Saudi Arabia is low. Interventions designed specifically for older adults addressing worries and concerns related to the vaccine are of paramount importance. In particular, these interventions should be tailored to address gender-based and health literacy level differences.","output":"Willingness to Receive COVID-19 Vaccination among Older Adults in Saudi Arabia: A Community-Based Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HIV-1 infects gut associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) very early after transmission by multiple routes. The infected GALT consequently serves as the major reservoir for HIV-1 infection and could constantly shed HIV-1 and CD4(+ )T cells into the intestinal lumen.

We compared this to levels of HIV-1 RNA/DNA in urine and blood from the same subjects. Our results show that HIV-1 DNA, RNA and CD4 mRNA were detected in 8%, 19% and 31% respectively, of feces samples from infected subjects with detectable plasma viral load, and were not detected in any of subjects on ART with undetectable plasma viral load. In urine samples, HIV-1 DNA was detected in 24% of infected subjects with detectable plasma viral load and 23% of subjects on ART with undetectable plasma viral load. Phylogenetic analysis of the envelope sequences of HIV-1 revealed distinct virus populations in concurrently collected serum, feces and urine samples from one subject. In addition, our study demonstrated for the first time the presence of CD4 mRNA in fecal specimens of HIV-1 infected subjects, which could be used to assess GALT pathogenesis in HIV-1 infection.","output":"Detection of HIV-1 RNA/DNA and CD4 mRNA in feces and urine from chronic HIV-1 infected subjects with and without anti-retroviral therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Low-volume antibody assays can be used to track SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in settings where active testing for virus is limited and remote sampling is optimal.

We utilised pre-pandemic (n=984) and confirmed/suspected recent COVID-19 sera taken pre-vaccination rollout in 2020 (n=269). Assays measuring total antibody discriminated best between pre-pandemic and COVID-19 sera and were selected for diagnostic evaluation. In the blind evaluation, two of these assays (Spike Pan ELISA and Spike-RBD Bridging LIPS assay) demonstrated >97% specificity and >92% sensitivity for samples from COVID-19 patients taken >21 days post symptom onset or PCR test. These assays offered better sensitivity for the detection of COVID-19 cases than a commercial assay which requires 100-fold larger serum volumes. This study demonstrates that low-volume in-house antibody assays can provide good diagnostic performance, and highlights the importance of using well-characterised samples and controls for all stages of assay development and evaluation.

We found that dynamics lead to an extensive network of interglycan interactions that drive the formation of higher-order structure within the glycan shield. This structure defines diffuse boundaries between buried and exposed protein surface and creates a mapping of potentially immunogenic sites on Env. Analysis of Env expressed in different cell lines revealed how cryo-EM can detect subtle changes in glycan occupancy, composition, and dynamics that impact glycan shield structure and epitope accessibility. Importantly, this identified unforeseen changes in the glycan shield of Env obtained from expression in the same cell line used for vaccine production.

Severe cases such as, hyperinfection syndrome (HS) and disseminated strongyloidiasis (DS), can involve pulmonary manifestations. These manifestations frequently aid the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis. Here, we present the pulmonary manifestations and radiological findings of severe strongyloidiasis. METHODS: From January 2004 to December 2014, all patients diagnosed with severe strongyloidiasis at the University of the Ryukyus Hospital or affiliated hospitals in Okinawa, Japan, were included in this retrospective study. All diagnoses were confirmed by the microscopic or histopathological identification of larvae. Severe strongyloidiasis was defined by the presence of any of the following: 1) the identification of S. stercoralis from extra gastrointestinal specimens, 2) sepsis, 3) meningitis, 4) acute respiratory failure, or 5) respiratory tract hemorrhage. Patients were assigned to either HS or DS. Medical records were further reviewed to extract related clinical features and radiological findings. RESULTS: Sixteen severe strongyloidiasis cases were included. Of those, fifteen cases had pulmonary manifestations, eight had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (53%), seven had enteric bacterial pneumonia (46%) and five had pulmonary hemorrhage (33%). Acute respiratory failure was a common indicator for pulmonary manifestation (87%). Chest X-ray findings frequently showed diffuse shadows (71%). Additionally, ileum gas was detected for ten of the sixteen cases in the upper abdomen during assessment with chest X-ray. While, chest CT findings frequently showed ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 89% of patients. Interlobular septal thickening was also frequently shown (67%), always accompanying GGO in upper lobes. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study described HS/DS cases with pulmonary manifestations including, ARDS, bacterial pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage. Chest X-ray findings in HS/DS cases frequently showed diffuse shadows, and the combination of GGO and interlobular septal thickening in chest CT was common in HS/DS, regardless of accompanying pulmonary manifestations. This CT finding suggests alveolar hemorrhage could be used as a potential marker indicating the transition from latent to symptomatic state.

We used publicly available data from the California Health Interview Survey collected during January 2019 and December 2020 (N=15, 279; mean age= 64.2311.59; female: 52.7%). Approximately 11.0% of the sample used telehealth at least once. Bivariate and multivariate logistical regression analyses found that, compared with non-users, telehealth users were more likely to be having higher numbers of chronic conditions, with self-reported mental distress, living in urban areas, born in the US, with higher English proficiency, higher education, and having higher incomes. Age, race/ethnicity, and gender were not significantly correlated with telehealth usage. Logistic regression revealed that having mental distress (OR=1.48, 95% CI=1.29-1.71, p<0.01), more chronic conditions (OR=1.48, 95% CI=1.29-1.71, p<0.001) and living in an urban area (OR=1.93, 95% CI=1.36-2.74, p<0.001) were independently related to telehealth use.

METHODS In this randomised controlled, open-label trial, in 29 teaching hospitals and tertiary care centres in the Netherlands and the UK, adults with non-stricturing, ileocaecal Crohn's disease, in whom conventional therapy has failed were randomly allocated (1:1) by an internet randomisation module with biased-coin minimisation for participating centres and perianal fistula to receive laparoscopic ileocaecal resection or infliximab. Eligible patients were aged 18-80 years, had active Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum, and had not responded to at least 3 months of conventional therapy with glucocorticosteroids, thiopurines, or methotrexate. Patients with diseased terminal ileum longer than 40 cm or abdominal abscesses were excluded. The primary outcome was quality of life on the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were general quality of life, measured by the Short Form-36 (SF-36) health survey and its physical and mental component subscales, days unable to participate in social life, days on sick leave, morbidity (additional procedures and hospital admissions), and body image and cosmesis.

At 12 months, the mean SF-36 total score was 1121 (95% CI 1080-1162) in the resection group versus 1065 (1021-1109) in the infliximab group (mean difference 56, 95% CI -04 to 116), the mean physical component score was 477 (457-497) versus 446 (425-468; mean difference 31, 42 to 60), and the mean mental component score was 495 (470-521) versus 461 (433-489; mean difference 35, -03 to 73). Mean numbers of days of sick leave were 34 days (SD 71) in the resection group versus 14 days (47) in the infliximab group (p<00001), days not able to take part in social life were 18 days (63) versus 11 days (45; p=020), days of scheduled hospital admission were 65 days (38) versus 68 days (32; p=084), and the number of patients who had unscheduled hospital admissions were 13 (18%) of 73 versus 15 (21%) of 70 (p=068). Body-image scale mean scores in the patients who had resection were 160 (95% CI 152-168) at baseline versus 178 (171-184) at 12 months, and cosmetic scale mean scores were 176 (166-186) versus 186 (176-196). Surgical intervention-related complications classified as IIIa or worse on the Clavien-Dindo scale occurred in four patients in the resection group. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in two patients in the infliximab group. During a median follow-up of 4 years (IQR 2-6), 26 (37%) of 70 patients in the infliximab group had resection, and 19 (26%) of 73 patients in the resection group received anti-TNF.

Blood-based biomarker (BBBM) tests are a promising tool to improve triaging at the primary care level. We projected their impact on cost of and wait times during the diagnostic process. Methods We compare four scenarios for triaging patients at the primary care level from the perspective of the U.S. health care system: (1) cognitive test only (Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE]), (2) BBBM test only, (3) MMSE followed by BBBM if positive, and (4) BBBM followed by MMSE if positive. Results Referring patients to dementa specialists based on MMSE or BBBM results alone would continuously require more specialist appointments than projected to be available until 2050. Combining MMSE and BBBM would eliminate wait lists after the first 3 years and reduce average annual cost by $400 to 700 million, while increasing correctly identified cases by about 120,000 per year.

Although no direct human fatality resulted, many individuals feared for their lives or those of their loved ones. Objectives: (1) To estimate the prevalence of post-traumatic stress, major depressive, insomnia, generalized anxiety, and substance use disorders in the adult population of Fort McMurray 1 year after the evacuation; (2) To identify pre-, peri-, and post-disaster correlates of mental health disorders. Methods: A phone survey using random digit sampling was used to survey evacuees. A total of 1,510 evacuees (response rate = 40.2%, 55.5% women, mean age = 44.11, SD = 12.69) were interviewed between May 9th and July 28th, 2017. Five validated scales were administered: the PTSD Symptoms Checklist (PCL-5), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the depression and anxiety subscales of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9, GAD-7), and the CAGE Substance Abuse Screening Tool. Results: One year after the wildfires, 38% had a probable diagnosis of either post-traumatic stress, major depressive, insomnia, generalized anxiety, or substance use disorder, or a combination of these. Insomnia disorder was the most common, with an estimated prevalence of 28.5%. Post-traumatic stress, major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders were almost equally prevalent, with ~15% each. The estimated prevalence of substance use disorder was 7.9%. For all five mental health disorders, having a mental health condition prior to the fires was a significant risk factor, as well as having experienced financial stress or strain due to the economic decline already present in Fort McMurray. Five post-disaster consequences were significant predictors of four of the five disorders: decrease in work, decrease in social life, poorer current health status, increase in drug and alcohol use, and higher level of stress experienced since the fires. Conclusion: One year after the fires, more than one third of the evacuees had clinically significant psychological symptoms, including those of insomnia, post-traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, and substance use. This study helped identify individuals more at risk for mental health issues after a natural disaster and could guide post-disaster psychosocial support strategies.","output":"Psychological Symptoms Among Evacuees From the 2016 Fort McMurray Wildfires: A Population-Based Survey One Year Later"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The paucity of symptoms and the difficulties in wearing personal protective equipment make children a potential source of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection for health care workers (HCWs).

We aimed at investigating the rate and determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs working in a regional reference center in the Southern Italy. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs and investigate the relation between the infection rate and hours of exposure or number and characteristics of procedures, including nasopharyngeal swab, high-flow oxygen delivery, suctioning of airway secretions, sputum induction, and nebulizer administration. RESULTS: After 5 months of monitoring, 425.6 hours of SARS-CoV-2 exposure (18.5 hours per person), and 920 hospital procedures, no case of nosocomial transmission was reported among the 23 HCWs enrolled in the study.

There is a need for treatments to significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Hence, we delved deep into the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which is the virus that has caused COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is from the same family as SARS-CoV in which three small viral RNAs (svRNA) were recently identified; those svRNAs play a significant role in the virus pathogenesis in mice. Contribution: In this paper, we report potential orthologs of those three svRNAs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Instead of off-the-shelf search and alignment algorithms, which failed to discover the orthologs, we used a special alignment scoring that does not penalize C/T and A/G mismatches. RNA bases C and U both can bind to G; similarly, A and G both can bind to U, hence, our scoring. To validate our results, we confirmed the discovered orthologs are fully conserved in all the publicly available genomes of various strains of SARS-CoV-2; the loci at which the SARS-CoV-2 orthologs occur are close to the loci at which SARS-CoV svRNAs occur. We also report potential targets for these svRNAs. We hypothesize that the discovered orthologs play a role in pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and therefore, antagomir-mediated inhibition of these SARS-CoV-2 svRNAs inhibits COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 orthologs of pathogenesis-involved small viral RNAs of SARS-CoV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We take up a recently proposed compartmental SEIQR model with delays, ignore loss of immunity in the context of a fast pandemic, extend the model to a network structured on infectivity, and consider the continuum limit of the same with a simple separable interaction model for the infectivities $\\\\beta$. Numerical simulations show that the evolving dynamics of the network is effectively captured by a single scalar function of time, regardless of the distribution of $\\\\beta$ in the population. The continuum limit of the network model allows a simple derivation of the simpler model, which is a single scalar delay differential equation (DDE), wherein the variation in $\\\\beta$ appears through an integral closely related to the moment generating function of $u=\\\\sqrt{\\\\beta}$. If the first few moments of $u$ exist, the governing DDE can be expanded in a series that shows a direct correspondence with the original compartmental DDE with a single $\\\\beta$. Even otherwise, the new scalar DDE can be solved using either numerical integration over $u$ at each time step, or with the analytical integral if available in some useful form. Our work provides a new academic example of complete dimensional collapse, ties up an underlying continuum model for a pandemic with a simpler-seeming compartmental model, and will hopefully lead to new analysis of continuum models for epidemics.","output":"Complete dimensional collapse in the continuum limit of a delayed SEIQR network model with separable distributed infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 started circulating in China and this led to a major epidemic in Northern Italy between February and May 2020 Young children (aged &lt;5 years) seem to be less affected by this coronavirus disease (COVID-19) compared to adults, although there is very little information on the circulation of this new virus among children in Italy We retrospectively tested nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 in samples collected in young children between November, 2019 and March, 2020 in the context of the RSV ComNet study","output":"Sars-Cov2 Not Detected in a Pediatric Population With Acute Respiratory Infection in Primary Care in Central and Southern Italy From November 2019 to Early March 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seaweed lectins, especially high-mannose-specific lectins from red algae, have been identified as potential antiviral agents that are capable of blocking the replication of various enveloped viruses like influenza virus, herpes virus, and HIV-1 in vitro.

Although isolation at any age is harmful, previous studies have shown that isolation during adolescence, correlating with critical periods of brain development, can impair cognitive function and increase the risk for psychiatric illness later in life. In this study, we utilized a mouse model of adolescent social isolation (SI) and compared performance of isolated and group-housed mice on touchscreen-based continuous performance test (CPT) and fixed ratio/progressive ratio (FR/PR) tasks in adulthood. SI increased sensitivity in the CPT in male mice and had no effect in female mice. The increase in sensitivity was consistent across time bins within the 45-minute testing session and there were no SI effects on reaction times or reward retrieval latencies. A possible confound for performance in the CPT would be SI-induced changes in reward-seeking or motivation for the strawberry milk reward. We next compared the SI mice to their group-housed littermate controls on both FR and PR schedules of reinforcement and found that male SI mice earned significantly more reinforcers on FR schedules of reinforcement and had higher breakpoints on PR schedules compared to their group-housed littermates. SI had no effect on FR or PR performance in female mice. These data indicate that SI during adolescence has striking, sex-specific effects on reward-seeking behavior in adult mice and may provide a useful behavioral model for studying the link between SI and risk for neuropsychiatric disorders.","output":"Post-weaning social isolation increases reward-seeking behavior in a sex-specific manner in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the electronic properties of DNA by way of a tight-binding model applied to four particular DNA sequences.

The City of Belleville, Ontario has recently replaced its evening and nighttime fixed route bus service with an on-demand transit (ODT) service. Preliminary reports have found a 300% increase in nighttime bus ridership since the implementation of this service, yet to fully understand the social return on the investment in on-demand services, we must also quantify whether and for whom these new services have enabled time savings and increased levels of activity participation. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether riders are satisfied with the service, and whether satisfaction levels have an impact on activity participation. As such, this study explores the determinants of activity participation of ODT users using a custom ridership survey instrument. We collect information on travel experience, satisfaction, and perceived changes in activity participation due to ODT. We then performed a factor analysis and estimated structural equation models to identify the relationships between aspects of the ODT service and activity participation. Our results show that reliability and service quality are the most important aspects of the ODT services in terms of positively influencing activity participation, and that shorter wait times, are most likely to lead to an increase in activity participation. Our findings further suggest that Belleville can eliminate barriers to nighttime activity participation by providing reliable and affordable ODT service, and that ODT can be an effective solution to provide transit services for transport-poor in low demand areas or during low demand periods of the day.

There are no published data outside a supervised telemedicine setting regarding patients' experiences with these devices. Our objective was to explore patients' usage patterns and perceptions of using pulse oximetry at home. METHODS: Patients with chronic respiratory disease who had a pulse oximeter at home were recruited to complete a structured survey. RESULTS: Thirty participants with a range of chronic respiratory diseases (mean age 71 y, 16 females) were recruited. Most participants (83%) used home oxygen therapy. Pulse oximeters were bought online (46.7%), at a pharmacy (40%), at a medical equipment store (6.7%), through a clinic (3.3%), or from an oxygen supplier (3.3%). Use was self-initiated in 56.7% of cases and was based on a health care-related recommendation in 26.7% of cases. Sixty percent of participants used the oximeter daily, with 90% expressing confidence in interpreting their oximeter readings primarily due to education from health care professionals and in-patient experiences. Almost all participants adjusted their activity levels or management based upon oximeter readings. Most participants reported that using a pulse oximeter at home was helpful in judging their physical limitations and provided reassurance and confidence in their disease management.

We used a combination of contact tracing and genomic epidemiology to trace the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the state up until May 21, 2020 (1578 cases). We obtained 91 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 which clustered into seven lineages (Pangolin lineagesA, B, B.1, B.1.80, B.1.1, B.4, and B.6). The lineages in Karnataka were known to be circulating in China, Southeast Asia, Iran, Europe and other parts of India and are likely to have been imported into the state both by international and domestic travel. Our sequences grouped into 17 contact clusters and 24 cases with no known contacts. We found 14 of the 17 contact clusters had a single lineage of the virus, consistent with multiple introductions and most (12/17) were contained within a single district, reflecting local spread. In most of the 17 clusters, the index case (12/17) and spreaders (11/17) were symptomatic. Of the 91 sequences, 47 belonged to the B.6 lineage, including eleven of 24 cases with no known contact, indicating ongoing transmission of this lineage in the state.

Their diagnostic and therapeutic potential has been recognized for diseases such as cancer in which signaling defects are prominent. However, it is unclear to what extent exosomes and their cargo inform the progression of infectious diseases. We recently defined a subset of exosomes termed defensosomes that are mobilized during bacterial infection in a manner dependent on autophagy proteins. Through incorporating protein receptors on their surface, defensosomes mediated host defense by binding and inhibiting pore-forming toxins secreted by bacterial pathogens. Given this capacity to serve as decoys that interfere with surface protein interactions, we investigated the role of defensosomes during infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19. Consistent with a protective function, exosomes containing high levels of the viral receptor ACE2 in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid from critically ill COVID-19 patients was associated with reduced ICU and hospitalization times. We found ACE2+ exosomes were induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and activation of viral sensors in cell culture, which required the autophagy protein ATG16L1, defining these as defensosomes. We further demonstrate that ACE2+ defensosomes directly bind and block viral entry. These findings suggest that defensosomes may contribute to the antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 and expand our knowledge on the regulation and effects of extracellular vesicles during infection.","output":"ACE2-containing defensosomes serve as decoys to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the accuracy, susceptibility and specificity of MYCOPLASMA IST3, the next generation of the most popular culture-based in vitro diagnostic device designed to detect, identify and test the susceptibility of urogenital mycoplasma infections.

Sample types included vulvovaginal/endocervical or urethral swabs (dry swab or eSwab?), semen and urine samples, which included blinded analysis following addition of a panel of 80 characterized control strains. RESULTS Overall species identification was excellent for both Ureaplasma spp. (98.4% sensitivity, 99.7% specificity) and M. hominis (95.7% sensitivity, 100% specificity) relative to combined colony morphology on agar and quantitative PCR standards. Non-dilution-based bacterial load estimation by the assay was accurate between 83.7% (M. hominis) and 86.3% (Ureaplasma spp.) of the time (increased to 94.2% and 100%, respectively, if 10-fold variance was allowed) relative to colonies counted on agar. Resistance accuracy for Ureaplasma spp. varied from gold standards for only 11/605 of individual tests (major error rate = 1.8%) and for 14/917 individual tests for M. hominis (major error rate = 1.5%).

For example, this is true in combustion models (many transient chemical species are not of interest in a given reaction) and in epidemiological models (only certain subpopulations are consequential). Thus, it is common to use greatly reduced or partial models in which only the interactions among the species of interest are known. In this work, we explore the use of an embedded, sparse, and data-driven discrepancy operator to augment these partial interaction models. Preliminary results show that the model error caused by severe reductionse.g., elimination of hundreds of termscan be captured with sparse operators, built with only a small fraction of that number. The operator is embedded within the differential equations of the model, which allows the action of the operator to be interpretable. Moreover, it is constrained by available physical information and calibrated over many scenarios. These qualities of the discrepancy modelinterpretability, physical consistency, and robustness to different scenariosare intended to support reliable predictions under extrapolative conditions.","output":"Data-Driven Corrections of Partial LotkaCVolterra Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical and surgical priorities have changed dramatically following the COVID-19 pandemic declaration The rapid spread of the virus and the high number of cases has saturated the health system in our country and has forced many hospitals to redistribute resources to care for infected patients This has led to asignificant reduction in surgical activity, in some cases reaching the point of delaying all elective interventions by performing only urgent interventions The decrease in the number of infections with the progressive desaturation of hospitals has currently allowed us to enter a new phase of \\"de-escalation\\" or transition in order to recover our surgical activity in pediatric urology, which was practically canceled It is proposed how surgical care activities such as outpatient care should be deal twith, in addition to the different circuits that patients must maintain and, above all, their and professional safety","output":"[Impact of COVID-19 during de-escalation in pediatric urology.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the bulk and shear elastic properties of barely-compressed, \\"athermal\\" emulsions and find that the rigidity of the jammed solid fails at remarkably large critical osmotic pressures.

However, limited evidence revealed the PSPH influence on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, we observed that PSPH expression was upregulated in both HCC tissues and cell lines, which was determined by Western blotting. TCGA database showed that the PSPH protein levels were significantly upregulated and affected patient survival rates in HCC. Then gain- and loss-of-function manipulations were performed by transfection with a pcDNA-PSPH expression vector or a specific siRNA against PSPH in Huh7 cells. Huh7 cell proliferation, stemness, invasion and apoptosis were assessed by using CCK-8 test, colony formation assay, Transwell assay and Flow cytometry analysis, respectively, and levels of autophagy-related proteins were detected by using Western blotting. The results showed that PSPH could induce Huh7 cell autophagy, promote cell proliferation and invasion, and inhibit apoptosis. Knockdown of PSPH could inhibit Huh7 cell proliferation, invasion, and autophagy. Furthermore, PSPH activated Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and TGF beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), affected the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway, but could not activate calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) in Huh7 cells. Inhibition of either LKB1, TAK1, or AMPK could eliminate the effect of PSPH overexpression on Huh7 cell behaviors. However, inhibition of CaMKK could not influence the effect of PSPH overexpression on Huh7 cell behaviors.

Physiotherapists who hold unhelpful beliefs are less likely to adhere to guidelines and may negatively influence their patients beliefs. Pre-registration education is critical in moving towards a biopsychosocial model of care. This study aimed to investigate the changes in 2nd year physiotherapy students beliefs about LBP after a module on spinal pain management and determine whether these changes were maintained at the end of academic training. METHODS: During three consecutive calendar years, this longitudinal cohort study assessed physiotherapy students beliefs with the Back Pain Attitudes Questionnaires (Back-PAQ) in their 1st year, before and after their 2nd year spinal management learning module, and at the end of academic training (3rd year). Unpaired t-tests were conducted to explore changes in Back-PAQ score. RESULTS: The mean response rate after the spinal management module was 90% (128/143 students). The mean ( SD) Back-PAQ score was 87.73 ( 14.21) before and 60.79 ( 11.44) after the module, representing a mean difference of ? 26.95 (95%CI ? 30.09 to ? 23.80, p < 0.001). Beliefs were further improved at the end of 3rd year (? 7.16, 95%CI ? 10.50 to ? 3.81, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A spinal management learning module considerably improved physiotherapy students beliefs about back pain. Specifically, unhelpful beliefs about the back being vulnerable and in need of protection were substantially decreased after the module. Improvements were maintained at the end of academic training one-year later. Future research should investigate whether modifying students beliefs leads to improved clinical practice in their first years of practice.","output":"Changes in physiotherapy students beliefs and attitudes about low back pain through pre-registration training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a need for surveillance of COVID-19 to identify individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

One potential alternative is the nonstructural protease (nsp5, also known as Mpro/3CLpro) implicated in SARS-CoV-2 viral replication but not incorporated into virions. Here, we report a divalent substrate with a novel design, (Cys)2C(AA)xC(Asp)3, to interface gold colloids in the specific presence of Mpro leading to a rapid and colorimetric readout. Citrate- and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)-AuNPs were identified as the best reporter out of the 17 ligated nanoparticles. Furthermore, we empirically determined the effects of varying cysteine valence and biological media on the sensor specificity and sensitivity. The divalent peptide was specific to Mpro, that is, there was no response when tested with other proteins or enzymes. Furthermore, the Mpro detection limits in Tris buffer and exhaled breath matrices are 12.2 and 18.9 nM, respectively, which are comparable to other reported methods (i.e., at low nanomolar concentrations) yet with a rapid and visual readout.

Saliva and midturbinate (MT) nasal swabs are attractive alternatives, as they allow for self-collection and are well accepted by patients. Saliva also requires limited consumables. We compared the performance of health care provider-collected NP swabs, patient-collected MT swabs, and patient-collected saliva specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection using a laboratory-developed PCR assay that had received Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA. Of 281 total evaluable samples, 33 (11.7%) NP swabs, 33 (11.7%) MT swabs, and 32 (11.4%) saliva specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 following resolution of discordant results. Compared to NP swabs, saliva exhibited a sensitivity of 90.9% (30/33) and specificity of 99.2% (246/248), while patient-collected MT swabs exhibited a sensitivity of 93.9% (31/33) and specificity of 99.2% (246/248). When comparing to the consensus standard, the sensitivity was found to be 100% (31/31) for both NP and MT swabs and 96.8% (30/31) for saliva specimens, while specificity was the same in both NP swabs and saliva specimens (98.8% [247/250]) and 99.2% (248/250) for MT swabs. Pretreatment of saliva with proteinase K and heating for 15 min prior to extraction reduced the invalid rate from 26.7% (52/195) to 0% (0/195).

Some models that account for the deceased, quarantined or social distancing functions were also presented. However, in any local space the real data reveals that the effects of lock-down and traveling are significant in decreasing and increasing the impact of this virus respectively. Here, discrete and continuum models for the dynamics of this virus are suggested. The continuum dynamical model is studied in detail. The present model deals with exposed, infected, recovered and deceased individuals (EIRD), which accounts for the health isolation and travelers (HIT) effects. Up to now no exact solutions of the parametric-dependent, nonlinear dynamical system NLDS were found. In this work, our objective is to find the exact solutions of a NLDS. To this issue, a novel approach is presented where a NLDS is recast to a linear dynamical system LDS. This is done by implementing the unified method (UM), with auxiliary equations, which are taken coupled linear ODEs (LDS). Numerical results of the exact solutions are evaluated, which can be applied to data in a local space (or anywhere) when the initial data for the IRD are known. Here, as an example, initial conditions for the components in the model equation of COVID-19, are taken from the real data in Egypt. The results of susceptible, infected, recovered and deceased people are computed. The comparison between the computed results and the real data shows an agreement up to a relative error [Formula: see text]. On the other hand it is remarked that locking-down plays a dominant role in decreasing the number of infected people. The equilibrium states are determined and it is found that they are stable. This reveals a relevant result that the COVID 19 can endemic in the case of a disturbance in the number of the exposed people. This result can be interpreted as in what follows. When a disturbance occurs in the exposed number increases, so the number of infected people increases. Or COVID-19 is endemic. This result is, globally, valid. Furthermore, initial states control is analyzed, where region of initial conditions for infected and exposed is determined.

We demonstrate that mice acquiring a low social status (subordinate) in a lifelong chronic psychosocial stress (CPS) model, accrue widespread proteomic changes in the frontal/temporal cortex during aging. To better understand the significance of these stress-induced changes, we compared the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of subordinate mice to those of patients at varying stages of dementia. Sixteen and fifteen DEPs upregulated in subordinate mice were also upregulated in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, respectively. Seven of those upregulated proteins (CPE, ERC2, GRIN2B, SLC6A1, SYN1, WFS1) were shared by subordinate mice and patients with MCI or AD. Finally, comparison with a spatially detailed transcriptomic database revealed that the superior frontal gyrus and hippocampus had the greatest overlap between mice subjected to lifelong CPS and AD patients. Overall, most of the overlapping proteins were functionally associated with enhanced NMDA receptor mediated glutamatergic signaling, an excitotoxicity mechanism known to affect neurodegeneration.

Although substantial empirical research has addressed this topic, the literature is fragmented across subdisciplines, and an overarching theoretical framework is lacking. The first step toward constructing a unifying framework is identifying relevant phenomena. This systematic review of 6305 articles used text mining to identify phenomena relevant to adolescents emotion regulation. First, a baseline was established of relevant phenomena discussed in theory and recent narrative reviews. Then, article keywords and abstracts were analyzed using text mining, examining term frequency as an indicator of relevance and term co-occurrence as an indicator of association. The results reflected themes commonly featured in theory and narrative reviews, such as socialization and neurocognitive development, but also identified undertheorized themes, such as developmental disorders, physical health, external stressors, structural disadvantage, substance use, identity and moral development, and sexual development.

Those individuals are at risk of infection who are in close contact with a NCOVID-19 patient or who take care of NCOVID-19 patients. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of any infection in healthcare facilities. Therefore, healthcare workers should be aware of basic knowledge and all procedures concerning prevention and protection from NCOVID-19. ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to evaluate the awareness level of healthcare workers toward NCOVID-2019 in Pakistan. Material and MethodsA questionnaire was generated according to WHO information that was circulated among the healthcare workers of different hospitals and medical institutes of Pakistan.

A. baumannii poses as a serious threat to hospital facilities because of its ability to persist in the environment and acquire multi-drug resistance. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent of A. baumannii cross-infection and identify any gene clonality between isolates in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Methods Bacterial isolates of A. baumannii found in patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to the main Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Umberto I Teaching Hospital of Rome were collected between March 2020 and February 2021. Isolates were typed by pulsed-field electrophoresis to analyse their homology relationships. Results Overall, 196 SARS-CoV-2 patients were admitted to the ICU. They were mainly male (N = 138) and aged 63 years on average. Of these, 122 died, and 74 were discharged. A total of 157 strains of A. baumannii were isolated from 74 patients (38%), who had a higher mean hospital stay than patients in whom the bacterial strain had not been isolated (24.6 vs. 12.2 days). The genotypic analysis of 120 isolates revealed two main patterns (A and F) and a few subtypes, especially A8 (43%), A4 (29%), and A11 (10%). Clone A8 was found mainly between October 2020 and February 2021, clone A4 in April-December 2020 and January-February 2021, and A11 in December 2020 and January 2021. The strains were susceptible to colistin only, were isolated mostly from tracheobronchial aspirates (41%) or rectal swabs (35%) and accounted for 56 healthcare-associated infections (33% of which sustained by A4, 38% by A8, and 9% by A11). Conclusions The isolation of A. baumannii from patients with COVID-19 highlighted the importance of monitoring co-infections caused by this pathogen, which frequently shows a multi-drug resistant profile that may lengthen the hospital stay. It is essential to implement preventive measures to contain these infections. Key messages A. baumanni is a pathogen that needs to be monitored because it may lengthen the hospital stay of SARS-CoV-2 patients.

MethodsCT images of 14,339 COVID-19 patients with overall survival outcome were collected from 19 medical centers. Whole lung segmentations were performed automatically using a previously validated deep learning-based model, and regions of interest were further evaluated and modified by a human observer. All images were resampled to an isotropic voxel size, intensities were discretized into 64-binning size, and 105 radiomics features, including shape, intensity, and texture features were extracted from the lung mask. Radiomics features were normalized using Z-score normalization. High-correlated features using Pearson (R2>0.99) were eliminated. We applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOT) algorithm in only the training set for different models to overcome unbalance classes. We used 4 feature selection algorithms, namely Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Kruskal- Wallis (KW), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Relief. For the classification task, we used seven classifiers, including Logistic Regression (LR), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost (AB), Naive Bayes (NB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The models were built and evaluated using training and testing sets, respectively. Specifically, we evaluated the models using 10 different splitting and cross-validation strategies, including different types of test datasets (e.g. non-harmonized vs. ComBat-harmonized datasets). The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were reported for models evaluation. ResultsIn the test dataset (4301) consisting of CT and/or RT-PCR positive cases, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.83{+/-}0.01 (CI95%: 0.81-0.85), 0.81, and 0.72, respectively, were obtained by ANOVA feature selector + RF classifier. In RT-PCR-only positive test sets (3644), similar results were achieved, and there was no statistically significant difference. In ComBat harmonized dataset, Relief feature selector + RF classifier resulted in highest performance of AUC, reaching 0.83{+/-}0.01 (CI95%: 0.81-0.85), with sensitivity and specificity of 0.77 and 0.74, respectively. At the same time, ComBat harmonization did not depict statistically significant improvement relevant to non-harmonized dataset. In leave-one-center-out, the combination of ANOVA feature selector and LR classifier resulted in the highest performance of AUC (0.80{+/-}0.084) with sensitivity and specificity of 0.77 {+/-} 0.11 and 0.76 {+/-} 0.075, respectively.

We hypothesised that lockdown restrictions were associated with reductions in severe asthma exacerbations requiring emergency asthma admissions and/or leading to death. METHODS: Using data from Public Health Scotland and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank in Wales, we compared weekly counts of emergency admissions and deaths due to asthma over the first 18 weeks in 2020 with the national averages over 2015C2019. We modelled the impact of instigating lockdown on these outcomes using interrupted time-series analysis. Using fixed-effect meta-analysis, we derived pooled estimates of the overall changes in trends across the two nations. We also investigated trends in asthma-related primary care prescribing and emergency department (ED) attendances in Wales. RESULTS: Lockdown was associated with a 36% pooled reduction in emergency admissions for asthma (incidence rate ratio, IRR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.83, p value 0.001) across both countries.

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) represents the preferred revascularization strategy among patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A decline in the rates of primary PCI has been observed globally during the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Fear of exposure to in-hospital infection has been hypothesized as the main mechanism of this phenomenon, also contributing to a delayed presentation of patients with STEMI. However, a formal assessment of initial electrocardiograms (ECGs) among STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is still lacking. We therefore compared pre-hospital ECGs of STEMI patients hospitalized in Italy after the first reported case of COVID-19 on February 21. 2020 with data from the same period in 2019 to identifying potential changes between the two periods. Methods. Prehospital ECGs were obtained from the STEMI care network in the Campania region covering an area of about 5 8 million residents. STEMI patients were identified in the field through the emergency medical sen/ice (EMS) using a 12-lead ECG equipment available in the ambulance systems. A wireless transmission of prehospital ECGs for physician interpretation was performed by the EMS at the scene. Deidentified ECGs were analyzed by two expert reviewers who were blinded to date of recording. Pathological Q-waves were defined as a Q-wave with a duration 40 ms and/or depth 25% of the R-wave in the same lead or the presence of a Q-wave equivalent. These criteria have been shown to be associated with final infarct size at cardiac magnetic resonance. For all conventional STEMI, the timing of STEMI onset was estimated with the Anderson-Wilkins (AW) acuteness score, ranging from 1 (least acute) to 4 (most acute). Continuous data are reported as mean  standard deviation and compared using Student's t-test. Categorical data are reported as frequencies and percentages and compared using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata 14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). Results. From February 21, 2020, to April 16, 2020, a total of 3,239 prehospital ECGs were recorded by the emergency medical system and 167 (5.15%) were classified as STEMI. During the same period in 2019, 3,505 pre-hospital ECGs were recorded and 196 (5.59%) were classified as STEMI. There was no difference between the two study periods in terms of age, gender, type (conventional vs. non-conventional) and location of STEMI. Pathological Q-waves were present in 54.5% of ECGs recorded during the COVID-19 period compared with 22.1% of ECGs recorded in the same period in 2019 (risk difference 32.3, 95% confidence intervals [CI], 21.2 to 43.5 percentage points). There was also an increase in the mean number of Q-waves during the COVID-19 compared with the control period (1.4 vs. 0.9;p<0.001). These findings remained similar when QS-A nd qR complexes were analyzed separately. Consistently, the AW score was significantly lower during the COVID-19 period (2.4 vs. 2.8;p<0.001). Conclusions. Our data indicate that prehospital ECGs of STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic presented more frequently with signs of late ischemia compared with the equivalent period in 2019. Approximately, 1 out of 2 patients had already pathological Q-waves in the initial ECG. The AW acuteness score is superior to patient history (historical timing) in predicting myocardial salvage and mortality after reperfusion in STEMI patients, thus explaining the higher mortality rate and the increased risk of infarct-related complications observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings support the hypothesis that COVID-19 outbreak was associated with a deferral of first medical contact among STEMI patients, prompting the continuous need for public campaigns to increase awareness of ischemic symptoms and confidence in the hospitals organization to preserve their safety.","output":"Prehospital ECG in patients with acute myocardial infarction during the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare clinicopathologic features and outcomes between patients with familial non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (FNMTC) and patients with sporadic non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (SNMTC) after performing individual risk factor-matching. Additionally, the study evaluated a dynamic risk stratification (DRS) system to validate its usefulness for familial-type thyroid carcinoma. METHODS: After individual risk factor-matching, 286 patients remained in the FNMTC group, and 858 patients were assigned to the SNMTC group consisting of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The prognostic outcomes were compared between the two groups in a matched cohort. RESULTS: During the mean follow-up period of 142 months, recurrences were experienced by 64 patients in the sporadic group (7.5%) and 29 patients in the familial group (10.1%). In the multivariate analysis, the independent risk factors for recurrence were primary tumor size (p = 0.033), gross extrathyroidal extension (p = 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001). The independent risk factors did not include family history alone (p = 1.101) or the number of affected family members (p = 0.122 for 2 members and p = 0.625 for &#8805; 3 members). In this matched-cohort study, the DRS system was well adjusted in the FNMTC and SNMTC groups. Moreover, the proportion of DRS categories and the recurrence rate in each DRS category were similar between the familial and sporadic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Family history did not present a statistically significant association with a poor prognosis for PTC patients. With a family history of PTC alone, less aggressive treatment could be considered. In this matched cohort, DRS was adjusted well and could be useful in predicting prognosis, even for PTC patients with a family history of PTC.","output":"Comparison Between Familial and Sporadic Non-medullary Thyroid Carcinoma: A Retrospective Individual Risk Factor-Matched Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Treating acute respiratory failure in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is challenging due to the lack of knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology. Hypoxemia may be explained in part by the loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. The present study assessed the effect of almitrine, a selective pulmonary vasoconstrictor, on arterial oxygenation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. DESIGN: Single-center retrospective observational study. SETTING: ICU of Lille Teaching Hospital, France, from February 27, 2020, to April 14, 2020. PATIENTS: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia confirmed by positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 and acute respiratory distress syndrome according to Berlin definition. Data focused on clinicobiological features, ventilator settings, therapeutics, outcomes, and almitrine-related adverse events. INTERVENTIONS: Almitrine was considered in patients with severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2 ratio < 150 mm Hg) in addition to the recommended therapies, at an hourly IV delivery of 10 g/kg/min. Comparative blood gases were done before starting almitrine trial and immediately after the end of the infusion. A positive response to almitrine was defined by an increase of PaO2/FIO2 ratio greater than or equal to 20% at the end of the infusion. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 169 patients were enrolled. Thirty-two patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome received an almitrine infusion trial. In most cases, almitrine was infused in combination with inhaled nitric oxide (75%). Twenty-one patients (66%) were responders. The median PaO2/FIO2 ratio improvement was 39% (9-93%) and differs significantly between the responders and nonresponders (67% [39-131%] vs 6% [9-16%], respectively; p < 0.0001). The 28-day mortality rates were 47.6% and 63.6% (p = 0.39) for the responders and nonresponders, respectively. Hemodynamic parameters remained similar before and after the trial, not suggesting acute cor pulmonale. CONCLUSIONS: Almitrine infusion improved oxygenation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome without adverse effects. In a multistep clinical approach to manage severe hypoxemia in this population, almitrine could be an interesting therapeutic option to counteract the loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and redistribute blood flow away from shunting zones.","output":"Almitrine Infusion in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2-Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Single-Center Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives To determine the association between extended high frequency hearing loss and tinnitus in normal cochlear function based on a conventional audiometry chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) patient. Design and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 220 ears diagnosed as having CSOM with an equal number of tinnitus and without tinnitus groups. Only those with normal cochlear function based on conventional pure tone audiometry (250 Hz to 8 kHz) were included. They were further tested for hearing at extended high frequencies of up to 16 kHz. The severity of tinnitus was tested using a tinnitus questionnaire. Results The prevalence of extended high frequency hearing loss in the normal cochlear function CSOM patients with tinnitus was 81.8% (95% CI 74.5%, 89.1%), whereas the prevalence in the tinnitus negative group was 30.0% (95% CI 21.3%, 38.7%). There was a significant association between extended high frequency hearing loss and tinnitus in CSOM patients (P < .001). The average thresholds were significantly higher in the tinnitus group at all extended high frequencies tested with an increasing trend of significance toward the higher frequencies. However, this study did not observe any association between the severity of tinnitus and extended high frequency hearing loss. Conclusion The development of tinnitus among normal cochlear function CSOM patients indicates that the damage has occurred at a higher frequency level. However, the severity of tinnitus does not predict the degree of higher frequency hearing loss. Therefore, the presence of tinnitus warrants more aggressive monitoring and treatment to prevent sensorineural hearing loss from developing into the speech frequencies.

Objectives: The present study aimed to identify risk factors associated with oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) in COVID-19 patients. Methods: The total number of confirmed COVID-19 patients was 218 (105 cases with OPC and 113 controls without OPC). The questionnaire used in this study consisted of demographic data, treatment strategy, clinical and laboratory data, and underlying diseases collected from the onset of clinical OPC until the end of hospitalization. Results: Pseudomembranous candidiasis (77/105, 73.3%) was the most prevalent form of OPC in case patients. The majority of the cases (58.1%) and controls (58.4%) were males. Increasing age (P = 0.03) and hospitalization length (P = 0.016) were significantly associated with OPC in COVID-19 patients. Diabetes (P = 0.003), solid tumor (P = 0.019), and hypertension (P = 0.000) were the most common underlying conditions. The use of dentures (P = 0.003) and poor oral hygiene (P = 0.000) were related to OPC in the case group. Therapy with chloroquine (P = 0.012), IVIG (P = 0.001), diuretics (P = 0.000), and corticosteroid pulse therapy (P = 0.000) were significantly associated with developing OPC in case patients. Conclusions: Old age, hospitalization length, poor oral hygiene, corticosteroids use, diabetes, solid tumor, and hypertension may predispose COVID-19 patients to develop OPC. ? 2021, Author(s).

A posthumanist sociology is not a flattened ontology, in which we find agency in all things living and non-living. A posthumanist sociology asks instead what we do with the fundamental question of becoming both more and less human, following a surge of interest in decentring human exceptionalism. Moreover, a posthumanist sociology returns to the question of what it means to be an intersectional being, to proliferate the involvement of entities at the intersections of histories and social structures. Thus, it is a perspective that emerges from within the conditions of related crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic has highlighted the need to decentre human exceptionalism, raising a challenge for sociologists to return to the premises of what it means to be a social being. In some sense, management of the pandemic already assumes a decentring. This article builds an argument by first reviewing what broadly constitutes a posthumanist sociological perspective, then moves on to a case study of the interrelated human and non-human actors that constituted the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. The case study usefully marks the intersection between human and non-human bodies as nodes in the interpretive production chain of this global event C one that acknowledges human extensions and connections to multispecies and ecological systems. Such interlinkages become foundational to interrogating what it means to become human in a posthuman world.

Also, the death of a group of architects due to Corona virus will motivate them to form an architectural product that is friendly to the natural environment. Thus, the aim of the research was to uncover the interrelationship between flexibility and epidemics and the role of each one to shape a sustainable architectural output. Accordingly, the research problem was to explore the role of Flexibility in Sustainable epidemic-resistant design. The research approach is to clarify the foundations of epidemic-resistant architecture as well as its characteristics and standards by building a knowledge framework, then a comprehensive theoretical framework from architectural literaturetos to be embodied in its final form in three main vocabulary, namely: foundations of epidemic-resistant architecture, characteristics of sustainable flexible architecture, and the standard for social spacing architecture. It has been applied to elected projects to clarify the extent to which these indicators have been achieved and to reach the conclusions, which made clear that flexibility and resisting architectural output is the extent of its ability to survive in the face of disasters and epidemics, and this is an ideal time to rethink how to develop new design standards and address existing structures to achieve the sustainability.","output":"Flexibility in sustainable architecture output Resistance to epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection are at risk for thrombotic complications necessitating use of therapeutic unfractionated heparin (UFH) Full-dose anticoagulation limits requirements for organ support interventions in moderately ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Given this benefit, it is important to evaluate response to therapeutic anticoagulation in this population Objectives The aim of this study was to assess therapeutic UFH infusions and associated bleeding risk in patients with COVID-19 Patients/Methods This retrospective cohort study includes patients at Brigham and Women?s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, receiving weight-based nursing-nomogram titrated UFH infusion during a 10-week surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations Of 358 patients on therapeutic UFH during this interval, 97 (27 1%) had confirmed COVID-19 Patient characteristics, laboratory values, and information regarding UFH infusion and bleeding events were obtained from the electronic medical record Results Patients who were COVID-19 positive had fewer therapeutic activatrd partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared to COVID-19?negative patients (median rate, 40 0% vs 53 1%;P &lt; 0005) Both major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were increased in COVID-19?positive patients, with major bleeding observed in 10 3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5 7%-17 9%) of patients who were COVID-19 positive and 3 1% (95% CI, 1 6%-5 9%) of patients who were COVID-19 negative (P &lt; 005) In logistic regression, bleeding events were associated with receiving UFH for longer than 7 days, but not platelet count, coagulation, or inflammatory measurements Conclusions Our data indicate a higher incidence of bleeding complications in patients with COVID-19 receiving weight-based nursing-nomogram titrated UFH infusions despite a higher prevalence of subtherapeutic aPTTs in this population These data underscore the need for prospective studies aimed at improving the quality and safety of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19","output":"Management of therapeutic unfractionated heparin in COVID-19 patients: A retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has spread explosively throughout the world and has since been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients aged 18 years old who were placed in an awake prone position due to hypoxemic respiratory failure and suspected COVID-19. The patients were selected from a tertiary center in Cartagena, Colombia, between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collated, and all the variables were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The median age of the participants was 63 (IQR, 48.8-73) years (survivors: 59 [IQR, 43.568] years vs. non-survivors: 70 [IQR, 63-78] years, P  .001). Of the 1470 patients admitted for respiratory symptoms, 732 (49.8%) were hospitalized for more than 24a? h, and 212 patients developed respiratory failure and required COT and APP (overall hospital mortality, 34% [73/212]).

A total of 231 patients with T1 SRM were included in the main analysis. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, biopsy and procedural details, clinical outcomes, complication rates, and changes in renal function were compared in patients with malignant SRMs. Survival rates were compared using log-rank test. RESULTS A total of 142 patients underwent PA and 89 patients underwent NE, with a respective mean follow-up period of 2.50 (SD 1.77) and 1.85 (SD 0.97) years (P = 0.029). Rate of intervention for benign tumors was similar in PA (n = 21, 15%) and NE (n = 16, 18%; P = 0.520) without routine pre-procedural biopsy. Routine pre-procedural biopsy resulted in zero benign tumors treated in the PA cohort. Tumor recurrence was similar and cumulative survival was similar in both groups (P = 0.287). Residual tumor was observed in 18 PA patients. Complication rates were lower for PA than for NE (9 vs 30%, P < 0.001). A significant reduction in eGFR was observed after NE (12.1 mL/min/1.73 m2; P = 0.009) relative to PA (5.9 mL/min/1.73 m2; P = 0.060). CONCLUSION PA is a safe alternative to NE in the treatment of SRM, with similar overall survival and decreased complication rates.

It has particularly drawn attention to the lack of approved small-molecule drugs to inhibit SARS coronaviruses. Importantly, lessons learned from the SARS outbreak of 2002C2004, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1), can be applied to current drug discovery ventures. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 both possess two cysteine proteases, the main protease (M(pro)) and the papain-like protease (PL(pro)), which play a significant role in facilitating viral replication, and are important drug targets. The non-covalent inhibitor, GRL-0617, which was found to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-1, and more recently SARS-CoV-2, is the only PL(pro) inhibitor co-crystallised with the recently solved SARS-CoV-2 PL(pro) crystal structure. Therefore, the GRL-0617 structural template and pharmacophore features are instrumental in the design and development of more potent PL(pro) inhibitors. In this work, we conducted scaffold hopping using GRL-0617 as a reference to screen over 339,000 ligands in the chemical space using the ChemDiv, MayBridge, and Enamine screening libraries. Twenty-four distinct scaffolds with structural and electrostatic similarity to GRL-0617 were obtained. These proceeded to molecular docking against PL(pro) using the AutoDock tools. Of two compounds that showed the most favourable predicted binding affinities to the target site, as well as comparable protein-ligand interactions to GRL-0617, one was chosen for further analogue-based work. Twenty-seven analogues of this compound were further docked against the PL(pro), which resulted in two additional hits with promising docking profiles. Our in silico pipeline consisted of an integrative four-step approach: (1) ligand-based virtual screening (scaffold-hopping), (2) molecular docking, (3) an analogue search, and, (4) evaluation of scaffold drug-likeness, to identify promising scaffolds and eliminate those with undesirable properties. Overall, we present four novel, and lipophilic, scaffolds obtained from an exhaustive search of diverse and uncharted regions of chemical space, which may be further explored in vitro through structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies in the search for more potent inhibitors. Furthermore, these scaffolds were predicted to have fewer off-target interactions than GRL-0617. Lastly, to our knowledge, this work contains the largest ligand-based virtual screen performed against GRL-0617.","output":"Establishing an Analogue Based In Silico Pipeline in the Pursuit of Novel Inhibitory Scaffolds against the SARS Coronavirus 2 Papain-Like Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.ensci.2020.100275.].","output":"Corrigendum to Encephalopathy in COVID-19 patients; viral, parainfectious, or both?

Studies of the 92-gene assay have demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy compared with standard pathology techniques and improved survival in patients treated on the basis of assay results. The current study assessed the clinical impact of the 92-gene assay on diagnostic and treatment decisions for patients with unknown or uncertain diagnoses. METHODS: Patients in this prospective, multi-institutional, decision-impact study included those for whom the 92-gene assay was ordered as part of routine care. Participating physicians completed electronic case report forms that contained standardized, specialty-specific questionnaires. Data collection included patient and tumor characteristics and clinical history. The key study objective of clinical impact was calculated on the basis of changes in final diagnosis and treatment after testing. RESULTS: Data collection included 444 patients, 107 physicians (73 oncologists and 34 pathologists), and 28 sites. Molecular diagnoses from 22 different tumor types and subtypes across all cases were provided in 95.5% of patients with a reportable result (n = 397). Physicians reported that the 92-gene assay was used broadly for diagnostic dilemmas that ranged from single suspected tumor type (29%) to a differential diagnosis of two or more suspected tumor types (30%) or cancers of unknown primary (41%). Integration of 92-gene assay results led to a change in the recommended treatment in 47% of patients. CONCLUSION: Findings from this clinical utility study demonstrate that the 92-gene assay led to a change in treatment decisions in every other patient case.

METHODS We prospectively analyzed patients who underwent PIRRT treatments at a COVID-19 reference hospital in Mexico City. Intradialytic hypotension was defined as a systolic blood pressure decrease of 20 mm Hg or an increase of 100% in vasopressor dose. RESULTS We identified 136 AKI cases (60.7%) in 224 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Among them, 21 (15%) underwent PIRRT (130 sessions) due to stage 3 AKI. The median age of the cohort was 49 (range 36-73) years, 17 (81%) were male, 7 (33%) had diabetes, and the median time between symptoms onset and PIRRT initiation was 12 (interquartile range [IQR] 7-14) days. The median of PIRRT procedures for each patient was 5 (IQR 4-9) sessions. In 108 (83%) PIRRT sessions, the total ultrafiltration goal was achieved. In 84 (65%) PIRRT procedures, there was a median increase in norepinephrine dose of +0.031 mcg/kg/min during PIRRT (IQR 0.00 to +0.07). Intradialytic hypotensive events occurred in 56 (43%) procedures. Fifteen (12%) PIRRT treatments were discontinued due to severe hypotension. Vasopressor treatment at PIRRT session onset (OR 6.2, 95% CI 1.4-28.0, p: 0.02) and a pre-PIRRT lactate 3.0 mmol/L (OR 4.63, 95% CI 1.3-12.8, p: 0.003) were independently and significantly associated with the risk of hypotension during PIRRT. During follow-up, 11 patients (52%) recovered from AKI and respiratory failure and 9 (43%) died. Several adaptations to our PIRRT protocol during the COVID-19 outbreak are presented. CONCLUSIONS PIRRT was feasible in the majority of COVID-19 patients with ARDS and severe AKI, despite frequent transitory intradialytic hypotensive episodes.

The internet is a major source of health information. eHealth literacy is the ability of individuals to find, assess, and use health information available on the internet. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to assess coronavirus-related eHealth literacy and examine the relationship between eHealth literacy and COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs). METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey of a representative sample of 1074 US adults. We adapted the 8-item eHealth Literacy Scale to develop the Coronavirus-Related eHealth Literacy Scale (CoV-eHEALS) to measure COVID-19-related knowledge, conspiracy beliefs, and adherence to protective behaviors (eg, wearing facial masks and social distancing). Our analyses identified sociodemographic associations with the participants' CoV-eHEALS scores and an association between the CoV-eHEALS measure and COVID-19 KAPs. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the adapted CoV-eHEALS measure was high (Cronbach &#945;=.92). The mean score for the CoV-eHEALS was 29.0 (SD 6.1). A total of 29% (306/1074) of the survey participants were classified as having low coronavirus-related eHealth literacy (CoV-eHEALS score <26). Independent associations were found between CoV-eHEALS scores and ethnicity (standardized ?=-.083, P=.016 for Black participants) and education level (standardized ?=-.151, P=.001 for participants with high-school education or lower). Controlling for demographic characteristics, CoV-eHEALS scores demonstrated positive independent associations with knowledge (standardized ?=.168, P<.001) and adherence to protective behaviors (standardized ?=.241, P<.001) and a negative association with conspiracy beliefs (standardized ?=-.082, P=.009). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an estimate of coronavirus-related eHealth literacy among US adults. Our findings suggest that a substantial proportion of US adults have low coronavirus-related eHealth literacy and are thus at a greater risk of lower and less-protective COVID-19 KAPs. These findings highlight the need to assess and address eHealth literacy as part of COVID-19 control efforts. Potential strategies include improving the quality of health information about COVID-19 available on the internet, assisting or simplifying web-based search for information about COVID-19, and training to improve general or coronavirus-specific search skills.","output":"Relationship Between Coronavirus-Related eHealth Literacy and COVID-19 Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices among US Adults: Web-Based Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How does the intersection of authoritarian populism and a global pandemic reinforce the suppression of human rights, dismantle environmental protections, and accelerate resource extraction? In parts of Southeast Asia, the rise of authoritarian regimes has created conditions of impunity in which state and non-state actors have exploited restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic to restrain activism, contain indigenous livelihoods, and intensify resource exploitation. This article explores how political control and violence against activists (defenders') under authoritarian Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte have intersected with and been reinforced through COVID-19 health measures to curtail grass-roots efforts to protect social and environmental safeguards. Since March 2020, violence against defenders has gone viral as activism in the country has been quarantined. Under Duterte's authoritarian populist rhetoric, state actors, parastatal and shadowy assassins have allegedly used public health measures to suppress activism further, enabling the harassment, arrests, and deaths of defenders and the intensification of resource extraction. Based on a critical review of news media and conservation policy, I describe the history and current context of defenders being 'quarantined' by authorities using lockdown measures to coercively suppress social and environmental activism across the country. I examine cases from Palawan Island to show how political authorities and elites have used COVID-19 to suppress defender mobility and enforcement practices and how lulls in defending and discourses of 'pandemic recovery' have facilitated mining and deforestation. The conclusion asserts that paying attention to how political conjunctures produce violent governance and local resistance reveals civil society's crucial role and vulnerabilities in protecting human rights and the environment in the Philippines and Southeast Asia.","output":"Quarantining activism: COVID-19, frontline defenders and intensifying extractivism in the Philippines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ivermectin is a safe, inexpensive and effective early COVID-19 treatment validated in 20+ RCTs.

With respect to HCC, ablation treatments are considered as upfront treatments in patients with early-stage disease, while in colorectal liver metastases (CLM), they can be employed as an upfront treatment or in association with surgical resection. The main prognostic feature of ablation is the tumor size, since the goal of the treatment is the necrosis of all viable tumor tissue with an adequate tumor-free margin. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are the most employed ablation techniques. Ablation therapies in HCC and liver metastases have presented a challenge to radiologists, who need to assess response to determine complication-related treatment. Complications, defined as any unexpected variation from a procedural course, and adverse events, defined as any actual or potential injury related to the treatment, could occur either during the procedure or afterwards. To date, RFA and MWA have shown no statistically significant differences in mortality rates or major or minor complications. To reduce the rate of major complications, patient selection and risk assessment are essential. To determine the right cost-benefit ratio for the ablation method to be used, it is necessary to identify patients at high risk of infections, coagulation disorders and previous abdominal surgery interventions. Based on risk assessment, during the procedure as part of surveillance, the radiologists should pay attention to several complications, such as vascular, biliary, mechanical and infectious. Multiphase CT is an imaging tool chosen in emergency settings. The radiologist should report technical success, treatment efficacy, and complications.

As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the 2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV.

Although such models are often deterministic, these models suffer from a wide range of uncertainties. We argue that uncertainty quantification is crucial for computer model validation and reproducibility. We present a statistical framework, termed history matching, for performing global parameter search by comparing model output to the observed data. We employ Gaussian process (GP) emulators to produce fast predictions about model behaviour at the arbitrary input parameter settings allowing output uncertainty distributions to be calculated. History matching identifies sets of input parameters that give rise to acceptable matches between observed data and model output given our representation of uncertainties. Modellers could proceed by simulating computer models outputs of interest at these identified parameter settings and producing a range of predictions. The variability in model results is crucial for inter-model comparison as well as model development.

The robustness of the model was tested with the Monte Carlo Simulation method (MCM) based one-sample t-test. The model was validated using the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and GUM's MCM approaches. The results showed that to dispatch at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to 7.8 billion people, nearly 8000 Boeing 747 flights will be needed, releasing approximately 8.1  0.30 metric kilotons (kt) of CO(2).

It is defined clinically as failure to conceive after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. The contribution of various aetiological factors to infertility differs per population. The causes of infertility have not been assessed in Zimbabwe. Our objectives were to determine the reproductive characteristics, causes and outcomes of women presenting for infertility care. METHODS: A retrospective and prospective study of women who had not conceived within a year of having unprotected intercourse presenting in private and public facilities in Harare was done. A diagnosis was made based on the history, examination and results whenever these were deemed sufficient. Data was analysed using STATA SE/15. A total of 216 women were recruited. RESULTS: Of the 216 women recruited, two thirds (144) of them had primary infertility. The overall period of infertility ranged from 1 to 21 years with an average of 5.6  4.7 years whilst 98 (45.4%) of the couples had experienced 2C4 years of infertility and 94 (43.5%) had experience 5 or more years of infertility. About 1 in 5 of the women had irregular menstrual cycles with 10 of them having experienced amenorrhoea of at least 1 year. Almost half of the participants (49%) were overweight or obese. The most common cause for infertility was unexplained in 22% of the women followed by tubal blockage in 20%, male factor in 19% and anovulation in 16%. Of the 49 (22.7%) women who conceived 21(9.7%) had a live birth while 23 (10.7%) had an ongoing pregnancy at the end of follow up. Thirty-seven (17.1%) had Assisted Reproduction Techniques (ART) in the form of Invitro-fertilisation/Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (IVF/ICSI) or Intra-Uterine Insemination (IUI). Assisted Reproduction was significantly associated with conception. CONCLUSION: Most women present when chances of natural spontaneous conception are considerably reduced. This study shows an almost equal contribution between tubal blockage, male factor and unexplained infertility. Almost half of the causes are female factors constituted by tubal blockage, anovulation and a mixture of the two. Improved access to ART will result in improved pregnancy rates.

Because radiographs such as X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans are cost-effective and widely available at public health facilities, hospital emergency rooms (ERs), and even at rural clinics, they could be used for rapid detection of possible COVID-19-induced lung infections. Therefore, toward automating the COVID-19 detection, in this paper, we propose a viable and efficient deep learning-based chest radiograph classification (DL-CRC) framework to distinguish the COVID-19 cases with high accuracy from other abnormal (e.g., pneumonia) and normal cases. A unique dataset is prepared from four publicly available sources containing the posteroanterior (PA) chest view of X-ray data for COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal cases. Our proposed DL-CRC framework leverages a data augmentation of radiograph images (DARI) algorithm for the COVID-19 data by adaptively employing the generative adversarial network (GAN) and generic data augmentation methods to generate synthetic COVID-19 infected chest X-ray images to train a robust model. The training data consisting of actual and synthetic chest X-ray images are fed into our customized convolutional neural network (CNN) model in DL-CRC, which achieves COVID-19 detection accuracy of 93.94% compared to 54.55% for the scenario without data augmentation (i.e., when only a few actual COVID-19 chest X-ray image samples are available in the original dataset). Furthermore, we justify our customized CNN model by extensively comparing it with widely adopted CNN architectures in the literature, namely ResNet, Inception-ResNet v2, and DenseNet that represent depth-based, multi-path-based, and hybrid CNN paradigms. The encouragingly high classification accuracy of our proposal implies that it can efficiently automate COVID-19 detection from radiograph images to provide a fast and reliable evidence of COVID-19 infection in the lung that can complement existing COVID-19 diagnostics modalities.","output":"DL-CRC: Deep Learning-Based Chest Radiograph Classification for COVID-19 Detection: A Novel Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic spread, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency on April 7, 2020 for seven prefectures, and on April 16, 2020 for all prefectures.

The present study examined the association of the mobility change in working, nightlife, and residential places and the COVID-19 outbreaks in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya metropolitan areas in Japan. METHODS: First, we calculated the daily mobility change in working, nightlife, and residential places compared to the mobility before the outbreak using mobile device data. Second, we estimated the sensitivity of mobility changes to the reproduction number by generalized least squares. RESULTS: Mobility change had already started in March, 2020. However, mobility reduction in nightlife places was particularly significant due to the state of emergency declaration. Although the mobility in each place type was associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, the mobility changes in nightlife places were more significantly associated with the outbreak than those in the other place types.

Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with crucial mutations pose a global challenge in the context of therapeutic drugs and vaccines developing globally. There are currently no specific therapeutics or vaccines available to combat SARS-CoV-2 devastation. Concerning this, the current study aimed to identify and characterize the mutations found in the Nsp13 of SARS-CoV-2 in Indian isolates. Methods: In the present study, the Clustal omega tool was used for mutational analysis. The impact of mutations on protein stability, flexibility, and function was predicted using the DynaMut and PROVEAN tools. Furthermore, B-cell epitopes contributed by Nsp13 were identified using various predictive immunoinformatic tools. Results: Non-structural protein Nsp13 sequences from Indian isolates were analyzed by comparing them with the firstly reported Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) protein sequence in Wuhan, China. Out of 825 Nsp13 protein sequences, a total of 38 mutations were observed among Indian isolates. Our data showed that mutations in Nsp13 at various positions (H164Y, A237T, T214I, C309Y, S236I, P419S, V305E, G54S, H290Y, P53S, A308Y, and A308Y) have a significant impact on the protein's stability and flexibility. Moreover, the impact of Nsp13 mutations on protein function was predicted based on the PROVEAN score that indicated 15 mutants as neutral and 23 mutants as deleterious effects. Immunological parameters of Nsp13, such as antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity, were evaluated to predict the potential B-cell epitopes. The predicted peptide sequences were correlated with the observed mutants. Our predicted data showed that there are seven high-rank linear epitopes as well as 18 discontinuous B-cell epitopes based on immunoinformatic tools. Moreover, it was observed that out of the total 38 identified mutations among Indian SARS-CoV-2 Nsp13 protein, four mutant residues at positions 142 (E142), 245 (H245), 247 (V247), and 419 (P419) were localised in the predicted B cell epitopic region.

Chloroquine appears to inhibit in vitro SARS virus' replication and to interfere with SARS-CoV2 receptor (ACE2). Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine impede lysosomal activity and autophagy, leading to a decrease of antigen processing and presentation. They are also known to interfere with endosomal Toll-like receptors signaling and cytosolic sensors of nucleic acids, which result in a decreased cellular activation and thereby a lower type I interferons and inflammatory cytokine secretion. Given the antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, there is a rational to use them against SARS-CoV2 infection. However, the anti-interferon properties of these molecules might be detrimental, and impaired host immune responses against the virus. This duality could explain the discrepancy with the recently published studies on CQ/HCQ treatment efficacy in COVID-19 patients.

However, whether it decreases mortality remains unknown. PURPOSE: We aimed to explore the association between QPT use and in-hospital mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study based on a real-world database was conducted. METHODS: We identified patients consecutively hospitalized with COVID-19 in 15 hospitals from a national retrospective registry in China, from January through May 2020. Data on patients' characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were extracted from the electronic medical records. The association of QPT use with COVID-19 related mortality was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models based on propensity score analysis. RESULTS: Of the 8939 patients included, 28.7% received QPT. The COVID-19 related mortality was 1.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8% to 1.7%) among the patients receiving QPT and 4.8% (95% CI 4.3% to 5.3%) among those not receiving QPT. After adjustment for patient characteristics and concomitant treatments, QPT use was associated with a relative reduction of 50% in-hospital COVID-19 related mortality (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.66 p < 0.001). This association was consistent across subgroups by sex and age. Meanwhile, the incidences of acute liver injury (8.9% [95% CI, 7.8% to 10.1%] vs. 9.9% [95% CI, 9.2% to 10.7%]; odds ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.81% to 1.14%], pa?=a?0.658) and acute kidney injury (1.6% [95% CI, 1.2% to 2.2%] vs. 3.0% [95% CI, 2.6% to 3.5%]; odds ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.17], pa?=a?0.318) were comparable between patients receiving QPT and those not receiving QPT. The major study limitations included that the study was an observational study based on real-world data rather than a randomized control trial, and the quality of data could be affected by the accuracy and completeness of medical records. CONCLUSIONS: QPT was associated with a substantially lower risk of in-hospital mortality, without extra risk of acute liver injury or acute kidney injury among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","output":"Association between use of Qingfei Paidu Tang and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: A national retrospective registry study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 health disaster has had a dramatic impact on the global hospitality industry, affecting millions of people.

We surveyed an online convenience sample of currently working pregnant people living in the U.S. (n = 1,417) to determine whether COVID-19-related changes to how long individuals planned to work during their pregnancy, and uncertainty about these changes, were associated with prenatal depression. As hypothesized, both COVID-19-related work-plan changes (OR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.36C2.42, p < 0.001) and uncertainty about the precise nature of these changes (OR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.14C6.0, p = 0.022) were associated with significantly higher odds of a clinically-significant depression score.

Pharmacists have the ability to perform certain point-of-care tests under federal regulations. On April 8, 2020, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health issued new guidance authorizing licensed pharmacists to order and administer COVID-19 tests. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the views of pharmacists about pharmacist-ordered and -administered COVID-19 testing. METHODS: A 13-item questionnaire was developed to survey pharmacists who currently hold an active license in Rhode Island. RESULTS: A total of 122 (13.8%) pharmacists consented and responded to at least 1 question of the survey. The results indicated that the primary concern of the pharmacists in regard to performing COVID-19 testing was spreading the infection to family members (71.3%). Becoming personally infected (59.8%) and not having access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (62.3%) were the second and third most common concerns of the pharmacists. Almost all of the pharmacists (99.9%) responded that they would be willing to take part in the testing process if they had appropriate PPE. A total of 46% of the pharmacists expressed concern regarding reimbursement for their company, whereas 56% of the pharmacists requested personal compensation for this service. CONCLUSION: Expanding the pool of health care providers who can perform testing is critical to achieving and sustaining proposed testing thresholds. Rhode Island pharmacists are willing to take part in performing COVID-19 testing provided appropriate PPE is available and services are reimbursed. Pharmacists are the most accessible and essential health care providers willing to take on critically important roles during the COVID-19 pandemic provided appropriate safety measures can be met.","output":"Pharmacists' response during a pandemic: A survey on readiness to test during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread among human populations, genetic changes occur and accumulate in the circulating virus. Some of these genetic changes have caused amino acid mutations, including deletions, which may have potential impact on critical SARS-CoV-2 countermeasures, including vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Considerable efforts have been made to categorize the amino acid mutations of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein along with certain mutations in other regions within the S protein as specific variants in an attempt to study the relationship between these mutations and the biological behavior of the virus. However, the currently used whole genome sequencing surveillance technologies can test only a small fraction of the positive specimens with high viral loads and often generate uncertainties in nucleic acid sequencing that needs additional verification for precision determination of mutations. This article introduces a generic protocol to routinely sequence a 437-bp nested RT-PCR cDNA amplicon of the ACE2 RBD and a 490-bp nested RT-PCR cDNA amplicon of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S gene for detection of the amino acid mutations needed for accurate determination of all variants of concern and variants of interest according to the definitions published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (2). Data from China have indicated that older adults, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness and death than are younger persons (3). Although the majority of reported COVID-19 cases in China were mild (81%), approximately 80% of deaths occurred among adults aged &#8805;60 years; only one (0.1%) death occurred in a person aged &#8804;19 years (3).

Extensive metagenomic studies of material from bats, in particular guano, have revealed a large number of novel or divergent viral taxa that were previously unknown. New Zealand has only two extant indigenous terrestrial mammals, which are both bats, Mystacina tuberculata (the lesser short-tailed bat) and Chalinolobus tuberculatus (the long-tailed bat). Until the human introduction of exotic mammals, these species had been isolated from all other terrestrial mammals for over 1 million years (potentially over 16 million years for M. tuberculata). Four bat guano samples were collected from M. tuberculata roosts on the isolated offshore island of Whenua hou (Codfish Island) in New Zealand. Metagenomic analysis revealed that this species still hosts a plethora of divergent viruses. Whilst the majority of viruses detected were likely to be of dietary origin, some putative vertebrate virus sequences were identified. Papillomavirus, polyomavirus, calicivirus and hepevirus were found in the metagenomic data and subsequently confirmed using independent PCR assays and sequencing. The new hepevirus and calicivirus sequences may represent new genera within these viral families.

Pangolins were recently identified as carriers and intermediate hosts of coronaviruses. Previous research has shown that infection with coronaviruses activates an innate immune response upon sensing of viral RNA by interferon-induced with helicase C domain 1 (IFIH1), also known as MDA5. Here, we performed a comparative genomics study of RNA sensor genes in three species of pangolins. DDX58/RIG-I, a sensor of cytoplasmic viral RNA and toll-like receptors (TLR) 3, 7, and 8, which bind RNA in endosomes, are conserved in pangolins. By contrast, IFIH1 a sensor of intracellular double-stranded RNA, has been inactivated by mutations in pangolins. Likewise, Z-DNA-binding protein (ZBP1), which senses both Z-DNA and Z-RNA, has been lost during the evolution of pangolins. These results suggest that the innate immune response to viruses differs significantly between pangolins and other mammals, including humans. We put forward the hypothesis that loss of IFIH1 and ZBP1 provided an evolutionary advantage by reducing inflammation-induced damage to host tissues and thereby contributed to a switch from resistance to tolerance of viral infections in pangolins.","output":"Pangolins Lack IFIH1/MDA5, a Cytoplasmic RNA Sensor That Initiates Innate Immune Defense Upon Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics and predictive roles of lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19 patients.

How to maintain the stability and service quality of the bus system under regular pandemic prevention and control, so as to maintain the attractiveness of the bus, is an important research direction. Predicting operation states and adopting appropriate control measures for running buses are effective means of improving the bus system's schedule reliability and service quality. Focusing on the impacts of intersection traffic lights on the link's travel time durations, we establish a probabilistic prediction model for bus headways, classifying the bus headways into three states: bunching, stable, and big gap states. Based on the prediction of bus headways, the most suitable control strategy is selected by the proposed method from the plan set, such as holding control, speed-adjusting control, and stop-skipping control to minimize the bus headway deviation. Simulation experiments were employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the no-control situation, the expected headway variation, average passenger waiting time, and bus bunching frequency for 100 simulations by the proposed method are reduced by 77.73%, 41.66%, and 87.11%, respectively. Compared with some control methods without prediction, the proposed method is more robust, maintains good control performance, and reduces bus bunching despite significant variations in environmental parameters. In addition, the model still performs well when considering the execution errors of bus drivers.

METHODS: From March 19th,2020 to May 24th,2020, patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia and baseline Chest CT were prospectively enrolled at six-months follow-up. CT qualitative findings, semi-quantitative Lungs Severity Score (LSS) and well-aerated lung quantitative Chest CT (QCCT) were analyzed. Baseline LSS and QCCT performances in predicting fibrotic-like changes (reticular pattern and/or honeycombing) at six-month follow-up Chest CT were tested with receiver operating characteristic curves. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to test clinical and radiological features predictive of fibrotic-like changes. The multivariable analysis was performed with clinical parameters alone (clinical model), radiological parameters alone (radiological model) and the combination of clinical and radiological parameters (combined model). RESULTS: One-hundred-eighteen patients, with both baseline and six-month follow-up Chest CT, were included in the study (62 female, mean age 6512 years). At follow-up Chest CT, 85/118 (72%) patients showed fibrotic-like changes and 49/118 (42%) showed GGOs. Baseline LSS (>14), QCCT (3.75L and 80%) showed an excellent performance in predicting fibrotic-like changes at Chest CT follow-up.

Urban flooding, a common threat in summer caused by heavy rainfalls, is frequently reported in urban communities along with sewage overflows. With summer already underway and economy re-opening in many parts of the world, urban flooding and the often-accompanied sewage overflows could jeopardize previous mitigation efforts by posing renewed risks of virus spread in affected areas and communities. In this article, we present the up-to-date evidence and discussions on sewage-associated transmission of COVID-19, and highlighted the roles of sewage overflow and sewage-contaminated aerosols in two publicized events of community outbreaks. Further, we collected evidence in real-life environments to demonstrate the shortcuts of exposure to overflowed sewage and non-dispersed human excreta during a local urban flooding event. Given that communities serviced by combined sewer systems are particularly prone to such risks, local municipalities could prioritize wastewater infrastructure upgrades and consider combined sewer separations to minimize the risks of pathogen transmission via sewage overflows during epidemics.","output":"Urban flooding events pose risks of virus spread during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: A number of studies have shown that the airborne transmission route could spread some viruses over a distance of 2 meters from an infected person An epidemic model based only on respiratory droplets and close contact could not fully explain the regional differences in the spread of COVID-19 in Italy On March 16th 2020, we presented a position paper proposing a research hypothesis concerning the association between higher mortality rates due to COVID-19 observed in Northern Italy and average concentrations of PM(10) exceeding a daily limit of 50 g/m(3) METHODS: To monitor the spreading of COVID-19 in Italy from February 24th to March 13th (the date of the Italian lockdown), official daily data for PM(10) levels were collected from all Italian provinces between February 9th and February 29th, taking into account the maximum lag period (14 days) between the infection and diagnosis In addition to the number of exceedances of the daily limit value of PM(10), we also considered population data and daily travelling information for each province RESULTS: Exceedance of the daily limit value of PM(10) appears to be a significant predictor of infection in univariate analyses (p6 0, comparable with the highest values estimated for China CONCLUSION: A significant association has been found between the geographical distribution of daily PM(10) exceedances and the initial spreading of COVID-19 in the 110 Italian provinces","output":"Potential role of particulate matter in the spreading of COVID-19 in Northern Italy: first observational study based on initial epidemic diffusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This short presentation will consider how rights and equity challenges may be addressed in responding to epidemic diseases.","output":"Early evidence of the impact of legal responses to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El documento contiene las disposiciones para fortalecer y facilitar la implementacin del intercambio prestacional en salud en el Sistema Nacional de Salud que permitan la adecuada y plena prestacin de los servicios de prevencin y atencin de salud para las personas contagiadas y con riesgo de contagio por COVID-19","output":"Disposiciones para fortalecer y facilitar la implementacin del intercambio prestacional en salud en el Sistema Nacional de Salud que permitan la adecuada y plena prestacin de los servicios de prevencin y atencin de salud para las personas contagiadas y con riesgo de contagio por COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital technology has offered a completely different way of learning compared to previous times Until now, the problem of equitable internet access and various limitations of digital resources have become obstacles in transforming technology-based learning It's already been experienced Some educators have successfully implemented online learning by involving students in a different learning management system (LMS), they have used LMS as part of non-traditional learning even before the pandemic started, e-learning for example, distance learning or blended learning From the ongoing global pandemic, educational organizations are expected to be able to create learning methods based on the use of technology with all aspects and technological developments, it's just that currently educational organizations to realize it are much faster than previous expectations because the gaps in learning that need to be anticipated and researched are based on digital technology which also practically breaks the pandemic cycle ? 2021 Karadeniz Technical University All rights reserved","output":"Tools of digital learning scheme in the era of pandemic Covid 19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a lockdown in many countries to control the exponential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This resulted in curbing the epidemic by reducing the time-varying basic reproduction number (Rt) to below one. Governments are looking for evidence to balance the demand of their citizens to ease some of the restriction, against the fear of a second peak in infections. More details on the specific circumstances that promote exponential spread (i.e. Rt>1) and the measures that contributed most to a reduction in Rt are needed. Here we show that in 33 of 35 Western countries (32 European, plus Israel, USA and Canada), Rt fell to around or below one during lockdown (March - May 2020). One third of the effect happened already on average 6 days before the lockdown, with lockdown itself causing another major drop in transmission. Country-wide compulsory usage of masks was implemented only in Slovakia 10 days into lockdown, and on its own reduced transmission by half. During lockdown, decreased mobility in retail and recreation was an independent predictor of lower Rt during lockdown, while changes in other types of mobility were not. These results are consistent with anecdotal evidence that large recreational gatherings are super-spreading events, and may even suggest that infections during day-to-day contact at work are not sufficient to spark exponential growth. Our data suggest measures that will contribute to avoiding a second peak include a tight control on circumstances that facilitate massive spread such as large gatherings especially indoors, physical distancing, and mask use.","output":"Behavioral changes before lockdown, and decreased retail and recreation mobility during lockdown, contributed most to the successful control of the COVID-19 epidemic in 35 Western countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The association of antihypertensive drugs with the risk and severity of COVID-19 remains unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, and medRxiv for publications before July 13, 2020. Cohort studies and case-control studies that contain information on the association of antihypertensive agents including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium-channel blockers (CCBs), -blockers, and diuretics with the risk and severity of COVID-19 were selected. The random-effects or fixed-effects models were used to pool the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the outcomes. The literature search yielded 53 studies that satisfied our inclusion criteria, which comprised 39 cohort studies and 14 case-control studies. These studies included a total of 2,100,587 participants. We observed no association between prior usage of antihypertensive medications including ACEIs/ARBs, CCBs, -blockers, or diuretics and the risk and severity of COVID-19. Additionally, when only hypertensive patients were included, the severity and mortality were lower with prior usage of ACEIs/ARBs (overall OR of 0.81, 95% CI 0.66-0.99, p < 0.05 and overall OR of 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.91, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, usage of antihypertensive drugs is not associated with the risk and severity of COVID-19. Based on the current available literature, it is not recommended to abstain from the usage of these drugs in COVID-19 patients.

The aim of the study was to evaluate colonic and anal motor activity by means of HRM in healthy subjects. As the present study revealed the presence of a new colonic motor pattern (pan-colonic pressurizations) in healthy subjects, three additional studies were conducted: the first and the second to exclude that this motor event results from an artifact due to abdominal wall contraction and to confirm its modulation by cholinergic stimulation, and the third, as pilot study, to test the hypothesis that this colonic pattern is defective in patients with chronic constipation refractory to current pharmacological treatments. METHODS In both volunteers and patients the HRM catheter was advanced proximally during colonoscopy. RESULTS In all subjects, pressure increases of 153 mm Hg and 244 s simultaneously occurring in all colonic sensors (pan-colonic pressurizations) and associated with anal sphincter relaxation were identified. Subjects had 8538 pan-colonic pressurizations, which increased significantly during meal (P=0.007) and decreased afterward (P=0.01), and were correlated with feelings of and desire to evacuate gas. The mean number of propagating sequences was 4739, and only retrograde increased significantly postprandially (P=0.01). Pan-colonic pressurizations differed from strain artifacts and significantly increased after prostigmine. In patients pan-colonic pressurizations were significantly reduced as compared with volunteers. CONCLUSIONS Pan-colonic pressurizations associated with relaxations of the anal sphincter represent a new colonic motor pattern that seems to be defective in patients with treatment-refractory chronic constipation and may have a role in the transport of colonic gas and in the facilitation of the propagating sequence-induced colonic transport.","output":"Pan-Colonic Pressurizations Associated With Relaxation of the Anal Sphincter in Health and Disease: A New Colonic Motor Pattern Identified Using High-Resolution Manometry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: The incidence of severe and moderate forms of DKA as the initial presentation of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is increasing, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This poses a higher risk of developing cerebral edema as a complication of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), as well as morbidity and mortality rates. The aim of this study was to determine the trend and clinical features of children treated in the last 10 years in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) due to the development of DKA. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was performed in the PICU, Clinical Hospital Centre Rijeka, in Croatia. All children diagnosed with DKA from 2011C2020 were included in this study. Data were received from hospital medical documentation and patient paper history. The number of new cases and severity of DKA were identified and classified using recent International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) guidelines. Results: In this investigation period, 194 children with newly diagnosed T1D were admitted to our hospital: 58 of them were treated in the PICU due to DKA; 48 had newly diagnosed T1D (48/58); and ten previously diagnosed T1D (10/58). DKA as the initial presentation of T1D was diagnosed in 24.7% (48/194). Moderate or severe dehydration was present in 76% of the children at hospital admission. Polyuria, polydipsia, and Kussmaul breathing were the most common signs. Three patients (5.2%) developed cerebral edema, of whom one died. Conclusions: During the investigation period a rising trend in T1D was noted, especially in 2020. About one quarter of children with T1D presented with DKA at initial diagnosis in western Croatia, most of them with a severe form. Good education of the general population, along with the patients and families of children with diabetes, is crucial to prevent the development of DKA and thus reduce severe complications.","output":"Epidemiologic Characteristics of Children with Diabetic Ketoacidosis Treated in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in a 10-Year-Period: Single Centre Experience in Croatia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccinations are a safe and effective way to protect against infectious diseases. The World Health Organization estimates vaccines have saved more lives than any other interventions and every year about two to three million deaths are averted worldwide through immunization. To improve vaccination coverage, pharmacists have been increasingly involved in immunization roles in their communitiesas advocates, educators, and immunizers. Community pharmacy-based vaccination services have increased both in the number of immunization providers and the number of sites where patients can receive immunizations. In Canada, health care is under provincial legislationand so, there are distinct differences in scope of pharmacist practice across the country. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020, in Qubec, Canadas second-largest province, pharmacists did not have the authority to administer vaccines. To help prepare pharmacists in Qubec to become immunizers, we developed and deployed a series of accredited workshops. In these facilitated workshops, pharmacists were able to share best practices that may lead to providing effective vaccination services, identify common competency gaps, discuss effective patient communication skills, and determine how to target the most vulnerable population groups. Participants were also asked to evaluate the workshop. Our results indicate the evaluation was very reliable in measuring participant satisfaction (Cronbachs  = 0.94) and pharmacists commented that the workshops learning outcomes exceeded their expectations, and the topics covered were relevant and applicable. The evaluation also asked participants to identify weaknesses of training, so future educational interventions can be planned accordingly.

After the emergence of AIDS, Social Network Analysis (SNA) was demonstrated to be a good supplementary tool for contact tracing. Traditionally, social networks for disease investigations are constructed only with personal contacts. However, for diseases which transmit not only through personal contacts, incorporating geographical contacts into SNA has been demonstrated to reveal potential contacts among patients. In this research, we use Taiwan SARS data to investigate the differences in connectivity between personal and geographical contacts in the construction of social networks for these diseases. According to our results, geographical contacts, which increase the average degree of nodes from 0 to 108.62 and decrease the number of components from 961 to 82, provide much higher connectivity than personal contacts. Therefore, including geographical contacts is important to understand the underlying context of the transmission of these diseases. We further explore the differences in network topology between one-mode networks with only patients and multi-mode networks with patients and geographical locations for disease investigation. We find that including geographical locations as nodes in a social network provides a good way to see the role that those locations play in the disease transmission and reveal potential bridges among those geographical locations and households.","output":"Incorporating Geographical Contacts into Social Network Analysis for Contact Tracing in Epidemiology: A Study on Taiwan SARS Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A fast PCR-assisted impedimetric biosensor was developed for the selective detection of the clbN gene from the polyketide synthase (pks) genomic island in real Escherichia coli samples. This genomic island is responsible for the production of colibactin, a harmful genotoxin that has been associated with colorectal cancer. The experimental protocol consisted of immobilizing the designated forward primer onto an Au electrode surface to create the sensing probe, followed by PCR temperature cycling in blank, positive, and negative DNA controls. Target DNA identification was possible by monitoring changes in the systems charge transfer resistance values (R(ct)) before and after PCR treatment through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Custom-made, flexible gold electrodes were fabricated using chemical etching optical lithography. A PCR cycle study determined the optimum conditions to be at 6 cycles providing fast results while maintaining a good sensitivity. EIS data for the DNA recognition process demonstrated the successful distinction between target interaction resulting in an increase in resistance to charge transfer (R(ct)) percentage change of 176% for the positive DNA control vs. 21% and 20% for the negative and non-DNA-containing controls, respectively.

Previous studies on the relationship between mental illness and the church have found that beliefs and practices within the church can contribute to stigma towards people with mental illness. Yet, the typical experience of people with mental illness who attend church has been found to be positive, suggesting that there are considerable resources within the church for supporting those who experience mental health problems. One such resource is the concept of hospitality, which promotes a sense of belonging for those with mental illness in the church. This qualitative study advances the construct of hospitality as a helpful paradigm for addressing mental health needs within the church, capturing perspectives and practices that are currently in place or seen as necessary by church attendees. The study methodology also emphasized the need to incorporate cultural considerations that are appropriate for the racial and ethnic make-up of particular churches. Semistructured focus group interviews were conducted with participants from eight churches that were either predominantly African American, Asian American, Latinx, or multi-ethnic.

METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION We screened 2,906 studies. Articles were included if in English, included primary research data, and referenced U.S.-based Catholic facilities. We reviewed the reference lists of included articles. We excluded articles that addressed the relationship of patient or health care provider religion to provision of reproductive services, described reproductive health care services in non-Catholic facilities, or reported legal cases or concerns. Two independent reviewers screened all citations, a third reviewer resolved differences, and all three reviewers categorized included citations. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS We included 27 studies. Investigators most commonly focused on the provision of emergency contraception (n=9) or other contraceptive and sterilization methods (n=7); few focused on a range of family planning methods (n=3), natural family planning (n=2), ectopic pregnancy management (n=2), abortion care (n=2), miscarriage management (n=1), and infertility care (n=1). The most common study designs were cross-sectional (18/27 [67%]) and qualitative investigations (6/27 [22%]).

We describe the patient characteristics, program characteristics, and clinical outcomes of patients in our RPM program. METHODS: We enrolled COVID-19 patients being discharged home from the hospital. Enrolled patients had an app, and were provided with a pulse oximeter and thermometer. Patients self-reported symptoms, O2 saturation, and temperature daily. Abnormal symptoms or vital signs were flagged and assessed by a pool of nurses. Descriptive statistics were used to describe patient and program characteristics. A mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to determine the odds of a combined endpoint of emergency department (ED) or hospital readmission. RESULTS: A total of 295 patients were referred for RPM from five participating hospitals, and 225 patients were enrolled. A majority of enrolled patients (66%) completed the monitoring period without triggering an abnormal alert. Enrollment was associated with a decreased odds of ED or hospital readmission (adjusted odds ratio: 0.54; 95% confidence interval: 0.3-0.97; p = 0.039). Referral without enrollment was not associated with a reduced odds of ED or hospital readmission.

Initially, we investigated the antibiofilm activities of 24 fatty acids against A. baumannii ATCC 17978 and two clinical isolates. Among these fatty acids, two unsaturated fatty acids, nervonic and oleic acid, at 20 g/mL significantly inhibited A. baumannii biofilm formation without affecting its planktonic cell growth (MICs were >500 g/mL) and markedly decreased the motility of A. baumannii but had no toxic effect on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.

Study Design Observational study. Evaluation of public health surveillance systems. Methods Data was collected in the Public Health England Second-Generation Surveillance System through routine laboratory reporting processes, as well as enhanced testing in collaboration with commercial partners. Three periods were chosen to present developments in disease surveillance around the first pandemic wave in England. Completeness of valid entries for key demographic and epidemiological fields were summarised. Timeliness was assessed using recorded date intervals; the sample collection to the laboratory reporting a positive result; the positive result being received by the national surveillance system; and the data being available for epidemiological analysis. Results In each period, demographic variables were more than 95% complete, and enhanced ethnicity more than 85%, allowing a rich understanding of the general characteristics of COVID-19 cases in England. The proportion of cases completing all reporting stages of the national system within 3 days of when the specimen was taken increased from 69.1% in period 1 to 76.6% in period 3. In period 3, the median number of days to complete all reporting stages decreased to two, from three in previous periods. Analysis of each reporting stage offers suggestive evidence that timeliness of the system has improved as reporting has become established over time. Conclusions Timely processing of data for epidemiological use was consistent and rapid once received by the national system. Delays in timeliness were most likely to occur in the first stage of the reporting process, prior to laboratory input to the surveillance platform. Existing national surveillance mechanisms enhanced during the response have succeeded in providing rapid collection and reporting of case data to facilitate epidemiological monitoring and analysis, and guide public health policy and strategy.","output":"Timeliness and completeness of laboratory-based surveillance of COVID-19 cases in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Major hyperparameters which affect fuzzy time series (FTS) forecasting are the number of partitions, length of partition intervals in the universe of discourse, and the fuzzy order. There are very few studies which have considered an integrated solution to optimize all the hyperparameters. In this paper, we strive to achieve optimum values of all three hyperparameters for fuzzy time series forecasting of the COVID-19 pandemic using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. We specifically propose two techniques, namely nested PSO and exhaustive search PSO for determining the optimal interval length, as an augmentation to the FTS-PSO model that optimizes the interval length and the fuzzy order. Nested PSO has two PSO loops: (i) the inner PSO optimizes the combination of fuzzy order and boundaries of intervals for a given number of partitions defined by the outer loop, and the resultant cost is fed back to the outer PSO;(ii) the outer PSO optimizes the number of partitions to reduce the cost while meeting the defined constraint. Exhaustive search PSO also has two loops where the inner loop is similar to nested PSO while the outer loop iterates over a pre-defined search space of number of partitions. We analyze the effectiveness of the two approaches by comparing with ARIMA, FbProphet, and the state-of-the-art FTS and FTS-PSO models. We adopt COVID-19 highly affected 10 countries worldwide to perform forecasting of coronavirus confirmed cases. We consider two phases of COVID-19 spread, one from the year 2020 and another from 2021. Our study provides an analytical aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic, and aims to achieve optimal number and length of intervals along with fuzzy order for FTS forecasting of COVID-19.

This simple fact has motivated multiple large-scale, comparative analyses of the drivers of pathogen sharing and zoonotic pathogen richness among hosts as well as the factors determining the zoonotic potential of pathogens themselves. However, most of this work focuses on viruses, limiting a broader understanding of how host range varies within and between pathogen groups. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Shaw et al. (2020) compile a comprehensive data set of host-pathogen associations across viruses and bacteria and test whether previous patterns observed in the former occur in the latter. They find most viruses and bacteria are specialists, and viruses are more likely to be generalists; however, generalist bacteria encompass multiple host orders, whereas viral sharing occurs more within host orders. Lastly, the authors demonstrate that many factors previously identified as predictors of zoonotic richness for viruses occur for bacteria and that host phylogenetic similarity is a primary determinant of cross-species transmission. However, pathogen sharing with humans was more common and more weakly related to phylogenetic distance to Homo sapiens for bacteria compared to viruses, suggesting the former could pose greater spillover risks across host orders.

Exogenous application of ABA has been performed to study fruit ripening and cracking, but this growth regulator is not used for commercial production. To determine the potential of this growth regulator to improve sweet cherry fruit quality, ABA canopy spraying was assayed in four cultivars. Canopy spraying of S-ABA significantly: (1) enhanced sweet cherry fruit color in Glenred, Lapins and Bing cultivars, but not in Royal Rainier (a bi-colored cultivar), and (2) decreased fruit size and firmness in Lapins, Bing and Royal Rainier. Seasonally reproducible effects were seen in Lapins (mid/late-maturing) but not in Glenred (early-maturing). Canopy spraying of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) decreased color and increased fruit size in Lapins, but not in Glenred. Direct application of ABA on fruits attached to the tree, without application to the foliage, increased Lapins fruit color without reducing size.

In this study, we investigated ampicillin's ability, which is commonly used in dairy cattle disease treatment, to induce Cronobacter sakazakii into the VBNC state. After treatment with ampicillin, the counts of culturable cells decreased from 108 CFU/mL to an undetected level 7-30 days post-treatment. Meanwhile, viable cells were still approximately 104-105 cells/mL, and could be resuscitated under appropriate conditions. Fluorescence microscopy showed that VBNC cell maintained apparent cellular integrity, but that the morphology of VBNC cells differed visibly from that of normal cells. Moreover, the respiratory chain activity of VBNC cells were confirmed by flow cytometry (FCM) analysis, suggesting that cells in a VBNC state were physiologically active. Finally, transcriptomics analysis and real-time PCR (qPCR) validation were used to explore the underlying mechanisms of VBNC cell formation. Over-expression of relA, lon, ppx, and ppk in the toxin-antitoxin (TA) trigger system contributed to VBNC cell formation. In the TA trigger system, RelA and exopolyphosphatases/guanosine pentaphosphate phosphohydrolases (PPX/GPPA) synthesize ppGpp, which activates polyphosphate kinase (PPK), the cellular enzyme that accumulates plyphosphate (PolyP). PolyP combines with and stimulates Lon to degrade the antitoxins, thereby activating the toxins that induce a VBNC state.

This systematic review aims to investigate the efficacy of CCT across cognitive, psychosocial and functional domains for people with PD and examine study and intervention design factors that could moderate CCT effects on cognition. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of CCT in patients with PD without dementia, on cognitive, psychosocial or functional outcomes, will be included. The primary outcome is overall cognitive function. Secondary outcomes are domain-specific cognitive function, psychosocial functioning and functional abilities. We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO through 14 May 2020 to identify relevant literature. Risk of bias will be assessed using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Effect sizes will be calculated as standardised mean difference of baseline to postintervention change (Hedges' g) with 95% CI for each eligible outcome measure. Pooling of outcomes across studies will be conducted using random-effects models, accounting for dependency structure of effect sizes within studies. Heterogeneity will be assessed using 2 and I2 statistic. Potential moderators, based on key study and intervention design factors, will be investigated using mixed-effects meta-regression models.

As a result, several antithrombotic modalities have been implicated in the treatment of this disease. This study aimed to identify if therapeutic anticoagulation or concurrent use of antiplatelet and anticoagulants was associated with an improved outcome in this patient population. Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study of adult patients admitted to a single university hospital for COVID-19 infection was performed. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, or the need for mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcomes were each of the components of the primary outcome, in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, or the need for mechanical ventilation. Results: 242 patients were included in the study and divided into 4 subgroups: therapeutic anticoagulation (TAC), prophylactic anticoagulation + antiplatelet (PACAP), therapeutic anticoagulation + antiplatelet (TACAP), and prophylactic anticoagulation (PAC) which was the reference for comparison. Multivariable cox regression analysis and propensity matching were done and showed when compared to PAC, TACAP and TAC were associated with less in-hospital all cause mortality with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 0.113 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.028-0.449) and 0.126 (95% CI, 0.028-0.528) respectively. The number needed to treat (NNT) in both subgroups was 11. Furthermore, PACAP was associated with a reduced risk of invasive mechanical ventilation with an aHR of 0.07 (95% CI, 0.014-0.351). However, the was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of major or minor bleeds, ICU admission, or the composite outcome of in-hospital mortality, ICU admission or the need for mechanical ventilation. Conclusion: The use of combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents or therapeutic anticoagulation alone in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was associated with a better outcome in comparison to prophylactic anticoagulation alone without an increase in the risk of major and minor bleeds. Sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials are needed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining antiplatelet and anticoagulants agents or using therapeutic anticoagulation in the management of patients with COVID-19 infection.","output":"Combined Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is associated with an improved outcome in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a propensity matched cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Syndromic surveillance systems monitor disease indicators to detect emergence of diseases and track their progression.

Artificial intelligence has been tried to help clinicians in improving the diagnostic accuracy and working efficiency of CT. Whereas, existing supervised approaches on CT image of COVID-19 pneumonia require voxel-based annotations for training, which take a lot of time and effort. This paper proposed a weakly-supervised method for COVID-19 lesion localization based on generative adversarial network (GAN) with image-level labels only. We first introduced a GAN-based framework to generate normal-looking CT slices from CT slices with COVID-19 lesions. We then developed a novel feature match strategy to improve the reality of generated images by guiding the generator to capture the complex texture of chest CT images. Finally, the localization map of lesions can be easily obtained by subtracting the output image from its corresponding input image. By adding a classifier branch to the GAN-based framework to classify localization maps, we can further develop a diagnosis system with improved classification accuracy. Three CT datasets from hospitals of Sao Paulo, Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology, and China Medical University about COVID-19 were collected in this article for evaluation. Our weakly supervised learning method obtained AUC of 0.883, dice coefficient of 0.575, accuracy of 0.884, sensitivity of 0.647, specificity of 0.929, and F1-score of 0.640, which exceeded other widely used weakly supervised object localization methods by a significant margin. We also compared the proposed method with fully supervised learning methods in COVID-19 lesion segmentation task, the proposed weakly supervised method still leads to a competitive result with dice coefficient of 0.575. Furthermore, we also analyzed the association between illness severity and visual score, we found that the common severity cohort had the largest sample size as well as the highest visual score which suggests our method can help rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, especially in massive common severity cohort. In conclusion, we proposed this novel method can serve as an accurate and efficient tool to alleviate the bottleneck of expert annotation cost and advance the progress of computer-aided COVID-19 diagnosis.","output":"Lung Lesion Localization of COVID-19 from Chest CT Image: A Novel Weakly Supervised Learning Method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

However, studies employ different primer combinations that target different lengths/regions of the 16S gene ranging from complete gene sequences (~ 1500 bp) to short fragments (~ 500 bp), the latter of which is the most ubiquitously used. Sequences of different lengths are often concatenated, compared, and/or jointly analyzed to infer phylogenetic relationships, estimate genetic divergence (p-distances), and justify the recognition of new species (species delimitation), making the 16S gene region, by far, the most influential molecular marker in amphibian systematics. Despite their ubiquitous and multifarious use, no studies have ever been conducted to evaluate the congruence and performance among the different fragment lengths. RESULTS: Using empirical data derived from both Sanger-based and genomic approaches, we show that full-length 16S sequences recover the most accurate phylogenetic relationships, highest branch support, lowest variation in genetic distances (pairwise p-distances), and best-scoring species delimitation partitions. In contrast, widely used short fragments produce inaccurate phylogenetic reconstructions, lower and more variable branch support, erratic genetic distances, and low-scoring species delimitation partitions, the numbers of which are vastly overestimated. The relatively poor performance of short 16S fragments is likely due to insufficient phylogenetic information content. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results demonstrate that short 16S fragments are unable to match the efficacy achieved by full-length sequences in terms of topological accuracy, heuristic branch support, genetic divergences, and species delimitation partitions, and thus, phylogenetic and taxonomic inferences that are predicated on short 16S fragments should be interpreted with caution. However, short 16S fragments can still be useful for species identification, rapid assessments, or definitively coupling complex life stages in natural history studies and faunal inventories. While the full 16S sequence performs best, it requires the use of several primer pairs that increases cost, time, and effort. As a compromise, our results demonstrate that practitioners should utilize medium-length primers in favor of the short-fragment primers because they have the potential to markedly improve phylogenetic inference and species delimitation without additional cost.

Objectives: The main objective of this review is to identify what works in curbing corruption in the public sector, by meta-analyzing the findings of published and unpublished evaluations of different types of anti-corruption interventions in different countries. The focus of this review is administrative corruption, namely corrupt acts involving civil servants in their dealings with their superiors, during the implementation of public policies, or while interacting with the public for service delivery. Political corruption (in the adoption of laws, regulations, and policies), and private-to-private corruption (involving only private actors) are excluded from this review. Search methods: The literature search was conducted by querying three widely recognized electronic databases: RePEc, SSRN, and Web of Science. These databases are considered the most comprehensive in the socio-economic field of research. The main grey literature repositories were also queried. Both published and unpublished studies were searched on the basis of specific combinations of keywords. The terms used to define queries were based on the types of corruption, types of interventions/policies/reforms and study design search strings. Specific conventions were used to explode or truncate keywords as appropriate. Screening of the references (i.e., snowballing) of the identified studies was also performed, and a reverse snowballing approach on Google Scholar was used. In order to ensure replicability, all searches were stored into Covidence, an online software developed by the Cochrane community for screening studies and extracting data for systematic reviews. Selection criteria: Any study that included experimental evaluations (randomized controlled trials) of interventions developed for use in the public sector (e.g., public administration, education, health, etc.) to curb administrative corruption has been included in this review without any geographical or temporal limitations. Only studies written in or translated into English have been considered. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors read the titles and abstracts of identified studies in order to determine their eligibility against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. When a title or abstract could not be included or rejected with certainty, the full text of the article was reviewed. In case of disagreement about whether or not a study should be included, the lead author (Giulia Mugellini), together with Martin Killias acted as arbitrator. The relevant information from identified studies was extracted independently by two review authors, following the guidelines of the Campbell Collaboration. The studies were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias checklist as a basis. The effect size selected for the analysis was the Fisher's z-score transformation of the partial correlation coefficient. For the meta-analysis, random effect(s) models were estimated. Meta-regression analysis models were then used to investigate the determinants behind the observed between- and within-study heterogeneity. Ten different covariates were included in the meta-regression models in order to control for the type of intervention, the type of corruption, the level of national income, the quality of the study and the type of participants involved in laboratory experiments. Results: The initial literature search led to the identification of 70 studies. Approximately one-third of the studies were excluded at the title/abstract stage because they either did not evaluate any anti-corruption intervention but simply assessed the relationship between corruption and other phenomena, or because the study design was not based on randomized controlled trials. Another 14 studies were excluded only after a full-text assessment. At this stage, the main reasons for exclusion were related to an unsuitable type of corruption (e.g., when the focus of the paper was political corruption, or private-to-private corruption instead of administrative corruption), the lack of regression output, or an unsuitable study design. At the end of the selection process, 29 studies resulted as eligible for inclusion. All the selected studies were written in English. The publication years ranged from 2007 to 2018. The majority of the selected studies (20) investigates the effect of anti-corruption interventions in high- and upper-middle income countries (Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Nine studies focused on low- and low-middle income countries (Burkina Faso, Burundi, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda). All of them were randomized experiments. Twenty-five of these experiments were conducted in a laboratory, while four of them were field experiments. As to the type of outcome, the majority (18) of the selected studies addressed bribery (either active or passive), while 11 studies considered misappropriation of public resources (embezzlement). In terms of anti-corruption interventions, 19 studies tested the effect of deterrence interventions, while 10 studies focused on policies based on organizational and cultural change. Overall, the meta-analysis findings indicate that the identified interventions decrease the level of corruption. Results are statistically significant (p < 0.01) and robust to different heterogeneity estimatorsthat is, (restricted) maximum likelihood and method of moment estimators. The observed high level of heterogeneity (Formula presented.) is equal to 92.36%, of which 43.78% is due to between-study heterogeneity and 48.57% to within-study heterogeneityalbeit in line with other meta-analyses in economics, suggests the need for meta-regression analyses. To investigate the determinants behind the between- and within-study heterogeneity of the observed effect, both a random effect model and a multilevel model were adopted. The results of the multilevel model show that:. 1) Control and deterrence interventions are more effective than organizational and cultural reforms in reducing corruption in the public sector. 2) Combining different interventions reduces corruption more than single interventions. 3) Interventions are more effective in preventing misappropriation of public resources (embezzlement) than passive or active bribery. Finally, the Funnel Asymmetry Test (FAT), conducted with both additive and multiplicative dispersion terms, shows no evidence of a strong publication bias in the literature. Authors conclusions: The results of this systematic review, based on a combination of laboratory and field experiments, demonstrate that increasing the expected monetary costs (e.g., sanctions) of corruption or the probability of detection (e.g., audit risk) is more effective than organizational, cultural and educational interventions in curbing administrative corruption, at least in the short term. However, this result might be due to the fact that the majority of selected studies are based on lab-experiments, where the assessment of the intervention is almost concurrent to its development. Short-term evaluations might fail to identify the effect of organizational and cultural interventions. Indeed, these interventions are based on structural changes in the organization of the system and the ethical and cultural education of public officials and might, thus, entail long periods to display their results on the level of corruption. Nevertheless, a combination of different interventions proves to be more effective than single interventions. For example, policies guaranteeing impunity to officials or citizens who report corrupt practices (principal witness/leniency treatment) are more effective if associated with a high probability of audit than leniency alone. A low probability of detection can be compensated by the threat of high fines in reducing both the amount and the likelihoo of bribe demands. To the contrary, a high probability of detection had no effect in the absence of severe sanction threats. The importance of the organizational and cultural environment in which the intervention is implemented clearly emerged in the literature. When possible, the characteristics of the settings where the interventions were developed were included in the meta-regression analysis (such as the level of income of the countries). When it was not possible to measure contextual factors and their interaction with the main intervention, a qualitative analysis was performed to reveal the complexities of these interactions. This additional analysis shows that the impact of the interventions was found to be affected by the likelihood of the continued interactions between bribe takers and givers, the amount and probability of fines, and the size of the bribe, among others. For example, reporting mechanisms and leniency policies increase their potential in combination with interventions that limit agent's exposure to one another C such as staff rotation. The success of audit risk on corruption is strongly dependent on the seriousness of the potential sanction and the probability that a sanction is applied. Some differences also emerge between high- and low-corruption countries regarding the effectiveness of anti-corruption interventions. For example, measures tending to increase social blame of corrupt practices work in low-corruption countries. Adding punishments in environments where actors behavior is tightly monitored increases compliance, but more so in environments where corruption is the exception rather than the rule. In terms of implications for research, the fact that control and deterrence turns out to be more effective thanorganizational and cultural interventions in curbing administrative corruption confirms the importance of economic theories (and cost-benefit analysis). However, the meta-analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of combining different types of interventions. This is true not only when combining policies reinforcing control and deterrence (monitoring frequency, detection probability and amount of fines), but also when policies based on organizational and cultural change are added (e.g., staff rotation and leniency). In particular, the role of moral levers in preventing corruption emerges, and especially the importance of strengthening professional identity and values in order to avoid conflicts between an individual's private interests and his/her public role. These results highlight the importance of going beyond economic models for explaining corruption, and considering the moral and cultural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. It also emerges the need to understand how different forms of corruption operate in practice at macro- (cross-country), meso- (country/nation-state) and micro- (individual) level. In particular, individual-level factors, such as the strive for power, low self-control, loss aversion and risk acceptance would need to be addressed. It would be interesting to distinguish, when more experimental studies will be available, between top-down (from supervisors to officials) and bottom-up (from citizens to officials) interventions. From a methodological point of view, it could be tested whether the results change according to the types of games used as a basis for the corruption experiments (e.g., behavioral game theory, trust game, etc.) and according to the setting in which the experiment was conducted (e.g., context-free versus in-context presentation of experimental tasks). Considering the effect of sensitization messages in reducing bribery demand, we would encourage researchers to develop other corruption experiments that explore the impact of interventions in fostering professional self-identity, as well as the impact of organizational family culture on corruption. Furthermore, this review highlights the need for a comprehensive classification of anti-corruption policies that distinguishes interventions by type of corruption, risk factors, type of poli y tool and administrative sector. ? 2021 The Authors.

A banking chatbot is one of the financial technologies promoted by the banking industry to meet the needs of its customers during the pandemic. However, there is still a gap between the quality of the developed chatbot service and customer expectations. The research is conducted to evaluate the factors that affect customer satisfaction with Indonesian banking chatbot services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data are collected through filling out questionnaires by 222 respondents using the snowball sampling technique. Only 100 respondents are selected and fit into the research criteria consisting of them who domicile in the JABODETABEK area and experience using Indonesian banking chatbot services. The number of respondents used as many as 100 people is also determined based on the ten times rule method and Slovin method. The variables analyzed in the research are system quality, information quality, service quality, trust, perceived value, situational factor, and personal factor. Each variable is observed for its effect on the intention to use and customer satisfaction in using Indonesian banking chatbot services. Then, the obtained data are analyzed using PLS-SEM. The results indicate that system quality, service quality, and information systems significantly positively affect customer satisfaction using Indonesian banking chatbot services. Moreover, information quality and personal factor also affect intention to use Indonesian banking chatbot services significantly and positively. The results are expected to recommend the banking industry to develop banking chatbot services to increase customer satisfaction and intention to use banking chatbot services. ? 2022 CommIT Journal.

T-cell trafficking into the hearts of CCM patients may be modulated by in situ expression of chemotactic or haptotactic molecules, as the chemokine CXCL12, the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), and extracellular matrix proteins (ECM), such as fibronectin. Herein we evaluated the expression of fibronectin, CXCL12, and TNF- in the myocardial tissue of T. cruzi seropositive (asymptomatic or with CCM), as well as seronegative individuals as healthy controls. Hearts from CCM patients exhibited enhanced expression of these three molecules. CXCL12 and TNF- serum levels were also increased in CCM individuals. We then evaluated T lymphocytes from chronic chagasic patients by cytofluorometry, in terms of membrane expression levels of molecules involved in cell activation and cell migration, respectively, HLA-DR and the VLA-4 (very late antigen-4, being one integrin-type fibronectin receptor). Indeed, the expression of HLA-DR and VLA-4 was enhanced on T lymphocytes from chagasic patients, especially in the CCM group. To further approach the dynamics of T cell migratory events, we performed fibronectin-, TNF--, and CXCL12-driven migration. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and T cells from CCM patients presented an ex vivo enhanced migratory capacity driven by fibronectin alone when this ECM protein was placed in the membrane of transwell migration chambers. When TNF- was previously placed upon fibronectin, we observed a further and significant increase in the migratory response of both PBMCs and T lymphocytes. Overall, these data suggest the existence in patients with chronic Chagas disease of a cardiac inflammatory infiltrate vector that promotes the recruitment and accumulation of activated T cells, driven in part by enhanced tissue expression of fibronectin and TNF-, as well as the respective corresponding VLA-4 and TNF receptors.","output":"Enhanced Migratory Capacity of T Lymphocytes in Severe Chagasic Patients Is Correlated With VLA-4 and TNF- Expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Migrants in high-income countries may be at increased risk of COVID-19 due to their health and social circumstances, yet the extent to which they are affected and their predisposing risk factors are not clearly understood. We did a systematic review to assess clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in migrant populations, indirect health and social impacts, and to determine key risk factors. Methods: We did a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42020222135). We searched multiple databases to 18/11/2020 for peer-reviewed and grey literature on migrants (foreign-born) and COVID-19 in 82 high-income countries. We used our international networks to source national datasets and grey literature. Data were extracted on primary outcomes (cases, hospitalisations, deaths) and we evaluated secondary outcomes on indirect health and social impacts and risk factors using narrative synthesis. Results: 3016 data sources were screened with 158 from 15 countries included in the analysis (35 data sources for primary outcomes: cases [21], hospitalisations [4]; deaths [15]; 123 for secondary outcomes). We found that migrants are at increased risk of infection and are disproportionately represented among COVID-19 cases. Available datasets suggest a similarly disproportionate representation of migrants in reported COVID-19 deaths, as well as increased all-cause mortality in migrants in some countries in 2020. Undocumented migrants, migrant health and care workers, and migrants housed in camps have been especially affected. Migrants experience risk factors including high-risk occupations, overcrowded accommodation, and barriers to healthcare including inadequate information, language barriers, and reduced entitlement. Conclusions: Migrants in high-income countries are at high risk of exposure to, and infection with, COVID-19. These data are of immediate relevance to national public health and policy responses to the pandemic. Robust data on testing uptake and clinical outcomes in migrants, and barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination, are urgently needed, alongside strengthening engagement with diverse migrant groups.","output":"Clinical outcomes and risk factors for COVID-19 among migrant populations in high-income countries: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has presented challenges to healthcare systems and healthcare professionals internationally. After one year of the pandemic, the initial evidence on health system responses begins to consolidate, and there is a need to identify and synthesise experiences of responding to COVID-19 among healthcare professionals and other health system stakeholders. This systematic review of primary qualitative studies depicts the experiences and perceptions of organisations and actors at multiple levels of health systems internationally in responding to COVID-19. METHODS: Six main databases of biomedical information, public health and health administration research were searched over the period October 1, 2019, to October 21, 2020. Information extracted from included studies was analysed thematically. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies were eligible for data extraction. Nine of those studies, of lower methodological quality, were removed from the thematic analysis of study results. Considering the professional level experiences, predominant themes of the studies consisted of the new roles and responsibilities of healthcare workers, burnout and distress, recognition of unseen healthcare workers, and positive changes and emergent solutions amid the crisis. Organisational level findings of the studies included provision of psychological support, COVID-19 as \\"catalyst\\" for change, and exercise of more \\"open\\" leadership by managers and health authorities. Continuous training, regulation of working conditions, providing supportive resources, coordinating a diversity of actors, and reviewing and updating regulations were roles identified at the local health system level. CONCLUSIONS: The experiences of frontline healthcare workers have been the focus of attention of the majority of primary qualitative studies as of October 2020. However, organisational and wider system level studies indicate that some responses to COVID-19 have been characterised by increased emphasis on coordination activities by local health system actors, making service adaptations at pace, and reliance on expanded roles of front-line workers. The need for theory-informed qualitative studies was identified at the organisational level.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Surgeons performed intracorporeal sutures with various instruments within three different cylindrical workspace sizes. Three pairs of instruments were compared: 3-mm non-robotic mini-laparoscopy instruments; 5-mm robotic instruments; and 8-mm robotic instruments. Workspace diameters were 4, 6 and 8 cm, with volumes of 50, 113 and 201 cm(3) respectively. Primary outcomes were validated objective task performance scores and instrument workspace breach counts. RESULTS A total of 23 participants performed 276 suture task repetitions. The overall median task performance scores for the 3-, 5- and 8-mm instruments were 421, 398 and 402, respectively (P = 0.12). Task scores were highest (best) for the 3-mm non-robotic instruments in all workspace sizes. Scores were significantly lower when spatial constraints were imposed, with median task scores for the 4-, 6- and 8-cm diameter workspaces being 388, 415 and 420, respectively (P = 0.026). Significant indirect relationships were seen between boundary breaches and workspace size (P < 0.001). Higher breach counts occurred with the robotic instruments. CONCLUSIONS Smaller workspaces limit the performance of both robotic and non-robotic instruments. In operating workspaces <200 cm(3) , 3-mm non-robotic instruments are better suited for advanced bimanual operative tasks such as suturing.

CLABSIs in encounters with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (COVID CLABSI) were compared with CLABSIs in encounters without a COVID diagnosis (non-COVID CLABSI). As a secondary analysis, we also reviewed all CLABSI occurrence in 2019. Characteristics were compared using Mid-P Exact (Poisson) and Chi Squared (categorical) Tests. Subjective data collected by infection preventionists during real-time case reviews with clinical staff of each CLABSI was also reviewed. RESULTS: In 2020, the rate of COVID CLABSI (CLABSI/1000 catheter days) was 6.6 times greater than the rate of non-COVID CLABSI (5.47 vs. 0.83, p< 0.001). In the COVID CLABSI group we observed higher rates of occurrence in the ICU setting (94% vs 28%, p< 0.001), in house mortality (53% vs 26% P=0.0187), presence of arterial lines (91% vs 20%, p< 0.001) and increased number of catheter lumens (4 vs 3, p< 0.001). No significant difference was observed in the distribution of pathogens. No significant differences were observed between 2019 CLABSI and 2020 non-COVID CLABSI. Real-time case reviews identified changes in nurse staffing, increased nurse: patient ratios, delays in routine central line dressing changes, and inconsistent use of alcohol-impregnated port protectors as possible contributing factors.

We aimed at summarising the strength of evidence in the published literature on the association of physical and mental health with social connection via social isolation, living alone and loneliness. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in April 2020 to identify meta-analyses using the Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases. The search strategy included terms of social isolation, loneliness, living alone and meta-analysis. Eligible meta-analyses needed to report any sort of association between an indicator of social connection and any physical or mental health outcome. The findings were summarised in a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Twenty-five meta-analyses met our criteria, of which 10 focused on physical health and 15 on mental health outcomes. The results suggest that lack of social connection is associated with chronic physical symptoms, frailty, coronary heart disease, malnutrition, hospital readmission, reduced vaccine uptake, early mortality, depression, social anxiety, psychosis, cognitive impairment in later life and suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: The existing evidence clearly indicates that social connection is associated with a range of poor physical and mental health outcomes.

We investigated in this study the expression of B(0)AT1 and its auxiliary peptidases as well as its transport function along the rat small intestine. Additionally, we tested its possible short- and long-term regulation by dietary proteins and amino acids.

Gastric emptying was delayed by intragastric application of an amino acid cocktail but we observed no acute dietary regulation of B(0)AT1 protein expression and L-isoleucine transport. Investigation of the chronic dietary regulation of B(0)AT1, ACE2 and CD13 by different diets revealed an increased B(0)AT1 protein expression under amino acid-supplemented diet in the proximal section but not in the distal one and for ACE2 protein expression a reverse localization of the effect. Dietary regulation for CD13 protein expression was not as distinct as for the two other proteins.

The aim of this study was to examine the association between race/ethnicity and COVID-19 hospitalization, ventilation status, and mortality in people with rheumatic disease. METHODS: US patients with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 entered into the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance physician registry March 24 - August 26, 2020 were included. Race/ethnicity was defined as white, Black, Latinx, Asian and other/mixed race. Outcomes included hospitalization, requirement for ventilatory support, and death. Multivariable regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals controlling for age, sex, smoking, rheumatic disease diagnosis, comorbidities, medications taken prior to infection, and rheumatic disease activity. RESULTS: A total of 1,324 patients were included, of whom 36% were hospitalized and 6% died; 26% of hospitalized patients required mechanical ventilation. In multivariable models, Black (OR=2.74, 95% CI 1.90, 3.95), Latinx (OR=1.71, 95% CI 1.18, 2.49), and Asian (OR=2.69, 95% CI 1.16, 6.24) patients had higher odds of being hospitalized compared to white patients.

In particular, much is unknown about how changes of contact patterns and other behaviors including adherence to social distancing, induced by these measures, may have impacted finer-scale transmission dynamics among different age groups. In this paper, we build a stochastic age-specific transmission model to systematically characterize the degree and variation of age-specific transmission dynamics, before and after lifting the lockdown in Georgia, USA. We perform Bayesian (missing-)data-augmentation model inference, leveraging reported age-specific case, seroprevalence and mortality data. We estimate that overall population-level transmissibility was reduced to 41.2% with 95% CI [39%, 43.8%] of the pre-lockdown level in about a week of the announcement of the shelter-in-place order. Although it subsequently increased after the lockdown was lifted, it only bounced back to 62% [58%, 67.2%] of the pre-lockdown level after about a month. We also find that during the lockdown susceptibility to infection increases with age. Specifically, relative to the oldest age group (> 65+), susceptibility for the youngest age group (0C17 years) is 0.13 [0.09, 0.18], and it increases to 0.53 [0.49, 0.59] for 18C44 and 0.75 [0.68, 0.82] for 45C64. More importantly, our results reveal clear changes of age-specific susceptibility (defined as average risk of getting infected during an infectious contact incorporating age-dependent behavioral factors) after the lockdown was lifted, with a trend largely consistent with reported age-specific adherence levels to social distancing and preventive measures. Specifically, the older groups (> 45) (with the highest levels of adherence) appear to have the most significant reductions of susceptibility (e.g., post-lockdown susceptibility reduced to 31.6% [29.3%, 34%] of the estimate before lifting the lockdown for the 6+ group). Finally, we find heterogeneity in case reporting among different age groups, with the lowest rate occurring among the 0C17 group (9.7% [6.4%, 19%]). Our results provide a more fundamental understanding of the impacts of stringent lockdown measures, and finer evidence that other social distancing and preventive measures may be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

We applied a generalized structural equation model with three mediating variables: sleep problems, job-related stress, and depressive symptoms. (3) Results: The total effect and direct effect of the categories of working hours longer than 41 h per week (h/w) for occurrence of near-misses were not significantly higher than that of 35C40 h/w. However, for indirect effects on occurrence of near-misses that first passed through job-related stress, there were higher reports for each category compared to 35C40 h/w, with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of OR = 1.12, 95% CI (1.07, 1.21) for 41C50 h/w; 1.25, (1.14, 1.41) for 51C60 h/w; and 1.31, (1.18, 1.51) for  61 h/w. (4) Conclusion: The results suggest that reducing working hours might improve job-related stress, which could reduce near-misses and prevent injuries.","output":"A Generalized Structural Equation Model Approach to Long Working Hours and Near-Misses among Healthcare Professionals in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented social and economic consequences in the United States Therefore, accurately predicting the dynamics of the pandemic can be very beneficial Two main elements required for developing reliable predictions include: (1) a predictive model and (2) an indicator of the current condition and status of the pandemic As a pandemic indicator, we used the effective reproduction number (Rt), which is defined as the number of new infections transmitted by a single contagious individual in a population that may no longer be fully susceptible To bring the pandemic under control, Rt must be less than one To eliminate the pandemic, Rt should be close to zero Therefore, this value may serve as a strong indicator of the current status of the pandemic For a predictive model, we used graph neural networks (GNNs), a method that combines graphical analysis with the structure of neural networks We developed two types of GNN models, including: (1) graph-theory-based neural networks (GTNN) and (2) neighborhood-based neural networks (NGNN) The nodes in both graphs indicated individual states in the United States While the GTNN model's edges document functional connectivity between states, those in the NGNN model link neighboring states to one another We trained both models with Rt numbers collected over the previous four days and asked them to predict the following day for all states in the United States The performance of these models was evaluated with the datasets that included Rt values reflecting conditions from 22 January through 26 November 2020 (before the start of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States) To determine the efficiency, we compared the results of two models with each other and with those generated by a baseline Long short-term memory (LSTM) model The results indicated that the GTNN model outperformed both the NGNN and LSTM models for predicting Rt","output":"Predicting the Dynamics of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States Using Graph Theory-Based Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS Evidence-based guidelines for the selection of appropriately sized ventilation tubes as well as their placement do not exist, although iatrogenic injuries to the trachea and larynx following endotracheal intubation are not infrequent. Our objective was to provide selection recommendations for ventilation tubes based on anatomic criteria. STUDY DESIGN Prospective cross-sectional study at a tertiary care hospital. METHODS From January 2010 to June 2010 all patients more than 16 years who underwent computer tomography of the neck were included. Contraindications were intubation, tracheotomy, fractures of the lower jaw, tumors, and head or neck deformities. Radiologic data was used to determine the distance between the lower incisors and cricoid cartilage and the smallest laryngotracheal diameter. The results were correlated with patient characteristics and compared with properties of ventilation tubes. RESULTS One hundred fifty-nine patients were included in the study. The laryngotracheal constriction was subcricoidal with a mean diameter of 15.5  3.2 mm coronal and 17.1  2.6 mm sagittal. The mean distance between lower incisors and cricoid cartilage was 176.5  14.8 mm. Patient height correlated significantly with the coronal subcricoid tracheal diameter (r = .51; P < .001) as well as with the distance between lower incisors and cricoid cartilage (r = .64; P < .001). No statistically significant gender or age-related correlations were found. Despite having the same specifications, tubes from different manufacturers differed considerably in their dimensions. CONCLUSIONS Selection of size and placement of ventilation tubes can be based on patient height. Considerable differences in the dimensions of ventilation tubes necessitate a height-based nomogram for evidence-based tube selection and placement.

In total, the country has more than 19.2 million confirmed cases of Covid-19, including over 533,509 fatalities. A set of emerging variants arose in the country, some of them posing new challenges for COVID-19 control. The goal of this study was to describe mutational events across samples from Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 sequences openly publicly obtainable on the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data-EpiCoV (GISAID-EpiCoV) platform and generate an index of new mutant by each genome. A total of 16,953 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained and are not proportionally representative of the five Brazilian geographical regions. A comparative sequence analysis was conducted to identify common mutations located at 42 positions of the genome (38 were in coding regions whereas two in 5 and two in 3 UTR). Moreover, 11 were synonymous and 27 missense variants, and more than 44.4% were located in the spike gene. Across the total of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) identified, 32 were found in genomes obtained from all five Brazilian regions. While a high genomic diversity is reported in Europe given the large number of sequenced genomes, Africa is emerging as a hotspot for new variants. In South America, Brazil and Chile, rates are similar to those found in South Africa and India, giving enough space to generate new viral mutations. Genomic surveillance is the central key to identifying the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil and has shown that the country is one of the hotspots in the generation of new variants.","output":"High rate of mutational events in SARS-CoV-2 genomes across Brazilian geographical regions, February 2020 to June 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reverse engineering is labor-intensive work to understand the inner implementation of a program, and is necessary for malware analysis, vulnerability hunting, etc. Cross-version function identification and subroutine matching would greatly release manpower by indicating the known parts coming from different binary programs.

We study three stake levels: 5 (n = 177), 100 (n = 168), and 1,000 (n = 171). We find that individuals decrease the donated fraction of the pie as the stakes increase. However, people still share roughly 20% of 1,000, an amount as high as the average monthly salary of people at the age of our subjects. We further report that the number of people sharing 50% of the pie is remarkably stable across stakes but donating the whole pie -the modal behavior in charity-donation experiments- disappears with stakes. Such hyper-altruistic behavior thus seems to be an artifact of the stakes typically employed in economic and psychological experiments. Our findings point out that sharing with others is a prevalent human feature, but stakes are an important determinant of sharing and policies frequently promoted via prosocial frames (such as stressing the effects of mask-wearing or social distancing on others during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic or environmentally-friendly behaviors on future generations) may thus be miscalibrated if they disregard the stakes at play.","output":"Hyper-altruistic behavior vanishes with high stakes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dysregulated Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 activation is involved in acute systemic sepsis, chronic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis and diabetes, and in viral infections, such as influenza infection. Thus, therapeutic control of the TLR4 signalling pathway is of major interest. Here we tested the activity of the small-molecule synthetic TLR4 antagonist, FP7, in vitro on human monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and in vivo during influenza virus infection of mice. Our results indicate that FP7 antagonized the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1) by monocytes and DCs (IC(50) < 1 M) and prevented DC maturation upon TLR4 activation by ultrapure lipopolysaccharide (LPS). FP7 selectively blocked TLR4 stimulation, but not TLR1/2, TLR2/6, or TLR3 activation. TLR4 stimulation of human DCs resulted in increased glycolytic activity that was also antagonized by FP7. FP7 protected mice from influenza virus-induced lethality and reduced both proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in the lungs and acute lung injury (ALI). Therefore, FP7 can antagonize TLR4 activation in vitro and protect mice from severe influenza infection, most likely by reducing TLR4-dependent cytokine storm mediated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) like HMGB1.","output":"TLR4 antagonist FP7 inhibits LPS-induced cytokine production and glycolytic reprogramming in dendritic cells, and protects mice from lethal influenza infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV2 exists chiefly in two conformations, open and closed.

This variation is derived from discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis, where the polymerase switches template from a 3? proximal genome body sequence to a 5? untranslated leader sequence. This leads to a fusion between the common 5? leader sequence and a 3? proximal body sequence in the RNA product. This process revolves around a common core sequence (CS) that is present at both the template sites that make up the fusion junction. Base-pairing between the leader CS and the nascent complementary minus strand body CS, and flanking regions (together called the transcription regulating sequence, TRS) is vital for this template switching event. However, various factors can influence the site of template switching within the same TRS duplex. Here, we model the duplexes formed between the leader and complementary body TRS regions, hypothesizing the role of the stability of the TRS duplex in determining the major sites of template switching for the most abundant mRNAs. We indicate that the stability of secondary structures and the speed of transcription play key roles in determining the probability of template switching in the production of subgenomic RNAs. We speculate on the effect of reported variant nucleotide substitutions on our models.","output":"Duplex formation between the template and the nascent strand in the transcription-regulating sequences is associated with the site of template switching in SARS C CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 global pandemic brings about a new episode in the multi-layered political, economic and humanitarian crisis affecting Puerto Rico since 2006.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Serial thin-section CT scans in 30 patients (17 men, aged 42.5 years +/- 12.2 [SD]) with SARS were reviewed by two radiologists together for predominant patterns of lung abnormalities: ground-glass opacities, ground-glass opacities with superimposed linear opacities, consolidation, reticular pattern, and mixed pattern (consolidation, ground-glass opacities, and reticular pattern). Scans were classified according to duration in weeks after symptom onset. Longitudinal changes of specific abnormalities were documented in 17 patients with serial scans obtained during 3 weeks. Each lung was divided into three zones; each zone was evaluated for percentage of lung involvement. Summation of scores from all six lung zones provided overall CT score (maximal CT score, 24). RESULTS Median CT scores increased from 1 in the 1st week to 12.5 in the 2nd week. Ground-glass opacities with or without smooth interlobular septal thickening and consolidation were predominant patterns found during the 1st week. Ground-glass opacities with superimposed irregular reticular opacities, mixed pattern, and reticular opacities were noted from the 2nd week and peaked at or after the 4th week. After the 4th week, 12 (55%) of 22 patients had irregular linear opacities with or without associated ground-glass opacities and CT scores greater than 5; five of these patients had bronchial dilatation. When specific opacities were analyzed in 17 patients, consolidation generally resolved completely (n = 4) or to minimal residual opacities; six (55%) of 11 patients with ground-glass opacities had substantial residual disease (CT scores > 5) on final scans. CONCLUSION There is a temporal pattern of lung abnormalities at thin-section CT in SARS. Predominant findings at presentation are ground-glass opacities and consolidation. Reticulation is evident after the 2nd week and persists in half of all patients evaluated after 4 weeks.

KEY FINDINGS: Medical Imaging plays an important auxiliary role in the diagnosis of Covid-19 patients, mainly those most seriously affected. Practice differs widely among different countries, mainly due to the variability of access to resources (viral testing and imaging equipment, specialised staff, protective equipment). It has been now well-documented that chest radiographs should be the first-line imaging tool and chest CT should only be reserved for critically ill patients, or when chest radiograph and clinical presentation may be inconclusive. CONCLUSION: As radiographers work on the frontline, they should be aware of the potential risks associated with Covid-19 and engage in optimal strategies to reduce these. Their role in vetting, conducting and often reporting the imaging examinations is vital, as well as their contribution in patient safety and care. Medical Imaging should be limited to critically ill patients, and where it may have an impact on the patient management plan. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: At the time of publication, this review offers the most up-to-date recommendations for clinical practitioners in radiology departments, including radiographers. Radiography practice has to significantly adjust to these new requirements to support optimal and safe imaging practices for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The adoption of low dose CT, rigorous infection control protocols and optimal use of personal protective equipment may reduce the potential risks of radiation exposure and infection, respectively, within Radiology departments.","output":"COVID-19 in the radiology department: What radiographers need to know"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research shows that extrahousehold kin economic resources contribute to the racial gap in transitions into homeownership, but the extent to which these resources matter for racial disparities in exits from homeownership is less understood.

For thoracic surgery, the first ERAS guidelines were published by the ERAS Society and the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) in 2019. We have now evaluated how ERAS-items are implemented in clinical practice by using an online survey. MATERIAL AND METHODS An online survey was conducted from 12/5/2021 until 1/6/2021. The survey consisted of 22 questions focusing on the key elements of an ERAS program according to the published ERAS guidelines. Results were summarised, descriptively analysed and put into context with the current literature. RESULTS Of 155 thoracic surgeons, 32 responded to the survey. In 28.1% (n = 9) of the hospitals, an ERAS core unit was established, and a database to record the ERAS items existed in 15.6% (n = 5). Only 3.1% (n = 1) kept an ERAS-diary preoperatively. A so-called Carboloading was conducted at 15.6% (n = 5) of surgeons. Standard PONV prophylaxis was administered to 59.4% (n = 19) of the patients. In most cases (84.4%, n = 29), a single drain was inserted into the pleural cavity during anatomic resections. In 3% (n = 1) of the centres two drains, in 12.5% (n = 4) no drainage was placed. The most commonly applied initial suction was -10 cmH2O (75%, n = 24). Suction  2 cmH2O was used by only two of those interviewed. Drainage removal took place in 50% (n = 16) of cases between the 1st or 2nd POD, in 34.4% of cases (n = 11) between the 3rd and 4th POD and in 9.4% (n = 3) the drain remained longer than the 4th POD. The first postoperative mobilisation took place in 71.9% (n = 23) of the centres on the day of the operation. CONCLUSIONS The implementation of ERAS guidelines varies in Germany between centres.

Due to the high mortality and morbidity in COVID-19-related brain damage, some changes to these general protocols, however, are necessary for ensuring the delivery of therapeutic(s) to the specific components of the CNS to meet their specific requirements.

Among AI/AN persons, age-standardized COVID-19 case and hospitalization risks were 3.7 (95% CI 3.6C3.8) and 10.5 (95% CI 9.8C11.2) times as high as persons of other races. Hospitalized AI/AN patients had higher proportions of diabetes mellitus (48% vs. 33%, P < 0.0001) and chronic liver disease (8% vs. 5%, P = 0.0004) compared to hospitalized patients of other races. AI/AN populations have disproportionately higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization compared to other races in New Mexico. By identifying etiologic factors that contribute to inequity, public health partners can implement culturally appropriate health interventions to mitigate disease severity within AI/AN communities.

We further aimed to investigate the correlation of laboratory data and lymph node stiffness to provide a reference basis for the early diagnosis of NFKD. METHODS Lymph node stiffness measurements were prospectively performed in 47 patients with NFKD, 56 patients with BCL, and 56 HC using SWE. Cervical SWE was compared in the groups. Factors associated with increased cervical lymph node stiffness were studied. RESULTS The mean elasticity of the largest cervical lymph nodes was significantly higher in the BCL group than the NFKD and HC groups (mean elasticity  SD, 16.37  2.45, 12.22  2.64, and 7.81  1.67 kPa, respectively; P < .01), with a cutoff of 14.55 kPa (area under the curve, 0.885; sensitivity, 89%; and specificity, 76%).

Significant progress has been made in identifying genetic risk for AD, but limited studies have investigated how AD genetic risk may be associated with other disease conditions in an unbiased fashion. In this study, we conducted a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) by genetic ancestry groups within a large academic health system using the polygenic risk score (PRS) for AD. PRS was calculated using LDpred2 with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. Phenotypes were extracted from electronic health record (EHR) diagnosis codes and mapped to more clinically meaningful phecodes. Logistic regression with Firths bias correction was used for PRS phenotype analyses. Mendelian randomization was used to examine causality in significant PheWAS associations. Our results showed a strong association between AD PRS and AD phenotype in European ancestry (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.40). Among a total of 1,515 PheWAS tests within the European sample, we observed strong associations of AD PRS with AD and related phenotypes, which include mild cognitive impairment (MCI), memory loss, and dementias. We observed a phenome-wide significant association between AD PRS and gouty arthropathy (OR = 0.90, adjusted p = 0.05). Further causal inference tests with Mendelian randomization showed that gout was not causally associated with AD. We concluded that genetic predisposition of AD was negatively associated with gout, but gout was not a causal risk factor for AD. Our study evaluated AD PRS in a real-world EHR setting and provided evidence that AD PRS may help to identify individuals who are genetically at risk of AD and other related phenotypes. We identified non-neurodegenerative diseases associated with AD PRS, which is essential to understand the genetic architecture of AD and potential side effects of drugs targeting genetic risk factors of AD. Together, these findings expand our understanding of AD genetic and clinical risk factors, which provide a framework for continued research in aging with the growing number of real-world EHR linked with genetic data.","output":"Phenome-Wide Association Study of Polygenic Risk Score for Alzheimers Disease in Electronic Health Records"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN: Observational. OBJECTIVES: To report on the rate of major complications following spinal fusion and instrumentation to treat spinal deformity in patients with cerebral palsy (CP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Understanding the risk of major complications following the surgical treatment of spine deformities in patients with CP is critical. METHODS: A prospectively collected, multicenter database of patients with CP who had surgical correction of their spinal deformity (scoliosis or kyphosis) was reviewed for all major complications. Patients with  2 year follow-up or who died  2 years of surgery were included. A complication was defined as major if it resulted in reoperation, re-admission to the hospital, prolongation of the hospital stay, was considered life-threatening, or resulted in residual disability. Overall complication and revision rates were calculated for the perioperative (Peri-op; occurring  90 days postoperative) and delayed postoperative (Delayed; > 90 days) time periods. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-seven patients met inclusion. Seventy-eight (30%) patients had a major complication, 18 (7%) had > 1. There were 92 (36%) major complications; 64 (24.9%) occurred Peri-op. The most common Peri-op complications were wound (n = 16, 6.2%) and pulmonary issues (n = 28, 10.9%), specifically deep infections (n = 12, 4.7%) and prolonged ventilator support (n = 21, 8.2%). Delayed complications (n = 28, 10.9%) were primarily deep infections (n = 8, 3.1%) and instrumentation-related (n = 6, 2.3%). There were 42 additional surgeries for an overall unplanned return to the operating room rate of 16% (Peri-op: 8.6%, Delayed: 7.8%). Thirty-six (14.0%) reoperations were spine related surgeries (wound or instrumentation-related). Eleven (4.3%) patients died between 3 months to 5.6 years postoperatively; 4 occurred  1 year of surgery. Two deaths were directly related to the spinal deformity surgery. CONCLUSION: Spinal deformity surgery in CP patients with greater than 2 years of follow-up have a postoperative major complication rate of 36% with a spine-related reoperation rate of 14.0%.

NF-B activator 1 (Act1) is mainly expressed in immune cells, including macrophages, and modulates immune cells function to regulate inflammation in inflammatory diseases. Macrophages play a vital role in the pathophysiology of periodontitis. However, the effect of macrophage-specific Act1 on periodontitis has not been investigated yet. This study aims to unravel the role of macrophage-specific Act1 on the pathophysiology of periodontitis. The expression of Act1 in healthy and periodontitis periodontal tissue was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Macrophage-specific Act1 expression downregulated (anti-Act1) mice were developed by inserting anti-Act1 antisense oligonucleotides after the CD68 promoter of C57BL/6 mice. Ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP) was induced in anti-Act1 mice and wildtype mice. Micro-CT, histology, and TRAP staining analyzed the periodontal tissue status, alveolar bone loss, and osteoclast numbers. Immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR, and ELISA analyzed the inflammatory cells infiltration, expression of inflammatory cytokines, and M1/M2 macrophage polarization. mRNA sequencing of in vitro bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated peritoneal macrophages analyzed the differentially expressed genes in anti-Act1 mice during inflammation. Anti-Act1 mice showed aggravated periodontitis and alveolar bone loss compared to wildtype. Periodontitis-affected periodontal tissue (PAPT) of anti-Act1 mice showed a higher degree of macrophage infiltration, and M1 macrophage polarization compared to wildtype. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF), and macrophage activity-related factors (CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4) were robustly high in PAPT of anti-Act1 mice compared to wildtype. mRNA sequencing and KEGG analysis showed activated TNF/NF-B signaling in LPS-treated macrophages from anti-Act1 mice. In vitro studies on LPS-treated peritoneal macrophages from anti-act1 mice showed a higher degree of cell migration and expression of inflammatory cytokines, macrophage activity-related factors, M1 macrophage-related factors, and TNF/NF-B signaling related P-p65 protein. In conclusion, downregulation of macrophage-specific Act1 aggravated periodontitis, alveolar bone loss, macrophage infiltration, inflammation, and M1 macrophage polarization. Furthermore, LPS-treated macrophages from anti-Act1 mice activated TNF/NF-B signaling. These results indicate the distinct role of macrophage-specific Act1 on the pathophysiology of periodontitis possibly via TNF/NF-B signaling.","output":"Downregulation of Macrophage-Specific Act-1 Intensifies Periodontitis and Alveolar Bone Loss Possibly via TNF/NF-B Signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The objective of this article is to elaborate how the form of remote work can be hindered in an institutional cultural context in non-Western countries.

Therefore, finding an efficient, robust, accurate, and widely available, and accessible alternative to RT-PCR for COVID-19 diagnosis is a matter of utmost importance. This study proposes a complete blood count (CBC) biomarkers-based COVID-19 detection system using a stacking machine learning (SML) model, which could be a fast and less expensive alternative. This study used seven different publicly available datasets, where the largest one consisting of fifteen CBC biomarkers collected from 1624 patients (52% COVID-19 positive) admitted at San Raphael Hospital, Italy from February to May 2020 was used to train and validate the proposed model. White blood cell count, monocytes (%), lymphocyte (%), and age parameters collected from the patients during hospital admission were found to be important biomarkers for COVID-19 disease prediction using five different feature selection techniques. Our stacking model produced the best performance with weighted precision, sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and F1-score of 91.44%, 91.44%, 91.44%, 91.45%, and 91.45%, respectively. The stacking machine learning model improved the performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers. Finally, a nomogram-based scoring system (QCovSML) was constructed using this stacking approach to predict the COVID-19 patients. The cut-off value of the QCovSML system for classifying COVID-19 and Non-COVID patients was 4.8. Six datasets from three different countries were used to externally validate the proposed model to evaluate its generalizability and robustness. The nomogram demonstrated good calibration and discrimination with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.961 for the internal cohort and average AUC of 0.967 for all external validation cohort, respectively.

Aims: In this paper we demonstrate (1) how to facilitate digital infrastructures to run a retrospective study in a research network spread across university and non-university hospital sites; and (2) to answer a medical question on COVID-19 related change in diagnostic counts for diabetes-related eye diseases. Materials and methods: The study is retrospective and non-interventional and runs on medical case data documented in routine care at the participating sites. The technical infrastructure consists of the OMOP CDM and other OHDSI tools that is provided in a transferable format. An ETL process to transfer and harmonize the data to the OMOP CDM has been utilized. Cohort definitions for each year in observation have been created centrally and applied locally against medical case data of all participating sites and analyzed with descriptive statistics. Results: The analyses showed an expectable drop of the total number of diagnoses and the diagnoses for diabetes in general; whereas the number of diagnoses for diabetes-related eye diseases surprisingly decreased stronger compared to non-eye diseases. Differences in relative changes of diagnoses counts between sites show an urgent need to process multi-centric studies rather than single-site studies to reduce bias in the data. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated the ability to utilize an existing portable and standardized infrastructure and ETL process from a university hospital setting and transfer it to non-university sites.

Immune responses according to IgG against nucleocapsid and spike antigens, and CD4 and CD8 interferon-gamma release assay against spike antigens, were evaluated. Results: A total of 1973 subjects were tested (61.7% residents, 48.3% staff), with a mean (SD) follow-up of 46.4 (3.6) weeks between assessments. More than half of residents and more than a third of staff had evidence of COVID-19 before vaccination; 26.9% and 22.7% had seroreversion of IgG-N, and 8.9% and 4.6% had IgG-N seroconversion at second assessment, respectively.

Development of evidence-based interventions are in pivotal role in the development of better targeted rehabilitation of CP, and thus in maintaining their motor function and wellbeing. Our aim is to investigate the efficacy of an individually tailored, multifaceted exercise intervention (EXECP) in children and young adults with CP. EXECP is composed of strength, flexibility and gait training. Furthermore, this study aims to verify the short-term retention of the adaptations three months after the end of the EXECP intervention. METHODS: Twenty-four children and young adults with spastic CP will be recruited to participate in a 9-month research project with a 3-month training intervention, consisting of two to three 90-min sessions per week. In each session, strength training for the lower limbs and trunk muscles, flexibility training for the lower limbs and inclined treadmill gait training will be performed. We will evaluate muscle strength, joint flexibility, neuromuscular and cardiometabolic parameters. A nonconcurrent multiple baseline design with two pre-tests and two post-tests all interspaced by three months is used. In addition to the CP participants, 24 typically developing age and sex-matched participants will perform the two pre-tests (i.e. no intervention) to provide normative data.

Strategies at improving oxygenation have evolved over the course of the pandemic. Recent Findings Although non-invasive respiratory support reduces the need for intubation, a significant number of patients with COVID-19 progress to invasive mechanical ventilation. Once intubated, a lung protective ventilation strategy should be employed that limits tidal volumes to 6 ml/kg of predicted body weight and employs sufficient positive end-expiratory pressure to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the fraction of inspired oxygen. Intermittent prone positioning is effective at improving survival, and there is a growing body of evidence that it can be safely performed in spontaneously breathing patients to reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators have not been shown to improve survival or cost-effectiveness in COVID-19 and should be used selectively.

Human NoVs are divided into at least three genogroups, genogroups I (GI), GII, and GIV, which contain at least 15, 18, and 1 genotypes, respectively. Except for a few genotypes, all NoVs bind to histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), namely ABH antigens and Lewis antigens, in which carbohydrate core structures, (types 1 and 2) constitute antigenically distinct phenotypes. Volunteer challenge studies have indicated that carbohydrate binding is essential for genogroup I genotype 1 (GI/1) infection. Non-secretors who do not express FUT2 fucosyltransferase, and consequently do not express H type 1 or Lewis b antigens in the gut, are not infected after challenge with GI/1. NoV virus-like particles (VLPs), which are recombinant particles that are morphologically and antigenically similar to the native virion, display different ABH and Le carbohydrate-binding profiles in vitro. Epidemiological studies have shown that individuals with different ABH phenotypes are infected with NoV strains in a genotype-specific manner. On the other hand, an in vitro binding assay using NoV VLPs showed a uniform recognition pattern against type 1 and 2 core structures, and bind more tightly to type 1 carbohydrates than to type 2. Type 1 carbohydrates are expressed at the surface of the small intestine and are presumably targeted by NoV. This property may afford NoV tissue specificity. GII/4 includes global epidemic strains and binds to more HBGAs than other genogroups. This characteristic may be linked to the worldwide transmission of GII/4 strains. Although it is still unclear whether HBGAs act as primary receptors or enhance NoV infectivity, they are important factors in determining tissue specificity and the risk of transmission.","output":"Norovirus and histo-blood group antigens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Before COVID-19, universal demand for distance education was increasing.

Despite many observations, the real impact of COVID-19 in the European Union (EU), its underlying factors and their contribution to mortality and morbidity outcomes were never systematically investigated. The aim of the present work is to provide an overview and a meta-analysis of main predictors and of country differences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-associated mortality rate (MR) in hospitalized patients. Out of 3714 retrieved articles, 87 studies were considered, including 35,486 patients (mean age 60.9  8.2 years) and 5867 deaths. After adjustment for confounders, diabetes mellitus was the best predictors of MR in an age- and sex-dependent manner, followed by chronic pulmonary obstructive diseases and malignancies. In both the US and Europe, MR was higher than that reported in Asia (25[20;29] % and 20[17;23] % vs. 13[10;17]%; both p < 0.02). Among clinical parameters, dyspnea, fatigue and myalgia, along with respiratory rate, emerged as the best predictors of MR. Finally, reduced lymphocyte and platelet count, along with increased D-dimer levels, all significantly contributed to increased mortality.

Despite its prevalence among women of reproductive age, the pathology of the disease has not yet been elucidated and only symptomatic treatment is available. Endometriosis has high latency and diagnostic methods are both limited and invasive. AIM OF REVIEW: The aim of this review is to summarise minimally invasive or non-invasive diagnostic methods for endometriosis and their diagnostic efficiencies. Furthermore, we discuss the identification and diagnostic potential of novel disease biomarkers of microbial or glycan origin. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: Great efforts have been made to develop minimally invasive or non-invasive diagnostic methods in endometriosis. The problem with most potential biomarker candidates is that they have high accuracy only in cases of severe disease. Therefore, it is necessary to examine other potential biomarkers more closely. Associations between gastrointestinal and genital tract microbial health and endometriosis have been identified. For instance, irritable bowel syndrome is more common in women with endometriosis, and hormonal imbalance has a negative impact on the microbiome of both the genital tract and the gastrointestinal system. Further interrogation of these associations may have potential diagnostic significance and may identify novel therapeutic avenues. Glycomics may also be a potent source of biomarkers of endometriosis, with a number of glyco-biomarkers already approved by the FDA. Endometriosis-associated microbial and glycomic profiles may represent viable targets for development of innovative diagnostics in this debilitating disease.","output":"Novel diagnostic options for endometriosis C Based on the glycome and microbiome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current understanding of the complex pathogenesis of COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia pathogenesis in the light of biopsies carried out in early/moderate phase and histology data obtained at postmortem analysis is discussed.

As a result, there are many different preparedness approaches using divergent core terminology. In this article a common definition for the term unusual biological incident is proposed. To do so, a literature review as well as semi-structured expert interviews with representatives of central actors in Germany were conducted. The understanding of unusual biological incident was not consistent among experts; four approaches to qualify a biological incident as unusual were identified. These were merged in a comprehensive system-oriented approach that focuses on the health systems resilience and on shortages of knowledge and material resources during incidents. Based on this approach, we suggest a stage model for the categorization of biological threats as incident, crisis, severe crisis, or disaster. The need for central coordination is a defining characteristic to qualify a biological incident as unusual.

Niveau de preuve: V ; tude observationnelle Introduction: The aim of this study was to compare the volume and characteristics of emergency trauma surgery procedures done at our hospital between March 20 and April 20, 2020 (the first month of the national lockdown in France) and to compare these data to the same period in 2019. We hypothesized that a portion of fractures are unavoidable, thus specific preventative measures will be needed to reduce their incidence. Methods: This was a continuous, observational, single center study. All patients who required urgent surgery for a fracture between March 20 and April 20, 2020, were included. Data for the same period in 2019 was retrieved. All the procedures were done at our hospital, which is a regional level II trauma center. Results: During the first month of the lockdown, 70 patients underwent emergency surgery because of a fracture, versus 109 patients in the same period in 2019, thus an overall 36% drop. The mean age of the patients was higher in 2020 (68.4 years SD = 22) than in 2019 (60.3 years SD = 24, p = 0.0210). There were fewer recreational and motor vehicle accidents in 2020 (34 vs. 10) and fewer work-related accidents (7 vs. 2) although the number of accidents at home were similar (65 vs. 55). Conclusion: During a public health emergency, it is vital to continue doing trauma surgery procedures, even though it requires a specific care pathway. The lockdown and associated behavioral changes have altered the spectrum of trauma surgery. A major decrease in motor vehicle, recreation and work-related accidents is the avoidable portion of this surgical activity, justifying specific preventative measures during a public health crisis.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels achieved after statin reinitiation are unknown. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to determine LDL-C levels after statin reinitiation. METHODS We analyzed data from 5498 participants in the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke study who reported ever taking a statin. We categorized participants according to their pattern of statin use including those taking a statin who did not experience statin-associated symptoms and continued treatment, and those who discontinued statins because of statin-associated symptoms and were not reinitiated, reinitiated and remained on treatment, and discontinued treatment after being reinitiated. Mortality and vascular event reduction with statin reinitiation was estimated using data from the Cholesterol-Lowering Treatment Trialists Collaboration. RESULTS After multivariable adjustment, LDL-C was 14.1 (95% CI: 9.9-18.3) mg/dL higher among participants reinitiated and taking a statin compared with those without statin-associated symptoms who continued statin therapy. Mean LDL-C was 18.1 mg/dL (95% CI: 13.0-23.1) and 27.5 mg/dL (95% CI: 20.7-34.4) lower among participants reinitiated and taking a statin compared with those who discontinued statin therapy and were not reinitiated and those who discontinued statins after being reinitiated, respectively.

This study evaluated the transmissibility of the infectious disease and analyzed its association with temperature and humidity to study the propagation pattern of COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, we revised the reported data in Wuhan based on several assumptions to estimate the actual number of confirmed cases considering that perhaps not all cases could be detected and reported in the complex situation there. Then we used the equation derived from the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model to calculate R0 from January 24, 2020 to February 13, 2020 in 11 major cities in China for comparison. With the calculation results, we conducted correlation analysis and regression analysis between R0 and temperature and humidity for four major cities in China to see the association between the transmissibility of COVID-19 and the weather variables. RESULTS: It was estimated that the cumulative number of confirmed cases had exceeded 45 000 by February 13, 2020 in Wuhan. The average R0 in Wuhan was 2.7, significantly higher than those in other cities ranging from 1.8 to 2.4. The inflection points in the cities outside Hubei Province were between January 30, 2020 and February 3, 2020, while there had not been an obvious downward trend of R0 in Wuhan. R0 negatively correlated with both temperature and humidity, which was significant at the 0.01 level. CONCLUSIONS: The transmissibility of COVID-19 was strong and importance should be attached to the intervention of its transmission especially in Wuhan.

Finding novel molecules to regulate neuroinflammation is of significant clinical value. We have previously shown that adjudin, a small molecule compound known to possess antispermatogenic function, attenuates microglia activation by suppression of the NF-B pathway. In this study we continued to explore whether adjudin could be neuroprotective by using the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model. Adjudin treatment after reperfusion significantly decreased the infarction volume and neuroscore compared to the vehicle group. Staining of CD11b showed that adjudin markedly inhibited microglial activation in both the cortex and the striatum, accompanied by a reduction in the expression and release of cytokines TNF-, IL-1 and IL-6. Concomitantly, adjudin noticeably prevented BBB disruption after ischemia and reperfusion, as indicated by the reduction of IgG detection in the brain cortex and striatum versus the vehicle group. This finding was also corroborated by immunofluorescence staining and immunoblotting of tight junction-related proteins ZO-1, JAM-A and Occludin, where the reduction of these proteins could be attenuated by adjudin treatment.

In order to realize a buildings carbon mitigation targets, the impact of individual occupancy profiles needs to be integrated with building simulation models. This paper introduces a decision support framework as a potential solution to make energy performance upgrade choices based on different occupancy profiles. This framework has been demonstrated through a case study of two single-family detached homes in Canada, which were highly instrumented with sensors for monitoring energy input and output. The case studies represented two common occupancy profiles-(1) a family of four (consisting of 2 working adults and 2 teenagers); and (2) a retired couple. Firstly, calibrated energy models were developed by using one-year energy use data collected through an intrusive load monitoring technique. Secondly, energy upgrade combinations were considered for each profile and tested for additional investment, payback period and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Lastly, the most suitable combination of energy upgrade for each profile was ranked using a multi-criteria decision-making method (e.g., TOPSIS). Results indicated that the retired couple used more energy than the family of four and required energy upgrades with usually higher payback periods to achieve the same level of GHG emission reduction. The results of this research are timely for energy policymaking and developing best management practices, which need to be implemented along with the deployment of more stringent building standards and codes.","output":"Occupant-based energy upgrades selection for Canadian residential buildings based on field energy data and calibrated simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent emergence and re-emergence of alphaviruses, in particular the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), in numerous countries has invoked a worldwide threat to human health, while simultaneously generating an economic burden on affected countries.

In Japan, many clusters occurred during the first wave in 2020. We describe the investigation of an early outbreak in a Tokyo hospital. Methods A COVID-19 outbreak occurred in two wards of the hospital from April to early May 2020. Confirmed cases were individuals with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection linked to Wards A and B, and contacts were patients or workers in Wards A or B 2 weeks before the index cases developed symptoms. All contacts were tested, and cases were interviewed to determine the likely route of infection and inform the development of countermeasures to curb transmission. Results There were 518 contacts, comprising 472 health-care workers (HCWs) and 46 patients, of whom 517 were tested. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 42 individuals (30 HCWs and 12 patients). The proportions of SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCWs were highest among surgeons, nurses, nursing assistants and medical assistants. Several HCWs in these groups reported being in close proximity to one another while not wearing medical masks. Among HCWs, infection was thought to be associated with the use of a small break room and conference room. Discussion Nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred in two wards of a Tokyo hospital, affecting HCWs and patients. Not wearing masks was considered a key risk factor for infection during this outbreak;masks are now a mandated countermeasure to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospital settings.","output":"Nosocomial outbreak of coronavirus disease in two general wards during the initial wave of the pandemic in 2020, Tokyo, Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter evaluates a variety of movement and border control measures in Asia and considers how these responses demonstrate the persistence of territorial sovereignty and the nation-state in a highly globalized world.

This framework employs three binaries for analyzing state control: territoriality (internal/external controls);nationality (citizens/aliens);and directionality (entry/exit). Ultimately, governmental responses to Covid-19 highlight both the independence and interdependence of states in a globalized world. The widespread closure of borders to outsiders and insiders demonstrates that classical Westphalian notions of the nation and state borders persist, even while being transformed by ever-more-innovative technologies.

This study has been designed to evaluate colchicine anti-inflammatory effect on the symptoms course, duration of hospitalization, morbidity and mortality rate, of COVID-19 patients. Methods: : In this prospective, open-label, randomized and double blind clinical trial, 100 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were randomized in a 1:1 allocation from May 21 to June 20, 2020, to either standard medical treatment (Hydroxychloroquine) or colchicine with standard medical treatment. The study took place in Imam Reza hospital of Ardabil city in Iran, with trial registration ID: 47707 (irct.ir). Colchicine group were received 1 mg tablet of colchicine daily alongside the Hydroxychloroquine for 6 days. Primary end points were (1) Length of hospitalization;(2) symptoms and (3) Co-existed disease. Secondary end points were examined 2 weeks after discharge and included (1) mortality and morbidity;(2) re-admission and (3) symptoms.

Whether health insurance deductibles are associated with forgoing of health care in a consumer-driven health care system with universal coverage, such as the Swiss health system, remains to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between insurance plan deductibles and forgoing of health care with consideration of socioeconomic factors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Geneva, Switzerland, using data collected from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2019. Population-based samples were obtained yearly through random stratified sampling by age and sex of the general population aged 20 to 74 years. Participants were invited to an appointment at 1 of the 3 study sites in Geneva, where they completed a sociodemographic and health questionnaire. EXPOSURES: Insurance plan deductible level. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was forgoing of health care owing to economic reasons. Unadjusted and multivariable Poisson models were used to assess the association between deductible level and forgoing of health care. Differences in forgoing health care across the range of health insurance deductibles or household income levels were quantified using the relative index of inequality (RII). RESULTS: The study group included 11 872 participants (5974 [50.3%] male; median age, 48.1 years [interquartile range, 38.7-59.1 years]); 1146 (9.7%) reported forgoing health care. Participants with high-deductible plans reported forgoing health care more frequently than those with low-deductible plans (331 [13.5%] vs 591 [8.7%]). In adjusted analysis, higher-deductible plans were associated with a greater likelihood of forgoing health care (RII, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.7-3.0; P < .001) independently of socioeconomic status, known comorbidities, and cardiovascular risk factors. Deductible level was associated with forgoing of health care among participants younger than 40 years (RII, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.6-4.0; P < .001) and those aged 40 to 64 years (RII, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.9; P = .002) but not among those older than 65 years (RII, 2.9; 95% CI, 0.8-10.4; P = .11). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, high insurance plan deductibles were associated with forgoing of health care independent of socioeconomic status and preexisting conditions in a universal consumer-driven health care system with good population outcomes in Switzerland. Uncovering health care system design features that could lead to suboptimal population care may help decision makers improve their current health care system design to achieve better outcomes.","output":"Health Insurance Deductibles and Health CareCSeeking Behaviors in a Consumer-Driven Health Care System With Universal Coverage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Excessive inflammatory signaling and pathological remodeling of the extracellular matrix are important contributors to cardiac fibrosis and involve major changes in gene expression. We examined the relationships between tissue-specific expression and the epigenetics of five genes involved in these pathways, NLRP3, MMP2, MMP9, CCN2/CTGF, and AGT. The proteins encoded by these genes play major fibrosis-related roles in inflammasome formation, degradation of extracellular matrix proteins and remodeling of the extracellular matrix and vasculature, autocrine regulation of fibrosis, or cell signaling. Our analyses showed that the first four of these genes had super-enhancers (unusually strong enhancer clusters) that correlate with their very high expression in monocytes, neutrophils, fibroblasts, or venous cells. Expression of the gene encoding miR-223, a micro-RNA that plays an important role in downregulating NLRP3 protein levels, is also probably driven by the super-enhancer in which it is embedded. Enhancer chromatin for all these genes was inside as well as outside the gene body. While AGT, which encodes precursors of angiotensin II, lacked a super-enhancer, its tissue-specific expression profile correlates with the tissue-specific enhancer chromatin extending into its distant silent gene neighbor (CAPN9). Tissue-specific peaks of DNA hypomethylation, open chromatin (DNaseI hypersensitivity), and transcription factor binding were detected in subregions of these super-enhancers/enhancers that are likely to be the main drivers of expression of their associated gene. We found that CCN2/CTGF is co-expressed with its far-upstream neighbor LINC01013, a noncoding RNA gene, specifically in vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and chondrocytes. Evidence from chromatin looping profiling (Hi-C) suggests coregulation of these genes in HUVEC. Our findings indicate the importance of understanding the often-overlooked roles of enhancers and their hypomethylated, transcription factor-binding subregions in the regulation of expression of fibrosis-related genes in normal and fibrotic tissue.","output":"Epigenetics and expression of key genes associated with cardiac fibrosis: NLRP3, MMP2, MMP9, CCN2/CTGF, and AGT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE It is important to understand the characteristics of patients with hyperhidrosis, which are different from the general population, for treating hyperhidrosis.

BACKGROUND: One of the most common and serious respiratory complications associated with acute stroke is HAP. Respiratory care is among the fundamentals of patient care, and thus competency in this field is expected as part of nursing training. However, there is a paucity of literature detailing RNs experiences with respiratory care in relation to HAP, specifically among patients with acute stroke, in the context of stroke units. As such, there is a need to expand the knowledge base relating to respiratory care focusing on HAP, to assist with evidence-based nursing. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study. METHOD: Eleven RNs working in four different acute stroke units in Southern Sweden participated in the current study. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews, and the transcribed interviews were analysed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: Three overarching categories were identified: (1), awareness of risk assessments and risk factors for HAP (2) targeting HAP through multiple nursing care actions, and (3) challenges in providing respiratory care to patients in risk of HAP. These reflected the similarities and differences in the experiences that RNs had with providing respiratory care in relation to HAP among in-patients with acute stroke. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that the RNs experience organisational challenges in providing respiratory care for HAP among patients with acute stroke. Respiratory care plays a vital role in the identification and prevention of HAP, but our findings imply that RNs knowledge needs to be improved, the fundamentals of nursing care need to be prioritised, and evidence-based guidelines must be implemented. RNs would also benefit from further education and support, in order to lead point-of-care nursing in multidisciplinary stroke teams.","output":"Registered nurses experiences of providing respiratory care in relation to hospital- acquired pneumonia at in-patient stroke units: a qualitative descriptive study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endometriosis is a chronic disease associated with pelvic pain and infertility.

Resultados: Foram identificados seis pacientes com resultado positivo para SARS-CoV-2 dos quais tres eram do sexo feminino, cinco possuiam genotipo SS e cinco eram portadores de alguma comorbidade sendo asma a mais comum, presente em dois pacientes. A idade media foi de 11,4 anos (6,6-16,8) e o IMC medio foi de 17,9 kg/m2 (12,5-27,5). A duracao media do tempo de internacao foi de oito dias (2-24). A principal queixa na entrada foi dor, presente em cinco pacientes. Em relacao as demais queixas, um paciente apresentava febre e sintomas respiratorios, um apenas sintomas respiratorios e um somente febre. O valor medio do d-dimero nos exames de entrada foi de 2,84 mcg/mL (2,08-5,99) e do d-dimero maximo foi de 5,85 mcg/mL (3,61-12,93). Das cinco tomografias realizadas, duas apresentavam padrao em vidro fosco tipico de infeccao viral. Durante a internacao, todos os pacientes apresentaram febre e dessaturacao, tres apresentaram sindrome toracica aguda (STA), todos receberam antibiotico e necessitaram de oxigenio suplementar, um fez uso de anticoagulacao e nenhum necessitou de UTI ou foi a obito. Discussao: Na nossa casuistica a asma foi a comorbidade mais comum nos pacientes infectados pelo novo coronavirus. Na literatura a asma e descrita como um fator de risco para o desenvolvimento de STA e, ate o presente momento, tambem foi identificada como fator preditivo de pior prognostico na evolucao da infeccao. No grupo de pacientes em questao, o paciente portador de asma foi o que apresentou evolucao mais prolongada. A dor foi a queixa inicial mais frequente entre os pacientes. Ainda nao esta clara a associacao entre COVID-19 e dor em pediatria, porem em adultos ja ha relatos de crise vaso oclusiva (CVO) como manifestacao inicial da doenca. Durante a evolucao a dessaturacao e a febre foram os sinais mais frequentes e que podem ser encontrados tanto na STA quanto na COVID-19. Na literatura a STA e descrita como uma complicacao de COVID-19, tendo sido identificada em metade dos nossos pacientes. Todos os pacientes necessitaram de suporte com oxigenio e antibioticoterapia, tratamento utilizado tanto na infeccao pelo novo coronavirus quanto na STA. Ainda nao e bem estabelecido o uso de anticoagulacao em pediatria nos casos de COVID-19, porem deve-se ter em mente que os pacientes com DF podem apresentar rotineiramente valores mais elevados de d-dimero durante CVO e STA. O paciente que recebeu anticoagulacao evoluiu com maior tempo de internacao. Os achados radiograficos de vidro fosco sao compativeis com os descritos ate o momento. Comparado com a literatura, nossos pacientes nao diferiram em termos de sexo, genotipo, duracao de internacao e desfecho.

Global rates of PTB continue to increase from 9.8 to 10.6% over a 15-year period from 2000 to 2014. Vaginal progesterone is commonly used by clinicians as a prevention strategy, with recent evidence affirming the benefit of vaginal (micronised) progesterone to prevent PTB in women with a shortened cervix (< 25 mm). Given the low incidence of a short cervix at mid-gestation in high-risk populations further evidence is required. The objective of this review is to determine if vaginal progesterone reduces spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) before 37 weeks in asymptomatic high-risk women with a singleton pregnancy with a normal mid-gestation cervical length. METHODS Studies will be sourced from MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Register of Trials (CENTRAL) from their inception onwards with the search terms 'progesterone' and 'preterm birth'. Studies will be screened and included if they assess vaginal progesterone compared to placebo in women with a normal cervical length. The primary outcome will be sPTB < 37 weeks, with secondary outcomes of sPTB < 34 weeks. Two independent reviewers will conduct study screening at abstract and full text level, data extraction and risk of bias assessment with disagreements resolved by an experienced researcher. The Mantel-Haenszel statistical method and random effects analysis model will be used to produce treatment effect odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals.

This study examined whether baseline perceived emotional intelligence (EI) predicted PTG through self-esteem and emotional regulation (ER) in a five-month follow-up study conducted on Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Validated measures were completed by 2090 participants, which assessed both the perceived EI and the PTG 1 month after a nationwide lockdown in China, with 1609 of these participating in the follow-up five months later. Structural equation models (SEM) were then used to explore the paths between the variables. RESULTS: As hypothesized, the follow-up survey found that the baseline perceived EI predicted PTG, ER, and self-esteem outcomes. The SEM analyses also revealed that self-esteem and ER significantly mediated the association between EI and PTG. LIMITATIONS: Studies of three or more waves may be more suitable for longitudinal mediation analyses. Self-assessment reports may have subjective effects. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that perceived EI might improve PTG in adolescents following the COVID-19 pandemic, and self-esteem and ER program training could be helpful in promoting PTG.","output":"Prospective examination of adolescent emotional intelligence and post-traumatic growth during and after COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Rapidly growing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to the health system in Nepal. The main objective of this study was to explore the characteristics and drivers of the health system preparedness towards COVID-19 and its impacts on frontline health care workers (HCWs) in Nepal. Methods: Semi-structured interviews (SSIs) were conducted among 32 HCWs who were involved in clinical care of COVID-19 patients and four policymakers who were responsible for COVID-19 control and management at central and provincial level. Participants were included from all seven provinces of Nepal. All SSIs were conducted through telephone or internet based tools such as Zoom and Skype. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed into English, and coded using inductive and deductive approaches. Results: Both HCWs and policymakers reported failure to initiate pre-emptive control measures at the early stages of the outbreak as the pivot in pandemic control. Although several measures were rolled out when cases started to appear, the overall health system preparedness was low. Specifically, there was inadequate personal protective equipment for HCWs, insufficient isolation beds for patients, poor coordination between the three tiers of governance, and poor engagement of the private sector. Additionally, HCWs experienced various degrees of stigma because of their profession and yet were able to maintain their motivation to continue working in the forefront. Conclusion: This study identified poor preparedness of the health system in the course of Nepal's COVID-19 response embedded in the governance. Specifically, the lack of human resources, inadequate logistic chain management and laboratory facilities for testing COVID-19 appeared to have jeopardized the health system preparedness and escalated the pandemic in Nepal. Despite the poor preparedness, and health and safety concerns, HCWs maintained their motivation.

To date, the virus has infected more than 110 million people worldwide and claimed 2.5 million lives. With the rapid increase in the number of infected cases, some countries face a shortage of testing resources. Computational methods such as deep learning algorithms can help in such a situation to expedite and automate the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: In this research, we trained eight convolutional neural network models to automatically detect and diagnose COVID-19 from medical imaging, including X-ray and CT scan images. Those deep learning networks have a predefined structure in which we re-train on medical images to serve our purpose, which is called transfer learning. RESULTS: We used two different medical images known as X-ray and CT scan. The experimental results show that CT scan achieved better performance than X-ray. Specifically, the Xception network model has achieved an overall performance on CT scan of 84%, 91%, and 77% for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively. That was the highest in all models that we trained. On the other hand, the same network model (Xception) was applied on X-ray and performed 69%, 83%, and 55% for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively. CONCLUSION: The performance of our proposed model to detect COVID-19 from CT scan is acceptable and promising to start in the field.

The year 2021 was characterized by both increases and decreases in COVID-19 incidence, and Russia was no exception. In this work, we describe regional features in the Northwestern federal district (FD) of Russia of the pandemic in 2021 based on Rospotrebnadzor statistics and data from SARS-CoV-2 genetic monitoring provided by the Saint Petersburg Pasteur Institute as a part of epidemiological surveillance. The epidemiological situation in the studied region was complicated by the presence of the megacity Saint Petersburg, featuring a high population density and its status as an international transport hub. COVID-19 incidence in the Northwestern FD fluctuated throughout the year, with two characteristic maxima in January and November. An analysis of fluctuations in the age structure, severity of morbidity, mortality rates, and the level of population vaccination in the region during the year is given. Assessment of epidemiological indicators was carried out in relation to changes in locally circulating genetic variants. It was seen that, during 2021, so-called variants of concern (VOC) circulated in the region (Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron), with Delta variant strains dominating from June to December. They successively replaced the variants of lines 20A and 20B circulating at the beginning of the year. An epidemiological feature of the northwestern region is the AT.1 variant, which was identified for the first time and later spread throughout the region and beyond its borders. Its share of the regional viral population reached 28.2% in May, and sporadic cases were observed until September. It has been shown that genetic variants of AT.1 lineages distributed in Russia and Northern Europe represent a single phylogenetic group at the base of the 20B branch on the global phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 strains. The progression of the COVID-19 pandemic occurred against the background of a vaccination campaign. The findings highlight the impact of vaccination on lowering severe COVID-19 case numbers and the mortality rate, despite ongoing changes in circulating SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants.","output":"Epidemiological Features of COVID-19 in Northwest Russia in 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Globally, studies have shown conflicting results regarding the association of blood groups with SARS CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVE: To observe the association between ABO blood groups and the presentation and outcomes of confirmed COVID-19 cases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prospective cohort study of patients with mild-to-moderately severe COVID-19 infections who presented in the COVID-19 unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital and were enrolled between 01 June and 25 August, 2020. Patients were followed up for at least 30 days after disease onset. We grouped participants with A-positive and A-negative blood groups into group I and participants with other blood groups into group II. RESULTS: The cohort included 438 patients; 52 patients were lost to follow-up, five died, and 381 completed the study. The prevalence of blood group A [144 (32.9%)] was significantly higher among COVID-19 patients than in the general population (p < 0.001). The presenting age [mean (SD)] of group I [42.1 (14.5)] was higher than that of group II [38.8 (12.4), p = 0.014]. Sex (p = 0.23) and co-morbidity (hypertension, p = 0.34; diabetes, p = 0.13) did not differ between the patients in groups I and II. No differences were observed regarding important presenting symptoms, including fever (p = 0.72), cough (p = 0.69), and respiratory distress (p = 0.09). There was no significant difference in the median duration of symptoms in the two group (12 days), and conversion to the next level of severity was observed in 26 (20.6%) and 36 patients (13.8%) in group I and II, respectively. However, persistent positivity of RT-PCR at 14 days of initial positivity was more frequent among the patients in group I [24 (19%)] than among those in group II [29 (11.1%)].

However, since the vaccines produce a heterogenous immune response, the risk of breakthrough infection is increased in vaccinated individuals who generate low levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). It is therefore paramount in the fight against COVID-19 to identify individuals who have a higher risk of breakthrough infection despite being vaccinated. Here we addressed the effect of cigarette smoking on the production of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) following COVID-19 vaccination since smoking profoundly suppresses the adaptive immune response to pathogen infection and the association between vaccination and smoking remains unclear. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibodies and NAbs (days 0, 14, 42, and 90) were measured in 164 participants received two vaccine doses of an inactivated vaccine (Sinovac-CoronaVac) longitudinally. Anti-Spike antibodies was elevated 14 and 42 days after COVID-19 vaccination compared to baseline (i.e., \\"Day 0\\"). Notably, RBD antibodies showed significantly higher expression in the nonsmoking group (n=153) than the smoking (n=11) group on day 42 (p<0.0001, Students t-test). NAbs continually increased after the first and second vaccine dose, peaking on day 42. NAbs titers then significantly decreased until day 90.

We developed a computer vision and machine learning-based automatic microbubble image classifier to accurately identify positives and negatives, and quantified and tracked antigen dynamics in ICU COVID inpatients and immunocompromised COVID patients. RESULTS: Compared to qualitative RT-PCR methods, the MSAA demonstrated a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI), 92-99%) and a negative percent agreement (NPA) of 97% (95% CI, 94-100%) in a clinical validation study with 372 residual clinical NP swabs. In immunocompetent individuals, the antigen positivity rate in swabs decreased as days-after-symptom-onset increased, despite persistent nucleic acid positivity. Antigen was detected for longer and variable periods of time in immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancies. Total microbubble volume, a quantitative marker of antigen burden, correlated inversely with Ct values and days-after-symptom-onset. Viral sequence variations were detected in patients with long duration of high antigen burden.

The most adversely affected ones are patients who need to admit to a hospital due to their chronic diseases, such as those receiving allergen immunotherapy. Material and Methods: Files of the patients who were administered subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) regularly, were retrospectively reviewed. At first outpatient clinic visits during the period of so-called normalization process (June-July-August 2020), the patients were asked to fill a mini questionnaire and validated coronavirus anxiety questionnaire. Results: A total of 151 patients receiving SCIT were included in the study. The most common government-related factors hindering outpatient clinic visits of the patients were travel restrictions (40.6%) and the most common patient-related factors were fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2 (39.7%). Overall adherence to treatment during the 3-month period from March to April-May 2020 was determined to be 54.3%. The duration of immunotherapy, increased allergic symptoms, the need for additional treatment and treatment switch in SC IT because of the pandemic were significantly higher in patients non-adherent to SCIT treatment compared to adherent ones (p: 0.031, p: 0.001, p: 0.001 and p: 0.001, respectively). Discussion: Access to allergen immunotherapy, applicability, and maintenance of the immunotherapy should be a priority during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Reliance upon digital computational methods restricts the value of natural experience reportable by patients, often considered subjective. In the course of modeling phosphate metabolism in the context of clinical practice it has become evident that use of categories based on normality, as definition of health, is inconsistent with the experience of patients. Given the opportunity, patients can provide detailed observations upon their experience of heat as the principle component of metabolism. It seems logical that heat should also be the foundational principal component of models developed for the translation of data to clinical care. This strategy has been applied to modeling the role of ACE(2) in the expression of variable phenotypes of COVID 19. Attempts to engage massive data and super-computing to the modeling of COVID 19 supported the assumption that ACE(2) is a critical component causing disease. The finding is attributed to an influence, not on heat, but instead suggested bradykinin that has long been a proposed explanation for ACE inhibition on chronic cough. Our modeling would posit that the ACE system engages aldosterone and subsequent influence on heat and acid/base balance as the mediators of variance in the expression of individual phenotypes. This clarification has been useful for addressing complexity in the presentation of metabolic disorders including thyroid disease, Diabetes, bone health, sleep disorders, vascular disease and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. It appears that the risk of developing ARDS shares a predisposition to chronic kidney disease mediated by excessive FGF(23) effects, while the asymptomatic spreaders are more Klotho dependent. The vitamin D system is also complex and involved in the modulation of heat and phosphate. These and other components can be extended to understanding bone and the hematopoietic marrow niche governing immune responses and includes a role for modulation of the microbiome influences by ACE(2). It is concluded that SARS-CoV-2 has helped to clarify the complexity of biology and has exposed the limitations of modeling strategies that do not include the application of case-based practice that can be described as model-dependent realism (1) as a means to discover the principle components of nature. The models are the valued product of the research that is mandated by the Helsinki accords when outcomes do not meet expectations.

The safer end of the credit spectrum experienced significant losses that are hard to fully reconcile with standard default or risk premium channels. Corporate bonds traded at a large discount to their corresponding CDS, and this basis widened most for safer bonds. Liquid bond ETFs traded at a large discount to their NAV, more so for Treasuries, municipal bonds, and investment-grade corporate than high-yield corporate. These facts suggest investors tried to sell safer, more liquid securities to raise cash. These disruptions disappeared nearly as fast as they appeared. We trace this recovery back to the unprecedented actions the Fed took to purchase corporate bonds rather than its interventions in extending credit. The March 23rd announcement to buy investment-grade debt boosted prices and lowered bond spreads (particularly at shorter maturities and the safer end of investment-grade) while having virtually no effect on high-yield debt. April 9th, in contrast, had a large effect on both investment-grade and high-yield, even for the riskier end of high yield which would only indirectly benefit from the policy.

Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model is used to forecast active COVID-19 cases in India considering the effect of nationwide lockdown and possible inflation in the active cases after its removal on May 3, 2020.

We also predict a 7$\\\\%$ to 21$\\\\%$ increase in the peak value of active infected cases for a variety of hypothetical scenarios reflecting a relative relaxation in the control strategies implemented by the government in the post-lockdown period. For India, it is an important decision to come up with a non-pharmaceutical control strategy such as nationwide lockdown for 40 days to prolong the higher phases of COVID-19 and to avoid severe load on its public health-care system. As the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak remains a global threat, it is a challenge for all the countries to come up with effective public health and administrative strategies to battle against COVID-19 and sustain their economies.","output":"Investigating the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in India under lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tik Tok suatu aplikasi yang saat ini digunakan oleh kalangan anak muda zaman sekarang dan digemari di dunia.

This study investigated the trends in cycling-related injuries requiring orthopaedic intervention during the COVID-19 lockdown period compared with similar time periods in 2018 and 2019. METHODS: Data were collected prospectively for patients in 2020 and collected retrospectively for 2019 and 2018, from hospitals within four NHS Scotland Health Boards encompassing three major trauma centres. All patients who sustained an injury as a result of cycling requiring orthopaedic intervention were included. Patient age, sex, mechanism of injury, diagnosis and treatment outcome from electronic patient records. RESULTS: Number of injuries requiring surgery 2020: 77 (mean age/years - 42.7); 2019: 47 (mean age/years - 42.7); 2018: 32 (mean age/years - 31.3). Overall incidence of cycling injuries 2020: 6.7%; 2019: 3.0%; 2018: 2.1%. Commonest mechanism of injury: fall from bike 2020 n = 54 (70.1%); 2019 n = 41 (65.1%); 2018 n = 25 (67.6%). Commonest injury type: fracture 2020 n = 68 (79.1%); 2019 n = 33 (70.2%); 2018 n = 20 (62.5%).

The surge in worldwide demand for dexamethasone suggests that the guidance, although correct, has not emphasised the danger of its wider use. STUDY DESIGN: Data from the Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial and the World Health Organisation (WHO) prospective meta-analysis have been deconstructed and analysed. METHODS: To provide context, relevant publications were identified in PubMed using the following keywords: COVID-19, RECOVERY trial, WHO meta-analysis, variants, immunity, public health. RESULTS: The WHO guidance 'Corticosteroids for COVID-19' was based on their prospective meta-analysis. This meta-analysis was weighted by data from the RECOVERY trial. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of COVID-19, dexamethasone has value in a narrow indication, namely, in hospitalised patients requiring respiratory support. The media blitz likely resulted in the wider use of dexamethasone in outpatients and as a preventive medication. This is reflected in the surge in worldwide demand for dexamethasone. We ask whether the use of steroids, beyond regulatory indications, may be responsible for the recent increase in mortality and especially the emergence of mucormycosis? From the public health standpoint, the current guidance for use of dexamethasone in COVID-19 could benefit from clarification and the addition of a cautionary note.","output":"COVID-19, corticosteroids and public health: a reappraisal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first detected in China at the end of 2019 and it has since spread in few months all over the World. Italy was one of the first Western countries who faced the health emergency and is one of the countries most severely affected by the pandemic. The diffusion of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy has followed a peculiar spatial pattern, however the attention of the scientific community has so far focussed almost exclusively on the prediction of the evolution of the disease over time. METHODS: Official freely available data about the number of infected at the finest possible level of spatial areal aggregation (Italian provinces) are used to model the spatio-temporal distribution of COVID-19 infections at local level. An endemic-epidemic time-series mixed-effects generalized linear model for areal disease counts has been implemented to understand and predict spatio-temporal diffusion of the phenomenon. RESULTS: Three subcomponents characterize the fitted model. The first describes the transmission of the illness within provinces; the second accounts for the transmission between nearby provinces; the third is related to the evolution of the disease over time. At the local level, the provinces first concerned by containment measures are those that are not affected by the effects of spatial neighbours. On the other hand, the component accounting for the spatial interaction with surrounding areas is prevalent for provinces that are strongly involved by contagions. Moreover, the proposed model provides good forecasts for the number of infections at local level while controlling for delayed reporting. CONCLUSIONS: A strong evidence is found that strict control measures implemented in some provinces efficiently break contagions and limit the spread to nearby areas. While containment policies may potentially be more effective if planned considering the peculiarities of local territories, the effective and homogeneous enforcement of control measures at national level is needed to prevent the disease control being delayed or missed as a whole. This may also apply at international level where, as it is for the European Union or the United States, the internal border checks among states have largely been abolished.","output":"Modelling and predicting the spatio-temporal spread of cOVID-19 in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused tens of thousands of deaths in Spain and has managed to breakdown the healthcare system hospitals in the Community of Madrid, largely due to its tendency to cause severe pneumonia, requiring ventilatory support.

In order to recover from this extraordinary level of suspended activity, we will be obliged to prioritize pathologies based on purely clinical criteria, for which tables including the relevance of each pathology within each area of urology are being proposed.

The freight traffic among both types of nodes is modeled by weighting the volume of product transported. To illustrate the model, the Spanish case is considered, with the data segmented by each type of traffic for a fine tuning. A sort of link prediction is possible, finding for those communities with two or more ports, countries that are part of the same community but with which some ports do not have yet significant traffic. The evolution of the traffics is analyzed by comparing the communities in 2009 and 2019.

Here, we report that murine hepatitis coronavirus initially seeded on FFR filter material is inactivated (6 order of magnitude reduction as measured by median tissue culture infective dose, TCID50) after dry heating at 75C for 30 min. We also find that the quantitative fit of FFRs after heat treatment at this temperature, under dry conditions or at 90% relative humidity, is not affected by single or 10 heating cycles. Previous studies have reported that the filtration efficiency of FFRs is not negatively impacted by these heating conditions. These results suggest that thermal inactivation of coronaviruses is a potentially rapid and widely deployable method to reuse N95 FFRs in emergency situations where reusing FFRs is a necessity and broad-spectrum sterilization is unavailable. However, we also observe that a radiative heat source (e.g. an exposed heating element) results in rapid qualitative degradation of the FFR. Finally, we discuss differences in the results reported here and other recent studies investigating heat as a means to recycle FFRs. These differences suggest that while our repeated decontamination cycles do not affect FFR fit, overall wear time and the number of donning/doffing cycles are important factors that likely degrade FFR fit and must be investigated further.","output":"Quantitative Fit Evaluation of N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators and Coronavirus Inactivation Following Heat Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No Abstract available.","output":"[Comment to the article ?Frecuency of diagnosis of bone lesions in cases of anterior glenohumeral dislocation?]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To compare the risk of intrauterine fetal death (20 weeks of gestation or later) and neonatal death among individuals who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared with those who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on admission for delivery. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Ovid, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, and Cochrane Library were searched from their inception until July 17, 2020. Hand search for additional articles continued through September 24, 2020. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched on October 21, 2020. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: The inclusion criteria were publications that compared at least 20 cases of both pregnant patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on admission to labor and delivery and those who tested negative. Exclusion criteria were publications with fewer than 20 individuals in either category or those lacking data on primary outcomes. A systematic search of the selected databases was performed, with co-primary outcomes being rates of intrauterine fetal death and neonatal death. Secondary outcomes included rates of maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Of the 941 articles and completed trials identified, six studies met criteria. Our analysis included 728 deliveries to patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 3,836 contemporaneous deliveries to patients who tested negative. Intrauterine fetal death occurred in 8 of 728 (1.1%) patients who tested positive and 44 of 3,836 (1.1%) who tested negative (P=.60). Neonatal death occurred in 0 of 432 (0.0%) patients who tested positive and 5 of 2,400 (0.2%) who tested negative (P=.90). Preterm birth occurred in 95 of 714 (13.3%) patients who tested positive and 446 of 3,759 (11.9%) who tested negative (P=.31).

METHODS: Patients with T2DM and moderate or severe COVID-19 infection were prospectively observed for development of new-onset DKA for one week following initiation of parenteral dexamethasone. Clinical and biochemical parameters were compared between those who developed DKA (Group A) and those who didnot (Group B). Logistic regression was done to identify independent risk-factors predicting DKA; ROC-curve analysis to determine cut-offs for the parameters in predicting DKA. RESULTS: Amongst 302 patients screened, n = 196 were finally included, of whom 13.2% (n = 26,Group A) developed DKA. Patients in Group A were younger, had lower BMI, increased severity of COVID-19 infection, higher HbA1c%, CRP, IL-6, D-dimer and procalcitonin at admission (p(all) < 0.02). Further, admission BMI (OR: 0.43, CI: 0.27C0.69), HbA1c % (OR: 1.68, CI: 1.16C2.43) and serum IL-6 (OR: 1.02, CI: 1.01C1.03) emerged as independent predictors for DKA.

CONCLUSION: There is significant incidence of new-onset DKA following parenteral glucocorticoids in T2DM patients with COVID-19, especially in those with BMI <25.56 kg/m(2), HbA1c% >8.35% and IL-6 levels >50.95 pg/ml at admission.","output":"Predictors of new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 receiving parenteral glucocorticoids: A prospective single-centre study among Indian type 2 diabetes patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) in December 2019 form Wuhan, China leads to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While the common cold symptoms are observed in mild cases, COVID-19 is accompanied by multiorgan failure in severe patients. The involvement of different organs in severe patients results in lengthening the hospitalization duration and increasing the mortality rate. In this review, we aimed to investigate the involvement of different organs in COVID-19 patients, particularly in severe cases. Also, we tried to define the potential underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV2 induced multiorgan failure. The multi-organ dysfunction is characterized by acute lung failure, acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, cardiovascular disease, and as well as a wide spectrum of hematological abnormalities and neurological disorders. The most important mechanisms are related to the direct and indirect pathogenic features of SARS-CoV2. Although the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a receptor of SARS-CoV2 in the lung, heart, kidney, testis, liver, lymphocytes, and nervous system was confirmed, there are controversial findings to about the observation of SARS-CoV2 RNA in these organs. Moreover, the organ failure may be induced by the cytokine storm, a result of increased levels of inflammatory mediators, endothelial dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities, and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the organs. Therefore, further investigations are needed to detect the exact mechanisms of pathogenesis. Since the involvement of several organs in COVID-19 patients is important for clinicians, increasing their knowledge may help to improve the outcomes and decrease the rate of mortality and morbidity.","output":"COVID-19 and multiorgan failure: A narrative review on potential mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, shelter-in-place and social-distancing policies have been enforced or recommended all over the world to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

We find that the degree of work mobility reduction is significantly driven by the intensity of poverty. Consistently, human movements vary significantly more between poverty levels when it come to work rather than less vital activities.

Such facilities were essential for the management of highly contagious patients during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks and the more recent 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic. Many different types of door designs are used in the construction of such isolation rooms, which may be related to the space available and affordability. Using colored food dye as a tracer, the qualitative effects of door-opening motions on the dissemination of potentially contaminated air into and out of a single isolation room were visualized and filmed using Reynolds-number-equivalent, small-scale, water-tank models fitted with programmable door-opening and moving human figure motions. Careful scaling considerations involved in the design and construction of these water-tank models enabled these results to be accurately extrapolated to the full-scale situation. Four simple types of door design were tested: variable speed single and double, sliding and hinged doors, in combination with the moving human figure. The resulting video footage was edited, synchronized and presented in a series of split-screen formats. From these experiments, it is clear that double-hinged doors pose the greatest risk of leakage into or out of the room, followed by (in order of decreasing risk) single-hinged, double-sliding and single-sliding doors. The relative effect of the moving human figure on spreading any potential contamination was greatest with the sliding doors, as the bulk airflows induced were large relative to those resulting from these door-opening motions. However, with the hinged doors, the airflows induced by these door-opening motions were significantly greater. Further experiments involving a simulated ventilated environment are required, but from these findings alone, it appears that sliding-doors are far more effective for hospital isolation room containment.","output":"Different Types of Door-Opening Motions as Contributing Factors to Containment Failures in Hospital Isolation Rooms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report of a joint World Health Organization (WHO) and United Kingdom (UK) Health Research Authority (HRA) workshop discusses the ethics review of the first COVID-19 human challenge studies, undertaken in the midst of the pandemic.

Research regarding the implementation of virtual teaching environments and standardized patients for simulation remains limited. Here, educators outcomes were evaluated following a transition from in-person teaching with real patients, to a standardized patient-based simulation in pre-clerkship psychiatric clinical skills teaching for medical students. METHODS: The Integrated Clinical Experiences course at the University of Toronto is a pre-clerkship clinical skills curriculum for second-year medical students. Four psychiatric clinical skills sessions were transitioned from in-person teaching to virtual teaching environments with standardized patient-based simulation. Educators (tutors) were assigned to teach groups of four to seven medical students, with a total of 45 groups. Tutors were then asked to complete an online questionnaire, and data was analyzed by quantitative and qualitative means. RESULTS: Of 30 tutors, 21 (75.0%) had previously taught the course for an average of 6.52  6.85 years. Twenty-four of 30 (80%) tutors described their ease of virtual teaching as extremely easy or moderately easy. Twenty-three of 30 (76.6%) were extremely satisfied or moderately satisfied with standardized patient-based simulation. Various advantages and disadvantages of the virtual teaching environment with standardized patient-based simulation were identified.

The three liquids display a Newtonian plateau followed by a shear thinning regime at shear rates of the order of GHz. Even though the main features of the liquid structure remains under shear, systematic changes were noticed at the GHz rates, with coordination shells becoming more diffuse as noticed by the reduction in the difference between consecutive maxima and minima in the radial distribution function. Interestingly, these structural changes with the shear rate can be precisely fitted using the Carreau equation, which is a well-known expression for the shear rate dependence of the viscosity. The fitting parameters for different distributions can be used to explain qualitatively the shear thinning behavior of these liquids. In the GHz range, the cations and, in a minor extension, some anions, tend to assume preferentially a parallel orientation with the flux, which contributes to the shear thinning behavior and may have consequences for adhesion in applications as lubricants.","output":"Relating the structure and dynamics of ionic liquids under shear by means of reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION One-third of adults in the United States who use tobacco regularly use two or more types of tobacco products. As the use of e-cigarettes and other non-combusted tobacco products increases-making multiple tobacco product (MTP) use increasingly common-it is essential to evaluate the complex factors that affect product use. METHODS In this update to our 2019 conceptual framework, we review and evaluate recent literature and expand the model to include ways in which MTP use may be affected by market factors such as the introduction of new products and socioenvironmental factors like marketing and advertising. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS MTP use patterns are complex, dynamic, and multiply determined by factors at the level of individuals, products, situations/contexts, and marketplace. Substitution, or using one product with the intent of decreasing use of another, and complementarity, or using multiple products for different reasons/purposes, explain patterns in MTP use. Moreover, substitution/complementarity may inform our understanding of how market changes targeted at one product, for instance, new product standards, bans, product pricing, and taxation, affect consumption of other tobacco products. New data from natural experiments and novel laboratory-based techniques add additional data and expand the framework. IMPLICATIONS A substantial proportion of people who use tobacco use more than one product. This review synthesizes and evaluates recent evidence on the diverse factors that affect MTP use in addition to expanding our framework.

While Twitter, like other platforms, affords world leaders the opportunity to rapidly present information to citizens, the discourse is often politically framed. In this study, we analysed how leaders' of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing group use Twitter to frame the COVID-19 virus. Specifically, four research questions were explored: 1) How frequently did each leader tweet about COVID-19 in 2020? 2) Which frames emerged from tweet content of each leader regarding COVID-19? 3) What was the overall tweet valence of each leader regarding COVID-19? and 4) To what extent can leaders' future tweets be predicted by the data? We used natural language processing (NLP) and conducted sentiment analysis via Python to identify frames and to compare the leaders' messaging. Results showed that of the leaders, President Trump tweeted the most, with Prime Minister Morrison posting the least number of tweets. The majority of each leaders' tweets were positive, while President Trump had the most negative tweets. Predictive modelling of tweet behavior was highly accurate. ?

Existing female-specific literature highlights breast asymmetry and cosmetic reconstruction. We sought to evaluate gender differences in cardiopulmonary function. METHODS Cardiac MRIs, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) were reviewed in 345 patients undergoing preoperative evaluation for PE. Regression modeling was used to evaluate associations between gender and clinical endpoints of cardiopulmonary function. RESULTS Mean age was 15.2 years, 19% were female, 98% were white. Pectus indices included median Haller Index (HI) of 4.8, mean depression index (DI) of 0.63, correction index (CI) of 33.6%, and Cardiac Compression Index (CCI) of 2.79. Cardiac assessment revealed decreased right and left ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF, LVEF) in 16% and 22% of patients, respectively. PFTs and CPETs were abnormal in ~ 30% of patients. While females had deeper PE deformities-represented by higher pectus indices-they had superior function with higher RVEF, LVEF Z-scores, FEV1, VO2 max, O2 pulse, work, and breathing reserve (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Despite worse PE deformity and symptomatology, females had a better cardiopulmonary function and exercise tolerance than males.

Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death. METHODS: In this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison. RESULTS: A total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care. Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P<0.001). The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization. In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs. 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs. 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55). CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.

The physical, psychological, and moral toll of the pandemic has threatened the well-being and integrity of clinicians. The narrative of self-sacrifice and heroism bolstered people early on but was not sustainable over time. For health professions students, the learning environment changed dramatically, limiting opportunities in direct patient care and raising concerns for meeting training requirements. Learners lost social connections and felt isolated while learning remotely, and they witnessed ethical tensions between patient-centered care and parallel obligations to public health. Worries about transmission of the virus and uncertainty about its management contributed to their moral suffering. Educators adjusted curricula to address the changing ethical landscape. Preparing learners for the realities of their future professional identities requires creation of interprofessional moral communities that provide support and help develop the moral agency and integrity of its members using experiential and relational learning methods. Investing in the well-being and resilience of clinicians, implementing the recommendations of the National Academy of Medicine, and engaging learners and faculty as cocreators of ethical practice have the potential to transform the learning environment. Faculty need to be trained as effective mentors to create safe spaces for exploring challenges and address moral adversity.

Especially in the COVID-19 pandemic, molecular techniques and biotechnological innovation have proven to be of utmost importance for rapid developments in disease diagnostics and treatment, including DNA and RNA sequencing technology, treatment with drugs and natural products and vaccine development. The COVID-19 crisis, however, has also demonstrated the need for systemic thinking and transdisciplinarity and the limits of MSM: the neglect of the bio-psycho-social systemic nature of humans and their context as the object of individual therapeutic and population-oriented interventions. COVID-19 illustrates how a medical problem requires a transdisciplinary approach in epidemiology, pathology, internal medicine, public health, environmental medicine, and socio-economic modeling. Regarding the need for conceptual integration of these different kinds of knowledge we suggest the application of general system theory (GST). This approach endorses an organism-centered view on health and disease, which according to Ludwig von Bertalanffy who was the founder of GST, we call Organismal Systems Medicine (OSM). We argue that systems science offers wider applications in the field of pathology and can contribute to an integrative systems medicine by (i) integration of evidence across functional and structural differentially scaled subsystems, (ii) conceptualization of complex multilevel systems, and (iii) suggesting mechanisms and non-linear relationships underlying the observed phenomena. We underline these points with a proposal on multi-level systems pathology including neurophysiology, endocrinology, immune system, genetics, and general metabolism. An integration of these areas is necessary to understand excess mortality rates and polypharmacological treatments. In the pandemic era this multi-level systems pathology is most important to assess potential vaccines, their effectiveness, short-, and long-time adverse effects.

METHODS: Moderate to severely ill, Covid-19 patients older than 18 years were included. Mild Covid-19 patients and the ones with negative polymerase chain reaction test results were excluded from the study. The primary outcome of the study was 30-day mortality rate and we aimed to determine the factors affecting mortality in moderate to severely ill Covid-19 patients. RESULTS: 168 patient results were analyzed. Median age of the patients was 59.5 (48.3 to 76) and 90 (53.6%) were male. According to multivariate regression analysis results, the presence of any comorbid disease (p = 0.027, HR = 26.11 (95%CI: 1.45 to 471.31)), elevated C-reactive protein levels (CRP) (p < 0.001, HR = 1.24 (95%CI: 1.11 to 1.38)) and presence of dyspnea (p = 0.026, HR = 4.26 ((95%CI: 1.19 to 15.28)) were found to significantly increase the mortality, while high pulse O 2 saturation level (p < 0.001, HR = 0.90 (95%CI: 0.82 to 0.99) was found to decrease. When receiver operating characteristic curve was created for laboratory tests, it was determined that white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, CRP levels and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio predicted mortality while Lymphocyte levels did not.

Records were abstracted for comorbidities, signs and symptoms, and illness outcomes during the 2 weeks before and after the date of positive specimen collection. Relative risks (RRs) of hospitalization and death were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 118 residents tested among approximately 130 residents from Facility A during February 28-March 16, 2020, 101 (86%) were found to test positive for SARS-CoV-2. At initial presentation, about two-thirds of SARS-CoV-2-positive residents had an abnormal vital sign or change in oxygen status. Most (90.2%) symptomatic residents had elevated temperature, change in mental status, lethargy, change in oxygen status, or cough; 9 (11.0%) did not have fever, cough, or shortness of breath during their clinical course. Those with change in oxygen status had an increased relative risk (RR) of 30-day mortality [51.1% vs 29.7%, RR 1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-3.0].

In the absence of specific antiviral medication, symptomatic treatment and physical isolation remain the options to control the contagion. The recent clinical trials on antiviral drugs highlighted some promising compounds such as umifenovir (haemagglutinin-mediated fusion inhibitor), remdesivir (RdRp nucleoside inhibitor), and favipiravir (RdRp Inhibitor). WHO launched a multinational clinical trial on several promising analogs as a potential treatment to combat SARS infection.

It is significant to note that researchers worldwide have been doing their best to handle the crisis and have produced an extensive and promising literature body. It opens a scope and allows understanding the viral entry at the molecular level. A structure-based approach can reveal the molecular-level understanding of viral entry interaction. The ligand profiling and non-covalent interactions among participating amino-acid residues are critical information to delineate a structural interpretation. The structural investigation of SARS virus entry into host cells will reveal the possible strategy for designing drugs like entry inhibitors. The structure-based approach demonstrates details at the 3D molecular level. It shows specificity about SARS-CoV-2 spike interaction, which uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry, and the human protease completes the process of viral fusion and infection. The 3D structural studies reveal the existence of two units, namely S1 and S2. S1 is called a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and responsible for interacting with the host (ACE2), and the S2 unit participates in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. TMPRSS2 mediates the cleavage at S1/S2 subunit interface in S-protein of SARS CoV-2, leading to viral fusion. Conformational difference associated with S1 binding alters ACE2 interaction and inhibits viral fusion.

However, longitudinal studies with pre-pandemic data are scarce. Objective To explore trajectories of emotional and behavioural difficulties in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design and setting Data were from children from the third generation of a birth cohort study; the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children - Generation 2 (ALSPAC-G2) in the southwest of England. Participants The study population comprised of 708 children (median age at COVID data collection was 4.4 years, SD=2.9, IQR= [2.2 to 6.9]), whose parents provided previous pre-pandemic surveys and a survey between 26 May and 5 July 2020 that focused on information about the COVID-19 pandemic as restrictions from the first lockdown in the UK were eased. Exposures We employed multi-level mixed effects modelling with random intercepts and slopes to examine whether trajectories of emotional and behavioural difficulties (a combined total difficulties score) during the pandemic differ from expected pre-pandemic trajectories. Main outcomes Children had up to seven measurements of emotional and behavioural difficulties from infancy to late childhood, using developmentally appropriate scales such as the Emotionality Activity Sociability Temperament Survey in infancy and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in childhood. Results The observed normative pattern of emotional and behavioural difficulties in children pre-pandemic, was characterised by an increase in scores during infancy peaking around the age of 2, and then declining throughout the rest of childhood. Pre-pandemic, the decline in difficulties scores after age 2 was 0.6 points per month; but was approximately one third of that in post-pandemic trajectories (there was a difference in mean rate of decline after age 2 of 0.2 points per month in pre vs during pandemic trajectories [95 % CI: 0.10 to 0.30, p <0.001]). This lower decline in scores over the years translated to older children having pandemic difficulty scores higher than would be expected from pre-pandemic trajectories (for example, an estimated 10.0 point (equivalent of 0.8 standard deviations) higher score (95% CI: 5.0 to 15.0) by age 8.5 years). Results remained similar although somewhat attenuated after adjusting for maternal anxiety and age. Conclusion and relevance The COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with greater persistence of emotional and behavioural difficulties after the age 2.

Some patients with coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) develop a fully blown secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), whereas others, despite a consistent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, do not fulfil sHLH criteria but still show some features resembling the phenotype of the hyperferritinemic syndrome.

Although hippocampus activity is believed to be affected by socioeconomic status (SES), limited knowledge exists on which SES indicators influence hippocampus function. Purpose: This study explored the separate and combined effects of three SES indicators, namely parental education, family income, and neighborhood income, on adolescents' hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task. As some of the effects of parental education may be through income, we also tested if the effect of parental education on hippocampus activation during our N-Back memory task is mediated by family or neighborhood income. Methods: The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study is a national multi-center investigation of American adolescents' brain development. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of a total sample of 3067 9-10-year-old adolescents were used. The primary outcome was left- hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task (mean beta weight for N-Back run 1 2 back versus 0 back contrast in left hippocampus). The independent variable was parental education. Family income and neighborhood income were two possible mediators. Age, sex, and marital status were the covariates. To test mediation, we used hierarchical linear regression models first without and then with our mediators. Full mediation was defined according to Kenny. The Sobel test was used to confirm statistical mediation. Results: In the absence of family and neighborhood income in the model, higher parental educational attainment was associated with lower level of left hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task. This effect was significant while age, sex, and marital status were controlled. The association between parental educational attainment and hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task was no more significant when we controlled for family and neighborhood income. Instead, family income was associated with hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task. These findings suggested that family income fully mediates the effect of parental educational attainment on left hippocampus activation during the N-Back memory task. Conclusions: The effect of parental educational attainment on adolescents' hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task is fully explained by family income. That means low family income is why adolescents with low-educated parents show highlighted hippocampus activation during an N-Back memory task. Given the central role of the hippocampus in learning and memory and as income is a modifiable factor by tax and economic policies, income-redistribution policies, fair taxation, and higher minimum wage may have implications for promotion of adolescent equality and social justice. There is a need to focus on family-level economic needs across all levels of neighborhood income.","output":"Family Income Mediates the Effect of Parental Education on Adolescents' Hippocampus Activation During an N-Back Memory Task."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study explores the influence of challenge stressors on identity orientation directly and via thriving at work and employee investment. Drawing on the broadenCandCbuild theory of positive emotions, this study proposes challenge stressors as a critical predictor of identity orientation. The purpose of this article is to explore if a particular identity is salient in different contextual factors, and this study suggests that challenge stressors stimulate personal, relational, and collective identities to respond to a situation. The relationships hypothesized in this study were tested using a sample of 225 employees from the banking sector of Pakistan. A time-lagged research design consisting of two waves of data collection was employed. A structural equation modeling technique was used to test the hypotheses regarding the relationship between challenge stressors and identity orientation, including the role of thriving at work and employee investment as intervening mechanisms of this relationship. Results showed that challenge stressors had a significant positive relationship with identity orientation. The results also confirmed the sequential mediation of thriving at work and employee investment in the relationship between challenge stressors and identity orientation. The findings suggest that the positive side of stress as a strength motivates employees for continued self-development.

We analyzed the serum ferritin levels on the first day of admission and the clinical progress of patients diagnosed with complete or incomplete KD. Of the 158 patients, 5 were diagnosed with KD-MAS. Conjunctival injection was significantly more frequent in KD group (p = 0.035), although there were no significant differences in other clinical features. On the first day of admission, the serum ferritin level in the KD-MAS group was >500 ng/mL, which was higher than that in the KD group (p = 0.001). In the KD-MAS group, total bilirubin, triglyceride, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly higher, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), total protein, albumin, and fibrinogen were significantly lower than the KD group (p < 0.05). Four patients were diagnosed with MAS within 7 days after admission, and 4 (80%) patients with KD-MAS survived.

METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing intra-arterial therapy for AIS using the 5MAX ACE reperfusion catheter at our institution was performed. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics and procedural data were obtained from chart review. Successful recanlization was defined as achievement of Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score (TICI) 2b-3 and time to recanalization was defined as time from groin puncture to achievement of at least TICI 2b recanalization. RESULTS The 5MAX ACE was used in 15 patients from July-October 2013. Direct aspiration was used as the primary technique in 10/15 (67%) patients. Out of these, aspiration alone was sufficient for recanalization in 3 (20%) patients. In the remaining 7 (47%) patients, additional devices were used. In 5/15 (33%) patients, combined aspiration/stentriever thrombectomy using Solitaire? (3/5 patients) and Penumbra 3D Separator? (2/5 patients) were used as the primary technique.

The antibodies to mismatched donor HLA\\\\DR7 were detected only with multi\\\\antigen beads but not with single\\\\antigen beads, excluding possible prozone effects in solid\\\\phase antibody assays. The crossmatches were positive with HLA\\\\DR7Cpositive surrogates (n = 2) while negative with HLA\\\\DR7Cnegative surrogates (n = 3), which confirms the HLA\\\\DR7 alloreactivity. The antigen configurations on B lymphocytes are similar to that on the multi\\\\antigen beads while distinct from the single\\\\antigen beads. HLA\\\\DR7 was the repeating mismatched antigen with the failing first kidney allograft. The newly emerged antibody to HLA\\\\DR7 probably is the consequence of bystander activation of memory response by the COVID\\\\19 vaccination. This case highlights the importance of verifying allo\\\\sensitization history and utilizing multiple assays, including cell\\\\based crossmatch and solid\\\\phase assays with multi\\\\antigens. COVID\\\\19 immunization may deserve special attention when assessing the immunological risk before and after organ transplantation.","output":"Positive flow cytometry crossmatch with discrepant antibody testing results following COVID\\\\19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A world wide pandemic of COVID 19 has been affected by the global health system of the majority of the world The significant burden of the pandemic results in severe damage to several steps of health supply Although significant health authorities and surgical societies gave the rapid response to this world wide outbreak, major concerns emerge for emergency and oncological cases which could be life-threatening on this sophisticated chaotic crisis environment Local precautions should be considered on this outbreak when every country and geographical region may manage its resources with severe limitations In this review, we try to collect recommendations about the triage of general surgical cancer care which are emphasized by the Turkish surgical community and world oncological societies up to date (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Dnya ?ap?nda COVID 19 ad?nda bir salg?n global sa?l?k sistemini etkilemektedir Sa?l?k zinciri bir ?ok a?amada pandeminin yol a?t ciddi bir yk tamaktad?r Dnya sa?l?k otoriteleri ve cerrahi dernekler bu pandemiye h?zla cevap verip k?lavuzlar haz?rlasalar da, kaotik kriz ortam?nda ya?am? tehdit eden acil ve onkolojik cerrahi vakalar?n y?netimiyle ilgili ciddi bir endi?e s?z konusudur Her lkenin elindeki t?bbi kaynaklar? ciddi k?s?tlamalarla kulland bu ortamda yerel ?nlemlerin al?nmas? ?nem kazanmt?r Bu derlemede genel cerrahi kanser vakalar?n?n y?netiminde Trk ve dnya onkolojik cerrahi dernekleri taraf?ndan ortaya konan k?lavuz ?nerileri ortaya konulmu?tur (Turkish) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Kafkas Journal of Medical Sciences, Kafkas Tip Bilimleri Dergisi is the property of Kafkas Journal of Medical Sciences, Kafkas Tip Bilimleri Dergisi and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Triage of General Oncological Surgery During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hemichorea and other hyperkinetic movement disorders are a rare presentation of stroke, usually secondary to deep infarctions affecting the basal ganglia and the thalamus.

Limited data describe out\\\\of\\\\hospital dyspnea treatment with non\\\\invasive, positive\\\\pressure ventilation (NIPPV), including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi\\\\level positive air pressure (BPAP). We sought to determine the course and outcomes of out\\\\of\\\\hospital acute dyspnea patients treated with NIPPV. METHODS: We analyzed retrospective data on 1289 EMS agencies from the ESO Data Collaborative (ESO, Inc., Austin, TX) between January and December 2018. We defined acute dyspnea as adults with an initial respiratory rate  30 breaths/min (bpm), with a primary or secondary EMS subjective impression of a respiratory condition, who received oxygen and/or a respiratory medication and had 2 or more recordings of respiratory rate (RR). We excluded patients with trauma and those with altered mental status. We identified cases receiving care with and without NIPPV. The primary outcome was change in respiratory rate (RR), censored at 90 minutes of treatment. We compared baseline characteristics between NIPPV and non\\\\NIPPV patients. We compared RR changes between NIPPV and non\\\\NIPPV patients at 20 and 40 minutes of treatment. Using mixed linear, fractional polynomial, and multiple spline models, we examined the association of out\\\\of\\\\hospital NIPPV with overall change in RR. Secondary outcomes included whether the patient received advanced airway treatment (intubation, supraglottic airway device, and/or cricothyroidotomy). RESULTS: We analyzed 33,585 EMS encounters for patients with acute dyspnea, including 8,750 (26.1%) NIPPV and 24,835 (73.9%) non\\\\NIPPV encounters. Median treatment duration was similar between NIPPV and non\\\\NIPPV (23.3 minutes vs 23.6 minutes, rank\\\\sum P = 0.266). Common concurrent treatments included albuterol (NIPPV, 48.8%; non\\\\NIPPV, 46.2%), ipratropium bromide (27.9%, 24.8%), and methylprednisolone (24.9%, 18.5%). At 20 minutes, mean RR change was slightly lower for the NIPPV group than non\\\\NIPPV; ?6.0 versus ?6.8 breaths/min. At 40 minutes, mean RR change was similar between NIPPV and non\\\\NIPPV groups; ?7.7 versus ?7.9 breaths/min. On linear mixed modeling adjusted for age, sex, incident location, race, ethnicity, agency type, initial RR, and medication use, NIPPV was associated with a smaller RR decrease across time than NIPPV; [NIPPV  time] interaction P < 0.001. Out\\\\of\\\\hospital advanced airway placement (endotracheal intubation or supraglottic airway insertion) was higher for NIPPV than non\\\\NIPPV group (2.3% vs 1.3%, odds ratio = 2.23, 95% confidence interval = 2.01C2.47). CONCLUSIONS: NIPPV has been proven to be an effective treatment for out\\\\of\\\\hospital patients experiencing acute dyspnea through prior studies. Our findings provide detailed insight into characteristics and use of NIPPV and highlight the commonality of this treatment modality with use in over 1 in 4 patients in respiratory distress.","output":"Out\\\\of\\\\hospital, non\\\\invasive, positive\\\\pressure ventilation for acute dyspnea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In December 2019, the first case of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus was found in Wuhan and rapidly spread throughout China, so","output":"Clinical Characteristics and CT Manifestations of 143 Hospitalized Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outside Wuhan: A Multi-Center Study in Taizhou City, Zhejiang, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People experiencing homelessness are at risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) and may experience barriers to hand hygiene, a primary recommendation for COVID\\\\19 prevention.

Although numerous strategies have tried to reduce inadequate antibiotic prescribing, antibiotics are still prescribed in 60% of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) cases in Catalonia (Spain). This study aims to explore service users' experiences of ALRTIs, the quality and access to healthcare services, and health education. Selective purposive sampling was carried out, based on a prior definition of participant characteristics. These were sex, age, ethnicity, date of the last ALRTI, number of ALRTIs in the last year, and treatments received. Participants with a previous diagnosis of ALRTIs were recruited from three primary health care centres in Barcelona and one in Tarragona. Twenty-nine interviews were conducted between April and June 2019. A content thematic analysis was performed. Three themes were identified: 1) risk perceptions and help-seeking; 2) treatment preferences and antibiotic use; and 3) relationship dynamics and communication with healthcare professionals. Accounts of service users' sense of autonomy towards their health and power dynamics within the healthcare system were apparent. Supporting service users to become reliable, subjective and agentic experts of their health and bodies could help them to voice their healthcare agendas. Power structures embedded within healthcare, political and economic institutions should be challenged so that healthcare services can be co-developed (with service users) and based on service users' autonomy and horizontal relationships. Special consideration should be paid to the intersection of social vulnerabilities. A concordance approach to prescribing could be key to improve the responsible use of antibiotics and to contribute to the prevention of AMR in primary healthcare. The marketisation of health, and the increased demands of private healthcare in Spain due to the financial pressures on public healthcare as a consequence of the financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic, are a risk for promoting adequate antibiotic prescribing and use.

The aim of this study was to clarify the association between CRRT and 28-day mortality in critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (-COVID-19) patients receiving mechanical ventilation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 112 respiratory decompensated critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to a COVID-19-designated ICU were included in this retrospective cohort study. Data on demographic information, comorbidities, laboratory findings upon ICU admission, and clinical outcomes were collected. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model were applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with 28-day mortality. RESULTS: The median age was 65.7 years, 67.8% were males, and 58.9% patients had at least one comorbidity. The median scores of the Charlson Comorbidity Index and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) were 3 and 7, respectively. Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurred in 57 critically ill patients upon ICU admission; 43 patients were classified as stage 2 - 3 AKI, and 36 patients were treated with CRRT. Age > 65 years, high SOFA score, damaged cardiac function, poor nutrition, and severe infection were significantly associated with increased 28-day mortality.

Elective surgical lists were cancelled to fulfil this demand for acute operating theatre time and theatre staff. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the elective surgical resource lost in the aftermath of the Whakaari White Island eruption by surgical specialty. METHODS: A data set listing all surgical procedures undertaken within Counties Manukau District Health Board during the period 1 December 2019-1 March 2020 and the corresponding months from the preceding 3 years was analysed. Sum operating time and procedures post-Whakaari were compared with the average of the prior 3 years to quantify loss in resource. RESULTS: In the 3 months post-Whakaari, 698 fewer elective operations were completed across all surgical specialties than the average of the previous 3 years, a decrease of 26.3%. All major surgical specialties except urology showed an absolute decrease in elective procedures completed.

Based on the epidemic data in England from September 1 to October 31, 2020, considering the continuous decline in the antibody level of COVID-19 recovers, an improved SEIR infectious disease dynamics model that considers the reinfection of recovers due to the decline in antibody levels is established. The kinetic parameters of the SEIR model are obtained by fitting. On this basis, a SEIRV infectious disease dynamic model with vaccination is established to study the impact of different vaccination rates and vaccine failure rates on the development of the epidemic in England. We obtain the lower the vaccine failure rate, the fewer new cases. When the vaccination rate is fixed at 0.005 (equivalent to 250000 people vaccinated every day), the peak of the epidemic will decrease with the decrease of vaccine failure rate. The peak value when the failure rate is 0.001 is 81.4% lower than the peak value when the failure rate is 0.01, and the peak value when the failure rate is 0.01 is 89.5% lower than the peak value when the failure rate is 0.02. When the failure rate is less than 0.01, the peak time will advance with the decrease of failure rate; when the failure rate is greater than 0.01, the peak time will be delayed with the decrease of failure rate; when the failure rate is 0.01, the peak time is 528 days later than that when the failure rate is 0.001 and 295 days later than that when the failure rate is 0.05. On the 60th day of vaccination, the vaccine failure rate of 0.002 decreases the number of cases by 5.8% compared with the vaccine failure rate of 0.01; on the 70th day of vaccination, the vaccine failure rate of 0.002 reduces the number of cases by 9.1% compared with the vaccine failure rate of 0.01. Therefore, with the extension of time, the vaccine with low failure rate has a more obvious effect on reducing the number of cases than the vaccine with high failure rate. When the vaccine failure rate is fixed at 0.005, we study the impact of different vaccination rates on the spread of the epidemic in England, the result shows that the peak of epidemic situation decreases with the increase of vaccination rate, and the peak time advance with the increase of vaccination rate, when the vaccination rate is 0.025, the peak decreases by 74.8% and the peak time was 114 days earlier than that when the vaccination rate is 0.005. Therefore, the higher the vaccine efficiency and vaccination rate, the lower the peak of the epidemic.

The spatial and temporal variation of indicators and pathogens was studied to examine the distribution patterns for areas with different land use, and the impact of seasonal changes on microbial populations. A total of 234 water samples were sampled for two years from reservoirs and their tributaries, and tested for fecal indicator bacteria, coliphages, human specific markers, pathogenic bacteria and viruses. The prevalence of indicators and pathogens in reservoirs were generally low, while relatively high concentrations were observed in tributaries to varying degrees. Of the enteric viruses, norovirus GII was among the most prevalent and had the highest concentration. Although strong correlations were found between indicators, only relatively weak correlations were found between indicators and pathogens.

However, while some studies report comparable success when using vitrified and fresh oocytes we still need to investigate whether the use of fresh oocytes give higher live birth rate than cryopreserved ones, when the same number of oocytes are given. The performance of embryo cryopreservation, conversely, seems to be more reliable. A novel approach based on the shipment of frozen sperm from the recipients country to the oocyte donors one, where fresh oocytes are inseminated and the resulting embryos frozen and transported back to the referring IVF centre to perform a frozen embryo transfer may be a good strategy. We believe that the use of frozen embryos from fresh oocytes could be associated with a higher cumulative live birth rate per cycle, while favouring personalised oocyte recipient care with a flexible number of oocytes assigned and limiting the burden of travelling abroad.","output":"Exploring the pros and cons of new approaches for gamete cross-border donation based on fresh and vitrified oocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivation Several protein-protein interaction networks (PPIN) aligners have been developed during the last 15 years. One of their goals is to help the functional annotation of proteins and the prediction of protein-protein interactions. A correct aligner must preserve the networks topology as well as the biological coherence. However, this is a trade-off that is hard to achieve. In addition, most aligners require a considerable effort to use in practice and many researchers must choose an aligner without the opportunity to previously compare the performance of different aligners.

In this context, smartphone-based tracking apps play an important role in controlling transmission. However, privacy concerns may compromise the populations willingness to adopt this mobile health (mHealth) technology. Based on the privacy calculus theory, this study aims to examine what factors drive or hinder adoption and disclosure, considering the moderating role of age and health status. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a European country hit by the pandemic that has recently launched a COVID-19 contact-tracing app. Data from 504 potential users was analyzed through partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings: Results indicate that perceived benefits and privacy concerns impact adoption and disclosure and confirm the existence of a privacy paradox. However, for young and healthy users, only benefits have a significant effect. Moreover, older people value more personal than societal benefits while for respondents with a chronical disease privacy concerns outweigh personal benefits. Originality/value: The study contributes to consumer privacy research and to the mHealth literature, where privacy issues have been rarely explored, particularly regarding COVID-19 contact-tracing apps. The study re-examines the privacy calculus by incorporating societal benefits and moving from a traditional self-focus approach to an other-focus perspective. This study further adds to prior research by examining the moderating role of age and health condition, two COVID-19 risk factors. This study thus offers critical insights for governments and health organizations aiming to use these tools to reduce COVID-19 transmission rates. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Privacy concerns with COVID-19 tracking apps: a privacy calculus approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research Ethics Committees (RECs)or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), as they are known in the USwere created about 50 years ago to independently assess the ethical acceptability of research projects involving human subjects, their fundamental role being the protection of the dignity and rights of research participants. In this paper we develop some critical reflections about the current situation of RECs. Our starting point is the definition of the role they should ideally play, a role that should necessarily include a collaborative approach and the focus on the ethics component of the review. This ideal is unfortunately quite far from reality: inadequacies in the functioning of RECs have been discussed for decades, along with reform proposals. Both in the US and in the European Union (EU), reforms that aim at the centralization of the review process were recently approved. Even though these reforms were needed, they nonetheless raise concerns. We focus on two such concerns, related in particular to Regulation (EU) No 536/2014: the risk of narrowing the scope of the ethics review and that of disregarding the local context. We argue that the COVID\\\\19 pandemic paved the way for the transition towards the centralized model and that an analysis of its impact on the research review process could provide some interesting insights into possible shortcomings of this new model.

The purpose of this paper was to do a survival analysis in a cohort of non-infected OTS patients and explaining the effect of different grades of surgical aggression. Methods: This is an observational study of 184 patients who underwent OTS in the month before the halt of surgical activities, before implementation of special measures, and high rate of transmission. Crude risk of infection, infection rates, survival and hazard function analysis, and Cox regression and Fine-Gray models for explaining the effect of aggression and inflammation (groups of surgery). Results: The crude risk of COVID-19 diagnosis was 14.13% (95%CI: 9.83%C19.90%). The total incidence rate (IR) was 2.67 (1000 person-day) (95%CI: 1.74C3.91). At the end of the follow-up, there was a 94.42% chance of surviving 76 days or more after OTS. The differences in survivor curves by surgery groups were statistically significant and established that Group of surgery 4 presented a lower survival function. The age adjusted for group of surgery, high blood pressure and respiratory history was one of the best model to explain the association with the mortality by COVID-19 (HR: 1.111, CI95%: 1.005-1.228;SHR: 1.111, CI95%: 1.046-1.177) Conclusions: There is an infection risk after OTS similar to the general population in a community transmission/area;the grade of aggression does not influence this rate. The survival probability is extremely high if patients were not previously infected. Mortality is higher if the group was susceptible to a higher aggression and inflammation grade;however, age adjusted for confounders as groups of surgery, high blood pressure and respiratory history are associated with mortality.","output":"Survival Analysis and Influence of the Surgical Aggression of a Cohort of Orthopedic and Trauma Patients in a Non-controlled Spread COVID-19 Scenario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In case of COVID-19 epidemic spread the requirements for protection of medical personnel were increased. This category of specialists has exposure of high risk of COVID-19, due to inevitable numerous contacts with infected persons.

The emergency response path was implemented through the opening of new infectious hospitals, re-profiling clinics, as well as increasing workload on medical personnel. This approach is associated with the possible rapid drop-up of qualified medical specialists due to the illness, which is a strong limiting factor to respond to new threats of COVID-19 due to the risks of exhaustion of the human resource. In the worst scenario, a threat of collapse of the emergency and specialized medical care system due to peak load of severe patients under the shortage of doctors and support personnel. To prevent such an emergency, a complex of anti-epidemic events is provided, most of the purpose of interrupting infection contacts, isolation of the most vulnerable contingents, extended population testing for virus or contact with infected persons, this allows you to follow unwanted contacts with the subsequent mobility limitation. Digital monitoring technologies with digitization of incoming data of significant events played the increasing role in all these options. Today they are complemented by robotic supporting.

However, the financial impact of medical care for sustained injuries is currently unknown. The purpose of this study is to characterize total billing charges associated with medical care of e-scooter injuries. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with e-scooter injuries presenting to the trauma bay, emergency department or outpatient clinics at an urban level 1 trauma center was conducted from November 2017 to March 2020. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Primary outcomes of interest were total billing charges and billing to insurance (hospital and professional). Multivariable models were used to identify preventable risk factors associated with higher total billing charges. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were identified consisting of 42 (66.7%) males, average age 40.19 (SD 13.29) years and 3.2% rate of helmet use. Patients sustained orthopedic (29%, n=18), facial (48%, n=30) and cranial (23%, n=15) injuries. The average total billing charges for e-scooter clinical encounters was $95 710 (SD $138 215). Average billing to insurance was $86 376 (SD $125 438) for hospital charges and $9 334 (SD $14 711) for professional charges. There were no significant differences in charges between injury categories.

We also did a forward-backward citation search of the included studies. INCLUSION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials and observational studies comparing face mask use to any active intervention or to control. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two author pairs independently screened articles for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies. The primary outcomes were compliance, discomforts, harms and adverse events of wearing face masks. RESULTS: We screened 5471 articles, including 37 (40 references); 11 were meta-analysed. For mask wear adherence, 47% (95% CI 25% to 68%, p<0.0001), more people wore face masks in the face mask group compared with control; adherence was significantly higher (26%, 95% CI 8% to 46%, p<0.01) in the surgical/medical mask group than in N95/P2 group. The largest number of studies reported on the discomfort and irritation outcome (20 studies); fewest reported on the misuse of masks, and none reported on mask contamination or risk compensation behaviour.

Cerium oxide (CeO(2)), which causes oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the environment of tumor cells, was synthesized on the surface of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles to produce nanoparticles that selectively kill cancer cells. In addition, hyaluronic acid (HA) was coated on the ceriums surface to target CD44-overexpressing tumor cells, and (nat)Zr was chelated on the Fe(3)O(4)@CeO(2) surface to show the usefulness of labeling the radioisotope (89)Zr (T1/2 = 3.3 d). The synthesis of Fe(3)O(4)@CeO(2) was confirmed by Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Field Emission-Transmission Electron Microscope (FE-TEM). The coating of HA was confirmed by FT-IR, X-ray Photoelectron. Spectroscopy (XPS), FE-TEM, Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)/Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The sizes of the prepared nanoparticles were confirmed through FE-TEM and Field Emission-Scanning Electron (FE-SEM) (sizes of 15 to 30 nm), and it was confirmed that (nat)Zr was introduced onto the surface of the nanoparticles using EDS. The particle size of the dispersed material was limited through Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) to about 148 nm in aqueous solution, which was suitable for the (enhanced permeation and retention) EPR effect. It was confirmed that the HA-coated nanoparticles have good dispersibility. Finally, a cytotoxicity evaluation confirmed the ability of CeO(2) to generate ROS and target the delivery of HA.

CASE PRESENTATION: The 57 year old Caucasian male patient had a 4-year history of MM and was considered penta-refractory upon presentation for CAR T cell therapy. He had a history of immunosuppression and received one dose of lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LDC) the day prior to COVID-19 diagnosis; this patient was able to mount a substantial immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and antiviral antibodies remain detectable 2 months after receiving anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy. The recent SARS-CoV-2 infection in this patient did not exacerbate CAR T-associated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and conversely the CAR T cell therapy did not result in COVID-19-related complications. One month after CAR T cell infusion, the patient was assessed to have an unconfirmed partial response per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. CONCLUSION: Our case adds important context around treatment choice for MM patients in the era of COVID-19 and whether CAR T therapy can be administered to patients who have recovered from COVID-19. As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues, the decision of whether to proceed with CAR T cell therapy will require extensive discussion weighing the potential risks and benefits of therapy. This case suggests that it is possible to successfully complete anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy after recovery from COVID-19.

We examined the association of mode of respiratory support and ceiling-of-care on mortality. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of routinely collected de-identified data of adults with nasal/throat SARs-CoV-2 swab-positive results, at the Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust between 10th March-19th April 2020 (outcomes determined on 22nd May). FINDINGS: Of 347 patients with SARs-CoV-2 swab-positive results, 294 (84.7%) patients admitted for Covid-19 were included in the study. Sixty-nine patients were trialled on CPAP, mostly delivered by face mask, either as an early ceiling of care instituted within 24 hours of admission (N = 19), or as a potential bridge to IMV (N = 44). Patients receiving a ceiling of care more than 24 hours after admission (N = 6) were excluded from the analysis. Two hundred and fifteen patients (73.1%) maximally received air/standard oxygen therapy, and 45 (15.3%) patients maximally received CPAP. Thirty-four patients (11.6%) required IMV, of which 24 had received prior CPAP. There were 138 patients with an early ceiling-of-care plan (pre-admission/within 24h). Overall, 103(35.0%) patients died and 191(65.0%) were alive at study end. Among all patients trialled on CPAP either as a potential bridge to IMV (N = 44) or as a ceiling-of-care (N = 19) mortality was 25% and 84%, respectively. Overall, there was strong evidence for higher mortality among patients who required CPAP or IMV, compared to those who required only air/oxygen (aOR 5.24 95%CI: 1.38, 19.81 and aOR 46.47 95%CI: 7.52, 287.08, respectively; p<0.001), and among patients with early ceiling-of-care compared to those without a ceiling (aOR 41.81 95%CI: 8.28, 211.17; p<0.001). Among patients without a ceiling of care (N = 137), 10 patients required prompt intubation following failed oxygen therapy, but 44 patients received CPAP. CPAP failure, defined as death (N = 1) or intubation (N = 24), occurred in 57% (N = 25) of patients. But in total, 75% (N = 33) of those started on CPAP with no ceiling of care recovered to discharge19 without the need for IMV, and 14 following IMV. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that among patients with no ceiling-of-care, an initial trial of CPAP as a potential bridge to IMV offers a favourable therapeutic alternative to early intubation. In contrast, among patients with a ceiling-of care, CPAP seems to offer little additional survival benefit beyond oxygen therapy alone. Information on ceilings of respiratory support is vital to interpreting mortality from Covid-19. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY: Sample size relatively small.

Besides well-established imaging techniques such O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET)-PET and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion imaging, amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) imaging has emerged as a promising novel MR technique. In this study, we aimed to better understand the relation between these imaging biomarkers and how well they capture cellularity and vascularity in newly diagnosed gliomas. METHODS Preoperative MRI and FET-PET data of 46 patients (31 glioblastoma and 15 lower-grade glioma) were segmented into contrast-enhancing and FLAIR-hyperintense areas. Using established cutoffs, we calculated hot-spot volumes (HSV) and their spatial overlap. We further investigated APTw and CBV values in FET-HSV. In a subset of 10 glioblastoma patients, we compared cellularity and vascularization in 34 stereotactically targeted biopsies with imaging. RESULTS In glioblastomas, the largest HSV was found for APTw, followed by PET and CBV (p < 0.05). In lower-grade gliomas, APTw-HSV was clearly lower than in glioblastomas. The spatial overlap of HSV was highest between APTw and FET in both tumor entities and regions. APTw correlated significantly with cellularity, similar to FET, while the association with vascularity was more pronounced in CBV and FET. CONCLUSIONS We found a relevant spatial overlap in glioblastomas between hotspots of APTw and FET both in contrast-enhancing and FLAIR-hyperintense tumor. As suggested by earlier studies, APTw was lower in lower-grade gliomas compared with glioblastomas. APTw meaningfully contributes to biological imaging of gliomas.","output":"Imaging glioma biology: spatial comparison of amino acid PET, amide proton transfer, and perfusion-weighted MRI in newly diagnosed gliomas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Subjective well-being (SWB) is a contributing factor for building resilience and a resource for positive outcomes, e.g. study achievement and work performance. Earlier studies have examined associations between and prospective effects of personality traits on SWB, but few addressed the role that SWB plays in formation of personality over time. The purpose of our study was to examine associations and prospective effects of SWB on personality traits and vice versa in a cohort sample of secondary school students in Sweden who completed self-reported measures of SWB and personality traits at baseline (N = 446, 76% females) and at 15C18 month follow-up (N = 283, 71% females). METHODS: SWB was defined and measured by the WHO-5 Well-being Index and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. The Big Five Inventory was used to measure personality traits. Autoregressive models were used to analyse associations and potential prospective effects of SWB on personality traits and vice versa. RESULTS: Low levels of neuroticism and high levels of extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness were associated with high levels of SWB at baseline and follow-up. The association between SWB and neuroticism was notably strong. We found high statistically significant rank order stability across the two time points for all measures of personality traits with stability effects, derived from the autoregressive models, ranging from .199 for extraversion to .440 for neuroticism. Stability for SWB was statistically significant across the two time points and ranged from .182 for well-being to .353 for life satisfaction. SWB had a prospective effect on agreeableness only. None of the personality traits had any significant prospective effects on SWB. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings indicate that although correlated, bidirectional prospective effects between personality traits and SWB could not be confirmed. Neuroticism displayed the strongest negative association with adolescents SWB. Schools are an appropriate setting to improve well-being, and allocating resources that reduce neuroticism is crucial, including structural interventions, policies for healthy school settings and teaching emotional regulation techniques.

Inflammatory markers for activation of complement (terminal C5b-9 complement complex [TCC]), granulocytes (myeloperoxidase), platelets (-thromboglobulin), cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF], IL-1, IL6, and IL-8), and leukocytes (CD11b and oxidative burst) were quantified, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, multiplex technology, and flow cytometry. In E. coli- and S. aureus-stimulated whole blood, a broad dose-titration of vitamin C and hydrocortisone alone did not lead to doseCresponse effects for the central innate immune mediators TCC and IL-6. Hence, the clinically relevant doses were used further. Compared to the untreated control sample, two of the nine biomarkers induced by E. coli were reduced by hydrocortisone and/or vitamin C.

RESEARCH DESIGN This was a retrospective, observational over fiscal years (FY) 2015-2018. SUBJECTS Veterans receiving primary care services paid for by the VA. MEASURES Veteran demographic, socioeconomic and clinical factors and use of VA primary care services under the VCP each year. RESULTS There were 6.3 million Veterans with >54 million VA primary care visits, predominantly (98.5% of visits) at VA facility. The proportion of VA-CCN visits increased in absolute terms from 0.7% in 2015 to 2.6% in 2018. Among Veterans with any VA-CCN primary care, the proportion of VA-CCN visits increased from 22.6% to 55.3%. Logistic regression indicated that Veterans who were female, lived in rural areas, had a driving distance >40 miles, had health insurance or had a psychiatric/depression condition were more likely to receive VA-CCN primary care. Veterans who were older, identified as Black race, required to pay VA copayments, or had a higher Nosos score, were less likely to receive VA-CCN primary care.

Despite its importance, the long-term persistence of its small and fragmented populations is jeopardised by genetic erosion and hence, monitoring its genetic resource and variability is practically required for providing conservation measures of the species germplasm in Zagros woodland ecosystem. The present study aimed to provide the first data on genetic diversity and genetic differentiation pattern of 19 natural populations comprising 240 individuals of A. monspessulanum across its growing area in Zagros forests using three molecular tools including inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR), start codon targeted (SCoT), and simple sequence repeat (SSR). In total, ISSR and SCoT primers generated a total of 141 and 121 clear and scorable bands for analysis with the polymorphism rate of 90.50 and 90.02% and a mean of 10.85 and 11 fragments per marker, respectively. In addition, 73 alleles were achieved using 10 polymorphic SSR loci from the studied accessions with 100% polymorphism, ranging between 5 and 10 alleles per locus. Average percentage of polymorphic alleles per population for ISSR, SCoT, and SSR data was 84.02%, 83%, and 100%, respectively, and generally, Nei's gene diversity (H) and Shannon's index of diversity (I) values for all populations demonstrated moderate to high levels of genetic diversity (H = 0.267-0.707; I = 0.38-1.38). The AMOVA results of the three marker systems attributed higher genetic variation to individuals within in each population than among populations. Furthermore, overall GST value for all populations detected the moderate to high levels of genetic differentiation, indicating a limited gene flow occurrence among the populations.

Design: Systematic rapid review and meta-analysis. Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, searched up to 23 March 2020. Method: We selected observational and experimental studies examining the impact on mental health of epidemic outbreaks on HCWs. Titles and abstracts were screened by one reviewer, and full texts were evaluated by two reviewers independently. We extracted study characteristics, symptoms, prevalence of mental health problems, risk factors, mental health interventions, and its impact. We assessed risk of bias for each individual study. We conducted a narrative and tabulated synthesis of the results. We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. We followed the GRADE approach to assess the certainty in the evidence. Results: We included 61 studies (56 examining impact on mental health and five about interventions to reduce such impact). Most were conducted in Asia (59%), examined the impact of the SARS epidemic (69%), and took place in the hospital setting (79%). The pooled prevalence was higher for anxiety (45%, 95% CI 21 to 69%; 6 studies, 3,373 participants), followed by depression (38%, 95% CI 15 to 60%; 7 studies, 3,636 participants), acute stress disorder (31%, 95% CI 0 to 82%, 3 studies , 2,587 participants), burnout (29%, 95% CI 25 to 32%; 3 studies; 1,168 participants) and post-traumatic stress disorder (19%, 95% CI 11 to 26%, 10 studies, 3,121 participants). Based on 37 studies, we identified a broad number of risk factors for these conditions, including sociodemographic: younger age and female gender; social factors: lack of social support, social rejection or isolation, stigmatization; and occupational: working in a high risk environment (frontline staff), specific occupational roles (e.g., nurse), and lower levels of specialized training, preparedness and job experience. Two out of five interventions identified were educational aimed to prevent mental health problems by increasing HCWs resilience. These interventions showed positive effects in confidence in support and training, pandemic self-efficacy and interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty). One multifaceted intervention (based on training and organisational changes) targeted at hospital nurses during the SARS epidemic produced statistically significant improvements in anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty). The impact of the two remaining interventions (multifaceted and based on psychotherapy provision) was unreported. Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety, depression, acute and post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout, was high both during and after the outbreaks. These problems not only have a long-lasting effect on the mental health of HCWs, but also hinder the urgent response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, by jeopardising attention and decision-making. Governments and healthcare authorities should take urgent actions to protect the mental health of HCWs.

Diverse retained surgical materials including instruments such as clamps and sutures have been reported, but surgical sponges are the most common material. We report an unusual case of a gossypiboma mimicking a complicated urachal cyst that led to perforation of the umbilicus. CASE PRESENTATION: A 38-year-old female patient presented in our facility with a palpable periumbilical mass and discharge of pus from the umbilicus for 7 months after an open appendectomy. Since the onset of symptoms, the patient had been treated conservatively in a peripheral hospital where she had been operated on. As no improvement was seen, an ultrasound scan was performed that suggested an intraperitoneal abscess adjacent to the umbilicus. Consequently, the patient was referred to our specialist outpatient department for surgical intervention. Suspecting a complicated urachal cyst, an exploratory laparotomy was performed but revealed a retained surgical sponge as the underlying cause. The gossypiboma was resected, and the postoperative period was unremarkable. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates that gossypibomas, even though rare, continue to occur. They may clinically and radiologically mimic other pathologies, especially abscesses and tumors. Preventive measures as well as the inclusion of gossypibomas in the differential diagnosis of intraabdominal masses or fistulation detected in patients with a history of surgery are of utmost importance to minimize morbidity, mortality, and potential medicolegal implications.","output":"Gossypiboma with perforation of the umbilicus mimicking a complicated urachal cyst: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NMDA receptors play vital roles in a broad array of essential brain functions, from synaptic transmission and plasticity to learning and memory.

During viral infections, the host innate immune response is mounted quickly to produce some endogenous functional molecules to limit virus replication and spread. Exosomes contain molecules from their cell of origin following virus infection and can enter recipient cells for intercellular communication. Here, we aim to clarify whether ZIKV-induced exosomes can regulate viral pathogenicity by transferring specific RNAs. MAIN METHODS: In this study, exosomes were isolated from the supernatants of A549 cells with or without ZIKV infection. Human transcriptome array (HTA) was performed to analyze the profiling of RNAs wrapped in exosomes. Then qPCR, western blotting and ELISA were used to determine ZIKV replication. CCK-8 and flow cytometry were used to test the cell proliferation and cell cycles. Co-culture assay was used to analyze the effect of exosomes on the cell cycles of recipient cells. KEY FINDINGS: Through human transcriptome array (HTA) we found the defensin alpha 1B (DEFA1B) expression was significantly increased within exosomes isolated from ZIKV infected A549 cells. Additionally, we found that the extracellular DEFA1B exerts significant anti-ZIKV activity, mainly before ZIKV entering host cells. Interestingly, up-regulated DEFA1B retards the cell cycle of host cells. Further studies demonstrated that DEFA1B interacted with the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1) which is required to initiate DNA replication during the cell cycle and increased DEFA1B expression decreased the ORC1 level in the cell nuclei. Accordingly, DEFA1B-containing exosomes can be internalized by the recipient cells to retard their cell cycles. SIGNIFICANCE: Together, our results demonstrated that the anti-ZIKV activity of DEFA1B can be mediated by exosomes, and DEFA1B interacts with ORC1 to retard cell cycles. Our study provides a novel concept that DEFA1B not only acts as an antiviral molecule during ZIKV infection but also may correlate with cell proliferation by retarding the progression of cell cycles.","output":"DEFA1B inhibits ZIKV replication and retards cell cycle progression through interaction with ORC1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), an enveloped dsDNA virus, is one of the major pathogens of feline upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) and ocular disease. Currently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains the gold standard diagnostic tool for FHV-1 infection but is relatively expensive, requires well-equipped laboratories and is not suitable for field tests. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), an isothermal gene amplification technology, has been explored for the molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases. In this study, an exo-RPA assay for FHV-1 detection was developed and validated. Primers targeting specifically the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of FHV-1 were designed. The RPA reaction was performed successfully at 39C and the results were obtained within 20 min. Using different copy numbers of recombinant plasmid DNA that contains the TK gene as template, we showed the detection limit of exo-RPA was 10(2) copies DNA/reaction, the same as that of real time PCR. The exo-RPA assay did not cross-detect feline panleukopenia virus, feline calicivirus, bovine herpesvirus-1, pseudorabies virus or chlamydia psittaci, a panel of pathogens important in feline URTD or other viruses in Alphaherpesvirinae, demonstrating high specificity. The assay was validated by testing 120 nasal and ocular conjunctival swabs of cats, and the results were compared with those obtained with real-time PCR. Both assays provided the same testing results in the clinical samples. Compared with real time PCR, the exo-RPA assay uses less-complex equipment that is portable and the reaction is completed much faster. Additionally, commercial RPA reagents in vacuum-sealed pouches can tolerate temperatures up to room temperature for days without loss of activity, suitable for shipment and storage for field tests. Taken together, the exo-RPA assay is a simple, fast and cost-effective alternative to real time PCR, suitable for use in less advanced laboratories and for field detection of FHV-1 infection.","output":"Recombinase Polymerase Amplification AssayA Simple, Fast and Cost-Effective Alternative to Real Time PCR for Specific Detection of Feline Herpesvirus-1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented and devastating impact on public health, society and economics around the world. As a result, the development of vaccines to protect individuals from symptomatic COVID-19 infections has represented the only feasible health tool to combat the spread of the disease. However, at the same time the development and regulatory assessment of different vaccines has challenged pharmaceutical industries and regulatory agencies as this process has occurred in the shorter time ever though. So far, two mRNA and two adenovirus-vectored vaccines have received a conditional marketing authorisation in the EU and other countries. This review summarized and discusses the assessment reports of the European Medicine Agency (EMA) concerning the safety of the 3 vaccines currently used in the EU (Pfizer, Moderna and Astra-Zeneca). A particular focus has been paid to safety information from pre-clinical (animal) and clinical (phase 3 trials) studies. Overall, the most frequent adverse effects reported after the administration of these vaccines consisted of local reactions at the injection site (sore arm and erythema) followed by non-specific systemic effects (myalgia, chills, fatigue, headache, and fever), which occurred soon after vaccination and resolved shortly. Rare cases of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia have been reported for Vaxzevria. Data on long-term studies, interaction with other vaccines, use in pregnancy/breast-feeding, use in immunocompromised subjects, and in subjects with comorbidities, autoimmune or inflammatory disorders are still missing for these vaccines. Therefore, careful follow-up and surveillance studies for continued vaccine safety monitoring will be needed to ascertain the potential risks of such adverse events or diseases. In conclusion, the benefits and risks of current COVID-19 vaccines must be weighed against the real possibility of contract the disease and develop complications and long-term sequels; all this on the basis of the available scientific evidence and in the absence of unmotivated biases.","output":"Safety of COVID-19 vaccines administered in the EU: Should we be concerned?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection hijacks signaling pathways and induces proteinCprotein interactions between human and viral proteins.

Then a glucose metabolism-related gene (GMG)-based model (PC, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), glucuronidase beta (GUSB), galactosidase beta 1 (GLB1), galactose mutarotase (GALM), or fructose-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1)) was constructed by a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and Lasso regression.

Various classical tumor-related functions were enriched by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. Since protein GALM was rarely studied in glioma, we detected high expression of GALM by western blot and immunohistochemistry in glioma tissues. And experiments in vitro showed that GALM could promote the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of glioma cells and could be regulated by TNFAIP3 in glioma cells. Overall, our study revealed the critical role of glucose metabolism in the prognosis of patients with glioma.

Early in the pandemic, more severe forms of COVID-19 have been observed in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, who are often treated with renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS)-blockers, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), but whether these are indeed independent risk factors is unknown. The cellular receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as for SARS-CoV(-1). Experimental data suggest that expression of ACE2 may be increased by RAAS-blockers, raising concerns that these drugs may facilitate viral cell entry. On the other hand, ACE2 is a key counter-regulator of the RAAS, by degrading angiotensin II into angiotensin (1-7), and may thereby mediate beneficial effects in COVID-19. These considerations have raised concerns about the management of these drugs, and early comments shed vivid controversy among physicians. This review will describe the homeostatic balance between ACE-angiotensin II and ACE2-angiotensin (1-7) and summarize the pathophysiological rationale underlying the debated role of the RAAS and its modulators in the context of the pandemic.

Here we describe the first case of mild COVID-19 during ongoing oncological treatment without significant deterioration after rituximab administration. CASE SUMMARY A 74-year-old female with an enlargement of her right palatine tonsil was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma following tonsillectomy and started immunochemotherapy according to the rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone regimen. At home before the fourth cycle, she developed nonspecific symptoms (excessive fatigue, loss of appetite and nausea), misdiagnosed as adverse effects of chemotherapy. Unexpectedly, interim positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan, performed shortly before rituximab administration, revealed previously nonexistent pulmonary changes, potentially of infectious etiology. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by a nasopharyngeal swab (with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test) performed the following day. Despite rituximab infusion, the patient remained oligosymptomatic and was discharged home for self-isolation. Having reached a negative SARS-CoV-2 status before the subsequently scheduled regimen, the patient successfully received six cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and obtained complete remission by positron emission tomography-computed tomography.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore why people who inject drugs decline free vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and how barriers to vaccination can potentially be addressed. METHODS: We conducted semistructured qualitative interviews with 17 unvaccinated adult persons who inject drugs during August and September 2021 at a New York City syringe service program, where approximately three-fourth of participants identified as Latino (55%) or African American (22%). Interviews lasted roughly 20 minutes. The interview guide examined reasons for declining vaccination, participants understanding of COVID-19 risks, and how messages could be developed to encourage vaccine uptake among people who inject drugs. RESULTS: Participants acknowledged that they faced increased risk from SARS-CoV-2 owing to their injection drug use but feared that long-term substance use may have weakened their health, making them especially vulnerable to side effects. Fears of possible side effects, compounded by widespread medical mistrust and questions about the overall value of vaccination contributed to marked ambivalence among our sample. The desire to protect children and older family members emerged as key potential facilitators of vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Community-developed messages are needed in outreach efforts to explain the importance of vaccination, including the far greater dangers of COVID-19 compared to possible unintended side effects.

Stool was collected to evaluate for changes in microbiome structure. Results182 participants were enrolled and randomized during the study period. Intention-to-treat analysis showed that participants randomized to LGG were less likely to develop symptoms versus those randomized to placebo (26.4% vs. 42.9%, p=0.02). Further, LGG was associated with a statistically significant reduction in COVID-19 diagnosis (log rank p=0.049) via time-to-event analysis. Overall incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis did not significantly differ between LGG and placebo groups (8.8% vs. 15.4%, p=0.17). LGG was well-tolerated with no increased side effects versus placebo. Placebo recipients were more likely to stop the study product, temporarily or permanently, due to symptoms attributed to the study product (5.5% vs. 0%, p = 0.02).

To this end and in line with the WHOs call for 40% raise in PPE production across the world, we sought to alleviate the PPE shortage and to support our local communities using 3D printing (additive manufacturing) and free and open-source hardware (FOSH). Methods: : Utilising a 3D printer and off-the-shelf components, reusable face shields and face masks were produced based on open source designs. Off-the-shelf components included transparent polyvinyl chloride (PVC) visor, ribbon tapings and elastic bands for the face shields, as well as cushioning pads (clothed foams) and filters (sensitive tissues) for the face masks. Hygienic measures employed during fabrication included the assembly following safety protocols, disinfection of products with ultraviolet bactericidal lamps, ensuring hygiene during collection and distribution. Users real-life experience and feedback were utilised to modify and improve on quality and adaptability of the designs. Results: : In a period of three months, over 400 reusable 3D-printed face shields and face masks were produced by a team of academics, for health practitioners, other professionals and people across the Olabisi Onabanjo University community and other cities within Ogun and Lagos states. Conclusions: : More awareness is generally required on the potentials of 3D printing and FOSH in the global south, particularly in universities and research institutions where innovative alternatives to expensive equipment remain vital.

The objective of the present study was to reassess the prevalence of recent suicidal ideation in the spring of 2021. Methods The prevalence of suicidal ideation among adults in Canada was examined using the 2021 SCMH (conducted between February 1 and May 7, 2021), and it was compared with the prevalence in the 2019 Canadian Community Health Survey. Unadjusted logistic regression analysis was used to assess the differential likelihood of reporting suicidal ideation in population subgroups. Results Among adults in Canada, the prevalence of suicidal ideation since the pandemic began was 4.2%, which was significantly higher than the pre-pandemic prevalence of 2.7% in 2019. A statistically significant increase in prevalence was observed among females and males, age groups younger than 65, and several other sociodemographic groups, as well as in British Columbia, the Prairie provinces and Ontario. People who were younger than 65 years, were born in Canada, had lower educational attainment, or were never married were significantly more likely to report suicidal ideation than others during the pandemic. Conclusion As the second year of the pandemic began, the prevalence of recent suicidal ideation in Canada was higher than it had been before the pandemic in 2019. Continuous monitoring of suicide-related outcomes and risks is necessary so that population-level changes can be detected and inform public health action.","output":"Prevalence of suicidal ideation among adults in Canada: Results of the second Survey on COVID-19 and mental health."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nurses are the largest regulated group of healthcare professionals involved in palliative care. In 2004, a taskforce of the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) launched the 'Guide for development of palliative nurse education in Europe' (hereinafter, the EAPC 2004 Guide). No systematic evaluation of its impact in the development of palliative care education was undertaken. AIMS: To describe current undergraduate and postgraduate nursing education across Europe; to identify the roles that nurses with different palliative care educational levels have in palliative care; and to assess the uptake of the EAPC 2004 Guide in the development of palliative care nursing in Europe. DESIGN: Descriptive research involving an online survey among nursing experts, and the consultation of national representatives. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 135 nurses (52% response rate) from 25 countries completed the online survey; representatives from 16 countries were consulted. RESULTS: In 14 (56%) countries, palliative care was not identified as a mandatory subject within undergraduate nursing education. The EAPC 2004 Guide is widely known and was/is being used in many countries to promote palliative care nursing education. Large variations were found across and within country responses. CONCLUSIONS: Palliative care nursing education varies largely in Europe. The wide awareness and use of the EAPC 2004 Guide show how policy measures can influence the development of palliative care education. Recommendations are built and focus on both fostering the use of this guide and implementing policy measures to ensure that palliative care nursing is recognised and certified as a specialty in all European countries.","output":"Nursing education on palliative care across Europe: Results and recommendations from the EAPC Taskforce on preparation for practice in palliative care nursing across the EU based on an online-survey and country reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes the effect of a preschool hygiene intervention program on psychosocial measures of educators regarding handwashing and communicable pediatric disease. A cluster-randomized trial, with randomization at the level of the preschool, was run in 40 Jerusalem preschool classrooms. Eighty preschool educators participated. The program used a multipronged approach which included elements aimed at staff, children, parents, school nurses and the classroom environment. Frontal lectures by medical, epidemiological and educational experts, along with printed materials and experiential learning, were provided to staff. Responses from a validated survey instrument were used to build four scales for each respondent regarding beliefs, attitudes, self-efficacy and knowledge. The scales were built on a Likert-type 1-7 scale (1 = minimum, 7 = maximum). The effect of the intervention was tested using mixed model analysis of variance. Response was received from 92.5% of educators. Educators believed that handwashing could affect health (mean = 5.5, SD = 1.1), had high levels of self-efficacy (mean = 6.1, SD = 0.9) and had positive attitudes toward handwashing (mean = 5.7, SD = 1.2). Knowledge was affected by the intervention (intervention: mean = 6.2, SD = 0.7; control: mean = 5.8, SD = 0.8). The combination of positive attitudes toward handwashing among educators and the program's effectiveness in imparting knowledge helped to create a sustained social norm of handwashing among many children in disparate locations.","output":"The effect of a handwashing intervention on preschool educator beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and self-efficacy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:A prospective study was conducted by Department of Molecular diagnostic laboratory, Deccan College of Medical Sciences to assess the importance of interpretation of a COVID-19 test result. This study strongly encourages us to manage patients with a high pre-clinical likelihood and typical clinical and radiological features as affected by COVID - 19, independently of the result of real-time RT-PCR, especially if performed on specimens collected from the upper air- ways. Acquisition of lower respiratory tract samples should be considered in the event of one or more negative RT -PCR assays. Methods:Out of 500 cases, 400 suspicious of COVID-19 affected patients were subjected to HRCT, simultaneously after admission their Nasopharyngeal and Oro-pharyngeal swabs for RT- PCR Assays. Laboratory diagnosis through RT-PCR testing alone lacks adequate sensitivity and specificity to be recommended as the only valid criterion to confirm COVID - 19 diagnosis. The leading role played by CT scan and repeat RT-PCR assay in the identification and management of espe- cially false-negative patients with COVID-19-has been highlighted in this study. Results: 24 cases were found to positive after retested by RT-PCR. Real-time RT-PCR has intrinsic limitations that might significantly affect its accuracy in the diagnosis of COVID-19. False-negative results may depend on several pre-analytical and analytical vulnerabilities, during specimen collection, transport, execution of test outside of the diagnostic window, PCR Inhibitors, use of non-validated assays. Moreover, the development of recombinant forms of SARS-CoV-2 may ad- versely affect the diagnostic accuracy of nucleic acid-based assays. Conclusions:If Covid-19 is suspected HRCT scan should be performed at hospital admission, together with or even be- fore or repeat sample, as this has been shown to correctly lead the clinical management yet from the earliest stage of the disease and to provide the highest detection rate after a very short time from symptoms onset.

Scheduled surgeries were suspended, operating rooms were closed, and anesthesiologists redistributed among the various intensive care units. At the Centro Hospitalar do Baixo Vouga the number of patients admitted to the emergency department decreased to approximately 8.000 during the period of lockdown which ranged from 18th March to 1st June 2020. The aim of this study was to compare the number of patients presenting with hip fractures during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with the equivalent period in 2019 and to analyze postoperative outcomes. METHODS: An observational retrospective study was conducted in two different periods. Patients over the age of 50 years admitted with hip fracture were included for analysis. The data was collected from the hospital database. A general descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: There was an overall reduction in the number of admissions due to hip fractures in Period 2020 compared with homologous Period in 2019 (68 patients and 94 patients, respectively). No statistically significant differences could be found regarding age, gender, ASA grade and pre-admission residence among patients admitted during these both periods. Nursing home patients in Period 2020 had a longer hospital stay (p=0.03), independently of the functional status (p=0.07). There were no statistically significant differences in the time it took the patient to go to the emergency department after the fall, place where the fracture had occurred, waiting time to perform the surgery, type of treatment performed, post-surgical complications and mortality. There was no relationship between mortality and the time it took the patient to access the emergency department (p=0,487), or mortality and the mean length of stay in the hospital (p=0,151). All the patients admitted to the emergency department in Period 2020 were negative to PCR test for SARS-CoV-2.

With recent advances in organoid technology, studies on farm and companion animal organoids have gained more attention in various fields including veterinary medicine, translational medicine and biomedical research. Not only is this because three-dimensional organoids possess unique characteristics from traditional two-dimensional cell cultures including their self-organizing and self-renewing properties and high structural and functional similarities to the originating tissue, but also because relative to conventional genetically modified or artificially induced murine models, companion animal organoids can provide an excellent model for spontaneously occurring diseases which resemble human diseases. These features of companion animal organoids offer a paradigm-shifting approach in biomedical research and improve translatability of in vitro studies to subsequent in vivo studies with spontaneously diseased animals while reducing the use of conventional animal models prior to human clinical trials. Farm animal organoids also could play an important role in investigations of the pathophysiology of zoonotic and reproductive diseases by contributing to public health and improving agricultural production. Here, we discuss a brief history of organoids and the most recent updates on farm and companion animal organoids, followed by discussion on their potential in public health, food security, and comparative medicine as One Health initiatives.

METHODS: We described the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome in a group of five Nigerian children managed at a COVID-19 isolation and treatment centre in Nigeria. RESULTS: We managed a total of five children with an age range of 3 months to 8 years in the last four weeks (16th April to 15th May 2020). Three of the five children were males. All the children had close contact with family members that tested positive for COVID-19. Out of the five children, one had moderate disease, three had mild symptomatic disease, and one was asymptomatic. Two out of the five children had lymphocytosis. Out of the four children who had chest radiograph, two had features of pneumonia. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is not uncommon in Nigerian children, and all had a confirmed family member with COVID-19.

In this context the country lockdown initiated to combat the COVID-19 pandemic (during March and April 2020 that is the pre-monsoon season) provides an unique opportunity for studying the relative impacts of different emission sources in the region. Here, we analyze changes in levels of air quality species across the region during selected lockdown periods using satellite and in-situ datasets. This analysis compares air quality levels during the lockdown against pre-lockdown conditions as well as against regional long-term mean. Satellite derived AOD, NO2, and CO data indicates an increase of 9.5%, 2%, and 2.6%, respectively, during the 2020 lockdown period compared to pre-lockdown over the South Asia domain. However, individual country statistics, urban site data, and industrial grid analysis within the region indicate a more varied picture. Cities with high traffic loads reported a reduction of 12C39% in columnar NO2 during lockdown, in-situ PM2.5 measurements indicate a 23C56% percent reduction over the country capitals and columnar SO2 has an approximate reduction of 50% over industrial areas. In contrast, pollutant emissions from natural sources e.g., from biomass burning were observed to be adversely affecting the air quality in this period potentially masking expected lockdown related air quality improvements. This study demonstrates the need for a more nuanced and situation specific understanding of sources of air pollutants (anthropogenic and natural) and for these sources to be better understood from the local to the regional scale. Without this deeper understanding, mitigation strategies cannot be effectively targeted, wasting limited resources as well as risking unintended consequences both for the atmosphere and how mitigation action is perceived by the wider public. ?

Now, we are entering the second phase of the pandemics in which the spread of the virus needs to be contained within the limits that national health systems can cope with. This second phase of the epidemics is expected to last until a vaccination is available or herd immunity is reached. Long-term management strategies thus need to be developed. METHODS: In this paper we present a new agent-based simulation model \\"COVID-19 ABM\\" with which we simulate 4 alternative scenarios for the second \\"new normality\\" phase that can help decision-makers to take adequate control and intervention measures. RESULTS: The scenarios resulted in distinctly different outcomes. A continued lockdown could regionally eradicate the virus within a few months, whereas a relaxation back to 80% of former activity-levels was followed by a second outbreak. Contact-tracing as well as adaptive response strategies could keep COVID-19 within limits. CONCLUSION: The main insights are that low-level voluntary use of tracing apps shows no relevant effects on containing the virus, whereas medium or high-level tracing allows maintaining a considerably higher level of social activity. Adaptive control strategies help in finding the level of least restrictions. A regional approach to adaptive management can further help in fine-tuning the response to regional dynamics and thus minimise negative economic effects.","output":"COVID-19 Intervention Scenarios for a Long-term Disease Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: E-learning has expanded recently in response to the social distance measures during COVID-19 pandemic.

Besides the lungs it can also affect other organs like the heart or the liver. Whether there is a pancreatic manifestation as well is currently unclear. METHODS: and aims: We prospectively collected patient information of patients with Covid-19 associated ARDS in a registry (COvid Registry REChts der Isar intensive care Trial - CORRECT) and analyzed this patient cohort for signs of acute pancreatitis (e.g. lipase activity >3 times the upper limit). RESULTS: 12/38 (31.6%) patients with Covid-19 associated ARDS had a serum lipase activity >180 U/l. Median lipase activity was 422 U/l (186-1127). No patient showed typical findings of acute pancreatitis on imaging studies. On hemodynamic monitoring no patient had signs of intravascular fluid demand regarding MAP, GEDVI and therapy with vasopressors. To avoid worsening respiratory function no treatment with crystalloids was initiated. Lipasemia was not explained by gastroenteritis or renal insufficiency, occurred before as well as after viral clearance and 16.1  6.0 days after the first symptoms. No patient developed severe acute pancreatitis during the follow up period of 35.8  8.3 days. CONCLUSION: High lipasemia without typical signs of acute pancreatitis is a frequent finding in severe Covid-19 associated ARDS.

Developing efficacious therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 is of high priority. Therefore, in this study, the chemical constituents obtained from Tinospora cordifolia are investigated for their in-silico interaction with protein targets crucial for SARSCoV-2 infection and cytokine storm. The five important targets chosen for SARSCoV-2 were the main protease (Mpro), Spike receptor binding domain (Spike-RBD), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp or Nsp12), nonstructural protein 15 (Nsp15) of SARS-CoV-2 and the host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) spike-RBD binding domain and cytokine receptors TNF- (Tumor Necrosis Factor-) and IL-6 (Interleukine-6). This was accomplished using Maestro 12.4 (Schrodinger Suite) to obtain docking scores. Also, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and toxicity parameters (ADMET) were determined using Maestro QikProp modules. The results of computational study revealed that four constituents Cordifolioside-A, Palmatoside-E, Tinocordioside and Tinosporaside significantly antagonize the five targets of SARS-CoV-2 by binding in the binding pocket with docking score ranging from ?9.664 to ?6.488 kcal/mol and shows drug-like property and also effectively inhibit cytokine storm by antagonizing the TNF- and IL-6 receptors. Promising drug-like properties, excellent docking scores, and binding pose against each target makes the screened compounds as possible lead candidate which can be further evaluated in future studies to assess their in vitro and in vivo efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.

The need for students to acquire collaboration-building skills to prepare them to work effectively within diverse healthcare teams to improve patient outcomes is a goal of interprofessional education (IPE). Accrediting bodies across healthcare professions require IPE as part of a robust curriculum to build collaborative skill sets and create a practice ready workforce. To respond to this need, an online healthcare program developed an innovative model for student collaboration across professions and institutions through a virtual interprofessional education (VIPE) program. The VIPE model aims to simulate clinical practice via an asynchronous and synchronous pedagogical approach that combines PBL/CBL with psychological safety. VIPE demonstrated statistically significant gains in knowledge and positive attitudes toward interprofessional collaborative practice as a result of participation in the VIPE program. During COVID-19, the demand for high quality IPE for health professions' students in virtual settings has grown, VIPE has the potential to be a solution for this.

The risk of large outbreaks in dense course settings is contrasted by the benefits of in-person teaching. Transmission risk depends on a range of parameters, such as vaccination coverage and efficacy, number of contacts and adoption of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures (NPIs). Due to the generalised academic freedom in Europe, many universities are asked to autonomously decide on and implement intervention measures and regulate on-campus operations. In the context of rapidly changing vaccination coverage and parameters of the virus, universities often lack sufficient scientific insight to base these decisions on. METHODS: To address this problem, we analyse a calibrated, data-driven agent-based simulation of transmission dynamics of 13,284 students and 1,482 faculty members in a medium-sized European university. We use a co-location network reconstructed from student enrollment data and calibrate transmission risk based on outbreak size distributions in education institutions. We focus on actionable interventions that are part of the already existing decision-making process of universities to provide guidance for concrete policy decisions. RESULTS: Here we show that, with the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, even a reduction to 25% occupancy and universal mask mandates are not enough to prevent large outbreaks given the vaccination coverage of about 85% recently reported for students in Austria.

In total, the four CECs discussed 54 cases from primary care services, with the four most common topics being patient autonomy, competence and coercion; professionalism; cooperation and disagreement with next of kin; and priority setting, resource use and quality. Nursing homes and home care were the primary care services most often involved. Next of kin were present in 10 case deliberations, whereas patients were never present. The investigation indicates that it might be feasible for new CECs to attain a high level of activity including case deliberations within the time frame.

METHODS: A questionnaire requesting general data, staff data and workload data of the centers was developed and sent by means of an online cloud-based software instrument to all Italian pediatric surgery Units. RESULTS: The survey was answered by 34 (65%) out of 52 centers. NICU bedside surgery is reported in 81.8% of the pediatric surgery centers. A lower prevalence of bedside surgical practice in the NICU was reported for Southern Italy and the islands than for Northern Italy and Central Italy (Southern <Northern<Central, p < 0.03). The most frequent clinical characteristics of neonates was preterm neonates with birthweight < 1200 g, with cardiorespiratory instability and/or ventilatory dependence. The most frequently selected indications to surgery were pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, central venous catheter (CVC) positioning, intestinal perforation, patent ductus arteriosus ligation and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. More than 60% of respondents report no institutional recommendations and dedicated informed consent on bedside surgical procedures. The lack of dedicated areas and infrastructures is considered a relative contraindication to the performance of bedside surgery.

The initial objective was to study the practice of primary care health professionals following the event. Initiated in February 2020, this survey was strongly transformed by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 changed the object of this study, imposed a reflection and a link between the two crises, where GPs found themselves once again on the front line. PURPOSE OF RESEARCH: To analyze the practices of general practitioners in situations of uncertainty in the context of these extraordinary events, namely an industrial fire and a viral pandemic. METHODS: Eighteen general practitioners were interviewed between February and July 2019 in semi-structured interviews conducted by a pair of researchers (sociologist and GP). An analysis inspired by the grounded theory was carried out on three levels (individual thematic analysis, paired confrontation, and collective restitution). CONCLUSION: In the health crisis contexts studied, GPs were confronted with more recurrent complaints while they had relatively little robust knowledge on which to base their responses. Finally, physicians responded to these situations of high uncertainty by drawing in original ways on their personal experiences of these crises.","output":"[The practice of general medicine in the face of health crises: from Lubrizol to COVID]./ L'exercice de la mdecine gnrale  l'preuve des crises sanitaires : de Lubrizol  la COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: to carry out a theoretical reflection on the Nursing Now Campaign and the experience of the unexpected irruptions facing the pandemic period.

RESULTS: the universe of phenomena is simultaneously composed of order, disorder and organization. Reasserting the central role of Nursing in the health team, facing the irruptions and uncertainties caused by the current pandemic, implies the ability to dialog with disorder and raise a new and more complex global (re)organization of the being and doing Nursing.

Thus, the role of social contacts in the spread of infectious disease is often treated as an assumption in disease simulation studies, and few studies have empirically demonstrated how pathogens spread through social networks. In JulyCAugust 2015, an outbreak of respiratory disease was observed in a wild chimpanzee community in Kibale National Park, Uganda, during an ongoing behavioral study of male chimpanzees, offering a rare opportunity to evaluate how social behavior affects individual exposure to socially transmissible diseases. From May to August 2015, we identified adult and adolescent male chimpanzees displaying coughs and rhinorrhea and recorded 5-m proximity data on males (N = 40). Using the network k-test, we found significant relationships between male network connectivity and the distribution of cases within the network, supporting the importance of short-distance contacts for the spread of the respiratory outbreak. Additionally, chimpanzees central to the network were more likely to display clinical signs than those with fewer connections. Although our analyses were limited to male chimpanzees, these findings underscore the value of social connectivity data in predicting disease outcomes and elucidate a potential evolutionary cost of being social.

Measures to correct bad practices have mainly been introduced by private actors. However, there is increased demand for state intervention, particularly regarding trade regulations for fish and other agricultural products. Building on discussions about product differentiation through trade measures that favour sustainable products, this study looked at how sustainable and unsustainable fish has been distinguished in Switzerland. In interviewing experts in the fish trade and sales business in Switzerland, the research aimed at understanding the actors and forces that shape the concept of sustainable fish in the country. RESULTS: Three ways of product differentiation for sustainable fish by private actors were identified in Switzerland: ecolabels, Swiss produce, and recommendations in the form of a consumer guide for fish. Currently, price is the main constraint on consumption of sustainable products in the country. Defining sustainable fish is challenging and subject to interpretation. All existing measures to differentiate sustainable from unsustainable fish products in Switzerland have shortcomings, particularly in terms of discrimination and inclusiveness. Fish ecolabels play a key role in product differentiation, but experts believe that they fail to accommodate all aspects of sustainability. CONCLUSION: Our findings imply that the Swiss state should play a more important role if it aims to fulfil the promise of article 104a of the Swiss Constitution, which seeks to foster sustainable production and cross-border trade relations that contribute towards this goal. Preferred trade treatment for sustainable fish products is a potential option to increase the production and consumption of sustainable fish. When designing measures for product differentiation, a careful choice is paramount to address sustainability in a holistic, inclusive, and transparent way and in order not to violate existing trade obligations. Due to similarities between the Swiss and other fish markets, we assume that governments in general and members of the European Union in particular must play an active role in shaping the definition and trade of sustainable fish products if they seek to comply with their sustainability commitments.

By examining the rise of measles cases following disinformation campaigns connected to the US 2016 presidential elections, the rise of disinformation in the current novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and the impact of misinformation on public health interventions during the 2014-2016 West Africa and 2019-2020 Democratic Republic of the Congo Ebola outbreaks, we ask whether the potential impact of these campaigns-which includes the undermining of sociopolitical systems, the delegitimization of public health and scientific bodies, and the diversion of the public health response-can be characterized as analogous to the impacts of more traditional conceptions of biowarfare. In this paper, we look at these different impacts and the norms related to the use of biological weapons and cyber campaigns. By doing so, we anticipate the advent of a combined cyber and biological warfare. The latter is not dependent on the existence of a manufactured biological weapon; it manages to undermine sociopolitical systems and public health through the weaponization of naturally occurring outbreaks.","output":"Disinformation and Epidemics: Anticipating the Next Phase of Biowarfare."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spatiotemporal variation of several carbapenemase-encoding genes (CRGs) was investigated in the influent and effluent of municipal WWTPs, with or without hospital sewage input. Correlations among gene abundances, bacterial community composition, and wastewater quality parameters were tested to identify possible predictors of CRGs presence. Also, the possible role of wastewaters in mirroring clinical resistance is discussed. The taxonomic groups and gene abundances showed an even distribution among wastewater types, meaning that hospital sewage does not influence the microbial diversity and the CRG pool. The bacterial community was composed mainly of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Patescibacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Acinetobacter spp. was the most abundant group and had the majority of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) positively correlated with CRGs. This agrees with recent reports on clinical data. The influent samples were dominated by bla(KPC), as opposed to effluent, where bla(IMP) was dominant. Also, bla(IMP) was the most frequent CRG family observed to correlate with bacterial taxa, especially with the Mycobacterium genus in effluent samples. Bacterial load, bla(NDM), bla(KPC), and bla(OXA-48) abundances were positively correlated with BOD(5), TSS, HEM, Cr, Cu, and Fe concentrations in wastewaters. When influent gene abundance values were converted into population equivalent (PE) data, the highest copies/1 PE were identified for bla(KPC) and bla(OXA-48), agreeing with previous studies regarding clinical isolates. Both hospital and non-hospital-type samples followed a similar temporal trend of CRG incidence, but with differences among gene groups. Colder seasons favored the presence of bla(NDM), bla(KPC) and bla(OXA-48), whereas warmer temperatures show increased PE values for bla(VIM) and bla(IMP). IMPORTANCE Wastewater-based epidemiology has recently been recognized as a valuable, cost-effective tool for antimicrobial resistance surveillance. It can help gain insights into the characteristics and distribution of antibiotic resistance elements at a local, national, and even global scale. In this study, we investigated the possible use of municipal wastewaters in the surveillance of clinically relevant carbapenemase-encoding genes (CRGs), seen as critical antibiotic resistance determinants. In this matter, our results highlight positive correlations among CRGs, microbial diversity, and wastewater physical and chemical parameters. Identified predictors can provide valuable data regarding the level of raw and treated wastewater contamination with these important antibiotic resistance genes. Also, wastewater-based gene abundances were used for the first time to observe possible spatiotemporal trends of CRGs incidence in the general population. Therefore, possible hot spots of carbapenem resistance could be easily identified at the community level, surpassing the limitations of health care-associated settings.","output":"Municipal Wastewaters Carry Important Carbapenemase Genes Independent of Hospital Input and Can Mirror Clinical Resistance Patterns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND E-science technologies have significantly increased the availability of data. Research grant providers such as the European Union increasingly require open access publishing of research results and data. However, despite its significance to research, the adoption rate of open data technology remains low across all disciplines, especially in Europe where research has primarily focused on technical solutions (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework) or considered only parts of the issue. METHODS AND FINDINGS In this study, we emphasized the non-technical factors perceived value and uncertainty factors in the context of academia, which impact researchers' acceptance of open data-the idea that researchers should not only publish their findings in the form of articles or reports, but also share the corresponding raw data sets. We present the results of a broad quantitative analysis including N = 995 researchers from 13 large to medium-sized universities in Germany. In order to test 11 hypotheses regarding researchers' intentions to share their data, as well as detect any hierarchical or disciplinary differences, we employed a structured equation model (SEM) following the partial least squares (PLS) modeling approach. CONCLUSIONS Grounded in the value-based theory, this article proclaims that most individuals in academia embrace open data when the perceived advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Furthermore, uncertainty factors impact the perceived value (consisting of the perceived advantages and disadvantages) of sharing research data. We found that researchers' assumptions about effort required during the data preparation process were diminished by awareness of e-science technologies (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework), which also increased their tendency to perceive personal benefits via data exchange.

We undertook a program of work to strengthen RHD primordial and primary prevention using a model addressing six domains: housing and environmental support, community awareness and empowerment, health literacy, health and education service integration, health navigation and health provider education. Our aim is to determine how the model was experienced by study participants. METHODS: This is a two-year, outreach-to-household, pragmatic intervention implemented by Aboriginal Community Workers in three remote communities. The qualitative component was shaped by Participatory Action Research. Yarning sessions and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 individuals affected by, or working with, ARF/RHD. 31 project field reports were collated. We conducted a hybrid inductive-deductive thematic analysis guided by critical theory. RESULTS: Aboriginal Community Workers were best placed to support two of the six domains: housing and environmental health support and health navigation. This was due to trusting relationships between ACWs and families and the authority attributed to ACWs through the project. ACWs improved health literacy and supported awareness and empowerment; but this was limited by disease complexities. Consequently, ACWs requested more training to address knowledge gaps and improve knowledge transfer to families. ACWs did not have skills to provide health professionals with education or ensure health and education services participated in ARF/RHD. Where knowledge gain among participant family members was apparent, motivation or structural capability to implement behaviour change was lacking in some domains, even though the model was intended to support structural changes through care navigation and housing fixes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first multi-site effort in northern Australia to strengthen primordial and primary prevention of RHD. Community-led programs are central to the overarching strategy to eliminate RHD. Future implementation should support culturally safe relationships which build the social capital required to address social determinants of health and enable holistic ways to support sustainable individual and community-level actions.

Surveillance for early detection of RVF virus circulation implies very low design prevalence values and thus sampling a high number of animals, so feasibility issues may rise. Passive surveillance based on notified abortions in ruminants is key for early warning and at present the only feasible surveillance option. The assessment of vaccination and culling against RVF in Mayotte suggests that vaccination is more effective when quickly implemented throughout the population, e.g. at a rate of 200 or 2,000 animals vaccinated per day. Test and cull is not an option for RVF control in Mayotte given the high number of animals that would need to be tested. If the risk of RVFV introduction into the continental EU increases, ruminant establishments close to possible points of disease incursion should be included in the surveillance. An enhanced surveillance on reproductive disorders should be applied during summer in risk areas. Serosurveillance targets of 0.3% animals should be at least considered. RVF control measures possibly applied in the continental EU have been assessed in the Netherlands, as an example. Culling animals on farms within a 20 km radius of detected farms appears as the most effective measure to control RVF spread, although too many animals should be culled. Alternative measures are vaccination in a 50 km radius around detection, ring vaccination between 20 and 50 km and culling of detected farms. The assessment of zoning showed that, following RVFV introduction and considering an R(0) = 2, a mean vector dispersal of 10 km and 10 farms initially detected, RVFV would spread beyond a radius of up to 100 km or 50 km from the infected area with 10% or 55% probability, respectively.","output":"Rift Valley Fever C assessment of effectiveness of surveillance and control measures in the EU"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Despite recommendations to exclusively breastfeed for the first 6 months of an infant's life with subsequent introduction of complementary foods through the infant's first year, breastfeeding rates decrease significantly over the first 6 months of life.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the association between TTS and preoperative disease progression in tumor size or nodal status among women diagnosed with clinical T1N0M0 ductal breast cancer. METHODS: Women diagnosed with clinical T1N0M0 ductal breast cancer who had breast-conserving surgery as their first definitive treatment between 2010 and 2016 (n = 90,405) were analyzed using the National Cancer Database. Separate multivariable logistic regression models for hormone receptor (HR)-positive and HR-negative patients, adjusted for clinical and demographic variables, were used to assess the relationship between TTS and upstaging of tumor size (T-upstaging) or nodal status (N-upstaging). RESULTS: T-upstaging occurred in 6.76% of HR-positive patients and 11.00% of HR-negative patients, while N-upstaging occurred in 12.69% and 10.75% of HR-positive and HR-negative patients, respectively. Among HR-positive patients, odds of T-upstaging were higher for 61C90 days TTS (odds ratio [OR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05C1.34) and 91 days TTS (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.17C1.84) compared with 30 days TTS, and odds of N- upstaging were higher for 91 days TTS (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13C1.62). No association between TTS and either T- or N-upstaging was found among HR-negative patients. Other clinical and demographic variables, including grade, tumor location, and race/ethnicity, were associated with both T- and N-upstaging. CONCLUSION: TTS 61 and 91 days was a significant predictor of T- and N-upstaging, respectively, in HR-positive patients; however, TTS was not associated with upstaging in HR-negative breast cancer. Delays in surgery may contribute to measurable disease progression in T1N0M0 ductal breast cancer.","output":"Prolonged Time from Diagnosis to Breast-Conserving Surgery is Associated with Upstaging in Hormone Receptor-Positive Invasive Ductal Breast Carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deaths from COVID-19 continue to increase globally the diversity of management strategies during the pandemic has resulted in high rates of local transmission.

In rural areas, population-wide implementation of Stroke Units is challenging. Therefore, the TeleMedical Project for integrative Stroke Care (TEMPiS) was established in 2003 as a TeleStroke Unit network to overcome this barrier in Southeast Bavaria/Germany. Evaluation of its implementation between 2003 and 2005 had revealed improved process quality and clinical outcomes compared with matched hospitals without TeleStroke Units. Data on sustainability of these effects are lacking. METHODS Effects on the stroke care of the local population were analyzed by using data from official hospital reports. Prospective registries from 2003 to 2012 describe processes and outcomes of consecutive patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack treated in TEMPiS hospitals. Quality indicators assess diagnostics, treatment, and outcome. Rates and timeliness of intravenous thrombolysis as well as data on teleconsultations and secondary interhospital transfers were reported over time. RESULTS Within the covered area, network implementation increased the number of patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack treated in hospitals with (Tele-)Stroke Units substantially from 19% to 78%. Between February 2003 and December 2012, 54 804 strokes and transient ischemic attacks were treated in 15 regional hospitals, and 31 864 teleconsultations were performed. Intravenous thrombolysis was applied 3331 stroke cases with proportions increasing from 2.6% to 15.5% of all patients with ischemic stroke. Median onset-to-treatment times decreased from 150 (interquartile range, 127-163) to 120 minutes (interquartile range, 90-160) and door-to-needle times from 80 (interquartile range, 68-101) to 40 minutes (interquartile range, 29-59).

METHODS: Bibliometric analysis was conducted using the database of Web of Science Core Collection. The literature published in 1985C2021 was screened and selected. The overall profile description, citation analysis, and research hotspot mining were performed using the citation report of Clarivate Analytics, bibliometrics online platform, and VOSviewer software. The bibliometric results and profiles were plotted and illustrated. RESULTS: The bibliometric analysis of 485 papers of interest showed that the research frontier was continuously expanding; especially the institutions from the USA were the main contributors. The numbers of citing papers have been ascending, and a considerable part of citations were from the areas other than the education research. Mining results showed that the in-school and residency education of pharmacy postgraduates was a research hotspot, as well as interprofessional training and new education styles for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapy were the emerging trends in the field. CONCLUSION: Through the analysis of the studies, it was found that encouraging relevant research programs, establishing financial supports, and launching specified publication sources could be helpful to boost the development of pharmaceutical sciences/pharmacy postgraduate education.

This study aimed to investigate potential and practical biomarkers that could assist in predicting mortality at the presentation in a group of elderly and non-elderly patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 1820 COVID-19 patients hospitalized for treatment. Clinical and mortality data as well as certain hematological and inflammatory parameters were retrieved from records. For analysis, patients were divided into two groups as geriatric (age 65 years) and non-geriatric subjects. The associated factors of the parameters on mortality were examined separately for elderly and younger patients. Results: Following multivariate analysis, high neutrophil count and high troponin T levels emerged as significant independent predictors of mortality in both geriatric patients and younger patients. Low and high monocyte count was associated with increased mortality risk for geriatric and younger patients, respectively. In the geriatric population, high ferritin levels and high RBC count was associated with increased risk, but increased eosinophil count was associated with decreased risk. Low lymphocyte count emerged as a predictor of mortality among younger patients. Conclusion: Several hematological and inflammatory parameters and indices may assist in predicting the mortality risk in patients with COVID-19;however, there appears to be some differences in terms of these predictors of mortality between elderly and younger patients.

The findings reveal that booster vaccination significantly increased anti-spike, anti-receptor binding domain, and neutralization titers above the pre-booster levels in almost all NH residents and HCW to significantly higher levels than shortly after the completion of the initial vaccine series. These data support the CDC recommendation to offer vaccine boosters to HCWs and NH residents on an immunological basis.

Many of these glycoproteins, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) protein form trimeric units in the membrane of the native virion. There is substantial experimental and pre-clinical evidence showing that the S protein is a promising lead for vaccines and therapeutics. Previously we generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to whole inactivated SARS-CoV which neutralize the virus in vitro. Here, we define their specificity and affinity, map several of their epitopes and lastly characterise chimeric versions of them. Our data show that the neutralizing mAbs bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS S protein. Three of the chimeric mAbs retain their binding specificity while one conformational mAb, F26G19, lost its ability to bind the S protein despite high level expression. The affinity for recombinant S is maintained in all of the functional chimeric versions of the parental mAbs. Both parental mAb F26G18 and the chimeric version neutralize the TO R2 strain of SARS-CoV with essentially identical titres (2.07 and 2.47 nM, respectively). Lastly, a comparison with other neutralizing mAbs to SARS-CoV clearly shows that the dominance of a 33 amino acid residue loop of the SARS-CoV RBD is independent of repertoire, species, quaternary structure, and importantly, the technology used to derive the mAbs. In cases like this, the dominance of a compact RBD antigenic domain and the central role of the S protein in pathogenesis may inherently create immunoselection pressure on viruses to evolve more complex evasion strategies or die out of a host species. The apparent simplicity of the mechanism of SARS-CoV neutralization is in stark contrast to the complexity shown by other enveloped viruses.","output":"Neutralizing epitopes of the SARS-CoV S-protein cluster independent of repertoire, antigen structure or mAb technology."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly instigated a global pandemic. Vaccine development is proceeding at an unprecedented pace. Once available, it will be important to maximize vaccine uptake and coverage. OBJECTIVE: To assess intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 among a representative sample of adults in the United States and identify predictors of and reasons for vaccine hesitancy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey, fielded from 16 through 20 April 2020. SETTING: Representative sample of adults residing in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Approximately 1000 adults drawn from the AmeriSpeak probability-based research panel, covering approximately 97% of the U.S. household population. MEASUREMENTS: Intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 was measured with the question, \\"When a vaccine for the coronavirus becomes available, will you get vaccinated?\\" Response options were \\"yes,\\" \\"no,\\" and \\"not sure.\\" Participants who responded \\"no\\" or \\"not sure\\" were asked to provide a reason. RESULTS: A total of 991 AmeriSpeak panel members responded. Overall, 57.6% of participants (n = 571) intended to be vaccinated, 31.6% (n = 313) were not sure, and 10.8% (n = 107) did not intend to be vaccinated. Factors independently associated with vaccine hesitancy (a response of \\"no\\" or \\"not sure\\") included younger age, Black race, lower educational attainment, and not having received the influenza vaccine in the prior year. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy included vaccine-specific concerns, a need for more information, antivaccine attitudes or beliefs, and a lack of trust. LIMITATIONS: Participants' intent to be vaccinated was explored before a vaccine was available and when the pandemic was affecting a narrower swath of the United States. Questions about specific information or factors that might increase vaccination acceptance were not included. The survey response rate was 16.1%. CONCLUSION: This national survey, conducted during the coronavirus pandemic, revealed that approximately 3 in 10 adults were not sure they would accept vaccination and 1 in 10 did not intend to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Targeted and multipronged efforts will be needed to increase acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available.

This pattern urges researchers to investigate the aging concept further to produce successful anti-aging agents. In the current study, the effects of Zingerone (a natural compound) on epidermal tissues were analyzed using a bioinformatics approach. METHODS: For this purpose, we chose the GEO dataset GSE133338 to carry out the systems biology and systems pharmacology approaches, ranging from identifying the differentially expressed genes to analyzing the gene ontology, determining similar structures of Zingerone and their features (i.e., anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and skin disorders), constructing the geneCchemicals network, analyzing geneCdisease relationships, and validating significant genes through the evidence presented in the literature. RESULTS: The post-processing of the microarray dataset identified thirteen essential genes among control and Zingerone-treated samples. The procedure revealed various structurally similar chemical and herbal compounds with possible skin-related effects. Additionally, we studied the relationships of differentially expressed genes with skin-related diseases and validated their direct connections with skin disorders the evidence available in the literature. Also, the analysis of the microarray profiling dataset revealed the critical role of interleukins as a part of the cytokines family on skin aging progress. CONCLUSIONS: Zingerone, and potentially any constituents of Zingerone (e.g., their similar compound scan functionality), can be used as therapeutic agents in managing skin disorders such as skin aging.

We analyzed data from 967 participants of the InCHIANTI study, a community-dwelling cohort in the Chianti region, Italy. Relative abundance of ACE2 in plasma was assessed using a proteomics platform. CVD diagnoses, use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists: ACEi, ARBs, and aldosterone antagonists, were ascertained. Multiple linear analyses were performed to examine the independent association of ACE2 with age, CVD, and RAAS antagonist use. Age was independently associated with lower log (ACE2) in persons aged &#8805; 55 years (STD ? = - 0.12, p = 0.0002). ACEi treatment was also independently associated with significantly lower ACE2 levels, and ACE2 was inversely associated with weight, and positively associated with peripheral artery disease (PAD) status. There was a trend toward higher circulating ACE2 levels in hypertensive individuals, but it did not reach statistical significance. In a stratified analysis, the association between log (ACE2) and log (IL-6) was more evidenced in participants with PAD. Circulating ACE2 levels demonstrate curvilinear association with age, with older individuals beyond the sixth decade age having lower levels. ACEi was associated with greater circulating ACE2 levels. Interestingly, ACE2 was elevated in PAD and positively associated with inflammatory markers, suggesting compensatory upregulation in the setting of chronic inflammation.

With animal models, like the pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in rats, it is possible to reduce the environmental effects and the genetic heterogeneity to identify chromosomal regions harboring genes responsible for the arthritis development. The PIA model has proved to be useful for identifying gene regions controlling different phases of the disease based on intercrosses between the resistant E3 and the susceptible DA rat. We have now performed a high-powered backcross analysis that confirms previous intercross-based data but also identifies additional loci. Earlier identified PIA loci were reproduced with high significance; Pia1 (MHC region on chromosome 20), Pia4 (chromosome 12), and Pia7 (chromosome 4) are all major regulators of PIA severity and were also found to operate in concert. These three loci were verified in congenic strains using both disease- and arthritis-inflammatory-related subphenotypes as traits. We were also able to detect five new quantitative trait loci with dominant effects on PIA: Pia10, Pia12, Pia13, Pia14, and Pia15 on chromosomes 10, 6, 7, 8, and 18, respectively.

METHODS: All cardiovascular patients in a single Chinese cardiology center that were admitted from January to December 2019 were reviewed. The clinical characteristics of those with HDL-C<20 mg/dL were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 20,655 individuals were enrolled. Of these, 52.17 % were males, and the average age was 58.20  12.98 years old. The prevalence of HDL-C<20 mg/dL was 0.47 % for all patients (N=98) and 1.05 % for inpatients. Of those with HDL-C<20 mg/dL, 88.8 % were inpatients, and 77.6 % were males. Their average age was 60.7  15.1 years.

METHODS ESCAPE-NA1 was a multicenter international randomized trial of nerinetide versus placebo in 1105 patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent endovascular treatment. We defined tandem occlusions as complete occlusion of the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) on catheter angiography, in addition to a proximal ipsilateral intracranial large vessel occlusion. Baseline characteristics and outcome parameters were compared between patients with tandem occlusions versus those without, and between patients with tandem occlusion who underwent ICA stenting versus those who did not. The influence of tandem occlusions on functional outcome was analyzed using multivariable regression modeling. RESULTS Among 115/1105 patients (10.4%) with tandem occlusions, 62 (53.9%) received stenting for the cervical ICA occlusion. Of these, 46 (74.2%) were stented after and 16 (25.8%) before the intracranial thrombectomy. A modified Rankin Score (mRS) of 0-2 at 90 days was achieved in 82/115 patients (71.3%) with tandem occlusions compared with 579/981 (59.5%) patients without tandem occlusions.

Every week, a lecture covered the necessary background information to identify the current research questions and prepare students for reading the assigned research article. Students completed an analysis worksheet prior to the subsequent class, and a summary presentation followed by a student-led critical analysis discussion occurred in class. Small student groups completed an in-class thought exercise that designed several experiments that built on the articles data. The modular course design enabled a quick and successful transition to an online asynchronous modality in less than two weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A recorded weekly lecture was posted online by the instructor, and students completed the analysis worksheet, watched a student-recorded summary presentation, and posted to a discussion board.

Despite the urgent need, we still do not fully understand the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and its ability to antagonize innate immune responses. Here, we use RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling along SARS-CoV-2 infection and comprehensively define the mechanisms that are utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to shutoff cellular protein synthesis. We show SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a global reduction in translation but that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated. Instead, we reveal that infection leads to accelerated degradation of cytosolic cellular mRNAs which facilitates viral takeover of the mRNA pool in infected cells. Moreover, we show that the translation of transcripts whose expression is induced in response to infection, including innate immune genes, is impaired, implying infection prevents newly transcribed cellular mRNAs from accessing the ribosomes. Overall, our results uncover the multipronged strategy employed by SARS-CoV-2 to commandeer the translation machinery and to suppress host defenses.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 utilizes a multipronged strategy to suppress host protein synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores how extravagantly visible mask-wearing relates with consumer culture. Methodologically, three purposively chosen case studies of spectacular or performative mask-wearing are used to show what the face mask can teach us about consumer culture in a pandemic. First, a Daily Mail (UK) article in which an elderly shopper is shamed for wearing a sanitary towel as a face mask is used to explore the politics of disposable commodities. Second, the multiplying portraits of people wearing masks archived under Instagrams #MaskSelfie hashtag allows an examination of how consumer-citizenship is performed. Third, the presence of extremely expensive luxury designer masks, as evidenced by Rich Mnisis Swarovski-encrusted offering, is a base for considering how virtue signalling has become a platform for luxury branding. Building on these three examples, the argument is made that waste, selfies and luxury are modalities for a pandemic commodity politics that is layered over and into the scientific citizenship signalled by the wearing of face masks. Together these create what I call a sci-commodity sensibility, in which the face mask as a technology has become integrated with the modalities of consumption.

The first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were recorded in Ghana on March 12, 2020. Since then, the country has been combatting countrywide community spread. This report describes how the Virology Department, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR) is supporting the Ghana Health Service (GHS) to diagnose infections with this virus in Ghana. Methods: The National Influenza Centre (NIC) in the Virology Department of the NMIMR, adopted real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) assays for the diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 in January 2020. Samples from suspected cases and contact tracing across Ghana were received and processed for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were 'pooled' to enable simultaneous batch testing of samples without reduced sensitivity. Outcomes: From February 3 to August 21, the NMIMR processed 283 946 (10%) samples. Highest number of cases were reported in June when the GHS embarked on targeted contact tracing which led to an increase in number of samples processed daily, peaking at over 7,000 samples daily. There were several issues to overcome including rapid consumption of reagents and consumables. Testing however continued successfully due to revised procedures, additional equipment and improved pipeline of laboratory supplies. Test results are now provided within 24 to 48 hours of sample submission enabling more effective response and containment. Conclusion: Following the identification of the first cases of SARS-CoV-2infection by the NMIMR, the Institute has trained other centres and supported the ramping up of molecular testing capacity in Ghana. This provides a blueprint to enable Ghana to mitigate further epidemics and pandemics. Funding: The laboratory work was supported with materials from the Ghana Health Service Ministry of Health, the US Naval Medical Research Unit #3, the World Health Organization, the Jack Ma Foundation and the University of Ghana Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research. Other research projects hosted by the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research contributed reagents and laboratory consumables.

Access to hospitals has been divided between a separate COVID and non-COVID route in order to avoid contamination. Telemedicine has become a daily way of communicating between doctors and patients.

We therefore tested 2 hypotheses: (1) that diabetics show a greater increase from preoperative to intraoperative glucose concentrations than nondiabetics; and (2) that steroid administration increases intraoperative hyperglycemia more so in diabetics compared with nondiabetics. METHODS Patients scheduled for major noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled and randomized to preoperative IV 8 mg dexamethasone or placebo, stratified by diagnosis of diabetes. Patients were part of a larger underlying trial (the Dexamethasone, Light Anesthesia and Tight Glucose Control [DeLiT] Trial). IV insulin was given when glucose concentration exceeded 215 mg/dL. The primary outcome measure was the change in glucose from the preoperative to maximal intraoperative glucose concentration. We also report the time-dependent pattern of intraoperative hyperglycemia. RESULTS Ninety patients (23% with diabetes) were randomized to dexamethasone, and 95 (29% with diabetes) were given placebo. The mean  SD change from preoperative to maximal intraoperative glucose concentration was 63  69 mg/dL in diabetics and 72  45 mg/dL in nondiabetics. The mean covariable-adjusted change (95% confidence interval) in nondiabetics was 29 (13, 46) mg/dL more than in diabetics (P < 0.001). For all patients combined, mean glucose increased slightly from preoperative to incision, substantially from incision to surgery midpoint, and then remained high and fairly stable through emergence, with nondiabetic patients showing a greater increase (P < 0.001). For nondiabetics, the mean increase in glucose concentration (97.5% CI) was 29 (9, 49) mg/dL more in patients given dexamethasone than placebo (P = 0.0012). However, there was no dexamethasone effect in diabetics (P = 0.99). CONCLUSIONS Treatment of intraoperative hyperglycemia should account for the hyperglycemic surgical stress response trend depending on the stage of surgery as well as the added effects of steroid administration. Denying steroid prophylaxis for postoperative nausea and vomiting for fear of hyperglycemic response should be reconsidered given the limited effect of steroids on intraoperative blood glucose concentrations.","output":"The hyperglycemic response to major noncardiac surgery and the added effect of steroid administration in patients with and without diabetes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of the species of Giardia duodenalis species and the genus Cryptosporidium spp. in dairy calves at different ages during the post-weaning phase in a herd located in Boa Esperan?a, South of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, during the fallwinter season.

There are four dengue serotypes (DENV1 to DENV4), and infection with one elicits lifelong immunity to that serotype but offers only transient protection against the other serotypes. Identification of the protective determinants of the human antibody response to DENV is a vital requirement for the design and evaluation of future preventative therapies and treatments. Here, we describe the isolation of a neutralizing antibody from a DENV1-infected patient. The human antibody 14c10 (HM14c10) binds specifically to DENV1. HM14c10 neutralizes the virus principally by blocking virus attachment; at higher concentrations, a post-attachment step can also be inhibited. In vivo studies show that the HM14c10 antibody has antiviral activity at picomolar concentrations. A 7 ? resolution cryoelectron microscopy map of Fab fragments of HM14c10 in a complex with DENV1 shows targeting of a discontinuous epitope that spans the adjacent surface of envelope protein dimers. As found previously, a human antibody specific for the related West Nile virus binds to a similar quaternary structure, suggesting that this could be an immunodominant epitope.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate changes in mortality from causes associated with social stress during the pandemic in Moscow. The analysis is based on the Rosstat statistics and RFS-EMIAS database (Medical death certificates issued by the Moscow health institutions) in 2019-2020. Deaths from mental disorders and suicides during the maximum and minimum excess mortality in Moscow in 2020 were compared to 2019 (May and December, when mortality exceeded the 2019 indicators by 57.2% and 56.7%, and July with the 7.1%) excess. First, the excess mortality from mental disorders in these months was almost entirely due to disorders related to alcohol and drug abuse. Second, alcohol and drug abuse also results in deaths from poisoning. This necessitates a joint evaluation of deaths associated with alcohol and drugs (from mental disorders and poisoning). The evaluation shows that excess deaths from alcohol abuse in men in May 2020 compared to May 2019 equaled to 65%, falling down to 52.3% in July, followed by its maximum (2.5-fold) in December. Females show a steady increase: 52.9%, 76.5% and 2.1-fold, respectively. Distribution by sex of the total deaths associated with drug addiction (mental disorders and poisoning) was reversed: a steady increase in males (55.4% in May, 67% in July and 2.1-fold in December) and a significant decrease in females: 63.6%, 31.6% and 2.7-fold, respectively. Third, the pandemic has paradoxically affected deaths from suicide (including hangings, falls and undetermined intent poisoning). In men, excess deaths equaled to zero in May, 1.2% in July and decreased by 20.6% in December. The female excess suicidal mortality increased: 13.5%, 30.6% and 36.7%, respectively.

Other factors, including strain on health care systems, may also have had an indirect toll. OBJECTIVES: This investigation aimed to evaluate whether population-level deaths due to cardiovascular causes increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The authors conducted an observational cohort study using data from the National Center for Health Statistics to evaluate the rate of deaths due to cardiovascular causes after the onset of the pandemic in the United States, from March 18, 2020, to June 2, 2020, relative to the period immediately preceding the pandemic (January 1, 2020 to March 17, 2020). Changes in deaths were compared with the same periods in the previous year. RESULTS: There were 397,042 cardiovascular deaths from January 1, 2020, to June 2, 2020.

This study aims to compare the critical mineral resources-magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca) and potassium (K)-in biological materials (scalp hair, blood, and serum) of 87 Ewing Sarcoma (ES) hypertensive men and women, age range 31-60 years, in an urban area, with 62 nonhypertensive subjects from the same age range and living area. METHODS An atomic-absorption spectrophotometer was used after microwave-induced acid digestion to determine elemental concentrations. The results' authenticity and precision were verified using a traditional wet acid digestion procedure and accredited reference materials. The average convalesces from all elements have been within the 99.2%-99.7% of certified values. RESULTS In the biological samples from patients with ES hypertension, the amount of Na was found to be higher than in controls. Patients with ES hypertension had lower Mg, K, and Ca levels in their biological samples (scalp hair and blood) than healthy controls of both genders. CONCLUSIONS Ca, Mg, and K deficiency can work with other ES hypertension risk factors. These findings will help physicians and other healthcare professionals determine the depletion of essential micronutrients in the biological samples (blood and scalp hair) of patients with hypertension. After microwave-induced acid digestion, the elemental concentration was determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The results' authenticity and precision were confirmed using a traditional wet-acid digestion procedure and accredited oriented materials. The average recoveries from all elements have been within the 99.2%-99.7% of certified values.","output":"Determination the level of essential elements in patients with Ewing Sarcoma: A correlation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In biopharmaceutical manufacturing, fermentation processes play a critical role on productivity and profit. A fermentation process uses living cells with complex biological mechanisms, and this leads to high variability in the process outputs. By building on the biological mechanisms of protein and impurity growth, we introduce a stochastic model to characterize the accumulation of the protein and impurity levels in the fermentation process. However, a common challenge in industry is the availability of only very limited amount of data especially in the development and early stage of production. This adds an additional layer of uncertainty, referred to as model risk, due to the difficulty of estimating the model parameters with limited data. In this paper, we study the harvesting decision for a fermentation process under model risk. In particular, we adopt a Bayesian approach to update the unknown parameters of the growth-rate distributions, and use the resulting posterior distributions to characterize the impact of model risk on fermentation output variability. The harvesting problem is formulated as a Markov decision process model with knowledge states that summarize the posterior distributions and hence incorporate the model risk in decision-making. The resulting model is solved by using a reinforcement learning algorithm based on Bayesian sparse sampling. We provide analytical results on the structure of the optimal policy and its objective function, and explicitly study the impact of model risk on harvesting decisions. Our case studies at MSD Animal Health demonstrate that the proposed model and solution approach improve the harvesting decisions in real life by achieving substantially higher average output from a fermentation batch along with lower batch-to-batch variability.","output":"Optimizing Biomanufacturing Harvesting Decisions under Limited Historical Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blood transfusion utilization continues to rise, yet it has never undergone prospective safety and efficacy testing.

This paper examines these trade-offs by putting the recent debt boom into a historical context. It reports three major findings. First, during the 2020 global recession, both global government and private debt levels rose to record highs, and at their fastest single-year pace, in five decades. Second, the debt-financed, massive fiscal support programs implemented during the pandemic supported activity and illustrated the benefits of accumulating debt. However, as the recovery gains traction, the balance of benefits and costs of debt accumulation could increasingly tilt toward costs. Third, more than two-thirds of emerging market and developing economies are currently in government debt booms. On average, the current booms have already lasted three years longer, and are accompanied by a considerably larger fiscal deterioration, than earlier booms. About half of the earlier debt booms were associated with financial crises in emerging market and developing economies.","output":"A mountain of debt: Navigating the legacy of the pandemic (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background CT may play a central role in the diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Purpose To perform a longitudinal study to analyze the serial CT findings over time in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods During January 16 to February 17, 2020, 90 patients (33 men, 57 women; mean age, 45 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively enrolled and followed up until being discharged, death, or the end of the study. A total of 366 CT scans were acquired and reviewed by two groups of radiologists for the patterns and distribution of lung abnormalities, total CT scores, and number of zones involved. Those features were analyzed for temporal change. Results CT scores and number of zones involved progressed rapidly, peaked during illness days 6-11 (median CT score, 5; median number of zones involved, five), and were followed by persistence of high levels. The predominant pattern of abnormalities after symptom onset was ground-glass opacity (35 of 78 scans [45%] to 49 of 79 scans [62%] in different periods). The percentage of mixed pattern peaked on illness days 12-17 (30 of 78 scans [38%]) and became the second most predominant pattern thereafter. Pure ground-glass opacity was the most prevalent subtype of ground-glass opacity after symptom onset (20 of 50 scans [40%] to 20 of 28 scans [71%]). The percentage of ground-glass opacity with irregular linear opacity peaked on illness days 6-11 (14 of 50 scans [28%]) and became the second most prevalent subtype thereafter. The distribution of lesions was predominantly bilateral and subpleural. Sixty-six of the 70 patients discharged (94%) had residual disease on final CT scans (median CT score, 4; median number of zones involved, four), with ground-glass opacity (42 of 70 patients [60%]) and pure ground-glass opacity (31 of 42 patients [74%]) the most common pattern and subtype. Conclusion The extent of lung abnormalities at CT peaked during illness days 6-11. The temporal changes of the diverse CT manifestations followed a specific pattern, which might indicate the progression and recovery of the illness. ?

While chemosensory dysfunction has been associated with eating disorders, the relationship is poorly understood. This systematic review aims to characterize psychophysical gustation and olfaction in patients with eating disorders. METHODS Systematic review of investigations assessing psychophysical chemosensory function in patients with organic eating disorders. RESULTS 26 studies were included. Five studies assessed both chemosenses, while 12 and 9 assessed exclusively gustation or olfaction, respectively. In total, 779 patients were included [72.4% anorexia nervosa (AN), 26.7% bulimia nervosa (BN), 0.8% combined AN/BN]. Patients with eating disorders experienced rates of hypogeusia up to 87% in AN and 84.6% in BN. There was evidence for alterations in psychophysical olfaction, but orientation of trends were less clear. Chemosensory dysfunction was more evident in AN patients. Treatment correlated with improved chemosensory function. CONCLUSIONS Despite heterogeneity in study methodology and results, this review demonstrates that patients with eating disorders experience some degree of chemosensory dysfunction, particularly in gustation. This symptomatology overlaps with those experienced by patients with other causes of chemosensory impairment.

This kind of question is appropriate for public health responses and it will depend on the early estimates of the key epidemiological parameters of the virus in a defined population.In this study, we combined a likelihood-based method using a Bayesian framework and compartmental model of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Nigeria to estimate the effective reproduction number (R(t)) and basic reproduction number (R0) - this also enables us to estimate the initial daily transmission rate (?0). We further estimate the reported fraction of symptomatic cases. The models are applied to the NCDC data on COVID-19 symptomatic and death cases from 27 February 2020 and 7 May 2020.In this period, the effective reproduction number is estimated with a minimum value of 0.18 and a maximum value of 2.29. Most importantly, the R(t) is strictly greater than one from 13 April till 7 May 2020. The R0 is estimated to be 2.42 with credible interval: (2.37-2.47). Comparing this with the R(t) shows that control measures are working but not effective enough to keep R(t) below 1. Also, the estimated fraction of reported symptomatic cases is between 10 and 50%.Our analysis has shown evidence that the existing control measures are not enough to end the epidemic and more stringent measures are needed.","output":"Is Nigeria really on top of COVID-19?

However, numerous implementation challenges remain and migrant perspectives on the policy are rarely known. The aim of this study was to examine migrant service users perspectives and their consequent response towards the HICS. METHODS: A qualitative case-study approach was employed. In-depth interviews with ten local migrants and four employers were conducted in one of the most densely migrant-populated provinces in Thailand. Document review was used as a means for data triangulation. Inductive thematic analysis was exercised on interview data. RESULTS: The findings revealed that most migrants were not aware of the benefit, they are entitled to receive from the HICS due to unclear communication and inadequate announcements about the policy. The registration costs needed for legalising migrants precarious status were a major concern. Adequate support from employers was a key determining factor that encouraged migrants to participate in the registration process and purchase the insurance card. Some employers sought assistance from private intermediaries or brokers to facilitate the registration process for migrants. CONCLUSION: Proper communication and promotion regarding the benefits of the HICS and local authorities taking action to expedite the registration process for migrants are recommended. The policy should also establish a mechanism to receive feedback from migrants.

Results: There was no statistical difference in the detection rate of PCa patients between systematic biopsy and targeted biopsy (44.41% vs 45.6%, P>0.05), while the detection rate of targeted biopsy in clinically significant PCa (csPCa) patients was slightly higher than that of systematic biopsy (40.83% vs 38.15%, P=0.033). Stratified analysis indicated that targeted biopsy was more advantageous in csPCa patients with PIRADS score  4 and ROI-load > 5%. The comparison of diagnostic sensitivity of systematic biopsy and targeted biopsy demonstrated that targeted biopsy was more sensitive than systematic biopsy to diagnose PCa (Z=2.110, P=0.035) at ROI-load  5%. In addition, ROI-load may be a better targeted biopsy indicator than ROI diameter for the diagnosis of PCa (Z=2.168, P=0.030).

Hence, it is urgent and imperative to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 for as many global locations as possible. This study calculates the relative risk of the importation and exportation of the COVID-19 virus. The study's most important contribution is the calculation of the overall relative risk of the importation and exportation of COVID-19 from every airport in local municipalities around the world, based on global spatial and mapping information. Three scenarios of air travel restriction are considered, and the change in the risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19 is calculated. The relative risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19 clearly shows that not only China, Europe, Middle East, and East Asia, but also the U.S., Australia, and countries in northeast Asia and Latin America are subject to risk. Further, a larger reduction in air travel through airports in a large part of the cumulative incidence area would lead to a gradual decrease in the risk flow. Importantly, the exportation risk of the disease from some airports in China, Iran, and European countries has a higher global spread than the importation risk during the pandemic stage. Therefore, every airport, or government with airports in their jurisdiction, should implement strict countermeasures. It is also indispensable for these countries to undertake countermeasures for COVID-19, such as home quarantine within each country and restricting infected or suspected individuals from flying on airplanes.","output":"Airport risk of importation and exportation of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Like previous educational technologies, artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) threatens to disrupt the status quo, with proponents highlighting the potential for efficiency and democratization, and skeptics warning of industrialization and alienation.

Given that a vaccine will eventually be produced, information will be needed to support a potential campaign to promote vaccination. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the variables affecting the likelihood of refusal and indecision toward a vaccine against COVID-19 and to determine the acceptance of the vaccine for different scenarios of effectiveness and side effects. Materials and Methods: A multinomial logistic regression method based on the Health Belief Model was used to estimate the current methodology, using data obtained by an online anonymous survey of 370 respondents in Chile. Results: The results indicate that 49% of respondents were willing to be vaccinated, with 28% undecided or 77% of individuals who would potentially be willing to be inoculated. The main variables that explained the probability of rejection or indecision were associated with the severity of COVID-19, such as, the side effects and effectiveness of the vaccine; perceived benefits, including immunity, decreased fear of contagion, and the protection of oneself and the environment; action signals, such as, responses from ones' family and the government, available information, and specialists' recommendations; and susceptibility, including the contagion rate per 1,000 inhabitants and relatives with COVID-19, among others. Our analysis of hypothetical vaccine scenarios revealed that individuals preferred less risky vaccines in terms of fewer side effects, rather than effectiveness. Additionally, the variables that explained the indecision toward or rejection of a potential COVID-19 vaccine could be used in designing public health policies. Conclusions: We discovered that it is necessary to formulate specific, differentiated vaccination-promotion strategies for the anti-vaccine and undecided groups based on the factors that explain the probability of individuals refusing or expressing hesitation toward vaccination.","output":"Hesitation and Refusal Factors in Individuals' Decision-Making Processes Regarding a Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nurses exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) are psychologically stressed.

But do social distancing policies in response to COVID-19 actually change population behavior and, if so, what political, socioeconomic, and epidemiological factors condition this policy effect? METHODS We leverage subnational variation in the stringency and timing of state-issued social distancing policies to test their effects on population mobility from March to December 2020 across 109 states in Brazil, Mexico, and the United States. We also explore how conventional explanations of compliance, including political trust, socioeconomic resources, health risks, and partisanship, modify these policy effects. FINDINGS In Brazil and the U.S., mandatory stay-at-home orders and workplace closures jointly reduced mobility, especially early in the pandemic. In Mexico, where federal government intervention created greater policy uniformity across states, workplace closures produced the most consistent reduction in mobility. Conventional explanations of compliance perform well in the U.S. but not in Brazil and Mexico, with the exception of socioeconomic resources. CONCLUSIONS In addition to new directions for future research on the politics of compliance, the article offers insights for policymakers about which public health measures are likely to elicit compliance. Our finding that the efficacy of workplace closures at reducing population mobility increases with levels of socioeconomic development suggests that cash transfers, economic stimulus packages, and other policies that mitigate the financial burdens of the pandemic may help reduce population mobility by decreasing the costs of staying at home.","output":"Who Stays at Home?

Case fatality rate (CFR) indicator of the disease is one of the most important indices noticed by experts, policymakers, and managers, based on which daily evaluations and many judgments are made. CFR can change during epidemics. This study aimed to estimate the actual number of COVID-19 cases in Iran and to calculate the early CFR for the disease based on official statistics. Methods: This was a descriptive study whose data were obtained from the website of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran from February 20, 2020 until March 26, 2020. CFR has been obtained by dividing the total number of deaths by the total number of confirmed cases at one point in time. In this study, the actual number of COVID-19 cases in Iran was estimated based on the mortality model in 4 scenarios. Excel 2013 software was used to analyze the data. Results: According to the findings of this study, In Iran, until March 26, 2020, a total of 27 017 people have been infected by COVID-19 and 2077 died of it. However, CFR indicator had a descending trend in Iran: 100%, 18.6%, 8.8%, 3.3%, 6.9%, and 7.7% on days 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 35, respectively. The actual number of COVID-19 cases in Iran was estimated to be 4 789 454, 2 873 673, 1 436 836, and 718418 as of March 26, 2020 according to the 4 scenarios, respectively. Conclusion: In emerging epidemics, CFR indicator must not be used as a basis to judge the performance of a health system unless that epidemic condition has been clarified. Moreover, it is suggested that in the outbreak of an epidemic, specifically emerging diseases, CFR must not be the base of judgment. Making judgments, specifically in the outbreak of emerging epidemics, based on fatality rate can lead to information bias. It is also possible to estimate the total number of patients based on the CFR in circumstances where little information is available on the disease.","output":"Can judgments according to case fatality rate be correct all the time during epidemics?

OBJECTIVE This systematic review examined the evidence for the relationship between training load and musculoskeletal injury risk in athlete, military, and first responder (i.e. law enforcement, firefighting, rescue service) populations. METHODS The CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, SportDISCUS, and SCOPUS databases were searched using a comprehensive strategy. Studies published prior to July 2017 were included if they prospectively examined the relationship between training load and injury risk. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) and Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine levels of evidence. A narrative synthesis of findings was conducted. RESULTS A total of 2047 articles were examined for potential inclusion. Forty-six met the inclusion criteria and 11 known to the authors but not found in the search were added, for a total of 57 articles. Overall, 47 studies had at least partially statistically significant results, demonstrating a relationship between training load and injury risk. Included articles were rated as poor (n = 15), fair (n = 6), and good (n = 36) based on NOS score. Articles assessed as 'good' were considered level 2b evidence on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Model, and articles assessed as 'fair' or 'poor' were considered level 4 evidence. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that the existence of a relationship between training load and injury continues to be well supported in the literature and is strongest for subjective internal training load.

Conventional approaches to analyse microbiome data typically entail dimensionality reduction and assume linearity of the observed relationships, however, the microbiome is a highly complex ecosystem marked by non-linear relationships. In this study, we use topological data analysis (TDA) to explore differences and similarities between the gut microbiome across several countries. Methods: We used curated adult microbiome data at the genus level from the GMrepo database. The dataset contains OTU and demographical data of over 4,400 samples from 19 studies, spanning 12 countries. We analysed the data with tmap, an integrative framework for TDA specifically designed for stratification and enrichment analysis of population-based gut microbiome datasets. Results: We find associations between specific microbial genera and groups of countries. Specifically, both the USA and UK were significantly co-enriched with the proinflammatory genera Lachnoclostridium and Ruminiclostridium, while France and New Zealand were co-enriched with other, butyrate-producing, taxa of the order Clostridiales. Conclusion: The TDA approach demonstrates the overlap and distinctions of microbiome composition between and within countries. This yields unique insights into complex associations in the dataset, a finding not possible with conventional approaches. It highlights the potential utility of TDA as a complementary tool in microbiome research, particularly for large population-scale datasets, and suggests further analysis on the effects of diet and other regionally varying factors.","output":"Topological Data Analysis Highlights Novel Geographical Signatures of the Human Gut Microbiome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past decade, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has successfully reduced uninsurance and improved access to and affordability of health care services for millions of Americans.

ARDS is caused by increased amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to lung damage and loss of lung function. There are currently no effective therapies for combatting ARDS. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been suggested as a potential treatment for ARDS due to their significant immunomodulatory properties. MSC small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), including exosomes, modulate the immune response as effectively as MSCs themselves, with the added advantages of increased safety and tissue penetration. METHODS: We isolated sEVs from MSCs induced to secrete increased levels of neurotrophic and immunomodulatory factors, termed Exo MSC-NTF, and compared their ability to treat ARDS, in a lung injury LPS mouse model, to sEVs isolated from na?ve MSCs (Exo MSC). Measurments of lung histopathological changes and neutrophil infiltration, blood oxygen saturation, and bronchoalveolar lavge fluid (BALF) proinflammatory cytokines and coagulation related factors were performed. RESULTS: We found that Exo MSC-NTF was superior to Exo MSC in reducing LPS-induced ARDS markers, including physiological lung damage such as alveolar wall thickness, fibrin presence, and neutrophil accumulation, as well as increasing oxygenation levels. Furthermore, Exo MSC-NTF reversed the imbalance in the host immune response, seen as decreased IFN-?3, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, and RANTES levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. CONCLUSIONS: These positive preclinical results suggest that Exo MSC-NTF may be suitable as a therapy for COVID-19-induced ARDS and are more effective at combatting ARDS physiological, pathological, and biochemical symptoms than sEVs isolated from non-induced MSCs.","output":"MSC-NTF (NurOwn?) exosomes: a novel therapeutic modality in the mouse LPS-induced ARDS model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To understand medical students' mental health, professional pride, and intention to work in the front-line during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and provide a reference for psychological intervention.

Whether elevated biomarkers truly represent myocardial dysfunction is not known. The aim of this study was to explore the incidence of ventricular dysfunction and assess its relationship with biomarker analyses. METHODS: This cross-sectional study ran from April 1 to May 12, 2020, and consisted of all consecutively admitted patients to the Radboud university medical centre nursing ward for COVID-19. Laboratory assessment included high-sensitivity Troponin T and N?terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Echocardiographic evaluation focused on left and right ventricular systolic function and global longitudinal strain (GLS). RESULTS: In total, 51 patients were included, with a median age of 63 years (range 51C68 years) of whom 80% was male. Troponin T was elevated (>14 ng/l) in 47%, and a clinically relevant Troponin T elevation (10  URL) was found in three patients (6%). NT-proBNP was elevated (>300 pg/ml) in 24 patients (47%), and in four (8%) the NT-proBNP concentration was >1,000 pg/ml. Left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction <52% and/or GLS >?18%) was observed in 27%, while right ventricular dysfunction (TAPSE <17 mm and/or RV S < 10 cm/s) was seen in 10%. There was no association between elevated Troponin T or NT-proBNP and left or right ventricular dysfunction. Patients with confirmed pulmonary embolism had normal right ventricular function. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalised patients, it seems that COVID-19 predominantly affects the respiratory system, while cardiac dysfunction occurs less often. Based on a single echocardiographic evaluation, we found no relation between elevated Troponin T or NT-proBNP, and ventricular dysfunction.

However, to our knowledge, the prevalence of IFIs has not yet been assessed in large populations of mechanically ventilated patients. We aimed to identify the prevalence, risk factors, and mortality associated with IFIs in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 under intensive care. METHODS: We performed a national, multicentre, observational cohort study in 18 French intensive care units (ICUs). We retrospectively and prospectively enrolled adult patients (aged 18 years) with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and requiring mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome, with all demographic and clinical and biological follow-up data anonymised and collected from electronic case report forms. Patients were systematically screened for respiratory fungal microorganisms once or twice a week during the period of mechanical ventilation up to ICU discharge. The primary outcome was the prevalence of IFIs in all eligible participants with a minimum of three microbiological samples screened during ICU admission, with proven or probable (pr/pb) COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) classified according to the recent ECMM/ISHAM definitions. Secondary outcomes were risk factors of pr/pb CAPA, ICU mortality between the pr/pb CAPA and non-pr/pb CAPA groups, and associations of pr/pb CAPA and related variables with ICU mortality, identified by regression models. The MYCOVID study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04368221. FINDINGS: Between Feb 29 and July 9, 2020, we enrolled 565 mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. 509 patients with at least three screening samples were analysed (mean age 594 years [SD 125], 400 [79%] men). 128 (25%) patients had 138 episodes of pr/pb or possible IFIs. 76 (15%) patients fulfilled the criteria for pr/pb CAPA. According to multivariate analysis, age older than 62 years (odds ratio [OR] 234 [95% CI 139C392], p=00013), treatment with dexamethasone and anti-IL-6 (OR 271 [112C656], p=0027), and long duration of mechanical ventilation (>14 days; OR 216 [114C409], p=0019) were independently associated with pr/pb CAPA. 38 (7%) patients had one or more other pr/pb IFIs: 32 (6%) had candidaemia, six (1%) had invasive mucormycosis, and one (<1%) had invasive fusariosis. Multivariate analysis of associations with death, adjusted for candidaemia, for the 509 patients identified three significant factors: age older than 62 years (hazard ratio [HR] 171 [95% CI 126C232], p=00005), solid organ transplantation (HR 246 [153C395], p=00002), and pr/pb CAPA (HR 145 [95% CI 103C203], p=0033). At time of ICU discharge, survival curves showed that overall ICU mortality was significantly higher in patients with pr/pb CAPA than in those without, at 618% (95% CI 500C728) versus 321% (277C367; p<00001). INTERPRETATION: This study shows the high prevalence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and candidaemia and high mortality associated with pr/pb CAPA in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. These findings highlight the need for active surveillance of fungal pathogens in patients with severe COVID-19.

The virus rapidly spread, and the World Health Organization declared a pandemic by March 2020. With millions of confirmed cases world-wide, there is growing concern and considerable debate regarding the potential for coronavirus infection to contribute to an appreciable burden of chronic respiratory symptoms or fibrotic disease among recovered individuals. As the first case of Covid-19 was documented less than one year ago, data regarding long-term clinical outcomes are not yet available and predictions for long-term outcome are speculative at best. However, due to the staggering number of cases and the severity of disease in many individuals, there is a critical need to consider the potential long-term implications of Covid-19. This review examines current basic and clinical data regarding fibrogenic mechanisms of viral injury in the context of SARS-CoV-2. Several intersecting mechanisms between coronavirus infection and fibrotic pathways are discussed to highlight factors and processes that may be targetable to improve patient outcome. Reports of post-infection sequelae from previous coronavirus outbreaks are presented toward the goal of improved recognition of potential contributing risk factors for fibrotic disease.","output":"Healing after Covid-19: Are Survivors at Risk for Development of Pulmonary Fibrosis?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in December 2019, neurological manifestations have been recognized as potential complications. Relatively rare movement disorders associated with COVID-19 are increasingly reported in case reports or case series. Here, we present a case and systematic review of myoclonus and cerebellar ataxia associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline using the PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases, from November 1, 2019 to December 6, 2020. RESULTS: 51 cases of myoclonus or ataxia associated with COVID-19, including our case, were identified from 32 publications. The mean age was 59.6 years, ranging from 26 to 88 years, and 21.6% were female. Myoclonus was multifocal or generalized and had an acute onset, usually within 1 month of COVID-19 symptoms. Myoclonus occurred in isolation (46.7%), or with ataxia (40.0%) or cognitive changes (30.0%). Most cases improved within 2 months, and treatment included anti-epileptic medications or immunotherapy. Ataxia had an acute onset, usually within 1 month of COVID-19 symptoms, but could be an initial symptom. Concurrent neurological symptoms included cognitive changes (45.5%), myoclonus (36.4%), or a Miller Fisher syndrome variant (21.2%). Most cases improved within 2 months, either spontaneously or with immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review highlights myoclonus and ataxia as rare and treatable post-infectious or para-infectious, immune-mediated phenomena associated with COVID-19.

Instead of being asymptomatic, bleeding, inflammation, and perforation may result in fistula formation and require surgery. This type of diverticulum is thought to be closely related to the gastrocolic fistula (GCF). PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a 26-year-old female presenting severe abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting and a history of constipation since childhood. The patient felt a mass around the epigastric region and extends to the right hypochondrium. Enema contrast examination showed a large diverticulum in the transverse colon. CT scan revealed a 21.4  8.4 cm structure with air-filled structures visible from the transverse colon filled with contrast material, suggesting a possible gastrocolic fistula. Resection was performed on the diverticulum and 20 cm in length of the transverse colon, followed by side-to-side anastomosis. Histopathological findings were type III GCD. The patient was discharged without complications 1 week later. DISCUSSION: Giant diverticulum is characterized by a diverticulum with 4 cm or more in length. Our case was a diverticulum from the central portion of the transverse colon with 25  9  3 cm in length and type III GCD. Resection was performed on the diverticulum and 20 cm in length of the transverse colon, followed by side-to-side anastomosis. CONCLUSION: Differentiating GCD and GCF with similar clinical course may necessitate multiple investigation before establishing the correct diagnosis. We suggest colectomy followed by side-to-side anastomosis is the best option of treatment for GCD.","output":"Giant diverticulum of the transverse colon mimicking gastrocolic fistula: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More and more learning apps like Duolingo are using some form of gamification (e.g., badges, points, and leaderboards) to enhance user learning.

Ethical leadership theory provides aspirational goals, but lacks empirically based guidance on how to implement policies that facilitate values-based behavior. Using a discourse theory analysis of a moral dilemma vignette with Royal Australian Air Force personnel, this research identifies important aspects of agency and subject position that must be addressed if such policies are to succeed. These findings show that the potential contradiction can be addressed by acknowledging the contrasting tendency to bureaucratic process by leaders at upper levels, while lower-level leaders address moral issues by incorporating their subjectivity and making a conscious deontological choice between humanity and comrade loyalty.","output":"The Relationship of Risk to Rules, Values, Virtues, and Moral Complexity: What We can Learn from the Moral Struggles of Military Leaders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: Electronic consultation is a means of communication with clients using different types of electronic devices at distance.

Inclusion criteria were patients who were assigned a diagnosis containing \\"croup\\" during either 5/30/2021-11/30/2021, a time period correlating with predominance of the COVID-19 Delta variant (B.1.617.2), or the initial phase of the Omicron variant surge (12/1/2021-1/15/2022). Contemporaneous publicly available local data on the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 samples in surrounding King County, Washington, with spike gene target failure on TaqPath PCR assays was used as a proxy for the proportion of infections caused by the Omicron variant. A total of 401 patients were diagnosed with croup during the Delta surge and 107 patients were diagnosed with croup during the Omicron surge. Patients who presented during the Omicron surge were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 (48.2% vs 2.8%, p < 0.0001).

Among multi-drug resistant organisms, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and multi-drug resistant Candida auris were most commonly reported. Stratified analyses found higher proportions of AMR outside of Europe and in ICU settings, though these results were not statistically significant. Patient-level analysis demonstrated > 50% (n = 58) mortality, whereby all but 6 patients were infected with a resistant organism. Conclusions During the first 18 months of the pandemic, AMR prevalence was high in COVID-19 patients and varied by hospital and geography although there was substantial heterogeneity. Given the variation in patient populations within these studies, clinical settings, practice patterns, and definitions of AMR, further research is warranted to quantify AMR in COVID-19 patients to improve surveillance programs, infection prevention and control practices and antimicrobial stewardship programs globally.

Adolescents worldwide alleviated the negative experiences of social distancing by spending more time on digital devices. Through a systematic literature search in eight academic databases (including Eric, Proquest Sociology, Communication & Mass Media Complete, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Pubmed, and Web of Science), the present systematic review and meta-analysis first summarized the existing evidence from 30 studies, published up to September 2021, on the link between mental health and digital media use in adolescents during Covid-19. Digital media use measures included social media, screen time, and digital media addiction. Mental health measures were grouped into conceptually similar dimensions, such as well-being, ill-being, social well-being, lifestyle habits, and Covid-19-related stress. Results showed that, although most studies reported a positive association between ill-being and social media use (r = 0.171, p = 0.011) and ill-being and media addiction (r = 0.434, p = 0.024), not all types of digital media use had adverse consequences on adolescents' mental health. In particular, one-to-one communication, self-disclosure in the context of mutual online friendship, as well as positive and funny online experiences mitigated feelings of loneliness and stress. Hence, these positive aspects of online activities should be promoted. At the same time, awareness of the detrimental effects of addictive digital media use should be raised: That would include making adolescents more aware of adverse mechanisms such as social comparison, fear of missing out, and exposure to negative contents, which were more likely to happen during social isolation and confinement due to the pandemic.","output":"Digital Media Use and Adolescents' Mental Health During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spain has been heavily affected by COVID-19. Reallocation of resources for managing the outbreak might have caused a disruption in stroke care. This study analyses the impact on stroke care of reorganising the healthcare system in response to the first COVID-19 outbreak peak in Spain and the strategies adopted by Spanish stroke units to deal with this impact. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained data from a structured survey sent to the responsible of stroke units across the country. We recorded the number of strokes, stroke code activations, intravenous thrombolysis treatments and mechanical thrombectomies during February and March 2019 and 2020. We also collected information on the impact on workflow metrics and on the availability of specialised neurological care and rehabilitation treatments, the characteristics of stroke care for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact on human resources. We compared the activity data between 2019 and 2020 and the information on activity and impact on stroke care between regions classified according to the disease incidence rate. RESULTS: Fifty-seven (75%) of all stroke units in Spain responded to the survey. There was an overall reduction in admissions for all stroke types during the outbreaks peak and in the number of stroke code activations and intravenous thrombolysis treatments, results that were independent of the COVID-19 incidence rate. Participants reported a delay in workflow metrics and a reduction of admissions to stroke units, outpatient clinics and rehabilitation therapies. Specific pathways and protocols for managing stroke patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak has jeopardised all phases of stroke care.

We further investigate whether these effects varied between small areas by deprivation. DESIGN: Synthetic control analysis. SETTING: We identified areas introducing tier 3 restrictions in October and December, constructed a synthetic control group of places under tier 2 restrictions and compared changes in weekly infections over a 4-week period. Using interaction analysis, we estimated whether this effect varied by deprivation and the prevalence of a new variant (B.1.1.7). INTERVENTIONS: In both October and December, no indoor between-household mixing was permitted in either tier 2 or 3. In October, no between-household mixing was permitted in private gardens and pubs and restaurants remained open only if they served a substantial meal in tier 3, while in tier 2 meeting with up to six people in private gardens were allowed and all pubs and restaurants remained open. In December, in tier 3, pubs and restaurants were closed, while in tier 2, only those serving food remained open. The differences in restrictions between tier 2 and 3 on meeting outside remained the same as in October. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Weekly reported cases adjusted for changing case detection rates for neighbourhoods in England. RESULTS: Introducing tier 3 restrictions in October and December was associated with a 14% (95% CI 10% to 19%) and 20% (95% CI 13% to 29%) reduction in infections, respectively, compared with the rates expected with tier 2 restrictions only. The effects were similar across levels of deprivation and by the prevalence of the new variant. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with tier 2 restrictions, additional restrictions in tier 3 areas in England had a moderate effect on transmission, which did not appear to increase socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 cases.","output":"Evaluating the impacts of tiered restrictions introduced in England, during October and December 2020 on COVID-19 cases: a synthetic control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 emerged as a global pandemic in 2020 and has affected millions of lives. Surgical training has also been significantly affected by this pandemic, but the exact effect remains unknown. We sought to perform a national survey of general surgery residents in the United States to assess the effect of COVID-19 on surgical resident training, education, and burnout. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was created and distributed to general surgery residents across the United States. The survey aimed to assess changes to surgical residents clinical schedules, operative volume, and educational curricula as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we sought to assess the impact of COVID-19 on resident burnout. RESULTS: 1102 general surgery residents completed the survey. Residents reported a significant decline in the number of cases performed during the pandemic. Educational curricula were largely shifted towards online didactics. The majority of residents reported spending more time on educational didactics than before the pandemic. The majority of residents feared contracting COVID-19 or transmitting it to their family during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has had significant impact on surgical training and education. One positive consequence of the pandemic is increased educational didactics. Online didactics should continue to be a part of surgical education in the post-COVID-19 era. Steps need to be taken to ensure that graduating surgical residents are adequately prepared for fellowship and independent practice despite the significantly decreased case volumes during this pandemic.

However, human NK cell responses in acute influenza infection, including infection with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, are poorly documented. Here, we examined changes in NK cell phenotype and function and plasma cytokine levels associated with influenza infection and vaccination. We show that absolute numbers of peripheral blood NK cells, and particularly those of CD56(bright) NK cells, decreased upon acute influenza infection while this NK cell subset expanded following intramuscular influenza vaccination. NK cells exposed to influenza antigens were activated, with higher proportions of NK cells expressing CD69 in study subjects infected with seasonal influenza strains. Vaccination led to increased levels of CD25+ NK cells, and notably CD56(bright) CD25+ NK cells, whereas decreased amounts of this subset were present in the peripheral blood of influenza infected individuals, and predominantly in study subjects infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Finally, acute influenza infection was associated with low plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-, MIP-1, IL-2 and IL-15, and high levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1ra. Altogether, these data suggest a role for the CD56(bright) NK cell subset in the response to influenza, potentially involving their recruitment to infected tissues and a local production and/or uptake of inflammatory cytokines.","output":"Changes in Cytokine Levels and NK Cell Activation Associated with Influenza"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Modular Construction is one of the emerging construction technologies, which play an important role in saving construction time and have gradually become a hot topic in the field of construction.

Fortunately, advances in systems medicine enable the development of effective therapies for treating viral diseases, of vaccines to prevent viral infections, as well as of diagnostic tools to mitigate the risk and reduce the death toll. Characterizing the SARS-CoV-2 gene sequence and the role of its spike protein in infection informs development of small molecule drugs, antibodies, and vaccines to combat infection and complication, as well as to end the pandemic. Drug repurposing of small molecule drugs is a viable strategy to combat viral diseases; the key concepts include (1) linking a drug candidate's pharmacological network to its pharmacodynamic response in patients; (2) linking a drug candidate's physicochemical properties to its pharmacokinetic characteristics; and (3) optimizing the safe and effective dosing regimen within its therapeutic window. Computational integration of drug-induced signaling pathways with clinical outcomes is useful to inform selection of potential drug candidates with respect to safety and effectiveness. Key pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles for computational optimization of drug development include a drug candidate's Cminss/IC95 ratio, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and systemic exposure-response relationship, where Cminss is the trough concentration following multiple dosing.

Yet, nitrate toxicity can be modulated by other stressors in the environment, such as elevated temperatures. Acclimation to elevated temperatures has been shown to offset the negative effects of nitrate on whole animal performance in fish, but the mechanisms underlying this cross-tolerance interaction remain unclear. In this study, juvenile silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) were exposed to a factorial combination of temperature (28 C or 32 C) and nitrate concentrations (0, 50 or 100 mg NO3- L-1) treatments to test the hypothesis that thermal acclimation offsets the effects of nitrate via compensatory changes to the cardiorespiratory system (gills, ventricle and blood oxygen carrying capacity). Following 21 weeks of thermal acclimation, we found that fish acclimated to 32 C experienced an expansion of gill surface area and an increase in ventricular thickness regardless of nitrate exposure concentration. Exposure to nitrate (both 50 and 100 mg NO3- L-1) reduced the blood oxygen carrying capacity of silver perch due to increases in methaemoglobin concentration and a right shift in oxygen-haemoglobin binding curves in fish from both thermal acclimation treatments.

The symptoms have made all ages suffer a lot. The diagnostics of COVID-19 is an excellent challenge for the medical field as the mutated form of the virus gives out its symptoms in different forms. The main diagnostics to be involved in this infection of COVID-19 is the Lung operation. Especially the automatic detection of the lungs' infection using chest X-rays provides the comprehensive possibility for healthcare professionals to develop hospital procedures to handle this COVID-19. Computed tomography scans are used to diagnose the lungs' infection caused by the Coronavirus, whereas the C.T. scans break the infected region from lung lesions. It is imperative to measure the disease progression, which is challenging to track down and treat accurately. Currently, Segmenting the contaminated regions from the C.T. slices can create loads of problems, which involves more alteration in contamination nature and minor power disagreement in the center of the infected tissues and the typical material. This chapter aims to segment the infection in the lungs using SqueezeNet as the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize the contaminated regions automatically. This approach may be useful to help in the accuracy of the C.T more accurately. It has been ensured based on Dice scores, sensitivity, and high precision, specificity.

Objectives: The aim of the study was to perform a systematic review on mortality associated to the use of ACEi in patients with COVID-19 disease. Methods: Search in Medline (PubMed), in ISI Web of Knowledge and in medRxiv database; use of other sources. Results: A total of 33 articles were evaluated. Concerning the papers used to produce the meta-analyses, 7 studies were selected, 5 of which were used. These 5 studies involved a total number of 944 patients treated with ACEi and 5173 not treated with ACEi. Increased mortality was seen in association to the use of ACEi in the context of COVID-19 disease (ACEi users vs nonusers; odds ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.15; Pa=a.04). When compared to mortality in patients treated with angiotensin receptor blockers, mortality of patients treated with ACEi was not significantly different (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.21; Pa=a.74). Concerning the remaining reports, different types of data adjustments were used by several authors, after which increased mortality was not seen in association to the use of ACEi in this context. Conclusions: ACEi use could act as a marker of increased mortality risk in some but not all COVID-19 disease settings. The data now presented do not prove a causal relation but argue in favor of carrying out clinical trials studying ACEi in COVID-19 patients, to establish the safety of ACEi use in this context.","output":"Mortality and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in COVID 19 disease: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: To develop methods for recovering a model virus (bacteriophage MS2) from healthcare personal protective equipment (PPE).

In this study, we performed single-cell transcriptomic sequencing of peripheral blood samples collected from six healthy controls and 14 COVID-19 samples including severe, moderate, and convalescent samples from three severely/critically ill and four moderately ill patients. We found that the monocytes were strongly remodeled in the severely/critically ill patients with COVID-19, with an increased proportion of monocytes and seriously reduced diversity. In addition, we discovered two novel severe-disease-specific monocyte subsets: Mono 0 and Mono 5. These subsets expressed amphiregulin (AREG), epiregulin (EREG), and cytokine interleukin-18 (IL-18) gene, exhibited an enriched erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB) signaling pathway, and appeared to exhibit pro-fibrogenic and pro-inflammation characteristics. We also found metabolic changes in Mono 0 and Mono 5, including increased glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and an increased hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway. Notably, one pre-severe sample displayed a monocyte atlas similar to that of the severe/critical samples.

Identity politics around race is used to legitimise expressive or reprisal-oriented violence against Hamitic or Tutsi minorities. The case of the Banyamulenge of South Kivu is examined in this article. Following Autesserre, we show that one-dimensional narratives C in this case of race C tend to over-simplify the dynamics of political violence. Anti-Hamitic racism is derived from colonial ideas around race hierarchies, and has resulted in systematic killings of Banyamulenge civilians in what resembles a slow genocide. Expressive violence has, in turn, produced a lack of concern for the plight of Banyamulenge civilians among the military, humanitarians, media, scholars and NGOs. Given armed alliances between local Maimai forces, Burundian and Rwandan opposition and the DRC army, such race narratives cruelly legitimise violence against civilians from Tutsi communities, associated by neighbouring communities with Rwanda. Resultant displacement, starvation and killing of Banyamulenge civilians in this context amount to an on-going, slow-moving genocide. As the COVID-19 crisis unrolls, the decolonisation of identity politics in Eastern DRC, and in South Kivu in particular still seems very remote.

We therefore implemented active monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers (HCWs) at an academic medical center during the COVID-19 epidemic in northeast US. METHODS: We recruited a cohort of HCWs at Yale New Haven Hospital who worked in COVID-19 units and did not have COVID-19 related symptoms between March 28 and June 1, 2020. During follow-up, participants provided daily information on symptoms by responding to a web-based questionnaire, self-administered nasopharyngeal (NP) and saliva specimens every 3 days, and blood specimens every 14 days. We performed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and an anti-spike protein IgM and IgG ELISA to identify virological and serological-confirmed infection, respectively. RESULTS: We enrolled 525 (13%) amongst 4,136 HCW of whom daily information on symptoms and NP, saliva, and blood specimens were obtained for 66% (of 13208), 42% (or 1977), 44% (of 2071) and 65% (of 1099), respectively, of the follow-up measurement points. We identified 16 (3.0% of 525) HCWs with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and an additional 12 (2.3% of 525) who were not tested by PCR or had negative PCR results but had serological evidence of infection. The overall cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 5.3% (28 of 525) amongst HCWs. Cases were not identified by hospital protocols for passive staff self-monitoring for symptoms. Amongst 16 PCR-confirmed cases, 9 (56%) of the 16 PCR-confirmed HCW had symptoms during or after the date of initial detection. We did not identify an epidemiological link between the 28 confirmed cases. CONCLUSION: We found that a significant proportion (5.3%) of HCWs were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 epidemic. In the setting of universal PPE use, infections were possibly acquired in the community rather than stemming from patient-HCW or HCW-HCW transmission. Passive monitoring of symptoms is inadequate in preventing introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the healthcare setting due to asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic presentations.

The mechanisms underlying the susceptibility to critical illness are poorly understood. Of interest, these comorbidities have previously been associated with increased signaling of Th17 cells. Th17 cells secrete IL-17A and are important for clearing extracellular pathogens, but inappropriate signaling has been linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Fibrils also serve as a matrix for the immobilization of biomolecules with biological activity, such as the phenolic compound phloroglucinol (PG), the subunit of marine polyphenols. The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of PG coatings on fibroblast- and osteoblast-like cells to increase the osseointegration of titanium implants. Collagen fibril coatings, containing PG at low and high concentrations, were produced on titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) scaffolds generated by additive manufacturing (AM). These coatings, especially PG-enriched coatings, reduced hydrophobicity and modulated the behavior of human osteosarcoma SaOS-2 and mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 cell lines. Both osteoblastic and fibroblastic cells spread and adhered well on PG-enriched coatings. Coatings significantly reduced the inflammatory response. Moreover, osteogenic differentiation was promoted by collagen coatings with a high PG concentration. Thus, the enrichment of collagen fibril coatings with PG is a promising strategy to improve Ti6Al4V implants for bone contact in orthopedics and dentistry and is worthy of further investigation.","output":"Phenolic-Enriched Collagen Fibrillar Coatings on Titanium Alloy to Promote Osteogenic Differentiation and Reduce Inflammation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Short instructional videos can make learning more efficient through the application of multimedia principles, and video animations can illustrate the complex concepts and dynamic processes that are common in health sciences education.

While about 80 % of infections cause mild or moderate COVID-19 disease, some individuals show a severe progression or even die. Most countries are far from achieving herd-immunity, however, the first approved vaccines offer hope for containment of the virus. Although much is known about the virus, there is a lack of information on the immunity of convalescent individuals. We here evaluate the humoral and cellular immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in 41 COVID-19 convalescents. As previous studies mostly included younger individuals, one advantage of our study is the comparatively high mean age of the convalescents included in the cohort considered (54 {+/-} 8.4 years). While anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were still detectable in 95 % of convalescents up to 8 months post infection, an antibody-decay over time was generally observed in most donors. Using a multiplex assay, our data additionally reveal that most convalescents exhibit a broad humoral immunity against different viral epitopes. We demonstrate by flow cytometry that convalescent donors show a significantly elevated number of natural killer cells when compared to healthy controls, while no differences were found concerning other leucocyte subpopulations. We detected a specific long-lasting cellular immune response in convalescents by stimulating immune cells with SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides, covering domains of the viral spike, membrane and nucleocapsid protein, and measuring interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) release thereafter. We modified a commercially available ELISA assay for IFN-{gamma} determination in whole-blood specimens of COVID-19 convalescents. One advantage of this assay is that it does not require special equipment and can, thus, be performed in any standard laboratory. In conclusion, our study adds knowledge regarding the persistence of immunity of convalescents suffering from mild to moderate COVID-19.

We have, therefore, validated a QPCR assay for quantification of a viral aerosol sample using the double-stranded DNA-binding dye SYBR green I, an economical alternative for quantification of target microorganisms. To achieve this objective we used mycobacteriophage D29 as model organism. Phage D29 aerosol was produced in an aerosol cabinet and then collected by use of an AGI liquid sampler. A standard curve was created by use of purified genomic DNA from the phage in liquid culture of known concentration measured by titration. To prevent false-positive results caused by formation of primerCdimers, an additional data-acquisition step was added to the three-step QPCR procedure; the new technique was called four-step QPCR. The standard curve was then used to quantify the total amount of phage D29 in liquid culture and aerosol samples. For liquid culture samples there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between results from quantification of the virus using double-agar culture and QPCR. For aerosol samples, however, the result determined by the QPCR method was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that from the double-agar culture method. The four-step SYBR green I QPCR method is a quick quantitative method for mycobacteriophage D29 aerosol.

Compared with PSS-ILD patients, the incidence of pulmonary nodule shadow is significantly higher in PSS-LIP patients, while that of grid shadow was significantly lower. (5) Compared with the baseline, the sum of the number, maximum diameter, and diameter of cysts in three levels of pSS-LIP patients showed an increasing trend after treatment. (6) Correlation analysis: The changes of ground-glass opacities were positively correlated with using GC or not, and those were negatively correlated with the dose of GC treatment. Besides, there is a positive correlation between the annual change rate of the maximum diameter of cysts (a?3?max1/t) and the use of CTX; there is a positive correlation between the annual change rate of the total diameter of cysts (a?3?sum1/t) and the use of CTX. CONCLUSION: To the patients of pSS-LIP, female were more common than male, and the onset of LIP was usually more insidious. Hyperglobulinemia and anti-SSA antibody were more prominent in patients with pSS-LIP. Pulmonary function showed the higher rate of obstructive ventilation dysfunction and the lower rate of diffusion dysfunction. The appearance of ground-glass opacities in pSS-LIP patients suggests that the infiltration of inflammatory cells increases, which may cause airway compression, the expansion of terminal bronchioles, and the formation of cysts. The more ground-glass opacities appear earlier, and the more appearance of new cysts later. Therapy with glucocorticoid may be effective on the ground-glass opacity during acute stage, and therapy with cyclophosphamide may be effective on the cysts during chronic stage. The heavier ground-glass opacity is at baseline, the more likely it will recur during maintenance treatment. So follow-up closely is needed. Key Points a? It is the first clinical study with more cases of patients with pSS-LIP. a? Female and hyperglobulinemia and anti-SSA antibody were more prominent in patients with pSS-LIP. a? Pulmonary function showed the higher rate of obstructive ventilation dysfunction and the lower rate of diffusion dysfunction. a?

Inside the definitive host, eggs released by Schistosoma mansoni lodge in the intestine and especially in the liver where they induce a granulomatous inflammatory process, which can lead to fibrosis. The molecular mechanisms initiating or promoting hepatic granuloma formation remain poorly understood. Inflammasome activation has been described as an important pathway to induce pathology mediated by NLRP3 receptor. Recently, other components of the inflammasome pathway, such as NLRP6, have been related to liver diseases and fibrotic processes. Nevertheless, the contribution of these components in schistosomiasis-associated pathology is still unknown. In the present study, using dendritic cells, we demonstrated that NLRP6 sensor is important for IL-1 production and caspase-1 activation in response to soluble egg antigens (SEA). Furthermore, the lack of NLRP6 has been shown to significantly reduce periovular inflammation, collagen deposition in hepatic granulomas and mRNA levels of -SMA and IL-13. Livers of Nlrp6(C/C) mice showed reduced levels of CXCL1/KC, CCL2, CCL3, IL-5, and IL-10 as well as Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Eosinophilic Peroxidase (EPO) enzymatic activity. Consistently, the frequency of macrophage and neutrophil populations were lower in the liver of NLRP6 knockout mice, after 6 weeks of infection. Finally, it was further demonstrated that the onset of hepatic granuloma and collagen deposition were also compromised in Caspase-1(C/C), IL-1R(C/C) and Gsdmd(C/C) mice.

Methods: This study assesses how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced health service utilization in terms of the difference between predicted and observed values with the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, reporting the results of a time-series approach used to forecast annual and monthly health service utilization as compared with the actual results. This includes considering the number of confirmed cases, data on healthcare services and social-economic and demographic data relating to each province of China covered. The results of a multiple regression analysis are also reported to shed light on determine the relationship between the severity of pandemics and health service utilization. Findings: For the annual projections, we found a significantly negative correlation between the utilization of health services in hospitals and the number of confirmed cases, and the impact on inpatient services has been greater than that on outpatient services. With respect to the monthly analysis, as the pandemic moves from outbreak to dissemination, health care utilization is less affected. It is also found that the trough period for outpatient services has been shorter than that for inpatient services and the pandemic has had a greater impact on hospital services than on township health center services, especially during the first phase of the concentrated outbreak. At the same time, the proportion of educated persons within the population was a protective factor for the utilization of both inpatient and outpatient services. Interpretation: This study is conducted to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its severity on the chosen healthcare system. Given that during the COVID-19 pandemic the utilization of health services has declined significantly, there is a need to have greater regard to the potential for disruption among health services and healthcare systems in all Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC).","output":"The Shock to and Recovery of Health Service Systems During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Case of China (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus circulating in the Arabian Peninsula since September 2012.

The increased taxonomic detail may be used by clinicians and public health decision makers to observe circulation patterns, monitor for outbreaks, and inform local testing practices. We propose a method for expanding the taxonomic resolution of PCR diagnostic systems by incorporating a priori knowledge of the assay design and publicly available sequence information into a genotyping classification model. For multiplexed PCR systems, this framework is generalized to incorporate information from multiple assays that react with different gene targets of the same pathogen to increase classification accuracy. To illustrate the method, a hierarchical classification model is developed for the BioFire? Respiratory 2.1 Panel and the BioFire? Respiratory 2 Panel (collectively the BioFire Respiratory Panels C highly multiplexed PCR diagnostic tests) to predict the species of human adenovirus (HAdV) from Adenovirus Detected test results. Performance of the classification model was characterized via a 10-fold cross-validation on a labeled dataset and exhibited 95%  4% accuracy. The model was then applied to the BioFire? Syndromic Trends dataset, which contains deidentified patient test data from BioFire Respiratory Panels collected at over 100 sites across the globe since 2015. Adenovirus Detected test results in BioFire Syndromic Trends were classified to produce predicted prevalence of each HAdV species within the United States from 2018 through 2021. These results show a marked change in both the predicted prevalence for HAdV and the species makeup with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, HAdV-B decreased from a pre-pandemic predicted prevalence of up to 40% to less than 5% in 2021, while HAdV-A and HAdV-F species both increased in predicted prevalence. Author Summary In the diagnosis of infectious disease there is often a trade-off between time to result, cost, and the amount of information gained about the pathogen. We develop a method that can provide increased genotypic information about a pathogen in a test result, with no additional time or cost. Our method is applied to the BioFire Respiratory? 2.1 Panel and the BioFire Respiratory? 2 Panel to speciate positive test results for adenovirus. The method shows robust performance in correctly identifying the adenovirus species from the test results. We estimate the prevalence of each adenovirus species in the United States by applying this method to adenovirus positive test results in the BioFire Syndromic Trends network. This information can be used in near real-time to augment the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention efforts to monitor adenovirus species circulation.

To analyze how governments responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in these six Latin American countries, we use an index of government response, created by the University of Oxford.

Overall, the results showed that both timelier and more stringent implementation of the public policies analyzed to address the COVID-19 pandemic seem to be associated with higher mobility reductions and lower mortality rates. We draw five policy lessons from the way each country implemented these mitigation policies.

To confirm this hypothesis, we longitudinally investigated whether the nigrostriatal function is asymmetric in Japanese patients with IRBD. METHODS: In 91 polysomnography-confirmed IRBD patients, which included 87 right-handed IRBD patients who underwent 33 repeat DAT-SPECT scans, we retrospectively examined the striatal dopaminergic terminals in each hemisphere using DAT-SPECT. We calculated the values of interhemispheric laterality index for the right and left sides. RESULTS: The proportion of IRBD patients with lower SBR in the striatum was different between the left (n = 60, 69.0%) and right (n = 27, 31.0%) hemispheres. In the repeat DAT-SPECT scan (n = 33), the rate of decline in the striatum was greater on the left than on the right side, and the proportion of patients with lower decline rates in the left striatum (n = 25, 73.5%) was greater than the that in the right striatum (n = 3, 8.8%). The proportion of lower SBR side at baseline did not predict the development of PD or DLB. CONCLUSION: Right-handed IRBD patients have asymmetric nigrostriatal dopaminergic function, as evidenced by the faster estimated rate of decline for the left striatum than the right striatum.

As deterministic models based on predicted population changes have been problematic, there remains a need for more precise and reliable prediction of use. Here, we develop three new time-series methods to predict red cell use 4 to 52 weeks ahead. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: From daily aggregates of red blood cell (RBC) units issued from 2005 to 2011 from the NHS Blood and Transplant, we generated a new set of non-overlapping weekly data by summing the daily data over 7 days and derived the average blood use per week over 4-week and 52-week periods. We used three new methods for linear prediction of blood use by computing the coefficients using Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) algorithm. RESULTS: We optimized the time-window size, order of the prediction, and order of the polynomial fit for our data set. By exploiting the annual periodicity of the data, we achieved significant improvements in long-term predictions, as well as modest improvements in short-term predictions. The new methods predicted mean RBC use with a standard deviation of the percentage error of 2.5% for 4 weeks ahead and 3.4% for 52 weeks ahead.

Although severity of Omicron cases may be reduced, the scale of infection suggests hospital admissions and deaths may be substantial. Definitive conclusions about disease severity require evidence from populations with the greatest risk of severe outcomes, such as residents of Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs). Methods We used a cohort study to compare the risk of hospital admission or death in LTCF residents in England who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the period shortly before Omicron emerged (Delta dominant) and the Omicron-dominant period, adjusting for age, sex, vaccine type, and booster vaccination. Variants were confirmed by sequencing or spike-gene status in a subset. Results Risk of hospital admission was markedly lower in 1241 residents infected in the Omicron-period (4.01% hospitalised, 95% CI: 2.87-5.59) compared to 398 residents infected in the pre-Omicron period (10.8% hospitalised, 95% CI: 8.13-14.29, adjusted Hazard Ratio 0.50, 95% CI: 0.29-0.87, p=0.014); findings were similar in residents with confirmed variant.

Thus, we investigated the relationship between , life-history strategies, and engagement in risky behaviors among individuals in recovery from alcohol use disorder (AUD). METHODS Data from 110 individuals in recovery from addiction from The International Quit & Recovery Registry, an ongoing online registry designed to understand recovery phenotype, were included in the analysis. The association between life-history strategies, , engagement in risky behaviors, and remission status were assessed. RESULTS Life-history strategy scores were significantly associated with  rates and finance, health, and personal development behaviors after controlling for age, sex, race, ethnicity, years of education, marital status, smoking status, and history of other substance use. Remission status was significantly associated with life-history strategy, , drug use, fitness, health, and safe driving after controlling for age, sex, race, years of education, marital status, and smoking status. In addition, a mediation analysis using Hayes' methods revealed that the discounting rates partially mediated the association between remission status and life-history strategy scores. CONCLUSIONS Life-history strategies and remission status are both significantly associated with  and various health and finance behaviors among individuals in recovery from AUD. This finding supports the characterizations of  as a candidate behavioral marker of addiction that could help differentiate subgroups needing special attention or specific interventions to improve the outcomes of their recovery.

This goes for the learning of movement capability and health but also in relation to outdoor education (OE). The latter a criticized area for having a one-size-fits-all approach to curriculum, with less attention to what to learn in OE, including aspects of everyday practices of being outdoors. The aim of this study was to explore students aged 15 years, and their meaning making of being outdoors expressed in written stories about a favorite place. Two school year eight classes in a Swedish compulsory school situated in an area with high diversity participated. Through this theory-generated empirical study, written stories were explored as one way of evaluating students' meaning making of outdoor places. By using practical epistemology analysis (PEA) to examine experience operationalized through aesthetic judgements attention is paid to the relation between the student and the situation (their favorite place). The analysis make it possible to discern a sense and meaning making of being outdoors as an embodied experience, as a relational whole of the self, others and the environment. Descriptions of aesthetic experiences were analyzed leading to dimensions of environing described as calm and privacy, community and togetherness and feelings and senses. A favorite place was by all students described as a very local and nearby place accessible in everyday life. The analysis generated understandings of feelings of fulfillment and different embodied experiences of what an encounter with an outdoor place or being outdoors could mean. Furthermore, how personal and diverse the meaning making place tends to be and how experience and habits contribute to the students' creation of microenvironments. Dimensions of environing become part of an embodied process. The analysis of the written stories calls for an alternative understanding of what OE can or should consist of. The findings encourage teachers and researchers to consider alternative understandings and practices of OE that highlight and educate students' overall embodied (individual) experiences and learning in OE and PE.","output":"Environing as Embodied ExperienceA Study of Outdoor Education as Part of Physical Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the coming years, mental health care may come into contact with patients who developed psychological complaints related to their critical illness and stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) as a result of COVID-19. However, the experiences of these patients are to date rarely documented. Aim: Gaining insight into the experiences of COVID-ICU-survivors. Methods: 19 COVID-ICU survivors answered a written survey four months after admission. Screening lists measured psychological complaints and sleeping disorders. Visual analogue scales (VAS) measured the influence of the pandemic context and the quality of life. A written survey mapped patient experiences. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively and qualitative data by means of thematic analysis. Results: 50% of the participants experienced psychological complaints or sleeping disorders. A limited social network and media coverage of COVID-19 complicated the recovery process of patients. 19% of the participants experienced a reduced quality of life. A weak social network caused feelings of hopelessness. Still, patients showed great resilience. Conclusion: Most COVID-ICU survivors are resilient enough to integrate their experiences into their lives, despite the challenges the pandemic context poses on their rehabilitation. It is therefore important not to over medicalise psychological complaints that occur during rehabilitation. Our attention needs to be directed to those with a weak social network.

Ervaringen van deze patienten werden tot op heden weinig gedocumenteerd. Doel Inzicht verwerven in de ervaringen van patienten met ic-opname wegens COVID-19. Methode: 19 patienten met ic-opname wegens COVID-19 beantwoordden vier maanden na opname een schriftelijke enquete. Met screeningslijsten maten we psychische klachten en slaapstoornissen. Met visueel-analoge schalen (VAS'sen) maten we de invloed van de pandemische context en de levenskwaliteit. Een geschreven interview bracht patientervaringen in kaart. Kwantitatieve data werden descriptief geanalyseerd en kwalitatieve data thematisch. Resultaten: 50% van de deelnemers ervoer psychische klachten of slaapstoornissen. Een beperkt sociaal netwerk en mediaaandacht voor COVID-19 bemoeilijkten het herstelproces van patienten. 19% van de deelnemers ervoer een verminderde levenskwaliteit. Een zwak sociaal netwerk veroorzaakte gevoelens van hopeloosheid. Toch lieten patienten een grote veerkracht zien. Conclusie: Hoewel de pandemische context uitdagingen stelt aan de revalidatie van COVID-ic-overlevenden, beschikken de meeste patienten over voldoende veerkracht om hun ervaringen te integreren in hun leven. Het is dan ook belangrijk psychische klachten die optreden tijdens revalidatie niet te medicaliseren. Onze aandacht dient te gaan naar degenen met een zwak sociaal netwerk.

STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective single-center study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). Two hundred selected patients with gynecological disease were recruited for the study from May 2008 through December 2009 at Samsung Medical Center. RESULTS Two hundred patients underwent SPA gynecological surgery (105 a total hysterectomy; 11 a subtotal hysterectomy; 43 an oophorectomy; 31 an ovarian cystectomy; 5 a salpingectomy; 2 a myomectomy; 3 adhesiolysis only). The median age and body mass index were 45.5 and 22.9 kg/m(2), respectively. SPA surgery was successfully completed in 187 patients, without the need for ancillary ports (93.5%). Two cases required a conventional multiport, and nine cases needed one additional port. Two patients were converted to a laparotomy. One intra- and five post-operative complications occurred. The complication rate was 3.2% (6/187). The median operative time was 120 min (54-250) for a total hysterectomy, 180 (150-345) for a subtotal hysterectomy, 60 (27-245) for an oophorectomy, 105 (50-185) for a cystectomy, and 60 (30-115) for a salpingectomy. CONCLUSION Single-port surgery was safe and feasible for gynecological indications. Further study of single-port surgery is required to determine whether it has significant benefits compared to conventional techniques.","output":"Single-port access (SPA) laparoscopic surgery in gynecology: a surgeon's experience with an initial 200 cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The pandemic phase 3-mitigation-by the SARS-Coronavirus-2 is currently taking on speed in Germany Skewed distributions of key epidemiological parameters of the virus and patient care are a challenge for the control of the outbreak as well as keeping the system functional Methods The skewed parameters-pre-patency period, incubation period, duration of viral shedding and time to admission to hospital-are analyzed in regard to their impact and possible countermeasures Results The skewed distributions are exclusively time related variables They are a handicap for outbreak control as well patient management Optimization between residual open flanks and the efforts to close them is difficult The main stakeholders are the local health departments, the diagnostic laboratories, the health care infrastructure and finally the citizens in regard to the burden due to non-pharmaceutical interventions including quarantine and isolation The duration of quarantine and isolation should urgently be shortened for health care workers (HCW) as well as people in critical infrastructure by ready (re-) testing Calculated risks have to be taken within a phase 3 of a pandemic to keep a system going Conclusions The skewed distributions are a special challenge for infectious disease control In the case of ending quarantine and isolation in phase 3 of the pandemic, they should be judged specifically in regard to the client/patient Cumulative distribution functions are very helpful in this regard","output":"Challenges in infectious disease control and the current pandemic by skewed distributions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the spring of 2020, New York City was an epicenter of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and mortality. One of the hardest hit areas in New York City was central Brooklyn, where State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate is located. As the severity of the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic waned in New York City, SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University planned to institute COVID-19 surveillance on campus to limit its spread among employees and students. APPROACH: In collaboration with university leadership and students across schools, the SUNY Downstate Contact Tracing Corps was established in July 2020. Using guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the New York State Department of Health, protocols for case and contact investigations, including scripts, were developed. Students were recruited and trained in remote and confidential case and contact investigations. OUTCOMES: From August 1, 2020, to March 23, 2021, there were 185 COVID-19 cases referred to the contact tracing program; of these, 180 were successfully investigated and isolated (97%). Case investigations identified 111 Downstate close contacts; 105 were investigated and quarantined (94.5%). There were 122 exposure-only investigations referred to the program, and 121 were successfully investigated and quarantined (99%). NEXT STEPS: The SUNY Downstate Contact Tracing Corps transitioned to a core group of tracers in January 2021 and has been maintained at 4 to 6 tracers since that time. With the emergence of COVID-19 variants, the threat of new variants, and variable COVID-19 vaccination rates across Brooklyn, Downstate employees and students remain vulnerable to COVID-19 transmission.

Its excessive concentrations in the aqueous environments may result in severe and irreversible damage. To fight this hazard, a raw biochar was prepared from Citrullus lanatus L. seeds, then characterized and compared with a MnFe2O4 modified biochar, both tested for U(VI) adsorption from wastewater, which was assayed for the first time in this study. The characterization of the adsorbent materials was performed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) with elemental mapping, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The effects of solution pH, concentration of sorbate and sorbents, temperature, time and ionic strength were assessed as regards their influence on U(VI) adsorption. The experimental adsorption data showed good fit to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model (reaching a value of qe = 15.12 mg g-1, R2 = 0.96 at equilibrium), and to the Langmuir isotherm (achieving a maximum score of qmax = 27.61 mg g-1, R2 = 0.96). The maximum adsorption capacity was found at 318 K. The results of the study indicate that the binding of negatively charged functional groups (carbonyls, hydroxyls, and some carboxylic groups) with MnFe2O4 significantly enhanced U(VI) adsorption. In view of the overall results, it can be concluded that the MnFe2O4 modification of the Citrullus lanatus L. seeds biochar could give an efficient alternative adsorbent for U(VI) removal in a variety of environmental conditions, simultaneously promoting resource utilization and good sustainable management of the materials studied, aiding to protect the environment and human health.","output":"Utilization of Citrullus lanatus L. seeds to synthesize a novel MnFe2O4-biochar adsorbent for the removal of U(VI) from wastewater: Insights and comparison between modified and raw biochar."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Urgent neurosurgical interventions in pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) are rare. These cases pose an additional stressor on a potentially vulnerable dysregulated inflammatory response which may put the child at risk for further clinical deterioration. Our aim was to describe the perioperative course of SARS-CoV-2 positive pediatric patients who required an urgent neurosurgical intervention. Methods We retrospectively analyzed pediatric patients 18 years of age admitted to a quaternary childrens hospital with a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 virus from March 2020 to October 2021. Clinical characteristics, anesthetic and neurosurgical operative details, surgical outcomes, and non-neurological symptoms were collected and analyzed. Results Eight SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were identified with a mean age of 8.83 years (median 8.5 years; range 0.58 -18 years). 6 of the 8 patients were male. All children had mild disease or were asymptomatic with regards to COVID symptoms. The anesthetic and surgical courses for these patients were overall uncomplicated. All patients were admitted to a specialized isolation unit in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for cardiopulmonary and neurologic monitoring. Increased protective personal equipment (PPE) during anesthesia and the operation did not impede a successful neurosurgical operation. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 positive pediatric patients with minimal COVID-related symptoms who require urgent neurosurgical interventions face unique challenges regarding their anesthetic status, operative delays due to SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and additional PPE requirements.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was approved by the ethical committee of the University of Heidelberg (reference no. S-324/2014). Owing to the retrospective character of the study, the ethical committee did not require any written informed consent. Two groups of 50 patients who underwent at least six consecutive MR imaging examinations with the exclusive use of either a linear GBCA (gadopentetate dimeglumine) or a macrocyclic GBCA (gadoterate meglumine) were analyzed retrospectively. The difference in mean SI ratios of DN to pons and GP to thalamus on unenhanced T1-weighted images from the last and first examinations was calculated. One-sample and independent-sample t tests were used to assess the difference in SI ratios for both groups, and regression analysis was performed to account for potential confounders. RESULTS The SI ratio difference in the linear group was greater than 0 (mean DN difference  standard deviation, 0.0407  0.0398 [P < .001]; GP, 0.0287  0.0275 [P < .001]) and significantly larger (DN, P < .001 and standardized difference of 1.16; GP, P < .001 and standardized difference of 0.81) than that in the macrocyclic group, which did not differ from 0 (DN, 0.0016  0.0266 [P = .680]; GP, 0.0031  0.0354 [P = .538]). The SI ratio difference between the last and first examinations for the DN remained significantly different between the two groups in the regression analysis (P < .001).

As the main source of extracellular fluid removed during HD are the legs, we sought to reduce DIH and increase phosphate removal by using cycling and pneumatic compression, which would potentially provide higher venous return, preserving central blood flow and also offering more phosphate to the dialyzer. METHODS We evaluated 21 patients in a randomized crossover fashion in which each patient underwent 3 different HD: control; cycling exercise during the first 60 min; and pneumatic compression during the first 60 min. Data obtained included bioelectrical impedance, hourly blood pressure measurement, biochemical parameters, and direct quantification of phosphate through the dialysate. DIH was defined as a drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP) 20 mm Hg. RESULTS There was no difference in the ultrafiltration rate (p = 0.628), delta weight (p = 0.415), delta of total, intra and extracellular body water among the control, cycling, and pneumatic compression (p = 0.209, p = 0.348, and p = 0.467 respectively). Delta MAP was less changed by pneumatic compression when compared to control, cycling, and pneumatic compression respectively (-4.7 [-17.2, 8.2], -4.7 [-20.5, -0.2], and -2.3 [-8.1, 9.0] mm Hg; p = 0.021). DIH occurred in 43, 38, and 24% of patients in control, cycling, and pneumatic compression respectively (p = 0.014). Phosphate removal did not increase in any intervention (p = 0.486). Higher phosphate removal was dependent on ultrafiltration, pre dialysis serum phosphate, and higher parathyroid hormone.

METHODS A regional collaboration among public health partners culminated in the design and implementation of the COVID-19 Self-Checker, a local online symptom tracker. The tool collected data on participant demographic characteristics and health history. County residents were then invited to take part in an automated daily electronic follow-up to monitor symptom progression, assess barriers to care and testing, and collect data on COVID-19 test results and symptom resolution. RESULTS Nearly 6500 county residents visited and 1755 residents completed the COVID-19 Self-Checker from April 30 through June 9, 2020.

In California, as well as in many water-scarce areas, water reclamation, recycling, and reuse are integral components of water resource planning and management. Historically, the driving motivation for water recycling was to supplement scarce resources and to provide alternatives to effluent disposal into surface waters. The California State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) adopted a Recycled Water Policy that moves towards the sustainable management of surface waters and groundwater, together with enhanced water conservation, water reuse, and the use of stormwater. In California, the practice of planned potable reuse has occurred in the form of indirect potable reuse (IPR), including an environmental buffer, for over 50 years. California's experience has demonstrated that planned potable reuse using IPR can be practiced without having any apparent detrimental effects on public health. In 2018 the State Water Board adopted surface water augmentation regulations(1) that establish minimum uniform water recycling criteria for he planned placement of recycled water into a surface water reservoir that is used as a source of domestic drinking water supply.

In this study, we investigated whether three detection dogs could learn the odor from dead spotted lanternfly egg masses and if so, whether that would allow them to recognize live spotted lanternfly egg masses. We found that dogs could be trained to find dead spotted lanternfly egg masses, and could learn to ignore relevant controls, with high levels of sensitivity and specificity (up to 94.6% and 92.8%, respectively). Further, we found that after the training, dogs could find live spotted lanternfly egg masses without additional training and returned to previous levels of sensitivity and specificity within a few sessions. Coded videos of training and testing sessions showed that dogs spent more time at the egg masses than at controls, as expected from training. These results suggest that dead spotted lanternfly egg masses could be a useful training aid for spotted lanternfly detection dogs.","output":"Egg masses as training aids for spotted lanternfly Lycorma delicatula detection dogs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of the COVID-19 crisis on the digital economy has been profound How and whether the widespread adoption of teleworking, telehealth and remote learning will continue after the crisis subsides is a matter for policy debate Digital inclusion will, in any case, be important This issue of the Journal publishes four public policy papers, two of which arise from the NBN Futures Forum in February 2020 The other two provide contrasting views on the rising influence of China on the Internet The issue also contains five more technical papers and a historical reprint The Journal welcomes contributions on telecommunications and the digital economy ? 2020 Telecommunications Association Inc All right reserved","output":"The digital economy lights up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pharmacy programs face a challenge in ensuring that all graduates obtain jobs that fulfill their goals and ambitions as pharmacists, given the limited availability of conventional positions in the workforce.

This is a relevant issue when millions of vapers (and smokers) must remain under indoor confinement and/or share public outdoor spaces with non-users. The fact that the respiratory flow associated with vaping is visible (as opposed to other respiratory activities) clearly delineates a safety distance of 1C2 m along the exhaled jet to prevent direct exposure. Vaping is a relatively infrequent and intermittent respiratory activity for which we infer a mean emission rate of 79.82 droplets per puff (6C200, standard deviation 74.66) comparable to mouth breathing, it adds into shared indoor spaces (home and restaurant scenarios) a 1% extra risk of indirect COVID-19 contagion with respect to a control case of existing unavoidable risk from continuous breathing. As a comparative reference, this added relative risk increases to 44C176% for speaking 6C24 min per hour and 260% for coughing every 2 min. Mechanical ventilation decreases absolute emission levels but keeps the same relative risks. As long as direct exposure to the visible exhaled jet is avoided, wearing of face masks effectively protects bystanders and keeps risk estimates very low. As a consequence, protection from possible COVID-19 contagion through vaping emissions does not require extra interventions besides the standard recommendations to the general population: keeping a social separation distance of 2 m and wearing of face masks.","output":"Aerial Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus through Environmental E-Cigarette Aerosols: Implications for Public Policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 death rate increases exponentially with age, and the main risk factors are having underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, severe chronic respiratory disease and cancer.

We review opioid use following wrist and ankle fracture fixation across Scotland, establishing prescribing patterns and associations with patient, injury, or perioperative factors. Six Scottish orthopedic units contributed. A total of 598 patients were included. Patient demographics were similar across all sites. There was variation in anesthetic practice, length of stay, and AO fracture type (p < 0.01). For wrist fractures, 85.6% of patients received a discharge opioid prescription; 5.0% contained a strong opioid. There was no significant variation across the six units in prescribing practice. For ankle fractures, 82.7% of patients received a discharge opioid prescription; 17% contained a strong opioid. Dundee and Edinburgh used more strong opioids; Inverness and Paisley gave the least opioids overall (p < 0.01). Younger patient age, location, and length of stay were independent predictors of increased prescription on binary regression. Despite variability in perioperative practices, discharge opioid analgesic prescription remains overwhelmingly consistent. We believe that the biggest influence lies with the prescriber-institutional standard practice.

Likewise, these competencies are necessary to be able to operate as individuals in todays society. In view of this situation, in the future post-COVID-19 educational model it is necessary to design training programs that promote both hard skills (specific competencies) and soft skills. This fact brings to the table the need for university teachers to have an optimal level of soft skills so that their students can acquire them. Given this situation, this paper aims to analyze the degree of acquisition of this type of competencies in American university teachers from different regions: (i) North America;(ii) Central America, and (iii) Southern Cone. To achieve this objective, it has been necessary to develop a questionnaire on the self-concept of soft skills, based on several variables: (i) gender, (ii) age range, (iii) geographic area, (iv) area of knowledge, (v) years of teaching experience, and (vi) university tenure (public-private). The questionnaire developed was based on the soft skills included in the Bochum Inventory of Personality and Competences (BIP). Results, obtained by descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of the means and deviations of the data collected from a sample of 473 participants, reflect that, in general, the American university teachers have a high self-concept about their degree of soft skills development.

Recently, the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China required the establishment of the system of 'High-quality Online and Offline Courses', which indicates that online courses will play an important role in higher education. Furthermore, the number of pathologists currently cannot satisfy clinical needs. To solve this health issue and implement the policy from the Ministry of Education, it is necessary to improve the current state of pathology education. First, we need to know students' opinions of the current courses and their professional choices. METHODS: Online questionnaires covering the quality of traditional courses, attitudes towards online courses, and suggestions for optimizing courses were designed and applied. Whether students want to become pathologists and the underlying reasons for this interest are also included in this survey. Participants are medical students from certain colleges in Nanjing. The collected data were assessed by statistical analyses, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: Of the 342 valid responses, 60.94% of undergraduate students showed their interest in pathology courses, and among them, 48.72% expressed that they may become pathologists. However, the corresponding percentage is only 29.59% in the group without interest. To optimize curricula, the top two suggestions are introducing more clinical cases (undergraduate students, 64.45%; graduate students, 79.09%) and making the classes lively and interesting (undergraduate students, 59.77%; graduate students, 62.79%). Approximately 80.00% of students consider online courses to be good supplementary materials to traditional courses, and approximately half prefer an online-offline mixed learning model. Salary, interest, and employment status are the main factors influencing students' professional choices. CONCLUSIONS: Students are generally satisfied with traditional pathology courses, and online courses are good supplementary materials in their opinions. It has been suggested that clinical cases be introduced in classes. It is more likely that students who have an interest in pathology will become pathologists. The data from this survey also show that the main causes of the shortage of pathologists are a lack of engaging work and an unsatisfactory salary.","output":"A survey on the attitudes of Chinese medical students towards current pathology education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preparing the world to manage future pandemics must take priority.

Crude CFRs could by biased by larger proportions of older COVID-19 cases in population data, who are also at increased mortality risk. Such distorted age case structures are a common feature of selective COVID 19 testing strategies in many countries, and they potentially mask underlying differences arising from other important factors such as health system burden. Methods We used the method of direct case-age standardisation to evaluate the effects of age variations on CFRs. Data on cases and death by age from Italy, Spain, China, Australia and South Korea were analysed to derive standardised CFRs. Findings were compared across different case age distribution references as standards. Results Using the South Korean case age distribution as a standard, the fivefold higher crude CFR for Italy is reduced to less than two-fold after adjustment, while the crude CFR difference for Spain is virtually eliminated. The adjusted CFR for Australia is the lowest among all countries. Discussion Mortality differences based on crude CFRs are exaggerated by age structures, which are effectively controlled by case age standardization. Residual CFR differences could be attributed to health and health system factors.

However, beyond the study of specific peptides, there is a lack of understanding of how peptide physicochemical properties affect nanoparticle pharmacokinetics, particularly in the context of traumatic brain injury (TBI). We engineered nanoparticle surfaces with peptides that possess a range of physicochemical properties and evaluated their distribution after two routes of administration: direct injection into a healthy mouse brain and systemic delivery in a mouse model of TBI. In both administration routes, we found that peptide-modified nanoparticle pharmacokinetics were influenced by the charge characteristics of the peptide. When peptide-modified nanoparticles are delivered directly into the brain, nanoparticles modified with positively charged peptides displayed restricted distribution from the injection site compared to nanoparticles modified with neutral, zwitterionic, or negatively charged peptides. After intravenous administration in a TBI mouse model, positively charged peptide-modified nanoparticles accumulated more in off-target organs, including the heart, lung, and kidneys, than zwitterionic, neutral, or negatively charged peptide-modified nanoparticles. The increase in off-target organ accumulation of positively charged peptide-modified nanoparticles was concomitant with a relative decrease in accumulation in the injured brain compared to zwitterionic, neutral, or negatively charged peptide-modified nanoparticles. Understanding how nanoparticle pharmacokinetics are influenced by the physicochemical properties of peptides presented on the nanoparticle surface is relevant to the development of nanoparticle-based TBI therapeutics and broadly applicable to nanotherapeutic design, including synthetic nanoparticles and viruses.

All cases were mapped across the continental US using geographic information systems modelling to examine how prevalence rates varied geographically. RESULTS Overall, 208 720 of 3 453 944 (6.04%) subjects were diagnosed with chalazion during the study period. Prevalence was highest in coastal regions. The mean age of the population was 69.3213.9 years and most patients were male (93.47%), white (77.13%) and non-Hispanic (93.72%). Factors associated with chalazion risk included smoking (OR=1.12, p<0.0005), conditions of the tear film (blepharitis (OR=4.84, p<0.0005), conjunctivitis (OR=2.78, p<0.0005), dry eye (OR=3.0, p<0.0005)), conditions affecting periocular skin (eyelid dermatitis (OR=2.95, p<0.0005), rosacea (OR=2.50, p<0.0005)), allergic conditions (history of allergies (OR=1.56, p<0.0005)) and systemic disorders (gastritis (OR=1.54, p<0.0005), irritable bowel syndrome (OR=1.45, p<0.0005), depression (OR=1.35, p<0.0005), anxiety (OR=1.31, p<0.0005)). These factors remained associated with chalazion risk when examined concomitantly. CONCLUSION Periocular skin, eyelid margin and tear film abnormalities were most strongly associated with risk for chalazion. The impact of environmental conditions on risk for chalazion represents an area in need of further study.","output":"Prevalence and risk factors for chalazion in an older veteran population."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, we release COVID-Twitter-BERT (CT-BERT), a transformer-based model, pretrained on a large corpus of Twitter messages on the topic of COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE To describe components of obstructive upper airway syndrome in a nonbrachycephalic terrier breed. ANIMALS Sixteen Norwich Terriers; 12 with and 4 without clinical signs of respiratory disease. METHODS Prospective case series. Physical and laryngoscopic examinations were performed by 1 investigator in all dogs. Medical and surgical interventions were summarized and results of follow-up examination or owner reports were recorded. RESULTS The study population was comprised of 9 females (6 intact) and 7 males (5 intact). Median age was 3.0 years (range, 0.5-11 years). Of 12 dogs presented for a respiratory complaint, physical examination was normal in 4 dogs. Laryngoscopic examination was abnormal in 11/12 dogs with redundant supra-arytenoid folds, laryngeal collapse, everted laryngeal saccules, and a narrowed laryngeal opening in most. Of 4 dogs lacking clinical signs, all had normal physical examination; however, 3/4 dogs had similar appearance of the larynx to dogs with clinical signs. Response to surgical intervention was minimal to moderate in all dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Norwich Terriers suffer from an upper airway obstructive syndrome that differs from that encountered in brachycephalic breeds. Affected dogs are difficult to identify without laryngoscopic examination because of the lack of clinical signs and abnormalities in physical examination findings, despite severe airway obstruction. Care is warranted when anesthetizing Norwich Terriers because of the small size of the laryngeal opening.","output":"Upper airway obstruction in Norwich Terriers: 16 cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID\\\\19 has stricken more than 203,000 people in Italy up to 30(th) of April 2020, with over 27,000 died according to official estimates(1).

In clinical studies, however, standard DNA injection alone generally induces low levels of transgene-specific immunity when compared to other vaccine approaches. In order to boost the immunogenicity of this platform, next-generation DNA vaccines require additional techniques such as the administration of electroporation. This new method involves the generation of a brief electric field in tissue around a local injection site that results in the transient poration, or permeabilization, of the cellular membranes. As a result, antigen-specific immune responses are greatly enhanced and are likely due to increased DNA uptake and antigen expression. Thus, electroporation-mediated DNA vaccination represents a promising new strategy for the elicitation of strong immune responses directed against the expressed antigen(s) and not the vector, and ongoing studies are currently underway to optimize the working parameters of this technique. Here, we review the uses of this technology in conjunction with vaccination and suggest future directions for its further exploration.","output":"Electroporation-Mediated DNA Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have become a major cause of premature mortality and disabilities in China due to factors concomitant with rapid economic growth and urbanisation over three decades.

We analyzed sixty SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify regions that could work as virus-encoded miRNA seed sponges and potentially bind to human miRNA seed sites and prevent interaction with their native targets thereby relieving native miRNA suppression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionally conserved single-stranded RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by disrupting translation. MiRNAs are key players in variety of biological processes that regulate differentiation, development and activation of immune cells in both innate and adaptive immunity. We find 34 miRNAs for positive-sense viral RNA and 45 miRNAs for negative-sense that can strongly bind to certain key SARS-CoV-2 genes. The disruption and dysfunction of miRNAs may perturb the immune response and stimulate the release of inflammatory cytokines altering the cellular response to viral infection.

The time horizon was 5 years. A discount rate of 5% was applied to both costs and outcomes. The health outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs were identified, quantified, and valorized from a payer perspective; therefore, only direct health costs were included. An incremental analysis was estimated to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).

In addition to restrictions in the inpatient health care sector, the maintenance of outpatient care by health care providers has also been affected by the pandemic-related restrictions. Both a decline in treatment frequencies and temporary practice closures have been observed. The aim of the study was to survey the work and care situation in outpatient physiotherapy practices during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous online survey including quantitative and qualitative items was conducted among physiotherapists in the outpatient sector in Germany between June 1 and August 31, 2020. The survey is part of the mixed-methods study ArTheCo, which was conducted throughout Germany including outpatient therapists and patients in physiotherapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy. RESULTS: In total, 577 physiotherapists from all over Germany took part in the survey. During the first wave of the pandemic, the occupancy rate fell below 50% at 45% of the facilities. 15% of the facilities had to close temporarily. Short-time work was announced at 58% of the respondents practices. This and the implementation of hygiene measures restricted the provision of physiotherapy. This mainly affected patients with a higher risk of a severe clinical course of disease, such as nursing home patients. Due to complex changes in practice organisation and patient care, many of the interviewees felt that their economic existence was threatened and also described a large physical and psychological burden. Existing dissatisfaction seemed to have increased by the pandemic. DISCUSSION: To maintain continuous physical therapy, a reorganisation of the reimbursement system as well as easily accessible, consistent and feasible action plans for practices are needed. In combination with threats to existence due to the pandemic and increasing skill shortage, the outpatient physiotherapeutic care also appears to be threatened beyond the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The current pandemic has highlighted long-standing challenges causing dissatisfaction and making the profession increasingly unattractive for some of the respondents. Political action to support physiotherapists needs to be initiated. This study indicates potential starting points.","output":"Einfluss der COVID-19 Pandemie auf die ambulante Physiotherapie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Informal caregivers are people providing some type of unpaid, ongoing assistance to a person with a chronic illness or disability. Long-term care measures and policies cannot take place without taking into account the quantitatively crucial role played by informal caregivers. We use the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS), the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS), and the Study on Health and Ageing in Europe (SHARE) to measure the prevalence of informal caregivers in the European population, and analyze associated socio-demographic factors. This rate ranges between about 13 percent in Portugal and Spain, and more than 22 percent in Luxembourg, Belgium, and Denmark. It declines in older age groups and, on average, is lower in men than in women in all countries studied, and lower among the poorly educated compared to those with higher levels of education.

Targeted measures such as case isolation and contact tracing can alleviate the societal cost of lock-downs by containing the spread where and when it occurs. To assess the relative and combined impact of manual contact tracing (MCT) and digital (app-based) contact tracing, we feed a compartmental model for COVID-19 with high-resolution datasets describing contacts between individuals in several contexts. We show that the benefit (epidemic size reduction) is generically linear in the fraction of contacts recalled during MCT and quadratic in the app adoption, with no threshold effect. The cost (number of quarantines) versus benefit curve has a characteristic parabolic shape, independent of the type of tracing, with a potentially high benefit and low cost if app adoption and MCT efficiency are high enough.

We assessed whether demand for self-managed medication abortion provided by online telemedicine increased following the emergence of COVID-19. METHODS: We examined 3915 requests for self-managed abortion to online telemedicine service Women on Web (WoW) between 1 January 2019 and 1 June 2020. We used regression discontinuity to compare request rates in eight European countries before and after they implemented lockdown measures to slow COVID-19 transmission. We examined the prevalence of COVID-19 infection, the degree of government-provided economic support, the severity of lockdown travel restrictions and the medication abortion service provision model in countries with and without significant changes in requests. RESULTS: Five countries showed significant increases in requests to WoW, ranging from 28% in Northern Ireland (97 requests vs 75.8 expected requests, p=0.001) to 139% in Portugal (34 requests vs 14.2 expected requests, p<0.001). Two countries showed no significant change in requests, and one country, Great Britain, showed an 88% decrease in requests (1 request vs 8.1 expected requests, p<0.001). Among countries with significant increases in requests, abortion services are provided mainly in person in hospitals or abortion is unavailable and international travel was prohibited during lockdown. By contrast, Great Britain implemented a fully remote no-test telemedicine service. CONCLUSION: These marked changes in requests for self-managed medication abortion during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate demand for remote models of care, which could be fulfilled by expanding access to medication abortion by telemedicine.","output":"Demand for self-managed online telemedicine abortion in eight European countries during the COVID-19 pandemic: a regression discontinuity analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-COV2 (Covid19) pandemic has a scaring burden on hospitals and health care providers all over the world. Unfortunately, after one year of pandemic, millions of persons are infected either mild symptoms or critical ones and unexplained deaths. Till now, No effective treatment or vaccination.

However, there is scarce evidence on which theories are best suited to addressing the inherent complexity of eHealth implementation. OBJECTIVE The objectives of this systematic review are to identify theories that inform and explain eHealth implementation and to classify these theories using the typology by Sovacool and Hess for theories of sociotechnical change. METHODS An electronic search was conducted in the PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Sociological Source Ultimate, Web of Science, ABI/INFORM, EBSCO, and ProQuest databases in June 2019. Studies were included if they were published between 2009 and June 2019; were written in English; reported on empirical research, regardless of study or publication type; reported on one or more theories in the context of eHealth implementation; and were published in a peer-reviewed journal. A total of 2 reviewers independently assessed the titles, abstracts, and full texts. Theories identified were classified using a typology for theories of sociotechnical change, which was considered a useful tool for ordering and analyzing the diverse theoretical approaches as a basis for future theory building. RESULTS Of the 13,101 potentially relevant titles, 119 studies were included. The review identified 36 theories used to explain implementation approaches in eHealth. The most commonly used approaches were the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (n=33) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) (n=32). These theories were primarily concerned with individual and interpersonal elements of eHealth acceptance. Less common were theories that reflect the various disorderly social processes and structural dimensions of implementation, such as the normalization process theory (n=17) and the structuration theory (n=6). CONCLUSIONS Theories currently informing the implementation of eHealth interventions predominantly focus on predicting or explaining end-user acceptance. Theoretical perspectives that capture the dense and intricate relationships and structures required to enact sustainable change are less well represented in the eHealth literature. Given the growing acknowledgment of the inherent complexity of eHealth implementation, future research should develop and test models that recognize and reflect the multidimensional, dynamic, and relational nature of this process.","output":"Theories Informing eHealth Implementation: Systematic Review and Typology Classification."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two cases of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with the B.1.351 variant were reported in France in mid-January, 2020.

METHODS: The patients demographic information, cancer history, treatment pattern, information about MERS-coronavirus (CoV) infection, history of travel, clinical symptoms, test results, and outcome were collected and analyzed as part of a quality improvement project to improve the care and safety of our patients. Only patients with confirmed infection were included. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were identified, with a median age of 66 years (range, 16-88 years), and 12 patients (63%) were males. The most common underlying disease was hematologic malignancies (47.4%), followed by colorectal cancer (21%) and lung cancer (15.8%). Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbidities (57.9% and 52.6%, respectively). Infection was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal swab in all patients. All patients contracted the infection during their hospitalization for other reasons. Sixteen patients (80%) were admitted to the intensive care unit; 13 patients (81%) had acute respiratory distress syndrome, 11 were intubated (68.75%), 9 had acute renal injury (56.25%), and 3 required dialysis (18.75%). Only 3 patients (15.8%) with early-stage cancers survived. Patients with hematologic malignancies and advanced solid tumors had a 100% case fatality rate.

The objective of the current study was to develop a video-based instrument, SARAhome , for measuring ataxia severity easily and independently at home. METHODS Based on feasibility of self-application, we selected 5 SARA items (gait, stance, speech, nose-finger test, fast alternating hand movements) for SARAhome (range, 0-28). We compared SARAhome items with total SARA scores in 526 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, and 6 from the EUROSCA natural history study. To prospectively validate the SARAhome , we directly compared the self-applied SARAhome and the conventional SARA in 50 ataxia patients. To demonstrate feasibility of independent home recordings in a pilot study, 12 ataxia patients were instructed to obtain a video each morning and evening over a period of 14 days. All videos were rated offline by a trained rater. RESULTS SARAhome extracted from the EUROSCA baseline data was highly correlated with conventional SARA (r = 0.9854, P < 0.0001). In the prospective validation study, the SARAhome was highly correlated with the conventional SARA (r = 0.9254, P < 0.0001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Adult patients with adrenal metastases who underwent percutaneous image-guided adrenal ablation during the years 2003-2012 were identified. There were 32 patients with 37 adrenal tumors identified. Technical success, safety, local control, and survival were analyzed according to standard criteria. RESULTS In 32 patients (25 men and 7 women; mean age, 66 y; age range, 44-88 y) with 37 adrenal tumors, 35 ablation procedures were performed. One patient with an 8.2-cm tumor underwent planned cryoablation debulking fully anticipating untreated margins owing to close proximity of the pancreas (ie, the intent was to diminish tumor burden rather than a curative intervention). Of the 36 patients treated with curative intent, technical success was achieved in 35 (97%) tumors. Follow-up imaging was performed on 34 of 37 tumors (excluding patients with intentional debulking [n = 1], technical failure [n = 1], and absence of follow-up [n = 1]).

White matter injury after TBI is characterized by axon damage and demyelination, resulting in neural network impairment and neurological deficit. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can promote white matter repair. The activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR) has been reported to promote microglia/macrophages towards anti-inflammatory state and therefore to promote axon regeneration. Bexarotene, an agonist of retinoid X receptor (RXR), can activate RXR/PPAR heterodimers. The aim of the present study was to identify the effect of bexarotene on BDNF in microglia/macrophages and axon sprouting after TBI in mice. Bexarotene was administered intraperitoneally in C57BL/6 mice undergoing controlled cortical impact (CCI). PPAR dependency was determined by intraperitoneal administration of a PPAR antagonist T0070907. We found that bexarotene promoted axon regeneration indicated by increased growth associated protein 43 (GAP43) expression, myelin basic protein (MBP) expression, and biotinylated dextran amine (BDA)+ axon sprouting. Bexarotene also increased microglia/macrophages-specific brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression after TBI. In addition, bexarotene reduced the number of pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophages while increased the number of anti-inflammatory microglia/macrophages after TBI. Moreover, bexaortene inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. In addition, bexarotene treatment improved neurological scores and cognitive function of CCI-injured mice. These effects of bexarotene were partially abolished by T0070907.

While outcomes from legalization reforms in other jurisdictions mostly rely on US-based data have been assessed to be mixed, Canadian data are only emerging. We compiled select population-level data on key indicators to gauge initial developments from pre- to post-legalization of cannabis in Canada. METHODS: We examined indicators data focusing on the following topics: prevalence of cannabis use, frequency of use, methods/products of consumption, driving after cannabis use, and cannabis sourcing. Indicator data were obtained mostly from national and some provincial population surveys. Prevalence or percentages for the indicators pre- and post-legalization (e.g., 2017- 2020), including confidence intervals were reported, with changes noted, as available in and indicated by the data sources. RESULTS: Data suggested selected increases in cannabis use prevalence, mostly among mid- and older- but possibly also younger (e.g., under legal use age) users. Frequency of use and driving after cannabis use among active users do not appear to have changed. Methods of cannabis use show diversifying trends, with decreases in smoking and increases in alternatives use modes (e.g., edibles, vaping). There is a clearly increasing trend towards accessing cannabis from legal sources among adults, while under-legal-use-age youth do not appear to experience heightened barriers to obtaining cannabis in legalization contexts. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary indicators on cannabis legalization in Canada show a mixed picture, some similar to US-based developments. While some use increases are observed, these do not necessarily represent indications of increases in cannabis-related harm, also since key (e.g., hospitalization or injury) data are lacking to date. There is a gradual embracing of legal supply sources of cannabis among users, which can be expected to serve public health and safety objectives.

However, there appears to be no well-established medication treatment available that can do this reliably at the present time. Anti-malarials currently being evaluated, i.e., chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, are not yet established as effective medications, and antiviral agents, including remdesivir, are only weakly active. This position paper report is focused on the modulation of the cytokine storm since it appears to be a major cause of the multi-organ failure in COVID-19. Whereas corticosteroids are not recommended in patients not on mechanical ventilation, immunotherapy with convalescent plasma and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) have been used with some success in COVID-19. There is emerging new evidence that polyvalent immunoglobulins (PVIG) from bovine colostrum given orally can also modulate the immune response. Research using lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from colorectal cancer patients (a so called micro-cytokine storm) has shown that PVIG block the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and stimulate the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. We have been able to confirm these results in a similar model using mononuclear cells from healthy subjects and could demonstrate that the modulations produced by PVIG are quantitatively and qualitatively similar to those obtained using human immunoglobulin (IVIG). Both immunoglobulins reduce the lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL-) 12/23p40 (-90%), IL-6 (-75%) and TNF-&#945; (-60%) and increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 (+75%). Evidence is presented that PVIG can produce anti-inflammatory effects similar to these after oral application in patients. Its use is contraindicated in patients with lactose intolerance but is otherwise safe and free of complications in clinical studies including the treatment of infants with gastrointestinal disorders.

The average PVC burden was determined by calculating the number of PVCs in total beats. Those who had a PVC burden >0.5% were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of adverse fetal or neonatal events. The adverse outcomes were compared between the groups to assess the impact of PVCs on pregnancy. RESULTS A total of 103 (1.68%) women with a PVC burden >0.5% were recorded. Among them, 17 adverse events (12 cases) were documented, which was significantly higher than that among women without PVCs (11.65% vs. 2.93%, p < .01). The median PVC burden among pregnant women with PVCs was 2.84% (1.02%-6.1%). Furthermore, compared with that of the women without adverse events, the median PVC burden of women with adverse fetal or neonatal outcomes was significantly higher (9.02% vs. 2.30%, p < .01).

Methods: Participants were infants born very preterm (n = 20). The speech environment of each infant was assessed at 32-36 weeks postmenstrual age using a speech-counting device known as a Starling. Speech rates were averaged for each infant over the 4-week period. Average rates of weight gain (g/kg/day) were ascertained over the same period. Calories were derived from charted intake (kcals/kg/day). Linear regressions examined associations between weight gain and both caloric intake and speech counts. Control analyses explored whether effects remained after controlling for family visitation, time in incubator, and health acuity. Results: Infants who received more calories gained more weight, accounting for more than 30% of the variance. Importantly, speech counts accounted for nearly 29% additional variance (p < .001). These effects were not reduced when controlling for family visitation, time in incubator, or health acuity. Conclusions: Enhancing speech exposure in the NICU may be beneficial for physical growth. NICU infant care plans should consider opportunities to increase speech exposure.","output":"Investigating relations between the NICU speech environment and weight gain in infants born very preterm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this COVID era, when many struggle to work remotely, methotrexate (MTX) has been doing so all along.

Relations between credit risk and macroeconomic drivers that have been fairly stable over decades have broken down. An example is the unemployment rate which has been widely used in predicting default rates in retail loan segments. Since mid-2020 this no longer works because of government interventions like monthly payments to citizens which allows them to service their debt despite suffering income loss due to unemployment or business closures. This results in substantially lower default rates than predicted by credit models. In this article, using data published by the US Federal Reserve Bank in Q1 2021, a framework is suggested that quantifies the effect of central bank and government interventions and shows how to include intervention scenarios into credit models improving the accuracy of their short-term predictions and allowing analysts to evaluate long-term scenarios. Furthermore, potential side-effects of intervention like increased inflation are quantified.","output":"Credit Risk Modeling in the Presence of Central Bank and Government Intervention (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research into stalking victimization has proliferated over the last three decades, but little research has been done with Canadian data and several theoretical questions related to stalking victimization risk remain largely unanswered. To address the gaps in the literature, this study advances an integrated approach of neighborhood social support from criminology and comorbidity model from health science to examine the correlates of stalking victimization. Relying on data from Canadian General Social Survey, results confirm that the correlation model is better justifiable than the causal model in exploring the relationships between risk factors and being stalked and that variables broadly derived from social support theory, such as community order and trust, are statistically significant correlates of stalking victimization. In addition, most variables in the comorbidity model are significant correlates of stalking victimization. We conclude that social contexts and individual life habits are both important for the risk of stalking victimization.","output":"Correlates of stalking victimization in Canada: A model of social support and comorbidity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last 5 years, frequent outbreaks of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) are observed in both broiler and layer chicken flocks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in spite of extensive usage of vaccines. The IBV is a widespread avian coronavirus affecting both vaccinated and unvaccinated chicken flocks and is attributed to significant economic losses, around the globe. In the present study, 58 (n = 58) samples were collected from four different commercial poultry flocks from 8 KSA districts during 2019. A total of nine positive isolates (9/58; 15.5%), based on real-time reverse transcriptase PCR targeting nucleocapsid (N) gene, were used for further genetic characterization and evolutionary analysis. Genetic characterization of the partial spike (S1) gene revealed the clustering of the reported isolates into three different genotypes, whereas four additional isolates were grouped within 4/91 genotype, two isolates within IS/885 genotype, one isolate was closely related to IS/1494/06, and two isolates were grouped within classic serotype (vaccine-like strains). Phylodynamic revealed clustering of four isolated viruses within GI-13 lineage, three isolates within GI-23 lineage, and two isolates within GI-1 lineage. Results indicate that there are high evolutionary distances between the newly identified IBV strains in this study and the commercially used vaccines (GI-1), suggesting that IBV strains circulating in the KSA are under constant evolutionary pressures. Selective pressure biostatistics analyses consistently demonstrate the presence of a higher positive score which highlights the role of natural selection, a mechanism of virus evolution on sites located on the protein surface, within or nearby domains involved in viral attachment or related functions. Recombination analysis revealed emergence of two isolates through recombination events resulting in new recombinant viruses. Taken together, these finding demonstrate the genetic and evolutionary insights into the currently circulating IBV genotypes in KSA, which could help to better understand the origin, spread, and evolution of infectious bronchitis viruses, and to ascertain the importance of disease monitoring as well as re-evaluation for the currently used vaccines and vaccination programs.","output":"Evolutionary Analysis of Infectious Bronchitis Virus Reveals Marked Genetic Diversity and Recombination Events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 threatens the lives and property safety of countless people and brings a tremendous pressure to health care systems worldwide. The principal challenge in the fight against this disease is the lack of efficient detection methods. AI-assisted diagnosis based on deep learning can detect COVID-19 cases for chest X-ray images automatically, and also improve the accuracy and efficiency of doctors' diagnosis. However, large scale annotation of chest X-ray images is difficult because of limited resources and heavy burden on the medical system. To meet the challenge, we propose a capsule network model with multi-head attention routing algorithm, called MHA-CoroCapsule, to provide fast and accurate diagnostics for COVID-19 diseases from chest X-ray images. The MHA-CoroCapsule consists of convolutional layers, two capsule layers, and a non-iterative, parameterized multi-head attention routing algorithm is used to quantify the relationship between the two capsule layers. The experiments are performed on a combined dataset constituted by two publicly available datasets including normal, non-COVID pneumonia and COVID-19 images. The model achieves the accuracy of 97.28%, recall of 97.36%, and precision of 97.38% even with a limited number of samples. The experimental results demonstrate that, contrary to the transfer learning and deep feature extraction approaches, the proposed MHA-CoroCapsule has an encouraging performance with fewer trainable parameters and does not require pretraining and plenty of training samples.","output":"MHA-CoroCapsule: Multi-Head Attention Routing-based Capsule Network for COVID-19 chest X-ray image classification."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Digital proximity tracing applications were rolled out early in the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries to complement conventional contact tracing. Empirical evidence about their benefits for pandemic response remains scarce. We evaluated the effectiveness and usefulness of 'COVIDSafe', Australia's national smartphone-based proximity tracing application for COVID-19. Methods: In this prospective study, conducted in New South Wales, Australia between May and November 2020, we calculated the positive predictive value and sensitivity of COVIDSafe, its additional contact yield, and the number of averted public exposure events. Semi-structured interviews with public health staff were conducted to assess the application's usefulness. Results: There were 619 confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 25,300 close contacts during the study period. COVIDSafe was used by 137 (22%) cases and detected 79 (0.3%) close contacts. It had a positive predictive value of 39% and a sensitivity of 15%, and detected 17 (0.07%) additional close contacts that were not identified by conventional contact tracing. The application generated a substantial additional workload for public health staff and was not considered useful. Conclusions: COVIDSafe was not sufficiently effective to make a meaningful contribution to the COVID-19 response in Australia's most populous state over a 6-month period.

The differential expression of these genes between male and female were analyzed in normal and tumor patients, and further analyzed in different locations of normal and tumor tissues to find out risk factors affecting the infection rate and mortality. Results: In our study, we identified that in the lung tissue, the expression level of ACE2, TMPRSS2, NRP1 and FURIN genes in male patients were higher than those in female patients. In all normal tissues of patients: NRP1, FURIN and NSP1 genes were significantly higher expressed in female. In all tumor tissues of patients: ACE2, FURIN and IL-6 genes were significantly higher expressed in male, while TMPRSS2, CD4, CD8, NLRP3, NSP1 and TNF genes were significantly higher expressed in female. Conclusions: The significant differential expression of SARS-COV-2 receptor related genes and immune response related genes between male and female patients may be the reason for the difference in COVID-19 infection rate and mortality.

There is a trend towards improved psychological outcomes following intervention, particularly when psychologist-led. However, there was considerable heterogeneity within interventions, outcome measures, and timing of assessment precluding numeric synthesis. Methodological limitations including non-blinding, absence of stratification, and underpowered studies were also pervasive.

This study aimed to assess the relationship between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), as well as tobacco use (cigarette and electronic cigarettes), on asthma severity among adults with current asthma, with stratification by sex to understand potential biological sex differences. Methods: The study population consisted of Californian adults 18 years or older with self-reported physician/health care diagnosis of asthma and still having current asthma from 2020 California Health Interview Survey. All descriptive statistics and analyses were sex-stratified and survey-weighted. Crosstabulations were used to understand the association between asthma attack and ETS or firsthand smoke exposure, while binary logistic regression models were used to assess the effect of ETS exposure, current smoking status, and control variables on asthma attack in the past 12 months, with a sub-analysis among non-smoking adults with asthma. Results: Among the primary variable of interest, 35% of males and 30% of females reported ETS exposure in the past 12 months, while 13% of males and 6% of females reported being a current smoker. Past year asthma attack was reported among 43% and 55% of males and females, respectively.

We consider a scenario with two localities where disease originates in one locality and is exported to the neighboring locality via travel of exposed (latently infected) individuals. We establish a lower bound on the outbreak size at the origin as a function of the speed of spread. Using the lower bound on the outbreak size at the origin, we establish an upper bound on the outbreak size at the importing locality as a function of the speed of spread and the level of preparedness for the low mobility regime. We evaluate the critical levels of preparedness that stop the disease from spreading at the importing locality. Finally, we show how the benefit of preparedness diminishes under high mobility rates. Our results highlight the importance of preparedness at localities where cases are beginning to rise such that localities can help stop local outbreaks when they respond to the severity of outbreaks in neighboring localities.","output":"Reacting to outbreaks at neighboring localities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forecasting COVID-19 disease severity is key to supporting clinical decision making and assisting resource allocation, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs).

ICU admission was the primary outcome used to define disease severity. We developed a stacking ensemble machine learning model including the backscattered signal features (optical fingerprint), patient comorbidities, and age (AUROC = 0.80), which significantly outperformed the predictive value of clinical and laboratory variables available at hospital admission (AUROC = 0.71). The information derived from patient optical fingerprints was not strongly correlated with any clinical/laboratory variable, suggesting that optical fingerprinting brings unique information for COVID-19 severity risk assessment.

Early identification of COVID-19 patients who need to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) helps to improve the outcomes. We aim to investigate whether absolute eosinophil count (AEC) can predict ICU transfer among elderly COVID-19 patients from general isolation wards. Methods: A retrospective study of 94 elderly patients older than 60 years old with COVID-19 was conducted. We compared the basic clinical characteristics and levels of inflammation markers on admission to general isolation wards and the needs for ICU transfer between the eosinopenia (AEC on admission <20 cells/l) and non-eosinopenia (AEC &#8805;20 cells/l) groups. Results: There was a significantly higher ICU transfer rate in the eosinopenia group than in the non-eosinopenia group (51 vs. 9%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that eosinopenia was associated with an increased risk of ICU transfer in elderly COVID-19 patients [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 6.12 (95% CI, 1.23-30.33), P = 0.027] after adjustment of age, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin levels. The eosinopenia group had higher levels of CRP, ferritin, and cytokines [interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;)] than the non-eosinophil group (P < 0.001). The area under the curve of AEC on admission for predicting ICU transfer among elderly COVID-19 patients was 0.828 (95% CI, 0.732-0.923). The best cut-off value of AEC was 25 cells/l with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 71%, respectively. Conclusion: Absolute eosinophil count on admission is a valid predictive marker for ICU transfer among elderly COVID-19 patients from general isolation wards and, therefore, can help case triage and optimize ICU utilization, especially for health care facilities with limited ICU capacity.","output":"Absolute Eosinophil Count Predicts Intensive Care Unit Transfer Among Elderly COVID-19 Patients From General Isolation Wards"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Making landfall in Rockport, Texas in August 2017, Hurricane Harvey resulted in unprecedented flooding, displacing tens of thousands of people, and creating environmental hazards and exposures for many more. OBJECTIVE: We describe a collaborative project to establish the Texas Flood Registry to track the health and housing impacts of major flooding events. METHODS: Those who enroll in the registry answer retrospective questions regarding the impact of storms on their health and housing status. We recruit both those who did and did not flood during storm events to enable key comparisons. We leverage partnerships with multiple local health departments, community groups, and media outlets to recruit broadly. We performed a preliminary analysis using multivariable logistic regression and a binomial Bayesian conditional autoregressive (CAR) spatial model. RESULTS: We find that those whose homes flooded, or who came into direct skin contact with flood water, are more likely to experience a series of self-reported health effects. Median household income is inversely related to adverse health effects, and spatial analysis provides important insights within the modeling approach. SIGNIFICANCE: Global climate change is likely to increase the number and intensity of rainfall events, resulting in additional health burdens.

The experiences, information needs, decision-making and support needs of children and young adult (CYA) patients or their parents during this period is not well known. METHODS: A UK-wide online survey co-produced with patients was conducted in May 2020 amongst CYA aged 12C30, or parents of children aged < 18 years with any long-term kidney condition. Participants answered qualitative open text alongside quantitative closed questions. Thematic content analysis using a three-stage coding process was conducted. RESULTS: One-hundred and eighteen CYA (median age 21) and 197 parents of children (median age 10) responded. Predominant concerns from CYA were heightened vigilance about viral (68%) and kidney symptoms (77%) and detrimental impact on education or work opportunities (70%). Parents feared the virus more than CYA (71% vs. 40%), and had concerns that their child would catch the virus from them (64%) and would have an adverse impact on other children at home (65%). CYA thematic analysis revealed strong belief of becoming seriously ill if they contracted COVID-19; lost educational opportunities, socialisation and career development; and frustration with the public for not following social distancing rules. Positive outcomes included improved family relationships and community cohesion. Only a minority (14C21% CYA and 20C31% parents, merged questions) desired more support. Subgroup analysis identified greater negative psychological impact in the shielded group. CONCLUSIONS: This survey demonstrates substantial concern and need for accurate tailored advice for CYA based on individualised risks to improve shared decision making.

DESIGN: Rapid response online survey. Participants completed the six-item US Household Food Security Survey Module, a brief measure of food insufficiency, and measures of food behaviours, neighbourhood safety and discrimination. Open-ended questions were used to assess changes in eating behaviours during COVID-19 and needed resources. SETTING: C-EAT (COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time) study invitations were sent by email and text message to a longitudinal cohort. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 218 emerging adults (mean age = 246 (sd 20) years, 702 % female) completed a survey in April-May 2020 during a stay-at-home order in Minnesota. RESULTS: The past year prevalence of food insecurity was 284 %. Among food-insecure respondents, 410 % reported both eating less and experiencing hunger due to lack of money in the past month. Food-insecure respondents were less likely than those who were food secure to have fruits/vegetables at home and more likely to have frequent fast-food restaurant meals, feel unsafe in their neighbourhood and experience discrimination during the stay-at-home order. Food-insecure adults reported changes including eating more food prepared at home, eating more take-out restaurant meals and purchasing more energy-dense snacks as a result of events related to COVID-19.

Upon introduction to a revolutionizing China, the renowned Hungarian poet Sndor Pet?fis poetry was celebrated as an exemplar of patriotic verse and was fervently accepted and reacted to as a resounding battle call. Efforts to introduce the poets works to Chinese readers were pioneered by the countrys progressive writers and leading intellectuals of the time under the auspices of renowned publishers. Since China embarked on its modernization journey, the motive of seeking historical relevance of literary works has been receding into the background, resulting in a dwindling zeal for revolution-themed works. Pet?fis most widely memorized piece Liberty and Love started to receive alternative interpretations that gradually undermined its historical reading and obscured its genuine authorship, thus working to subvert and subjugate the original. Drawing from documented sources and published literature, the paper presents various Chinese translations of the famous lines and, in a comparative analysis, seeks possible explanations for the sweeping preference for a more domesticated yet less faithful version. To account for the changes in the interpretation and evaluation of the preferred translation, the paper then explores the linguistic factors that may have played a part in shaping the poems translation and reception among Chinese readers. In summarizing the major findings of the case study, the paper further reflects on the role of language in the translation of literary works and how it may serve to shape the landscape of world literature. This focused analysis aims to help demystify the Hungarian poets less well-understood popularity among Chinese readers. Going beyond the analysis of a particularistic case, the discussion offers implications for weaving the precious lines from minoritized languages into the rich tapestry of world literature.","output":"Translation as subversion and subjugation: Sndor Pet?fis Liberty and Love in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Despite being known abroad as a viable alternative to face-to-face consultation and therapy, telerehabilitation has not fully emerged in developing countries like the Philippines. In the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, wherein social distancing disrupted the in-clinic delivery of rehabilitation services, Filipinos attempted to explore telerehabilitation. However, several hindrances were observed especially during the pre-implementation phase of telerehabilitation, necessitating a review of existing local evidences. Objective: We aimed to determine the challenges faced by telerehabilitation in the Philippines. Method: We searched until March 2020 through PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and HeRDIN for telerehabilitation-related publications wherein Filipinos were involved as investigator or population. Because of the hypothesized low number of scientific outputs on telerehabilitation locally, we performed handsearching through gray literature and included relevant papers from different rehabilitation-related professional organizations in the Philippines. We analyzed the papers and extracted the human, organizational, and technical challenges to telerehabilitation or telehealth in general. Results: We analyzed 21 published and 4 unpublished papers, which were mostly reviews (8), feasibility studies (6), or case reports/series (4). Twelve out of 25 studies engaged patients and physicians in remote teleconsultation, teletherapy, telementoring, or telemonitoring. Patients sought telemedicine or telerehabilitation for general medical conditions (in 3 studies), chronic diseases (2), mental health issues (2), orthopedic problems (2), neurologic conditions (1), communication disorders (1), and cardiac conditions (1). Outcomes in aforementioned studies mostly included telehealth acceptance, facilitators, barriers, and satisfaction. Other studies were related to telehealth governance, legalities, and ethical issues. We identified 18 human, 17 organizational, and 18 technical unique challenges related to telerehabilitation in the Philippines. The most common challenges were slow internet speed (in 10 studies), legal concerns (9), and skepticism (9). Conclusion: There is paucity of data on telerehabilitation in the Philippines.

Whether some factors affect virus replication and proliferation had not been fully understood in the course of nerve damage caused by PHEV infection. In recent years, some reports suggested that miRNA might play a key regulatory role in viral infection. In this study, we found the miR-21a-5p is notably up-regulated in the brains of mice and N2a cells infected with PHEV, and it down-regulated the expression of CASK-interactive protein1 (Caskin1) by directly targeting the 3-UTR of Caskin1 using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. The over-expression of miR-21a-5p or Caskin1 knockdown in the host significantly contributes to PHEV proliferation. Conversely, the silencing of miR-21a-5p by miR-21a-5p inhibitors suppressed the virus proliferation. Taken together, our results indicate that Caskin1 is the direct target gene of miR-21a-5p, and it is advantageous to virus proliferation by down-regulating Caskin1.

A cohort of community-dwelling older adults were followed for 5.5 years after the disaster at 3 waves (2010, 2013 and 2016). Depressive symptoms were measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form, while PTSS was assessed by the Screening Questionnaire for Disaster Mental Health. We examined the trajectories of mental illness symptoms based on the probabilities of persistence, recovery, and delayed onset. Among people without pre-disaster depressive symptoms, 13.6% had developed depressive symptoms 2.5 years after the disaster. Of these, half of those had recovered and half had persisted at the 5.5 year follow-up. 11.1% of survivors reported post-traumatic stress symptoms in 2013; of these, 58% recovered by 2016, while 4.8% experienced delayed onset. Job loss was associated with persistent PTSS (OR 2.03; 95%CI 1.01-4.12) while a drop in subjective economic status predicted delayed onset of PTSS (OR 2.13; 1.34-3.39). However, disaster-related experiences were unrelated to the trajectory of depressive symptoms at 5.5 years. The probabilities of remission (58%) and delayed onset (5%) of PTSS are consistent with prior disaster research.

It would be desirable to have a swift diagnosis with identification of COVID-19 from disease genes or from CT or X-Ray images. COVID-19 causes flus, cough, pneumonia, and lung infection in patients, wherein massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure can lead to death. This paper proposes two different detection methods - the first is a Gene-based screening method to detect Corona diseases (Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and Human coronavirus HKU1) and differentiate it from Pneumonia. This novel approach to healthcare utilizes disease genes to build functional semantic similarity among genes. Different machine learning algorithms - eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Na?ve Bayes, Regularized Random Forest, Random Forest Rule-Based Model, Random Ferns, C5.0 and Multi-Layer Perceptron, are trained and tested on the semantic similarities to classify Corona and Pneumonia diseases. The best performing models are then ensembled, yielding an accuracy of nearly 93%. The second diagnosis technique proposed herein is an automated COVID-19 diagnostic method which uses chest X-ray images to classify Normal versus COVID-19 and Pneumonia versus COVID-19 images using the deep-CNN technique, achieving 99.87% and 99.48% test accuracy. Thus, this research can be an assistance for providing better treatment against COVID-19.","output":"Diagnosis of corona diseases from associated genes and X-ray images using machine learning algorithms and deep CNN"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intraarticular corticosteroid injection (ICSI) is a widely practiced management for hip and knee osteoarthritis. Imposed delays to arthroplasty during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic have led us to postulate that many patients have opted for recent ICSI. We compared the odds of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) in patients who were or were not administered ICSI within 12 months prior to hip or knee arthroplasty. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science was performed in February 2021, with studies assessing the effect of ICS on PJI rates identified. All studies, which included patients that received ICSI in the 12 months prior to primary hip and knee arthroplasty, were included. In total 12 studies were included: four studies with 209 353 hips and eight studies with 438 440 knees. ICSI administered in the 12 months prior to hip arthroplasty increased the odds of PJI [odds ratio (OR) = 1.17, P = 0.04]. This was not the case for knees. Subgroup analysis showed significantly higher odds of PJI in both hip [OR = 1.45, P = 0.002] and knee arthroplasty [OR = 2.04; P = 0.04] when ICSI was within the preceding 3 months of surgery. A significantly higher odds of PJI were seen in patients receiving ICSI within the 12 months prior to hip arthroplasty. Subgroup analysis showed increased odds of PJI in both hip and knee arthroplasty, in patients receiving ICSI within 3 months prior to their arthroplasty. We recommend delaying knee arthroplasty for at least 3 months after ICSI and possibly longer for hip arthroplasty.

The complex and multifaceted pathophysiology of life-threatening COVID-19 illness including viral mediated organ damage, cytokine storm, and thrombosis warrants early interventions to address all components of the devastating illness. In countries where therapeutic nihilism is prevalent, patients endure escalating symptoms and without early treatment can succumb to delayed in-hospital care and death. Prompt early initiation of sequenced multidrug therapy (SMDT) is a widely and currently available solution to stem the tide of hospitalizations and death. A multipronged therapeutic approach includes 1) adjuvant nutraceuticals, 2) combination intracellular anti-infective therapy, 3) inhaled/oral corticosteroids, 4) antiplatelet agents/anticoagulants, 5) supportive care including supplemental oxygen, monitoring, and telemedicine. Randomized trials of individual, novel oral therapies have not delivered tools for physicians to combat the pandemic in practice. No single therapeutic option thus far has been entirely effective and therefore a combination is required at this time. An urgent immediate pivot from single drug to SMDT regimens should be employed as a critical strategy to deal with the large numbers of acute COVID-19 patients with the aim of reducing the intensity and duration of symptoms and avoiding hospitalization and death.","output":"Multifaceted highly targeted sequential multidrug treatment of early ambulatory high-risk SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Echo chambers may exclude social media users from being exposed to other opinions, therefore, can cause rampant negative effects.

The cause of the disease remains undetermined, but it is estimated to result from viral or bacterial infections. Certain studies have shown infection as a leading cause of KD. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between KD incidence and viral infections in different pediatric age groups, using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment (HIRA) Open Access Big Data Platform, to confirm seasonal trends by analyzing monthly patterns. We investigated the HIRA data of KD patients (M30.3) who were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin from 2015 to 2018. Weekly virus positive detection rate data (PDR) for this period was obtained from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency for human adenovirus (HAdV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), influenza virus (IFV), human coronavirus (HCoV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human bocavirus (HBoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rotavirus, norovirus, and astrovirus. We then analyzed the weekly/monthly virus PDR and its association with KD incidence, including monthly incidence patterns, and seasonal trends. Seasonal trend analysis of the virus PDR was performed using the time series analysis method through ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average). Correlations between KD incidence and PDR at 1- and 2-month intervals were analyzed using the Granger test. A total of 16,740 patients were diagnosed with KD during the study period, mainly young children, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.35. Specifically, 15,635 (93%) patients were under 5 years of age, with an incidence rate of 172.4/100,000 person-years. Annually, the cumulative number of cases per month was the highest in January, with an average of 469 cases, and was the lowest in September, with an average of 291 cases, although most were diagnosed with KD in winter (29.3%). Granger tests showed that PDR for HRSV, rotavirus, and norovirus were related with KD incidence by 1 month, while PDR for HRSV, HRV, rotavirus, and norovirus by 2 months. This study found that detection rates of respiratory and enteric viruses preceded KD by 1C2 months.

Objective: The study aimed to investigate if an air-cleaning CSTD can prevent liquid viral contamination by human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43). Methods: Chemfort? CSTD with (intact) or without (control) a Toxi-Guard system was used to transfer liquids between an IV bag and an empty vial (a total of 5 liquid transfers) inside a sealed glove box contaminated by HCoV-OC43 aerosols. In addition, the vial adaptor was challenged by direct spray of HCoV-OC43 solution on the septum and filter areas. HCoV-OC43 RNA was extracted from samples of the transferred liquid and compared between the devices with or without a Toxi-Guard system. Results: Use of a CSTD with the Toxi-Guard system resulted in non-detectable cycle threshold (CT) values, indicative of no detectable HCoV-OC43RNA in the transferred liquid, even when the septa and filter areas were directly sprayed with HCoV-OC43 stock solution. In contrast, use of the CSTD with no Toxi-Guard system resulted in a detectable CT value of the transferred liquid.

Medical records of confirmed WT were retrospectively assessed for demographic, imaging, treatment, pathology, and oncological outcome data. RESULTS Fifty patients, with a median age of 38 months (6-181), were included in 10 centers. All patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as per SIOP protocol. Median tumor volume post-chemotherapy was 673 mL (18-3331), 16 tumors crossed the lateral border of the spine, and three crossed the midline. Six patients with tumors that crossed the lateral border of the spine (tumor volumes 1560 mL [299-2480]) were converted to an open approach. There was no intraoperative tumor rupture. Overall, MIS was completed in 19% of the 195 nephrectomies for WT presenting during the study period. Tumor was stage I in 29, II in 16, and III in 5, and histology was reported as low in three, intermediate in 42, and high risk in five. Three patients had positive tumor margins. After a median follow-up of 34 months (2-138), there were two local recurrences (both stage I, intermediate risk, 7 and 9 months after surgery) and one metastatic relapse (stage III, high risk, four months after surgery). The three-year event-free survival was 94%.

Objective: To determine whether Ivermectin is associated with lower mortality rate in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Design and Setting: Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients hospitalized at four Broward Health hospitals in South Florida with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Enrollment dates were March 15, 2020 through May 11, 2020. Follow up data for all outcomes was May 19, 2020. Participants: 280 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (mean age 59.6 years [standard deviation 17.9], 45.4% female), of whom 173 were treated with ivermectin and 107 were usual care were reviewed. 27 identified patients were not reviewed due to multiple admissions, lack of confirmed COVID results during hospitalization, age less than 18, pregnancy, or incarceration. Exposure: Patients were categorized into two treatment groups based on whether they received at least one dose of ivermectin at any time during the hospitalization. Treatment decisions were at the discretion of the treating physicians. Severe pulmonary involvement at study entry was characterized as need for either FiO2 [a?]50%, or noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included subgroup mortality in patients with severe pulmonary involvement and extubation rates for patients requiring invasive ventilation. Results: Univariate analysis showed lower mortality in the ivermectin group (25.2% versus 15.0%, OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29-0.96, P=.03). Mortality was also lower among 75 patients with severe pulmonary disease treated with ivermectin (38.8% vs 80.7%, OR 0.15, CI 0.05-0.47, P=.001), but there was no significant difference in successful extubation rates (36.1% vs 15.4%, OR 3.11 (0.88-11.00), p=.07).

To determine the genetic variations and evolutionary trajectory of the isolates, the genomes of isolates were compared to those of global virus strains from GISAID. Pharyngeal specimens were confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2-positive by RT-PCR. Direct whole-genome sequencing was performed, and viral assemblies were subsequently uploaded to GISAID. Comparative genome sequence and single-nucleotide variation analyses were performed. RESULTS: The D614G mutation was identified in imported cases, which separated into two clusters related to viruses originally detected in the USA. Our findings highlight the risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants through air travel and the need for continued genomic tracing for the epidemiological investigation and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 using viral genomic data.

It is hypothesized that the ZF motif(s) in HA of AI virus can be used as a ''novel'' biomarker for categorization of the virus and/or its virulence. As a model for analysis, we used the H5 subtypes of highly pathogenic, non-pathogenic and low pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI, NPAI and LPAI) viruses of H5N1 and H5N2 of avian and human origins. Interestingly, our method of characterization using the zinc-finger agrees with the existing classification in distinguishing between highly pathogenic and non-pathogenic or low pathogenic subtypes. The new method also clearly distinguished between low and non-pathogenic strains of H5N2 and H5N1 which are indistinguishable by the existing method that utilizes the sequence of the polybasic amino acids of the proteolytic cleavage site for pathogenicity. It is hypothesized that zinc through the activities of zinc-binding proteins modulates the virulence property of the viral subtypes. Our observation further revealed that only the HA protein among the eight encoded proteins of influenza viruses contain high numbers of Cys-His residues.

All patients in the study group were treated with a combination of Cortexin and Recognan, and a repeat study was conducted 4 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: The study revealed the predominance in the observation group of patients with a comorbid background, as well as pronounced anxiety disorders. After the complex treatment, there was a significant decrease in the indicators of common, physical, mental asthenia, as well as an increase in motivational activity, there was a decrease in situational anxiety, and to a lesser extent personal anxiety. According to cognitive tests, there was an improvement in indicators on the MMSE scale, direct reproduction of the 5-word test, significant changes in the evaluation of work efficiency when performing the Schulte test. CONCLUSION: It should be noted that the positive results of this study can be considered a decrease in the severity and severity of asthenia symptoms, a decrease in anxiety manifestations, and an improvement in cognitive functions against the background of complex neurotropic therapy with Cortexin and Recognan. Preference in this situation should be given to drugs with a multimodal mechanism of action, as well as creating optimal combinations of drugs that potentiate each other's action.","output":"[The use of neurotropic therapy in young patients with postcovid syndrome]./ Primenenie neirotropnoi terapii u molodykh patsientov s postkovidnym sindromom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colorectal carcinogenesis (CRC) is caused by the gradual long-term accumulation of both genetic and epigenetic changes. Recently, epigenetic alterations have been included in the classification of the CRC molecular subtype, and this points out their prognostic impact. As epigenetic modifications are reversible, they may represent relevant therapeutic targets. DNA methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), regulates gene expression. For many years, the deregulation of DNA methylation has been considered to play a substantial part in CRC etiology and evolution. Despite considerable advances in CRC treatment, patient therapy response persists as limited, and their profit from systemic therapies are often hampered by the introduction of chemoresistance. In addition, inter-individual changes in therapy response in CRC patients can arise from their specific (epi)genetic compositions. In this review article, we summarize the options of CRC treatment based on DNA methylation status for their predictive value. This review also includes the therapy outcomes based on the patient's methylation status in CRC patients. In addition, the current challenge of research is to develop therapeutic inhibitors of DNMT. Based on the essential role of DNA methylation in CRC development, the application of DNMT inhibitors was recently proposed for the treatment of CRC patients, especially in patients with DNA hypermethylation.","output":"Methylation-Based Therapies for Colorectal Cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is expressed in Barrington's nucleus (BarN), which plays an essential role in the regulation of micturition. To control the neural activities of BarN, glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs from multiple sources have been demonstrated; however, it is not clear how modulatory neurotransmitters affect the activity of BarN neurons. We have employed knock-in mice, CRH-expressing neurons of which are labeled with a modified yellow fluorescent protein (Venus). Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we examined the responses of Venus-expressing (putative CRH-expressing) neurons in BarN (BarCRH), as well as non-CRH-expressing neurons (BarCRH-negative), following bath application of cholinergic agonists. According to the present study, the activity of BarCRH neurons could be modulated by dual cholinergic mechanisms. First, they are inhibited by a muscarinic receptor-mediated mechanism, most likely through the M2 subclass of muscarinic receptors. Second, BarCRH neurons are excited by a nicotinic receptor-mediated mechanism. BarCRH-negative neurons also responded to cholinergic agents. Choline transporter-immunoreactive nerve terminals were observed in close proximity to the neurites, as well as the somata of BarCRH.

However, with an increasing number of applications being deployed, an important question arises: how can a HAR system autonomously learn new activities over a long period of time without being re-engineered from scratch? This problem is known as continual learning and has been particularly popular in the domain of computer vision, where several techniques to attack it have been developed. This paper aims to assess to what extent such continual learning techniques can be applied to the HAR domain. To this end, we propose a general framework to evaluate the performance of such techniques on various types of commonly used HAR datasets. We then present a comprehensive empirical analysis of their computational cost and effectiveness of tackling HAR-specific challenges (i.e., sensor noise and labels' scarcity). The presented results uncover useful insights on their applicability and suggest future research directions for HAR systems.

The Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) system in Hong Kong provides a safety net for those aged children and adults below 65 years old who cannot support themselves financially. It is designed to bring their income up to a prescribed level to meet their basic needs. The rapid increase in social welfare expenditure in the last decade has become a concern to the Hong Kong SAR Government. The overall social welfare expenditure has accounted for nearly 15.6% of government expenditure in 2018, with the total amount increasing from $58 billion to $90 billion (an increase of 72.4%) for the period 2014-2018. However, the amount spent on CSSA only increased from $20.7 billion to $22.3 billion with an increase of 7.7% only for the same period. The much slower magnitude of increase is related to the reduction in the number of CSSA recipients, which decreased from 237,501 to 185,528 over the period. A decomposition method was used to assess the changes in the number of people in the CSSA system. It showed that the rate of arriving into the system has been decreasing due to a robust economy with a very low unemployment rate; whereas moving out of the system has also been decreasing in the past 5 years. This phenomenon can be partly attributed to the widening of the income gap in the community in the period. Despite the increase in population size, as long as employment conditions remain strong and the momentum of leaving the system can be maintained, the number of CSSA recipients will continue to decrease. However, the results also suggested that a certain proportion of CSSA recipients will not be able to move out of the system and have been trapped. Some innovative methods to help them out of CSSA are discussed. In view of the poor economic outlook arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important for the Government to have effective measures to keep people in their jobs. If the unemployment rate will does not substantially increase and then increase of in CSSA recipients can be contained.","output":"A decomposition analysis to examine the change in the number of recipients in the comprehensive social security assistance (CSSA) system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is in the midst of a pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus and is desperately searching for possible treatments.

These patients may have lower immune responses. Little is known about the cellular and humoral immune response after a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in IBD. METHODS: 28 patients with IBD and 27 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited at Jena University Hospital. Blood samples were taken before, after the first and in a subgroup of 11 patients after second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Cellular immune response including IFN- and TNF- response and antibody titers were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 71.4% of the IBD-patients and 85.2% of the controls showed levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies above the cutoff of 33.8 BAU/ml (p=0.329) after the first dose. Even in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, IBD patients showed significant T cell responses after first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination compared to healthy controls, which was not influenced by different immunosuppressive regimens. Associated with the vaccination, we could also detect a slight increase of the TNF production among SARS-CoV-2-reactive T(H) cells in HD and IBD patients. After the second dose of vaccination, in IBD patients a further increase of humoral immune response in all but one patient was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Already after the first dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, cellular immune response in IBD patients is comparable to controls, indicating a similar efficacy.

Due to the scientific community's efforts, there is an increasing body of published studies describing the virus' biology, its transmission and diagnosis, its clinical features, its radiological findings, and the development of candidate therapeutics and vaccines. Despite the decline in postmortem examination rate, autopsy remains the gold standard to determine why and how death happens. Defining the pathophysiology of death is not only limited to forensic considerations; it may also provide useful clinical and epidemiologic insights. Selective approaches to postmortem diagnosis, such as limited postmortem sampling over full autopsy, can also be useful in the control of disease outbreaks and provide valuable knowledge for managing appropriate control measures. In this scenario, we strongly recommend performing full autopsies on patients who died with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, particularly in the presence of several comorbidities. Only by working with a complete set of histological samples obtained through autopsy can one ascertain the exact cause(s) of death, optimize clinical management, and assist clinicians in pointing out a timely and effective treatment to reduce mortality.

Knowledge that one is less at risk after being vaccinated may alleviate distress, but this hypothesis remains unexplored. Here we test whether psychological distress declined in those vaccinated against COVID-19 in the US and whether changes in perceived risk mediated any association. METHODS: A nationally-representative cohort of U.S. adults (N=5,792) in the Understanding America Study were interviewed every two weeks from March 2020 to June 2021 (28 waves). Difference-in-difference regression tested whether getting vaccinated reduced distress (PHQ-4 scores), with mediation analysis used to identify potential mechanisms, including perceived risks of infection, hospitalization, and death. RESULTS: Vaccination was associated with a 0.09 decline in distress scores (95% CI: ?0.15 to ?0.04) (0C12 scale), a 5.7% relative decrease compared to mean scores in the wave prior to vaccination. Vaccination was also associated with an 8.44 percentage point reduction in perceived risk of infection (95% CI: ?9.15% to ?7.73%), a 7.44-point reduction in perceived risk of hospitalization (95% CI: ?8.07% to ?6.82%), and a 5.03-point reduction in perceived risk of death (95% CI: ?5.57% to ?4.49%). Adjusting for risk perceptions decreased the vaccination-distress association by two-thirds.

Recently, it has been shown that Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) might protect against COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the possible correlation between BCG vaccination and morbidity/mortality/recovery rate associated with COVID-19 infection. METHODS Data of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and population were obtained from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (Accessed on 12 June, 2020). To have meaningful comparisons among countries' mortality and recovery rates, we only choose those countries with COVID-19 infected cases at least 200. The Poisson regression and logistic regression were used to explore the relationship between BCG vaccination and morbidity, mortality and recovery rates. RESULTS Among those 158 countries with at least 200 COVID-19 infected cases, there were 141 countries with BCG vaccination information available. The adjusted rates ratio of COVID-19 confirmed cases for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination was 0.339 (with 95% CI= (0.338,0.340)). Moreover, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of death and recovery after coronavirus infected for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination were 0.258 (with 95% CI= (0.254,0.261)) and 2.151 (with 95% CI= (2.140,2.163)), respectively. CONCLUSIONS That data in this study show the BCG might provide the protection against COVID-19, with consequent less COVID-19 infection and deaths and more rapid recovery.

Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found significant heterogeneity in predictors of severe disease due to large variation in these factors during the time course of the illness. We aimed to identify factors associated with progression to severe dengue disease that are detectable specifically in the febrile phase. METHODS We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify predictors identifiable during the febrile phase associated with progression to severe disease defined according to WHO criteria. Eight medical databases were searched for studies published from Jan 1, 1997, to Jan 31, 2020. Original clinical studies in English assessing the association of factors detected during the febrile phase with progression to severe dengue were selected and assessed by three reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Meta-analyses were done using random-effects models to estimate pooled effect sizes. Only predictors reported in at least four studies were included in the meta-analyses. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q and I2 statistics, and publication bias was assessed by Egger's test. We did subgroup analyses of studies with children and adults. The study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018093363. FINDINGS Of 6643 studies identified, 150 articles were included in the systematic review, and 122 articles comprising 25 potential predictors were included in the meta-analyses. Female patients had a higher risk of severe dengue than male patients in the main analysis (2674 [162%] of 16 481 vs 3052 [105%] of 29 142; odds ratio [OR] 113 [95% CI 101-126) but not in the subgroup analysis of studies with children. Pre-existing comorbidities associated with severe disease were diabetes (135 [313%] of 431 with vs 868 [160%] of 5421 without; crude OR 438 [258-743]), hypertension (240 [350%] of 685 vs 763 [206%] of 3695; 219 [136-353]), renal disease (44 [458%] of 96 vs 271 [160%] of 1690; 467 [221-988]), and cardiovascular disease (nine [231%] of 39 vs 155 [86%] of 1793; 279 [104-750]). Clinical features during the febrile phase associated with progression to severe disease were vomiting (329 [135%] of 2432 with vs 258 [68%] of 3797 without; 225 [187-271]), abdominal pain and tenderness (321 [177%] of 1814 vs 435 [81%] of 5357; 192 [135-274]), spontaneous or mucosal bleeding (147 [179%] of 822 vs 676 [108%] of 6235; 157 [113-219]), and the presence of clinical fluid accumulation (40 [421%] of 95 vs 212 [149%] of 1425; 461 [229-926]). During the first 4 days of illness, platelet count was lower (standardised mean difference -034 [95% CI -054 to -015]), serum albumin was lower (-05 [-086 to -015]), and aminotransferase concentrations were higher (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 106 [054 to 157] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 073 [036 to 109]) among individuals who progressed to severe disease. Dengue virus serotype 2 was associated with severe disease in children. Secondary infections (vs primary infections) were also associated with severe disease (1682 [118%] of 14 252 with vs 507 [52%] of 9660 without; OR 226 [95% CI 165-309]). Although the included studies had a moderate to high risk of bias in terms of study confounding, the risk of bias was low to moderate in other domains. Heterogeneity of the pooled results varied from low to high on different factors. INTERPRETATION This analysis supports monitoring of the warning signs described in the 2009 WHO guidelines on dengue. In addition, testing for infecting serotype and monitoring platelet count and serum albumin, AST, and ALT concentrations during the febrile phase of illness could improve the early prediction of severe dengue.

In Brazil, official surveillance system of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) investigates influenza A (IAV) and B (IBV) viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (HAdV), parainfluenza viruses (hPIV). In Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, many fatalities associated with SARI between 2013-2017 were patients without underlying diseases and for whom the causative agent had not been identified using official protocols. METHOD This cross-sectional study analyzed the presence of coronaviruses (HCoV), bocavirus (HBoV), metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinovirus in patients who died of SARI despite not having comorbidities, and that were negative for IAV, IBV, RSV, HAdV, hPIV. Nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs from patients were used for nucleic acid extraction. The presence of HCoV OC43, HKU1, NL63, and 229E; HBoV; hMPV; and rhinovirus was assessed by RT-qPCR. Clinical data was also analyzed. RESULTS Between 2013 and 2017, 16,225 cases of SARI were reported in RS; 9.8% of the patients died; 20% of all fatal cases were patients without comorbidities and for whom no pathogen was detected using standard protocols. Analysis of 271 of these cases identified HCoV in nine cases; HBoV, hMPV, and rhinovirus were detected in three, three, and ten cases, respectively. Of note, patients infected with HCoV were adults.

We implemented a COVID Virtual Clinic (CVC) in a tertiary referral centre allowing such patients to be monitored in the community. This study describes the CVC's remote monitoring experience and explores the predictors of need for specialist intervention. Methods: We included all patients enrolled in the CVC at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin between March 1st and June 1st 2020. Patients received a Bluetooth-enabled pulse oximeter and smartphone application (Patient-M-Power?) and uploaded twice-daily SpO2 readings, heart rate and dyspnoea score (1-10). A team of 2-14 healthcare providers monitored results. Abnormal or absent data triggered calls from the CVC, with assessments and/or admission as required. We collected data on demographics, calls received from/made to patients, outcomes and readmissions. Descriptive analysis of the CVC was performed as well as simple logistic regression to explore factors associated with the likelihood of readmission. Results: 502 patients were included (179 (36.4%) male, median age 39 (IQR 50-3) years, 360 (73.2%) staff). Outcomes are illustrated in Figure 1. Median time in CVC was 12 days (IQR 13-10). 1902 calls were made to patients by CVC staff prompted by abnormal data: dyspnoea (41 patients, 8.2%), low SpO2 (133, 26.5%), tachycardia, (99, 19.7%), technical issues (81, 16.1%), absent results (255, 50.1%). This resulted in 45 (9%) patients requiring re-assessment and 42 (8.4%) being readmitted. Of those readmitted, 3 (7%) required critical care admission. Median length of stay was 2 (IQR 6.75-1) days. Those readmitted were more likely to be older (odds ratio [OR] per year older 1.03 (1.01, 1.05), P=0.0050, have an abnormal SpO2 (&lt;94%, OR 5.43 [2.93, 11.1], P&lt;0.001), a high dyspnoea score (&gt;7, OR 4.33 (2.04, 9.3), P&lt;0.001) and be staff (OR 6.08 (3.11, 11.87), P&lt;0.001). Neither gender nor abnormal HR were associated with higher likelihood of readmission. 22.2% of presenting patients were hypoxic in the absence of dyspnoea, of which 70% required admission and one patient required intensive care. Conclusion: We describe the largest remotely monitored cohort of COVID19 patients to date.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from 260 inpatients discharged from the Bohnice Hospital (Prague) and obtained a set of sociodemographic and clinical variables as well as the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS) and HoNOS-secure scores. RESULTS: The following variables were identified as significantly associated with a longer LoS: older age, length of previous psychiatric hospitalization, olanzapine equivalent, clozapine treatment, psychosocial dysfunction, psychotic or paraphilic disorder diagnosis, and sexual offense. A shorter LoS was associated with being in a relationship, being employed before hospitalization, receiving personal support, and committing an index offense under the influence of substance. While the HoNOS score and HoNOS symptom subscale predicted a longer LoS, the HoNOS-secure subscale predicted a shorter stay.

At the first step, its fluorescence was quenched by preparing the conjugate with hemin. Interestingly, the fluorescence intensity gradually increases (turn-on) with increasing concentration of Fav, and develops 9-fold higher fluorescence at 15.6 nM of Fav. The fluorescence enhancement is selective, and the limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be about 1.96 nM. The fluorescence turn-on is governed by aggregation-induced emission (AIE), which originates from electrostatic interactions between the sensor-analyte systems. A similar fluorescence turn-on was observed for Fav in human blood plasma (BP) as well as in artificial urine (AU), which indicates that the sensor is viable in real-sample analysis. In addition to Fav, its 1:1 cocrystals with theophylline (Theo) and ferulic acid (FRA) also enhance the fluorescence in real samples with an LOD of 3.47 and 12.2 nM, respectively. Therefore, the cocrystals remain intact in biological medium and the sensor interacts with cocrystals too. The detection of Fav and its cocrystals, and the development of cocrystals as alternatives in the pharmaceutical industry, is essential considering the current COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. Therefore, the findings of this work will certainly help in developing fluorescence sensors for quantitative determination of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in real samples. ? 2021 American Chemical Society.","output":"Soot-Based Reduced Graphene Quantum Dot/Hemin Conjugate for Favipiravir Sensing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Businesses relies on information technology to retrieve data and store data. The data is used for making business decisions at all levels of an organization. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the reliance on information technology has risen to help companies connect their employees and their supply chain partners. Since Indonesia emerging market is growing, there is a need to investigate the growing intention to adopt information and communication technology. The reason is that Indonesian companies' survivability relies on their competitiveness and sustainability in business during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigates intention to use information technology through user satisfaction, Confirmation, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness. Data were collected from 45 employees working in the industry. The findings show that there is a difference between before pandemic and during the pandemic. After benchmarking the result with the literature, perceived usefulness and satisfaction were not significant to adopting information technology. The reason is due to pandemic forced employees to embrace technology and change employees' work ethic. The result contributes to the literature extending the empirical evidence and providing future direction to investigate pre- and post-pandemic situations.

Evidence suggests that urbanicity is linked to an increased risk for the development of mental health disorders. Rather than an accumulation of risk factors, urbanization is a complex process that profoundly structures living conditions. In this sense, it is timely to discuss what are the social and structural determinants of mental health of children and young people in such settings. RECENT FINDINGS Three domains of determinants of mental health were selected for discussion: economics and living conditions, crime and violence, and urban layouts. For each, we debated realities faced by urban children and young people, providing an overview of recent evidence on implications for mental disorders and well being. We also discuss the potential impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on each domain, as well as recommendations for future action. SUMMARY Structural factors are of major relevance for the mental health of children and young people living in cities.

We constructed a machine learning model for COVID-19 diagnosis that was based and cross-validated on the routine blood tests of 5333 patients with various bacterial and viral infections, and 160 COVID-19-positive patients. We selected the operational ROC point at a sensitivity of 81.9% and a specificity of 97.9%. The cross-validated AUC was 0.97. The five most useful routine blood parameters for COVID-19 diagnosis according to the feature importance scoring of the XGBoost algorithm were: MCHC, eosinophil count, albumin, INR, and prothrombin activity percentage. t-SNE visualization showed that the blood parameters of the patients with a severe COVID-19 course are more like the parameters of a bacterial than a viral infection. The reported diagnostic accuracy is at least comparable and probably complementary to RT-PCR and chest CT studies. Patients with fever, cough, myalgia, and other symptoms can now have initial routine blood tests assessed by our diagnostic tool. All patients with a positive COVID-19 prediction would then undergo standard RT-PCR studies to confirm the diagnosis.

The inclusion criterion was a tumor diameter of  5 cm. The median follow-up was 93 months (range 13 - 149). RESULTS Most of intraoperative and postoperative variables were comparable between the two groups, except for lengthening of operation time in TASE (287  87 min vs. 226  78 min, P = 0.011). TUSE did not lengthen the duration of postoperative recovery, hospital stay, or pain, or increase the incidence of postoperative complications. Whereas TUSE showed 8.8% (6/68) of wound-related complications, TASE did not show wound-related complications during follow-up period (P = 0.586). CONCLUSION With the exception of a prolonged operation time, TASE showed equivalent surgical outcomes as TUSE in SPLS sigmoidectomy.

Extensive mutations in the spike protein may threaten the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies(4). Two signature spike mutations of concern are E484K, which has a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of antibodies, and N501Y, a driver of rapid worldwide transmission of the B.1.1.7 lineage. Here we report the emergence of the variant lineage B.1.526 (also known as the Iota variant(5)), which contains E484K, and its rise to dominance in New York City in early 2021. This variant is partially or completely resistant to two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies that are in clinical use and is less susceptible to neutralization by plasma from individuals who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection or serum from vaccinated individuals, posing a modest antigenic challenge. The presence of the B.1.526 lineage has now been reported in all 50 states in the United States and in many other countries. B.1.526 rapidly replaced earlier lineages in New York, with an estimated transmission advantage of 35%. These transmission dynamics, together with the relative antibody resistance of its E484K sub-lineage, are likely to have contributed to the sharp rise and rapid spread of B.1.526.

METHODS In southern Israel, 2 ethnic groups, Jewish and Bedouin, live side-by-side. Computerized data on visits for children <18 years were examined from clinics with 50 insured children, active both pre-COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Visits were divided into in-person and remote. Monthly infectious diagnoses and dispensed antibiotic prescription rates were calculated by age (<5, 5-17 years) and ethnic groups. Mean monthly rates of 2 parallel seasons (pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods) were compared. RESULTS Overall 2,120,253 outpatient clinic visits were recorded. Remote clinic visit rates (per 1000 children) increased from 97.04 and 33.86 in the pre-COVID-19 to 179.75 and 50.05 in the COVID-19 period in Jewish and Bedouin children, respectively (P < 0.01) along with a reduction of in-person visit rates in both populations. Comparing pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, the rates of overall infectious diagnoses in remote visits increased. Nevertheless, dispensed antibiotic prescription rates in remote visits (per 1000 visits) remained unchanged (9.84 vs. 8.67, P = 0.70, in the Jewish population and 14.32 vs. 14.17, P = 1.00, in the Bedouin population in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, respectively) with a similar distribution of antibiotic categories. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an expansion of remote visits of children <18 years with an increase in infectious diagnoses. However, remote dispensed antibiotic prescription rates remained unchanged.

The addiction of morphine is a very serious social issue. Some long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed to engage in drug addiction. Objective: Whether lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) attended to morphine-mediated autophagy of mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells was probed. Materials and methods: HT22 cells were subjected to 10 M morphine for 24 h. Cell autophagy was assessed by measuring LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 expression. qRT-PCR was carried out to measure MEG3 expression. SiRNA oligoribonucleotides targeting MEG3 (si-MEG3) was transfected to silence MEG3. The orexin1 receptor (OX1R), c-fos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expressions were tested by western blotting. SCH772984 was used as an inhibitor of ERK pathway. Results: Morphine elevated OX1R (2.92 times), c-fos (2.06 times), p/t-ERK (2.04 times) and p/t-PKC (2.4 times), Beclin-1 (3.2 times) and LC3-II/LC3-I (3.96 times) expression in HT22 cells. Moreover, followed by morphine exposure, the MEG3 expression was also elevated in HT22 cells (3.03 times). The silence of MEG3 lowered the Beclin-1 (1.85 times), LC3-II/LC3-I (2.12 times), c-fos (1.39 times) and p/t-ERK (1.44 times) expressions in morphine-treated HT22 cells.

We present the clinical, neuropathological, and molecular findings of 41 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections who died and underwent autopsy in our medical center. The mean age was 74 years (38-97 years), 27 patients (66%) were male and 34 (83%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Twenty-four patients (59%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Hospital-associated complications were common, including 8 (20%) with deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), 7 (17%) patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, and 10 (24%) with positive blood cultures during admission. Eight (20%) patients died within 24 hours of hospital admission, while 11 (27%) died more than 4 weeks after hospital admission. Neuropathological examination of 20-30 areas from each brain revealed hypoxic/ischemic changes in all brains, both global and focal; large and small infarcts, many of which appeared hemorrhagic; and microglial activation with microglial nodules accompanied by neuronophagia, most prominently in the brainstem. We observed sparse T lymphocyte accumulation in either perivascular regions or in the brain parenchyma. Many brains contained atherosclerosis of large arteries and arteriolosclerosis, though none had evidence of vasculitis. Eighteen (44%) contained pathologies of neurodegenerative diseases, not unexpected given the age range of our patients. We examined multiple fresh frozen and fixed tissues from 28 brains for the presence of viral RNA and protein, using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), RNAscope, and immunocytochemistry with primers, probes, and antibodies directed against the spike and nucleocapsid regions. qRT-PCR revealed low to very low, but detectable, viral RNA levels in the majority of brains, although they were far lower than those in nasal epithelia. RNAscope and immunocytochemistry failed to detect viral RNA or protein in brains. Our findings indicate that the levels of detectable virus in COVID-19 brains are very low and do not correlate with the histopathological alterations. These findings suggest that microglial activation, microglial nodules and neuronophagia, observed in the majority of brains, do not result from direct viral infection of brain parenchyma, but rather likely from systemic inflammation, perhaps with synergistic contribution from hypoxia/ischemia.

Here we show functionalized nanoparticles, termed Nanotraps, completely inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the interaction between the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 of host cells. The liposomal-based Nanotrap surfaces were functionalized with either recombinant ACE2 proteins or anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and phagocytosis-specific phosphatidylserines. The Nanotraps effectively captured SARS-CoV-2 and completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection to ACE2-expressing human cell lines and primary lung cells; the phosphatidylserine triggered subsequent phagocytosis of the virus-bound, biodegradable Nanotraps by macrophages, leading to the clearance of pseudotyped and authentic virus in vitro. Furthermore, the Nanotraps demonstrated excellent biosafety profile in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the Nanotraps inhibited pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection in live human lungs in an ex vivo lung perfusion system. In summary, Nanotraps represent a new nanomedicine for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Highlights Nanotraps block interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and host ACE2 receptors Nanotraps trigger macrophages to engulf and clear virus without becoming infected Nanotraps showed excellent biosafety profiles in vitro and in vivo Nanotraps blocked infection to living human lungs in ex vivo lung perfusion system Progress and Potential To address the global challenge of creating treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we devised a nanomedicine termed Nanotraps that can completely capture and eliminate the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Nanotraps integrate protein engineering, immunology, and nanotechnology and are effective, biocompatible, safe, stable, feasible for mass production. The Nanotraps have the potential to be formulated into a nasal spray or inhaler for easy administration and direct delivery to the respiratory system, or as an oral or ocular liquid, or subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection to target different sites of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, thus offering flexibility in administration and treatment. More broadly, the highly versatile Nanotrap platform could be further developed into new vaccines and therapeutics against a broad range of diseases in infection, autoimmunity and cancer, by incorporating with different small molecule drugs, RNA, DNA, peptides, recombinant proteins, and antibodies.","output":"Nanotraps for the containment and clearance of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reproductive tactics and strategies contribute to the persistence and maintenance of long-term populations in fish species.

The aim of this study was to conduct a comprehensive investigation to evaluate the annual reproductive cycle of seven species of goodeines (splitfins). We carried out our study in the subtropical Lake Zacapu, Mexico, with bi-monthly sampling from May 2019 to March 2020. We obtain the fertility, size at first maturity (L50), sex ratio, and gonadosomatic index. Our result shows that populations of goodeines have high fertility compared to other populations of the same species in other aquatic systems and also to other species of goodein. We found that males mature at smaller sizes than females, the observed proportion of females was greater than males in all the goodeines. Lake Zacapu goodeines have two reproductive peaks, one in spring (April to June) and another in fall (September to November).

Here, we demonstrated the specific knockdown of CD147 significantly decreased HCMV-induced activation of NF-B and Interferon-beta (IFN-), which contribute to the cellular antiviral responses.

Except for lung injury, it is possible that COVID-19 patients develop liver injury. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of abnormal liver biochemical tests in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, and Wanfang databases were searched. The incidence of abnormal liver biochemical tests, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), total bilirubin (TBIL), and albumin (ALB), was pooled. Risk ratio (RR) was calculated to explore the association of abnormal liver biochemical tests with severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five studies were included. The pooled incidence of any abnormal liver biochemical indicator at admission and during hospitalization was 27.2% and 36%, respectively. Among the abnormal liver biochemical indicators observed at admission, abnormal ALB was the most common, followed by GGT, AST, ALT, TBIL, and ALP (39.8%, 35.8%, 21.8%, 20.4%, 8.8%, and 4.7%). Among the abnormal liver biochemical indicators observed during hospitalization, abnormal ALT was more common than AST and TBIL (38.4%, 28.1%, and 23.2%). Severe and/or critical patients had a significantly higher pooled incidence of abnormal liver biochemical indicators at admission than mild and/or moderate patients. Non-survivors had a significantly higher incidence of abnormal liver biochemical indicators than survivors (RR = 1.34, p = 0.04).

Viruses depend on the host translation machinery for viral protein synthesis. Therefore, viruses have evolved clever strategies to utilize the host translation machinery. Earlier studies have shown that genotype 1-Hepatitis E virus (g1-HEV) utilizes both cap-dependent and cap-independent translation machineries for its replication and proliferation. Cap-independent translation in g1-HEV is driven by an eighty seven nucleotide-long RNA element which acts as a noncanonical, internal ribosome entry site like (IRESl) element. Here, we have identified the RNA-protein interactome of the HEV IRESl element and characterized the functional significance of some of its components. Our study reveals indispensable roles of host ribosomal protein RPL5 and DHX9 (RNA helicase A) in mediating efficient translation from the IRESl element and establish the function of HEV IRESl as a bonafide internal ribosome entry site. Author summary Protein synthesis is a fundamental process for survival and proliferation of all living organisms. Majority of cellular proteins are produced through a cap-dependent translation process. However under conditions of stress and/or when cap-dependent translation is not operational, cells utilize a variety of cap-independent translation processes to synthesize essential proteins. Viruses are the only living organisms which depend on the host cell translation apparatus to synthesize their own proteins. Many viruses utilize both cap-dependent and cap-independent machineries for the synthesis of viral proteins. Hepatitis E virus is a major cause of acute hepatitis worldwide. The viral genome is a capped positive strand RNA. Viral non-structural and structural proteins are synthesized through a cap-dependent translation process from one open reading frame (ORF) present in the genomic RNA and two overlapping ORFs present in the subgenomic RNA, respectively. An earlier study from our laboratory reported the presence of a fourth ORF in the viral genome, which produced the ORF4 protein using a cap-independent internal translation initiation mechanism. Using bicistronic reporter assays and site-directed mutagenesis studies, it was demonstrated that translation of the ORF4 protein was driven by an internal ribosome entry site-like (IRESl) element. In the current study, we identified the host proteins that directly or indirectly associate with the HEV-IRESl RNA and generated the RNA-protein interactome. Subsequent studies identified essential roles of ribosome protein L5 (RPL5) and DHX9 (RNA Helicase A) in mediating the function of the IRESl. Biochemical fractionation studies showed the presence of IRESl and its components in the actively translating polysomes. Collectively, our data proves that HEV-IRESl is a bonafide internal ribosome entry site.","output":"RNA-protein interactome at the Hepatitis E virus internal ribosome entry site"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the paper is to create a typology of consumers based on the consumption of food products and non-alcoholic beverages for two countries.

Increasing evidence indicates that red blood cells (RBCs) may contribute to immune response and inflammation. However, the precise molecular mechanisms that link RBC and hemolysis to the development and progression of inflammatory pathologies are not entirely understood. In this study, we used bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to mimic an infectious hemolysis and found that RBCs dynamically regulated cell aggregation between immune cells and human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC). When RBCs were treated with LPS, integrin 41 was increased and was accompanied by cytokines and chemokines release (TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-, CXCL12, CCL5, CCL7 and CCL4). Upon 41 elevation, RBCs not only facilitated mature monocyte derived dendritic cell (mo-DCs) adhesion but also promoted HLMVEC aggregation. Furthermore, co-culture of the supernatant of LPS pre-treated RBCs with mo-DCs could promote na?ve CD4 T cell proliferation. Notably, the filtered culture from LPS-lysed RBCs further promoted mo-DCs migration in a concentration dependent manner. From a therapeutic perspective, cyclic peptide inhibitor of integrin 41 combined with methylprednisolone (41/Methrol) remarkably blocked RBCs aggregation to mo-DCs, HLMVEC, or mo-DCs and HLMVEC mixture. Moreover, 41/Methrol dramatically reduced mo-DCs migration up-regulated glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper in mo-DCs, and ultimately reversed immune cell dysfunction induced by hemolysis. Taken together, these results indicate that integrin 41 on RBCs could mediate cell-cell interaction for adaptive immunity through influencing cell adhesion, migration, and T cell proliferation.","output":"Integrin 41/VCAM-1 Interaction Evokes Dynamic Cell Aggregation Between Immune Cells and Human Lung Microvascular Endothelial Cells at Infectious Hemolysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Metagenomic sequencing combined with Oxford Nanopore Technology has the potential to become a point-of-care test for infectious disease in public health and clinical settings, providing rapid diagnosis of infection, guiding individual patient management and treatment strategies, and informing infection prevention and control practices.

Methods: We conducted a primary survey of 638 adults in Brazil on March 25-28, 2020, about one month (32 days) after the first COVID-19 case in South America was confirmed in Sao Paulo. Results: In Brazil, 52% (332) of the sampled adults experienced mild or moderate distress, and 18.8% (120) suffered severe distress. Adults who were female, younger, more educated, and exercised less report-ed higher levels of distress. The distance from the Brazilian epicenter of Sao Paulo inter-acted with age and workplace attendance to predict the level of distress. The typhoon eye effect was stronger for people who were older or attended their workplace less. The most vulnerable adults were those who were far from the epicenter and did not go to their workplace in the week before the survey.

The technique involved one 11-mm trocar, one 10-mm 0 scope and curved reusable instruments. A supplementary 1.8-mm straight trocarless grasping forceps was percutaneously inserted for perioperative complications or difficulties. RESULTS A unilateral hernia repair was performed in 122 patients, and a bilateral repair in 39 patients. The total operative time was 57.4  22.3 min, and pure laparoscopic time was 46.6  21.6 min. There was no need for insertion of a supplementary 5-mm trocar, and the need for insertion of 1.8-mm trocarless grasper was 32.9%. Perioperative complications occurred in 73 patients. The mean final scar length was 15.3  2.6 mm. The mean hospital stay was 1.0  0.3 days. Postoperative complications at the access site affected 15 patients and at the hernia site 31 patients.

We included 150 students from the Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Cluj-Napoca, Romania (102 females and 48 males, mean age 21 years). Each student completed a lifestyle questionnaire, personal history, family history as well as the Rome IV questionnaire for functional dyspepsia. The status of HP infection was determined using the C13-urea respiratory test. The prevalence of HP infection was 25.33%, and 18% met the Rome IV criteria for functional dyspepsia. 37% of students with functional dyspepsia had a positive HP test. Of all students, 8% had a history of HP infection. Those with a history of HP infection had a 4.45% (95% CI 1.6 C 12.37) higher risk of having positive Rome IV criteria for functional dyspepsia than those with no previous history of infection (p=0.008). Thus, the present study adds to the body of evidence regarding HP prevalence among medical students, 25.33% being positive.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients (n=172) who underwent additional whole-chest CT via a COVID-19 acute abdominal pain CT imaging pathway between 27 March and 3 May 2020 were evaluated in this retrospective single-centre study. Chest CT examinations were graded as non-COVID-19, indeterminate for, or classic/probable for COVID-19. CT examinations in the latter two categories were further divided into one of three anatomical distributions (lung base, limited chest [below carina], whole chest [above carina]) based on location of findings. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results and clinical features of COVID-19 were assessed to determine if COVID-19 was clinically suspected at the time of CT referral. RESULTS Twenty-seven of the 172 (15.7%) patients had CT features potentially indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia, 6/27 (3.5%) demonstrating a classic/probable pattern and 21/27 (12.2%) demonstrating an indeterminate pattern. After correlation with clinical features and RT-PCR 8/172 (4.7%) were defined as COVID-19 positive, of which only 1/172 (0.6%) was clinically unsuspected of COVID-19 at the time of CT referral. All COVID-19 positive cases could be identified on review of the lung base alone. CONCLUSION Whole-chest CT as part of an acute abdominal pain CT imaging pathway has a very low diagnostic yield for the present cohort of patients. All COVID-19-positive patients in the present cohort were identified on review of the lung bases on the abdominal CT and this offers an alternative imaging approach in this patient group.","output":"Diagnostic utility of additional whole-chest CT as part of an acute abdominal pain CT imaging pathway during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still evolving and affecting millions of lives. E-government and social media have been used widely during this unprecedented time to spread awareness and educate the public on preventive measures. However, the extent to which the 2 digital platforms bring to improve public health awareness and prevention during a health crisis is unknown. In this study, we examined the influence of e-government and social media on the public's attitude to adopt protective behavior. For this purpose, a Web survey was conducted among 404 Malaysian residents during the Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO) period in the country. Descriptive and multiple regression analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS software. Social media was chosen by most of the respondents (n = 331 or 81.9%) as the source to get information related to COVID-19. Multiple regression analysis suggests the roles of e-government and social media to be significantly related to people's attitudes to engage in protective behavior. In conclusion, during the COVID-19 outbreak, public health decision makers may use e-government and social media platforms as effective tools to improve public engagement on protective behavior.

This study examines whether there was an increase in the prevalence and incidence of common mental disorders (CMD) in the UK adult population during the first months of lockdown and whether changes in CMD were associated with stressors related to the pandemic and lockdown. METHODS: Longitudinal data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study waves 10C11: 2019C2020 and waves 1C4 of the COVID-19 monthly surveys in April (n = 17 761) to July 2020 (n = 13 754), a representative sample of UK adult population, were analysed. CMD was measured using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) (cut-off >2). Changes in CMD were analysed in relation to COVID-19 and social stressors. RESULTS: Around 29% of adults without CMD less than a year earlier had a CMD in April 2020. However, by July 2020, monthly incidence of CMD had reduced to 9%. Most employment, financial and psychological shocks were at their highest levels in April and reduced steadily in later months. Despite the lifting of some lockdown conditions by July, stressors related to loneliness, unemployment, financial problems and domestic work continued to influence CMD. CONCLUSION: Some COVID-19 policy responses such as furloughing may have been effective in mitigating the increase in CMD for some groups of employees. Despite some reduction in levels of pandemic and lockdown-related stressors by the middle of 2020, loneliness and financial stressors remained key determinants of incidence in CMD among the UK adult population.","output":"The mental health impact of COVID-19 and lockdown-related stressors among adults in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The study aimed to investigate the prevalence and titres of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children treated at the Childrens Hospital Zagreb in the first and the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistical significance of difference at two time points was done to determine how restrictive epidemiological measures and exposure of children to COVID-19 infection affect this prevalence in different age groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At the first time point (13th to 29th May 2020), 240 samples and in second time point (24th October to 23rd November 2020), 308 serum samples were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Confirmation of results and titre determination was done using virus micro-neutralization test. Subjects were divided according to gender, age and epidemiological history. RESULTS: Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies differs significantly in two time points (P = 0.010). In first time point 2.9% of seropositive children were determined and in second time point 8.4%. Statistically significant difference (P = 0.007) of seroprevalence between two time points was found only in a group of children aged 11-19 years. At the first time point, all seropositive children were asymptomatic with titre < 8. At the second time point, 69.2% seropositive children were asymptomatic with titre  8. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was significantly lower at the first time point than at the second time point.

METHODS The data of 84 patients who underwent EG for LPG between January 2013 and September 2019 were analyzed. EG with fundoplication was done using a circular stapler (OrVil) in 45 patients (CS group) and a linear stapler in 39 patients (LS group). The patients' medical records were reviewed. Clinical symptoms were obtained by interview at each outpatient consultation. All patients underwent postoperative 1-year follow-up endoscopy. To minimize bias between the two groups, propensity scores were calculated using a logistic regression model. After propensity-score matching, 60 patients (30 in the CS group and 30 in the LS group) were studied. RESULTS Patient characteristics, operative outcomes were similar in two groups. Anastomotic leakage occurred in one patient (3.3%) in both groups. Anastomotic stenosis occurred in five patients (16.7%) in the CS group and two patients (6.7%) in the LS group.

Objective To determine whether baseline IL-6 serum levels can predict the need for IMV and the response to TCZ. Methods Retrospective observational study performed in hospitalized patients diagnosed of COVID-19. Clinical information and laboratory findings, including IL-6 levels, were collected approximately 3 and 9 days after admission to be matched with pre- and post-administration of TCZ. Multivariable logistic and linear regressions, and survival analysis were performed depending on outcomes: need for IMV, evolution of arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) or mortality. Results One hundred and forty-six patients were studied, predominantly male (66%); median age was 63 years. Forty-four patients (30%) required IMV, and 58 patients (40%) received treatment with TCZ. IL-6 levels>30 pg/ml was the best predictor for IMV (OR:7.1; p<0.001). Early administration of TCZ was associated with improvement of oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2) in patients with high IL-6 (p=0.048).

International studies have demonstrated that troponin is an independent predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients but to our knowledge this has not been assessed in a UK hospitalised population. We performed a single-centre retrospective observational study investigating the association between troponin positivity in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and increased mortality in the short term. Methods All adults admitted with swab-proven RT-PCR COVID-19 to Homerton University Hospital (HUH) from 04.02.20 to 30.04.20 were eligible for inclusion. We retrospectively analysed data collected from the physical and electronic patient records (EPR) including demographic and biochemical data (e.g. serum high sensitivity Troponin I). Data was analysed according to the primary outcome of death at 28 days during hospital admission. Troponin positivity was defined above the upper limit of normal according to our local laboratory assay (&gt;15.5ng/l for females, &gt;34 ng/l for males). Univariate and multivariate logistical regression analyses were performed to evaluate the link between troponin positivity and death. Results The total number of adults with swab-proven RT-PCR COVID-19 to HUH from the date of the first positive swab to 30th April 2020 was 402. Mean length of stay for all patients was 9.1 days(SD 12.0). Table 1 shows selected demographics. This is a highly comorbid population with modest ethnic minority representation. Mean age was 65.3 years for men compared to 63.8 years for women. In those with a positive initial troponin, there was a high burden of mortality at 28 days post-admission. Mortality in troponin positive and negative patients is shown in table 2. A chi-squared test showed that survival of COVID-19 patients was significantly higher in those with a negative troponin (p = 3.23 x10-10) compared to those with a positive troponin. A Mann Whitney U test showed that initial troponin was significantly higher in those who died (p = 2.24 x10-12) compared to those who were alive. Mean initial troponin was 89.8 (95% CI 43.1 - 136.5). In the multivariate logistical regression, lung disease, age, troponin positivity and CPAP were all significantly associated with death, with an AUC of 0.8872, sensitivity of 0.9004 and specificity of 0.6292 for the model. Within this model, troponin positivity was independently associated with short term mortality (OR 3.23 , 95% CI 1.53-7.16, p=0.00278).

Methods: Epidemiological investigation and big data technology were used to verify the exposure points of the cases. Close contacts were traced from the exposure points, and their human and environmental samples were collected for nucleic acid tests. Serum samples were collected from key persons for antibody detection. Results: A total of 33 corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19) cases were reported in the local outbreak, from January 17, 2021 to January 29, 2021 in Daxing district, Beijing, and there was epidemiological association in 32 cases. Except for one case who was infected in the workplace, other cases were all infected in the community and family. All cases involved 14 families, of which 6 families were all infected. The attack rate of all family members was 69%(33/48), and the secondary attack rate was 56%(19/34). There was no obvious source of infection found after the investigation of entry-exit personnel and goods.

But the role of immune dysregulation of malignant patients on poor prognosis of COVID-19 has remained insufficiently investigated. Here we conducted a retrospective cohort study that included 2,052 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (Cancer, n = 93; Non-cancer, n = 1,959), and compared the immunological characteristics of both cohorts. We used stratification analysis, multivariate regressions, and propensity-score matching to evaluate the effect of immunological indices. In result, COVID-19 patients with cancer had ongoing and significantly elevated inflammatory factors and cytokines (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8), as well as decreased immune cells (CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, B cells, NK cells, Th and Ts cells) than those without cancer. The mortality rate was significantly higher in cancer cohort (24.7%) than non-cancer cohort (10.8%). By stratification analysis, COVID-19 patients with immune dysregulation had poorer prognosis than those with the relatively normal immune system both in cancer and non-cancer cohort. By logistic regression, Cox regression, and propensity-score matching, we found that prior to adjustment for immunological indices, cancer history was associated with an increased mortality risk of COVID-19 (p < .05); after adjustment for immunological indices, cancer history was no longer an independent risk factor for poor prognosis of COVID-19 (p > .30). In conclusion, COVID-19 patients with cancer had more severely dysregulated immune responses than noncancerous patients, which might account for their poorer prognosis.

Information on how MI and SVP intercorrelate and their part in a psychological trauma complex is limited. We tested and validated a German version of the Moral Injury Symptom and Support Scale for Health Professionals (G-MISS-HP) instrument, screening for MI and correlated it with the recently developed German version of the Second Victim Experience and Support Tool (G-SVESTR) instrument, testing for SVP. Methods: After translating Moral Injury Symptom and Support Scale for Health Professionals (MISS-HP), we conducted a cross-sectional online survey providing G-MISS-HP and G-SVEST-R to HP. Statistics included Pearsons interitem correlation, reliability analysis, principal axis factoring and principal components analysis with Promax rotation, confirmatory factor and ROC analyses. Results: A total of 244 persons responded, of whom 156 completed the survey (33% nurses, 16% physicians, 9% geriatric nurses, 7.1% speech and language therapists). Interitem and corrected item-scale correlations did not measure for one item sufficiently. It was, therefore, excluded from further analyses. The nine-item score revealed good reliability (Guttmans lambda 2 = 0.80; Cronbachs alpha = 0.79). Factor validity was demonstrated, indicating that a three-factor model from the original study might better represent the data compared with our two-factor model. Positive correlations between G-MISS-HP and G-SVESTR subscales demonstrated convergent validity. ROC revealed sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 63% for G-MISS-HP using a nine-item scale with cutoff value of 28.5 points. Positive and negative predictive values were 62% and 69%, respectively. Subgroup analyses did not reveal any differences. Conclusion: G-MISS-HP with nine items is a valid and reliable testing instrument for moral injury. However, strong intercorrelations of MI and SVP indicate the need for further research on the distinction of these phenomena.","output":"Validation of the German Version of the Moral Injury Symptom and Support Scale for Health Professionals (G-MISS-HP) and Its Correlation to the Second Victim Phenomenon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Principals are critical to improving schools, but job-related stress and burnout are factors that can limit principal effectiveness and lead to untimely turnover.

During this audit, Prof. Serge Vaudenay and Dr. Martin Vuagnoux described a large set of problems with the app, including a new variation of a known false-positive attack, leveraging a cryptographic weakness in the Google and Apple Exposure Notification framework to tamper with the emitted Bluetooth beacons. Separately, the first author described a re-identification attack leveraging rogue apps or SDKs. The response from the Swiss cybersecurity agency and the Swiss public health authority was to claim these various attacks were unlikely as they required physical proximity of the attacker with the target (although it was admitted the attacker could be further than two meters). The physical presence of the attacker in Switzerland was deemed significant as it would imply such attackers would fall under the Swiss Criminal Code. We show through one example that a much larger variety of adversaries must be considered in the scenarios originally described and that these attacks can be done by adversaries without any physical presence in Switzerland. This goes directly against official findings of Swiss public authorities evaluating the risks associated with SwissCovid. To move the discussion further along, we briefly discuss the growth of the attack surface and harms with COVID-19 and SwissCovid prevalence in the population.

However, effective prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines have yet to be developed for completely curing deadly diseases, such as cancer, malaria, HIV, and serious microbial infections. Thus, suitable vaccine candidates need to be designed to elicit appropriate immune responses. Nanotechnology has been found to play a unique role in the design of vaccines, providing them with enhanced specificity and potency. Nano-scaled materials, such as virus-like particles, liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), and protein NPs, have received considerable attention over the past decade as potential carriers for the delivery of vaccine antigens and adjuvants, due to their beneficial advantages, like improved antigen stability, targeted delivery, and long-time release, for which antigens/adjuvants are either encapsulated within, or decorated on, the NP surface. Flexibility in the design of nanomedicine allows for the programming of immune responses, thereby addressing the many challenges encountered in vaccine development. Biomimetic NPs have emerged as innovative natural mimicking biosystems that can be used for a wide range of biomedical applications.

The initiatives taken by various ministries and divisions of Bangladesh resonated partially with 84 targets of SDGs. Findings - Ambiguous mandates of different ministries and divisions have caused overlapping jurisdiction, followed by conflicts of interest and lack of cohesion. Inaccurate stakeholder analysis, data unavailability, lack of competency and accountability, and a top-down policy approach can be considered as the major institutional bottlenecks in achieving SDGs. Originality/value - This paper advocates revising the map to incorporate the right stakeholders to avoid erroneous monitoring, evaluation, and finally, inaccurate reporting. The reallocation of business for ministries and divisions is warranted to abolish jurisdictional overlapping and conflict of interests and make SDGs friendly.

Jean Garrab lui-mme a cherch  s'inscrire dans cette dynamique, en considrant l'existence de diffrentes perspectives dans le paysage psychiatrique. L'objectif de cet article est de retracer d'ventuelles continuits entre la pense de Jean Garrab et les enjeux nosologiques contemporains axs autour du pluralisme. Nous partirons pour cela d'un des leitmotivs de l'auteur, selon lequel l'histoire peut renseigner la construction des classifications psychiatriques. Dans la premire partie, nous rappellerons la diversit des perspectives en philosophie de la psychiatrie et en philosophie des sciences. Dans la seconde partie, nous verrons comment Jean Garrab a su discuter, plus ou moins explicitement, trois axes actuellement dvelopps dans les propositions de modlisations contemporaines de la psychiatrie. La premire partie dtaille les relations que Jean Garrab a entretenues avec la philosophie des sciences. Nous analysons trois exemples nosographiques tmoignant de la diversit de ces changes. La seconde partie tudie trois axes conceptuels dvelopps au sein des modlisations et des classifications contemporaines C  savoir la dynamique, la hirarchie et la dimensionnalit des troubles psychiatriques. La pense de Jean Garrab est marque par l'empreinte du pluralisme et des trois axes que nous avons identifis. Le premier axe concerne son intrt pour la dynamique temporelle des phnomnes psychopathologiques, voluant dans le temps de manire synchronique et diachronique. Le deuxime concerne son intrt pour la hirarchisation des troubles et des lments smiologiques, que ce soit via une intuition de validit comme chez Kraepelin, ou via des tudes statistiques comme dans les taxonomies contemporaines. Le troisime axe correspond  l'intrt de Jean Garrab pour la dimensionnalit, qui prend en compte l'tude des fonctionnements sous-jacents aux troubles psychiatriques, qu'ils soient phnomnologiques ou physiopathologiques. The consideration of a plurality of perspectives is highlighted in a various number of medical and scientific disciplines. For example, in psychiatry, many attempts claiming to be pluralism have been carried out over the course of the discipline, e.g. Kraepelinian and Meyerian approaches, biopsychosocial model, Jasperian approach or Freudian psychoanalytic model. At the same time, the starting point for Jean Garrab's views on psychiatric nosology refers to his consideration for the existence of different perspectives in the psychiatric landscape. The objective of this article is to highlight possible continuities between the Jean Garrab's developments and contemporary nosological issues. We will start from one of his leitmotifs, i.e. \\"History can inform the construction of psychiatric classifications\\". In the first part, we present the diversity of perspectives in Philosophy of Psychiatry and in Philosophy of Science. In the second part, we will see how Jean Garrab was able to discuss, in a more or less structured and explicit manner, three axes currently and widely studied in the proposals for contemporary models of psychiatry. In a first part, we analyze the integration of Jean Garrab into the general debates of the philosophy of science and modelisation. We will thus develop three examples of modelisation, based on contemporary psychiatric classifications, to testify this integration. The first example corresponds to staging models, which consider that psychiatric disorders could be better understood as subgroups of evolving elements C rather than as fixed categories in time. Indeed, staging models allow a sub-classification of psychiatric disorders according to their dynamical progression. The second example concerns the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology project, which d scribes psychiatric disorders according to a continuum of quantitative variations, hierarchized in several dimensions. The third example concerns the Research Domain Criteria initiative, which targets some dimensions of mental functioning, i.e. areas of research from contemporary cognitive neurosciences allowing to organize psychiatric research on specific neuroscientific constructs. In a second part of this article, we analyze three axes developed both within the proposals of contemporary models and classifications and the Jean Garrab's views, namely dynamics, hierarchy and dimensionality of psychiatric disorders. Jean Garrab's conceptions seem marked by the footprint of pluralism and the three identified axes. The first axe concerns his interest for the temporal dynamics of psychopathological phenomena, evolving in time in a synchronic and diachronic manner. The second concerns his interest in the hierarchy of disorders and semiological elements, e.g. through validity or statistical analyzes. The third axe corresponds to the Jean Garrab's interest for the dimensionality, which considers elements underlying psychiatric disorders, whether they are phenomenological or physiopathological.

METHODS: A manikin with simulated fluorescein salivation was treated by four experienced dentists applying two different periodontal treatment options, i.e. air-polishing with an airflow device or ultrasonic scaling in the upper and lower anterior front for 5 minutes, respectively. Aerosol deposition was quantitatively measured on 21 pre-defined locations with varying distances to the manikins mouth in triplicates using absorbent filter papers. RESULTS: The selected periodontal interventions resulted in different contamination levels around the patients mouth. The highest contamination could be measured on probes on the patients chest and forehead but also on the practitioners glove. With increasing distance to the working site contamination of the probes decreased with both devices. Air-polishing led to greater contamination than ultrasonic. CONCLUSION: Both devices showed contamination of the nearby structures, less contamination was detected when using the ultrasonic.

ED attendance reduced by 27C62% across all categories of diagnosis in the Delay phase and remained significantly below prior year levels as the country began Phase One of Reopening, with an incident rate ratio (IRR) of 0.58. The decrease was predominantly attributable to reduced attendance for injury and viral/viral induced conditions resulting from changed living conditions imposed by the public health response. However, attendance for complex chronic conditions also reduced and had yet to return to pre-COVID levels as reopening began. Attendances referred by general practitioners (GPs) dropped by 13 percentage points in the Delay phase and remained at that level. While changes in living conditions explain much of the decrease in overall attendance and in GP referrals, reduced attendance for complex chronic conditions may indicate avoidance behaviour and continued surveillance is necessary.","output":"Assessing the Impact of COVID-19 Public Health Stages on Paediatric Emergency Attendance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK Worrying data indicate the urgency of strongly limiting Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI).

The scientific community has made several important inroads in the fight against COVID-19, and there are over 2500 clinical trials registered globally. Within the context of the rapidly changing pandemic, we are seeing a large number of trials conducted without results being made available. It is likely that a plethora of trials have stopped early, not for statistical reasons but due to lack of feasibility. Trials stopped early for feasibility are, by definition, statistically underpowered and thereby prone to inconclusive findings. Statistical power is not necessarily linear with the total sample size, and even small reductions in patient numbers or events can have a substantial impact on the research outcomes. Given the profusion of clinical trials investigating identical or similar treatments across different geographical and clinical contexts, one must also consider that the likelihood of a substantial number of false-positive and false-negative trials, emerging with the increasing overall number of trials, adds to public perceptions of uncertainty. This issue is complicated further by the evolving nature of the pandemic, wherein baseline assumptions on control group risk factors used to develop sample size calculations are far more challenging than those in the case of well-documented diseases. The standard answer to these challenges during nonpandemic settings is to assess each trial for statistical power and risk-of-bias and then pool the reported aggregated results using meta-analytic approaches. This solution simply will not suffice for COVID-19. Even with random-effects meta-analysis models, it will be difficult to adjust for the heterogeneity of different trials with aggregated reported data alone, especially given the absence of common data standards and outcome measures. To date, several groups have proposed structures and partnerships for data sharing.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of STEMI patients admitted to the Hangzhou Chest Pain Center (CPC) during a COVID-19 epidemic period in 2020 (24 cases) and the same period in 2019 (29 cases). General characteristics of the patients were recorded, analyzed, and compared. Moreover, we compared the groups for the time from symptom onset to the first medical contact (SO-to-FMC), time from first medical contact to balloon expansion (FMC-to-B), time from hospital door entry to first balloon expansion (D-to-B), and catheter room activation time. The groups were also compared for postoperative cardiac color Doppler ultrasonographic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF),the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE),Kaplan-Meier survival curves during the 28 days after the operation. RESULTS: The times of SO-to-FMC, D-to-B, and catheter room activation in the 2020 group were significantly longer than those in the 2019 group (P < 0.05).

We reported the first Hong Kong patient without risk factors for severe A(H7N9) disease. METHODS: Direct sequencing was performed on the endotracheal aspirate collected from a 36-year-old female with history of poultry contact. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to compare the current strain and previous A(H7N9) isolates. RESULTS: The influenza A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 virus strain was detected in a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome, deranged liver function and coagulation profile, cytopenia, and rhabdomyolysis. The HA, NA and MP genes of A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 cluster with those of other human A(H7N9) strains. The PB1, PB2 and NS genes are most closely related to those of A/Guangdong/1/2013 strain identified in August 2013, but are distinct from those of other human and avian A(H7N9) strains. The other internal genes NP and PA genes are more closely related to those of non-A(H7N9) avian influenza A viruses. A unique PA L336M mutation, associated with increased polymerase activity, was found. The patient required salvage by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS: The A/Hong Kong/470129/2013 virus is a novel reassortant derived from A/Guangdong/1/2013 virus.

As a consequence, it imposed delirious consequences in patients with underlying co C morbid conditions that make them immunocompromised. The purpose of this paper is to provide an in - depth review of influence of COVID C 19 in patients with underlying HIV in terms of mortality and hospitalization. Authors also aim to provide a thorough risk analysis of hospitalization, ICU admission and mortality of PLWH and COVID-19. The secondary objective was to analyze the CD4+ count variations and outcome of COVID - 19 and to correlate if ART provided a protective role. Authors also aim to provide an evaluation of typical clinical presentation of COVID-19 in PLWH. ART is found to show activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and there is some similarity in the structure of HIV-1 gp41 and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV since they both belong to +ssRNA type. Methods We conducted a literature review using search engines namely, Cochrane, PubMed and Google Scholar. The following keywords were targeted: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV. We included case reports, case series, and cohort (retrospective and prospective) studies. We excluded clinical trials and review articles. We came across 23 articles that met the inclusion criteria. PRISMA guidelines were followed for study acquisition (Fig. 9). Results From the 23 studies, we found a total of 651 PLWH with confirmed COVID-19 (549, 91, and 11 in cohorts, case series, and case reports, respectively). The overall risk of hospital admission from pooled data of the 23 reviewed articles was 69.13% (450/651), ICU admission was 12.90% (84/651) in total infected patients, and 18.67% (84/450) among hospitalized patients. The overall case fatality rate from the 23 reviewed articles was 11.21 (73/651).A weak positive correlation was found between CD4+ counts and hospital admissions in case series and case reports, while the weak negative correlation was found in cohorts. For mortality, there was a negative weak association in the cohorts and in case series, while a weak positive was seen in case reports (Fig.7). We assessed the presenting symptoms of PLWH with COVID-19, and our review demonstrated this group does not greatly differ from the rest of the population, as their common presenting symptoms were cough, fever, and SOB. Conclusion Our results indicated that there was a high rate of hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality among patients living with HIV and COVID-19. PLWH needs to be noted as a high-risk group for COVID-19 complications and severity. We recommend that PLWH be closely monitored by their physicians and strictly adhere to antiretroviral therapy and standard universal COVID-19 precautions.","output":"Influence of Novel Coronavirus COVID C 19 and HIV: A Scoping Review of Hospital Course and Symptomatology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its eruption in China, novel coronavirus disease (Covid\\\\19) has been reported in most of the countries and territories (>200) of the world with ~ 18 million confirmed cases (as of August 3, 2020).

Although most often used in the laboratory it has seen increasing application under field conditions. Air is drawn or pushed through a metabolic chamber or the nest with the animal, and the O2 depletion and/or CO2 accumulation in the air is analysed to calculate metabolic rate and energy expenditure. Under field conditions, animals are often measured within the microclimate of their nest and in contrast to laboratory work, the temperature of the air entering the nest cannot be controlled. Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the explanatory power of respirometry in a set-up mimicking field conditions. We measured O2 consumption of 14 laboratory mice (Mus musculus) using three different flow rates [50 L*h-1 (834 mL*min-1), 60 L*h-1 (1000 mL*min-1) and 70 L*h-1 (1167 mL*min-1)] and two different temperatures of the inflowing air; either the same as the temperature inside the metabolic chamber (no temperature differential; 20 C), or cooler (temperature differential of 10 C). Our results show that the energy expenditure of the mice did not change significantly in relation to a cooler airflow, nor was it affected by different flow rates, despite a slight, but significant decrease of about 1.5 C in chamber temperature with the cooler airflow. Our study emphasises the validity of the results obtained by open-flow respirometry when investigating energy budgets and physiological responses of animals to ambient conditions. Nevertheless, subtle changes in chamber temperature in response to changes in the temperature and flow rate of the air pulled or pushed through the system were detectable. Thus, constant airflow during open-flow respirometry and consequent changes in nest/chamber temperature should be measured.","output":"Open-flow respirometry under field conditions: How does the airflow through the nest influence our results?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In March 2020, Saudi Arabia (KSA) experienced a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The mitigation strategy aimed to reduce both the impact on vulnerable groups and the risk of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Risk factors, such as sequential organ failure, comorbidities, ventilation, and mortality, have not been described in different settings of care. Materials and Methods: A multicenter, retrospective chart review of 220 adults with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU included demographics and ICU admission factors (e.g., quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score, ventilator status, comorbidities, days from laboratory confirmation to ICU admission, and days from hospitalization to ICU admission). Regression was utilized to identify predictors of need for mechanical ventilation (MV) and mortality in ICU patients. Results: ICU admission, COVID-19 hospital mortality, and ventilator-associated mortality rates were 26.5%, 44%, and 30.5%, respectively. The mean patients' age was 30 years. Across four cities, Jeddah patients were at the highest risk of MV (<0.001). Within the 1st day of hospitalization, without lymphocytopenia, non-Saudi patients with a qSOFA score of 2 and 3 were at the highest risk of ventilation (odds ratio [OR], 3.9;95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72-8.66;OR, 11.4;95% CI, 2.35-55.47;and OR, 6.1;95% CI, 1.0-37.33, respectively). Moreover, within the same period of hospital stay, mechanically-ventilated patients with a qSOFA score of 3 who received antiviral medications were significantly at the higher risk of death (OR, 2.8.4;95% CI, 1.44-5.64;OR, 13.1;95% CI, 1.23-39.68;and OR, 2.2;95% CI, 1.14-4.14, respectively). Conclusions: The 1st day of hospitalization, along with an assessment of the dyspnea status using the qSOFA score, is the window of opportunity for minimizing ICU admission risk. Neither lymphocytopenia nor comorbidities are associated with the risk of mechanical ventilation. Factors were also discussed.

There is little data regarding peri-procedural outcomes of medical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. We enacted protocols to safely reboot AF ablation while limiting healthcare resource utilization. We aimed to evaluate acute and subacute outcomes of protocols instituted for reboot of AF ablation during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Perioperative healthcare utilization and acute procedural outcomes were analyzed for consecutive patients undergoing AF ablation under COVID-19 protocols (2020 cohort; n=111) and compared to those of patients who underwent AF ablation during the same time period in 2019 (2019 cohort; n=200). Newly implemented practices included preoperative COVID-19 testing, selective transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), utilization of venous closure, and same-day discharge when clinically appropriate. RESULTS: Pre-ablation COVID-19 testing was positive in 1 of 111 patients. There were 0 cases ablation-related COVID-19 transmission and 0 major complications in either cohort. Pre-procedure TEE was performed in significantly fewer 2020 cohort patients compared to the 2019 cohort patients (68.4% vs. 97.5%, p <0.001, respectively) despite greater prevalence of persistent arrhythmia in the 2020 cohort.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of indicators related to access to healthcare services, in COVID-19 surveillance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A time series analysis was performed using the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19 in Mainland Portugal, between weeks 14/2020 (March 30 to April 5) and 25/2020 (June 15 to 21), and six indicators: 1) COVID-19 consultations in primary healthcare; 2) number of COVID-19 emergency department visits; 3) number of emergency department visits due to viral pneumonia; 4) number of hospitalizations due to viral pneumonia; 5) proportion of emergency department visits due to viral pneumonia; and 6) proportion of hospitalizations for viral pneumonia. Pearson correlation and cross-correlations were computed. RESULTS: A strong correlation was found between the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19 and all indicators. [(1) 0.76; (2) 0.82; (3) 0.77; (4) 0.84; (5) 0.86; e (6) 0.90]. Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for viral pneumonia detect variations in the frequency of the disease with a one week lag compared to the incidence rate of COVID-19, in one week. COVID-19 consultations in primary healthcare and emergency department visits trail behind the incidence rate of COVID-19, in one week. The proportion of viral pneumonias in emergency department visits, or hospitalizations, is temporally aligned with the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19. DISCUSSION: The delay found in the COVID-19 primary healthcare consultations and emergency department visits, may be related to changes in access to healthcare services and clinical coding. Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for viral pneumonia may be useful in the early detection of COVID-19. Viral pneumonia may have been coded as being of unknown origin. Future monitoring of these indicators is necessary to ascertain whether the incidence of COVID-19 is significantly influenced by changes in testing strategies. The indicators described in this study will be an asset for the optimization of testing strategies, allocation of healthcare resources to the communities that are most vulnerable to severe morbidity and assessing vaccination impact. As such, surveillance systems based on clinical data will be a valuable complementary tool to SINAVE. CONCLUSION: The indicators under analysis could be used regularly, with special attention to viral pneumonias, to detect outbreaks of COVID-19.

The need to address SDOH is reinforced by morbidity and mortality trends, including a recent multiyear decrease in life expectancy and persistent health disparities. Leadership on SDOH-related efforts has come from public health, health care, private philanthropy, and nongovernmental entities. STRATEGY The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been addressing SDOH through both disease- or condition-specific programs and crosscutting offices. Guidance from public health partners in the field has led the CDC to consider more strategic approaches to incorporating SDOH into public health activities. IMPLEMENTATION The CDC's crosscutting SDOH Workgroup responded to external recommendations to develop a specific vision and plan that aims to integrate SDOH into the agency's infrastructure. The group also sponsors CDC forums for sharing research and trainings on embedding SDOH in programs. The group created a Web site to centralize CDC SDOH research, data sources, practice tools, programs, and policies. PROGRESS The CDC has shown strong leadership in prioritizing SDOH in recent years. Individual programs and crosscutting offices have developed various models aimed at ensuring that public health research and practice address SDOH. DISCUSSION Building sustainable SDOH infrastructures in public health institutions that reach across multiple health topics and non-health organizations could increase chances of meeting public health morbidity and mortality reduction goals, including decreasing health disparities. Although public health priorities and socioeconomic trends will change over time, experience suggests that social and structural factors will continue to influence the public's health. The CDC and state, tribal, local, and territorial public health institutions have played important leadership roles in the system of community and service organizations that interface with communities they mutually serve to address SDOH.

Older age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and raised serum D-dimer and interleukin-6 were predictive of poor outcomes. Overall, 33.7% of live births were preterm, of which half were iatrogenic among women with mild COVID-19 and no complications. Most women underwent cesarean despite lacking a clear indication. Eight (2.0%) neonates had positive nasopharyngeal swabs after delivery and developed chest infection within 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced gestation, maternal age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and a combination of elevated D-dimer and interleukin-6 levels are predictive of poor pregnancy outcomes in COVID-19. The rate of iatrogenic preterm birth and cesarean delivery is high; vertical transmission may be possible but has not been proved.","output":"Clinical characteristics, prognostic factors, and maternal and neonatal outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospitalized pregnant women: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An unprecedented global lockdown has been implemented for controlling the spread of COVID-19 in many countries. These actions are reducing the number of coronics, but with the prolonged COVID-19 outbreak, the restrictions on the activities of people are having a significant impact on all industries. Accordingly, this study aimed to statistically analyze changes in building energy consumption under the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, as well as identify the relationship between COVID-19 and building energy consumption according to the building use type. As a result, the average rate of changes in electricity and gas energy consumption decreased ?4.46% and ?10.35%, respectively, compared to the previous year. The energy consumption in most facilities has tended to decrease while energy consumption in residential facilities increased during COVID-19. The rate of change in building energy consumption had a significantly positive correlation with COVID-19 related factors in various facilities (e.g., neighborhood, religious, educational, and research facilities). Significant findings of this study that social distancing by the COVID-19 outbreak, has changed energy consumption according to building use type indicates the need for new energy systems to effectively manage the energy demand at the community level in the Post COVID-19 era.","output":"Changes in energy consumption according to building use type under COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemic threshold of the susceptibleCinfectedCrecovered model is a boundary separating parameters that permit epidemics from those that do not. This threshold corresponds to parameters where the system's equilibrium becomes unstable. Consequently, we use the average rate at which deviations from the equilibrium shrink to define a distance to this threshold. However, the vital dynamics of the host population may occur slowly even when transmission is far from threshold levels. Here, we show analytically how such slow dynamics can prevent estimation of the distance to the threshold from fluctuations in the susceptible population. Although these results are exact only in the limit of long-term observation of a large system, simulations show that they still provide useful insight into systems with a range of population sizes, environmental noise and observation schemes. Having established some guidelines about when estimates are accurate, we then illustrate how multiple distance estimates can be used to estimate the rate of approach to the threshold. The estimation approach is general and may be applicable to zoonotic pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) as well as vaccine-preventable diseases like measles.","output":"Estimating the distance to an epidemic threshold"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We consider the problem of optimizing the distribution operations at a drone hub that dispatches drones to different geographic locations generating stochastic demands for medical supplies. Drone delivery is an innovative method that introduces many benefits, such as low-contact delivery, thereby reducing the spread of pandemic and vaccine-preventable diseases. While we focus on medical supply delivery for this work, drone delivery is suitable for many other items, including food, postal parcels, and e-commerce. In this paper, our goal is to address drone delivery challenges related to the stochastic demands of different geographic locations. We consider different classes of demand related to geographic locations that require different flight ranges, which is directly related to the amount of charge held in a drone battery. We classify the stochastic demands based on their distance from the drone hub, use a Markov decision process to model the problem, and perform computational tests using realistic data representing a prominent drone delivery company. We solve the problem using a reinforcement learning method and show its high performance compared with the exact solution found using dynamic programming.

This study assessed the association between baseline microscopic and submicroscopic asymptomatic P. falciparum infections and anti-malarial antibody levels and whether these parasitaemia modify protective associations between antibody levels and malaria in Ghanaian children. Healthy children (N=973, aged 0.5-12 years) were recruited into a 50-week longitudinal malaria cohort study from January 2016 to January 2017. Baseline asymptomatic parasitaemia were determined by microscopy (microscopic parasitaemia) and polymerase chain reaction (submicroscopic parasitaemia) and antibody levels against crude schizont antigens measured by ELISA. Antibody levels, parasite diversity and risk of malaria in the ensuing transmission season were compared among children who had baseline asymptomatic microscopic or submicroscopic or no P. falciparum infections. Of the 99 asymptomatic baseline infections, 46 (46.5%) were microscopic and 53 (53.5%), submicroscopic. Cox regression analysis adjusting for age group, sex and community found a strong association between both baseline microscopic [Hazard ratio (HR)=0.36, 95%CI=(0.21, 0.63), p<0.001] and submicroscopic [HR=0.22, 95%CI=(0.11, 0.44), p<0.001] asymptomatic parasitaemia and a reduced risk of febrile malaria compared to those who were uninfected at baseline. Baseline asymptomatic submicroscopic parasitaemia had a significant effect on associations between anti-schizont antibodies and protection against febrile malaria (likelihood ratio test p<0.001). The study found both baseline P. falciparum asymptomatic microscopic and more strongly submicroscopic infections to be associated with protection against febrile malaria in the ensuing transmission season.

However, little is known about the potential endogenous reasons for the increase in COVID-19 associated mortality in Italy. Objective: This study aimed to search the potential endogenous reasons for the increase in COVID-19 mortality recorded in Italy during the year 2020 and evaluate the statistical significance of the latter. Methods: We analyzed all the trends in the timelapse 2011-2019 related to deaths by age, sex, region, and cause of death in Italy and compared them with those of 2020. Ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regressions and ARIMA (p, d, q) models were applied to investigate the predictions of death in the year 2020 as compared to death reported in 2020. Grubbs and Iglewicz-Hoaglin tests were used to identify the statistical differences between the predictors and observed death during the year 2020. The relationship between mortality and predictive variables was assessed using OLS multiple regression models. Results: Both ARIMA and OLS linear regression models predicted the number of deaths in Italy during the year 2020 is between 640,000 and 660,000 (95% confidence intervals range: 620,000 - 695,000) and these values were far from the observed deaths reported (n = 750,000). Significant difference in deaths at national level (P = 0.003), and higher male mortality than women (+18% versus +14%, P < 0.001 versus P = 0.01) was observed. Finally, higher mortality was strongly and positively correlated with latitude (R = 0.82, P < 0.001) Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the absence of historical endogenous reasons capable of justifying the increase in deaths and mortality observed in Italy in 2020. Together with the current knowledge on the novel coronavirus 2019, these findings provide decisive evidence on the devastating impact of COVID-19 in Italy. We suggest that this research be leveraged by government, health, and information authorities to furnish proof against conspiracy theorists.

METHODS Two metal catalysts Ag/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 were pressed into wafers. One hundred microL 10(6) TCID50/mL SARS-CoV, 100 microL 10(6) PFU/mL recombinant baculovirus expressing hamster's prion protein (haPrP) protein and roughly 10(6) E. coli were slowly dropped onto the surfaces of the catalyst wafers and exposed for 5 and 20 min, respectively. After eluted from the surfaces of wafers, the infectivity of viruses and propagation of bacteria were measured. The expression of PrP protein was determined by Western blot. The morphological changes of bacteria were observed by electronic microscopy. RESULTS After exposure to the catalysts surfaces for 5 and 20 min, the infectivity of SARS-CoV in Vero cells and baculovirus in Sf9 cells dropped down to a very low and undetectable level, and no colony was detected using bacteria culture method. The expression of haPrP protein reduced to 21.8% in the preparation of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus exposed for 5 min and was undetectable exposed for 20 min. Bacterial membranes seemed to be cracked and the cytoplasm seemed to be effluent from cell bodies. CONCLUSION Exposures to the surfaces of Ag/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 destroy the replication and propagation abilities of SARS-CoV, baculovirus and E. coli.

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study of patients from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III, version 1.4), we evaluated the association of thiamine use with clinical outcomes in patients with AUD and sepsis. The primary outcome was 28-day survival, and secondary outcomes included ICU, in-hospital, and 90-day mortality, ICU and hospital length of stay, duration of vasopressor use, need and duration of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and dynamic changes for variables up to day 7 after ICU admission. RESULTS: A total of 944 patients with sepsis and AUD were included in this cohort [median age, 53.1 years; women, 26.0% (245 of 944)]. Among all patients, 24.6% (233 of 944) received thiamine with a dose of 200 mg (IQR 100-345 mg).

Further, doing so will provide a baseline for investigation of the long-term effects of these public health measures upon behaviours and perceptions, and facilitate future follow-up study. OBJECTIVES: To determine how the onset of coronavirus (COVID-19), and associated 'lockdown', affected RT behaviours, in addition to motivation, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and intent to continue, in those who regularly performed RT prior to the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study using online surveys in multiple languages (English, Danish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Slovakian, Swedish, and Japanese) distributed across social media platforms and through authors' professional and personal networks. Adults (n = 5389; median age = 31 years [interquartile range (IQR) = 25, 38]), previously engaged in RT prior to lockdown (median prior RT experience = 7 years [IQR = 4, 12]) participated. Outcomes were self-reported RT behaviours including: continuation of RT during lockdown, location of RT, purchase of specific equipment for RT, method of training, full-body or split routine, types of training, repetition ranges, exercise number, set volumes (per exercise and muscle group), weekly frequency of training, perception of effort, whether training was planned/recorded, time of day, and training goals. Secondary outcomes included motivation, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and intent to continue RT. RESULTS: A majority of individuals (82.8%) maintained participation in RT during-lockdown. Marginal probabilities from generalised linear models and generalised estimating equations for RT behaviours were largely similar from pre- to during-lockdown. There was reduced probability of training in privately owned gyms (~ 59% to ~ 7%) and increased probability of training at home (~ 18% to ~ 89%); greater probability of training using a full-body routine (~ 38% to ~ 51%); reduced probability of resistance machines (~ 66% to ~ 13%) and free weight use (~ 96% to ~ 81%), and increased probability of bodyweight training (~ 62% to ~ 82%); reduced probability of moderate repetition ranges (~ 62-82% to ~ 55-66%) and greater probability of higher repetition ranges (~ 27% to ~ 49%); and moderate reduction in the perception of effort experienced during-training (r = 0.31). Further, individuals were slightly less likely to plan or record training during lockdown and many changed their training goals. Additionally, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and likelihood of continuing current training were all lower during-lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Those engaged in RT prior to lockdown these behaviours with only slight adaptations in both location and types of training performed. However, people employed less effort, had lower motivation, and perceived training as less effective and enjoyable, reporting their likelihood of continuing current training was similar or lower than pre-lockdown. These results have implications for strategies to maintain engagement in positive health behaviours such as RT during-restrictive pandemic-related public health measures.

In most cases, elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein as well as lymphocytic pleocytosis were found. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in five (24%) patients, meanwhile in 13 (62%) patients, the testing was negative. Testing was not performed in two cases and, in one, data were unavailable. Nearly half of the cases (N=9) were associated with isolated long extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), whereas a combination of both LETM and patchy involvement was found in two. Only five patients had isolated short segment involvement and two patchy involvement. Furthermore, concomitant demyelination of both brain and spine was reported in six patients. Concerning the prognosis, most of the patients improved and the mortality rate was low (N = 2, <10%). CONCLUSION: : Spinal cord demyelination should be added to the plethora of immune mediated neurologic complications associated with COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 and emerging spinal cord complications: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein complexes that crucially contribute to host defense against pathogens but are also involved in the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases. Inflammasome formation leads to activation of effector caspases (caspase-1, 4, 5, or 11), the proteolytic maturation of IL-1 and IL-18 as well as cleavage of the pore-forming protein Gasdermin D. Dendritic cells are major regulators of immune responses as they bridge innate and adaptive immunity. We here summarize the current knowledge on inflammasome expression and formation in murine bone marrow-, human monocyte-derived as well as murine and human primary dendritic cells. Further, we discuss both, the beneficial and detrimental, involvement of inflammasome activation in dendritic cells in cancer, infections, and autoimmune diseases. As inflammasome activation is typically accompanied by Gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis, which is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death, inflammasome formation in dendritic cells seems ill-advised. Therefore, we propose that hyperactivation, which is inflammasome activation without the induction of pyroptosis, may be a general model of inflammasome activation in dendritic cells to enhance Th1, Th17 as well as cytotoxic T cell responses.","output":"Inflammasomes in Dendritic Cells: Friend or Foe?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of new vaccine modalities is a critical need to address many of the shortcomings of traditional platforms such as the lack of sufficient efficacy against certain pathogens or cancer; difficulties with production; or, in some cases, safety issues [...].","output":"mRNA Innovates the Vaccine Field"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Covid 19 pandemia since the first reported case in 2019 had a direct socioeconomic impact related to morbi-mortality and indirect in response to protection and isolation strategies.

Furthermore, they are habitually exposed to large fluctuations in blood flow during physical and sedentary activities. Low-flow-mediated constriction (L-FMC) and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) provide indices of endothelial-dependent vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively. Age and sex both impact upper-limb FMD. However, it is unclear whether these factors also influence popliteal endothelial-dependent function. Popliteal endothelial function was compared between younger and older males and females (n=14 per group) matched for age- and sex-specific relative aerobic fitness levels (each group's normative percentile: ~45%). Nitroglycerin-mediated dilation (NMD) was also assessed as a measure of endothelial-independent vasodilation. Ageing reduced relative popliteal FMD in both males (older: 4.31.8% versus younger 5.71.9%) and females (older: 2.91.8% versus younger: 6.11.6%, both: P<0.046). FMD was also lower in older females versus older males (P=0.04). Popliteal NMD findings followed the same pattern as FMD. Compared to younger adults, relative L-FMC responses were blunted among older males (older: -1.21.1% versus younger: -2.21.0%) and females (older: -1.01.2% versus younger: -2.11.3%, both P<0.03) with no sex-differences observed in either age group (all, P>0.60). The adverse age- and sex-related (older adults only) declines in popliteal FMD were mediated, in part, by reduced vascular smooth muscle sensitivity to nitric oxide. Endothelial-dependent vasoconstriction was also attenuated with age, but unaffected by sex. Despite similar normative aerobic fitness percentiles (~45%), older adults exhibited attenuated popliteal endothelial function than their younger counterparts. This was particularly evident in older females who exhibited the lowest endothelial-dependent vasodilatory responses.","output":"The impact of age and sex on popliteal artery endothelial-dependent vasodilator and vasoconstrictor function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a naturally-occurring neurodegenerative disease of cervids.

COVID-19 affects predominantly the respiratory system, in addition to other organ systems, mainly the cardiovascular system. One of the hypotheses is that virus entering the target cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 affecting hypothalamic pituitary axis could lead to dysautonomia which is measured by heart rate variability (HRV). HRV is a non-invasive measure of autonomic function that facilitates identification of COVID-19 patients at the risk of developing cardiovascular complications. So, we aimed to assess HRV in COVID patients and compare between COVID patients and normal controls. METHODS In a case control design, we compared 63 COVID-19 infected patients with 43 healthy controls matched for age and gender. Along with clinical characterization, heart rate variability was evaluated using ambulatory 5 min ECG in lead II and expressed in frequency and time domain measures. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0. RESULTS Mean age of the study population was 49.1  14.2 years and 71 (66.9%) were males. Frequency domain measures high (HF) and low (LF) frequency powers were significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. HF/LF and LF/HF ratios were not different between groups. Time domain measures rMSSD (root mean square of successive RR interval differences) and SDNN (standard deviation of NN intervals) were significantly increased among COVID-19 subjects. COVID-19 infection was associated with increased parasympathetic activity as defined by rMSSD>40 {adjusted odds ratio 7.609 (95% CI 1.61-35.94); p=0.01} and SDNN>60 {adjusted odds ratio 2.620 (95% CI 1.070-6.44); p=0.035} after adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities.

The effects of obesity on clinical outcomes of COVID-19 warrant systematical investigation. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the effects of obesity with the risk of severe disease among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Body mass index (BMI) and degree of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) accumulation were used as indicators for obesity status. Publication databases including preprints were searched up to August 10, 2020. Clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19 included hospitalization, a requirement for treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. Risks for severe COVID-19 outcomes are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for cohort studies with BMI-defined obesity, and standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95%CI for controlled studies with VAT-defined excessive adiposity. RESULTS: A total of 45, 650 participants from 30 studies with BMI-defined obesity and 3 controlled studies with VAT-defined adiposity were included for assessing the risk of severe COVID-19. Univariate analyses showed significantly higher ORs of severe COVID-19 with higher BMI: 1.76 (95%: 1.21, 2.56, Pa?=a?0.003) for hospitalization, 1.67 (95%CI: 1.26, 2.21, P<0.001) for ICU admission, 2.19 (95%CI: 1.56, 3.07, P<0.001) for IMV requirement, and 1.37 (95%CI: 1.06, 1.75, Pa?=a?0.014) for death, giving an overall OR for severe COVID-19 of 1.67 (95%CI: 1.43, 1.96; P<0.001). Multivariate analyses revealed increased ORs of severe COVID-19 associated with higher BMI: 2.36 (95%CI: 1.37, 4.07, Pa?=a?0.002) for hospitalization, 2.32 (95%CI: 1.38, 3.90, Pa?=a?0.001) for requiring ICU admission, 2.63 (95%CI: 1.32, 5.25, Pa?=a?0.006) for IMV support, and 1.49 (95%CI: 1.20, 1.85, P<0.001) for mortality, giving an overall OR for severe COVID-19 of 2.09 (95%CI: 1.67, 2.62; P<0.001). Compared to non-severe COVID-19 patients, severe COVID-19 cases showed significantly higher VAT accumulation with a SMD of 0.49 for hospitalization (95% CI: 0.11, 0.87; Pa?=a?0.011), 0.57 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.81; P<0.001) for requiring ICU admission and 0.37 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.71; Pa?=a?0.035) for IMV support.

The drug-like properties of compounds were evaluated first and then molecular docking using DS v20.1.0.19295 software showed that the compounds behaved as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) while interacting at the allosteric site of target HIV-RT protein (PDB:3MEC). The docking results revealed that all compounds formed hydrogen bonds with Lys101, Lys103, Val179, Tyr188, Gln190, Gly190, Pro225, Phe227, and Tyr318, and showed -interaction with Tyr188 and Tyr318. TOPKAT (Toxicity Prediction by Komputer Assisted Technology) results confirmed that the compounds were found to be less toxic than the reference drugs. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis was performed to assess the binding affinity of all compounds. Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on compound 6 and delavirdine with HIV-RT enzyme. Comprehensive MD analyses showed a similar pattern of conformational stability and flexibility in both the complexes suggesting alike inhibitory action. The hydrogen-bonding interactions and the binding energy of active-site residues for the compound 6 complex revealed strong inhibitory activity than the reference (delavirdine) complex. Thus, the compound 6 might act as a potential inhibitor against HIV-RT. Overall, this study revealed that compound 6 (5-hydroxy-N-(4-methyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-8-yl) thiophene-2-sulfonamide) has prudent anti-HIV activity against both HIV-1 (SI = 2.65) and HIV-2 (SI = 2.32) that can further be utilised in drug discovery against HIV virus.","output":"In silico design, synthesis and anti-HIV activity of quinoline derivatives as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective government policies may reduce uncertainty in sovereign bond markets Can policy responses help to curb bond market volatility during the COVID-19 pandemic?

However, early indicators of disease progression remain unclear. This study aimed to identify early indicators of disease progression to provide a basis for improved prognostic prediction and disease management. Methods: We examined 53 recovered adult COVID-19 patients who were treated at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center between January 20, 2020, and February 20, 2020. The patients were categorized into the following four groups according to their condition at admission: mild condition (n = 3), moderate (n = 41), severe (n = 7), and critical (n = 2). They were also categorized according to disease progression as mild or moderate conditions that remained stable (n = 26), moderate disease that progressed to severe condition (n = 18), and continuously severe or critical (n = 9). We then focused on investigating the differences in the epidemiological and laboratory indicators between remained stable cases and progressed to severe condition cases. Results: Mild or moderate patients were younger than severe or critical patients. The number of patients with shortness of breath and underlying diabetes and heart disease at admission was higher in the severe or critical group. This group also showed considerably lower or higher values in 28 laboratory indicators. In addition, mild and moderate patients who remained stable were younger than moderate patients progressing to severe disease. Men had a higher risk of disease progression. Patients who progressed had either higher or lower values in 11 laboratory indicators. Survival curve analysis showed that age, procalcitonin, D-dimer, serum C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, lymphocytes, neutrophils, CD4%, and CD4/CD8 ratio were significant predictors of progression to severe disease. Conclusions: Lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, etc. are early warning indicators of severe COVID-19. Age (>64 years), shortness of breath, past histories of diabetes and heart disease, and abnormality in 28 other indicators at admission are indicative of severe or progression toward severe COVID-19. Meanwhile, abnormalities in 11 indicators and an abnormal coagulation function index at admission are risk factors for progression to severe disease.","output":"Early Warning Indicators of Severe COVID-19: A Single-Center Study of Cases From Shanghai, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Under conditions of the rapidly developing e-commerce sector especially during pandemic, ensuring high quality of courier service is essential both for clients, as well as courier companies.

(CeG!) - when supporting the process of transition to parenthood and early infancy, at multiple PC units. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A cluster-randomised trial will be conducted in 12 PC units (clusters) from the Lisbon metropolitan area, Portugal. Participants will be a minimum of three family physicians and one nurse/unit, as well as 216 expecting parents and future babies until 18 months who are using the PC services. Sites will be randomised to either the CeG! or usual care. The CeG! will consist of: (1) the integration of the Touchpoints approach in PC maternal and well-child visits, with the support of 28 leaflets for parents to file in a folder; plus (2) training for PC providers on how to perform the CeG! into existing practice. Parents will be required to fill in questionnaires at point throughout their childs 18-month, mostly online. The primary outcome will be the self-perception of parental competence (Parenting Sense of Competence Scale). Other outcomes include: family functioning, couple dynamics, mental health, well-being/quality of life, psychological experience of pregnancy, attachment, child development. Acceptability, satisfaction and feasibility of CeG! will also be obtained from providers and parents perspectives. Costs associated with delivering the CeG! will be calculated.

The B.1.351 variant carrying the escape mutation E484K in the receptor binding domain is of particular concern due to reduced immunological protection following vaccination. Protection can manifest as early as 10 days following immunization with full protection two weeks following the second dose, but the course is not well-characterized for variants. Here, we investigated the immune transcriptome of six elderly individuals (average age 82 yr.) from an old peoplea?s home, who contracted B.1.351, with four having received the first dose of BNT162b eight to 11 days prior to the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The patients were hospitalized and received dexamethasone treatment. Immune transcriptomes were established from PBMCs approximately 10 and 35 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptomology. RNA-seq revealed a more intensive immune response in vaccinated patients as compared to unvaccinated ones. Specifically, transcription factors linked to the JAK/STAT pathway, interferon stimulated genes, and genes associated with innate antiviral immunity and COVID-19-SARS-CoV-2 infection were highly enriched in vaccinated patients. This rendered the transcriptomes of the older vaccinated group significantly different than older unvaccinated individuals infected at the same institution and more similar to the immune response of younger unvaccinated individuals (ages 48-62) following B.1.351 infection. All individuals in this study whether vaccinated or not were hospitalized due to B.1.351 infection and one vaccinated patient died illustrating that although an enhanced immune response was documented infection it was insufficient to protect from disease.

Further, doing so will provide a baseline for investigation of the long-term effects of these public health measures upon behaviours and perceptions, and facilitate future follow-up study. OBJECTIVES: To determine how the onset of coronavirus (COVID-19), and associated lockdown, affected RT behaviours, in addition to motivation, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and intent to continue, in those who regularly performed RT prior to the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study using online surveys in multiple languages (English, Danish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Slovakian, Swedish, and Japanese) distributed across social media platforms and through authors professional and personal networks. Adults (n = 5389; median age = 31 years [interquartile range (IQR) = 25, 38]), previously engaged in RT prior to lockdown (median prior RT experience = 7 years [IQR = 4, 12]) participated. Outcomes were self-reported RT behaviours including: continuation of RT during lockdown, location of RT, purchase of specific equipment for RT, method of training, full-body or split routine, types of training, repetition ranges, exercise number, set volumes (per exercise and muscle group), weekly frequency of training, perception of effort, whether training was planned/recorded, time of day, and training goals. Secondary outcomes included motivation, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and intent to continue RT. RESULTS: A majority of individuals (82.8%) maintained participation in RT during-lockdown. Marginal probabilities from generalised linear models and generalised estimating equations for RT behaviours were largely similar from pre- to during-lockdown. There was reduced probability of training in privately owned gyms (~ 59% to ~ 7%) and increased probability of training at home (~ 18% to ~ 89%); greater probability of training using a full-body routine (~ 38% to ~ 51%); reduced probability of resistance machines (~ 66% to ~ 13%) and free weight use (~ 96% to ~ 81%), and increased probability of bodyweight training (~ 62% to ~ 82%); reduced probability of moderate repetition ranges (~ 62C82% to ~ 55C66%) and greater probability of higher repetition ranges (~ 27% to ~ 49%); and moderate reduction in the perception of effort experienced during-training (r = 0.31). Further, individuals were slightly less likely to plan or record training during lockdown and many changed their training goals. Additionally, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and likelihood of continuing current training were all lower during-lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Those engaged in RT prior to lockdown these behaviours with only slight adaptations in both location and types of training performed. However, people employed less effort, had lower motivation, and perceived training as less effective and enjoyable, reporting their likelihood of continuing current training was similar or lower than pre-lockdown. These results have implications for strategies to maintain engagement in positive health behaviours such as RT during-restrictive pandemic-related public health measures.

In order to better understand the digital healthcare, this work conducted a systematic and comprehensive review of digital healthcare, with the purpose of helping us combat the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper covers the background information and research overview of digital healthcare, summarizes its applications and challenges in the COVID-19 pandemic, and finally puts forward the prospects of digital healthcare. First, main concepts, key development processes, and common application scenarios of integrating digital technologies and digital healthcare were offered in the part of background information. Second, the bibliometric techniques were used to analyze the research output, geographic distribution, discipline distribution, collaboration network, and hot topics of digital healthcare before and after COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly accelerated research on the integration of digital technologies and healthcare. Third, application cases of China, EU and U.S using digital technologies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic were collected and analyzed. Among these digital technologies, big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, 5G are most effective weapons to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Applications cases show that these technologies play an irreplaceable role in controlling the spread of the COVID-19. By comparing the application cases in these three regions, we contend that the key to China's success in avoiding the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic is to integrate digital technologies and public health on a large scale without hesitation. Fourth, the application challenges of digital technologies in the public health field are summarized. These challenges mainly come from four aspects: data delays, data fragmentation, privacy security, and data security vulnerabilities. Finally, this study provides the future application prospects of digital healthcare. In addition, we also provide policy recommendations for other countries that use digital technology to combat COVID-19.","output":"Integrating Digital Technologies and Public Health to Fight Covid-19 Pandemic: Key Technologies, Applications, Challenges and Outlook of Digital Healthcare"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused millions of infections and deaths worldwide, forced schools to suspend classes, workers to work from home, many to lose their livelihoods, and countless businesses to close. Throughout this crisis, families have had to protect, comfort and care for their children, their elderly and other members. While the pandemic has greatly intensified family care responsibilities for families, unpaid care work has been a primary activity of families even in normal times. This paper estimates the future global need for caregiving, and the burden of that need that typically falls on families, especially women. It takes into account projected demographic shifts, health transitions, and economic changes in order to obtain an aggregate picture of the care need relative to the potential supply of caregiving in low-, middle- and high-income countries. This extensive margin of the future care burden, however, does not capture the weight of that burden unless the quantity and quality of care time per caregiver are taken into account. Adjusting for care time given per caregiver, the paper incorporates data from time-use surveys, illustrating this intensive margin of the care burden in three countries that have very different family and economic contextsGhana, Mongolia, and South Korea. Time-use surveys typically do not provide time data for paid care services, so the estimates depend only on the time intensity of family care. With this caveat, the paper estimates that the care need in 2030 would require the equivalent of one-fifth to two-fifths of the paid labor force, assuming 40 weekly workhours. Using the projected 2030 mean wage for care and social service workers to estimate the hypothetical wage bill for these unpaid caregivers if they were paid, we obtain a value equivalent to 16 to 32 percent of GDP in the three countries.","output":"Demographic, health, and economic transitions and the future care burden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM This study examined trends in absolute and relative socioeconomic, gender and geographical inequalities in the coverage of polio immunisation in Guinea, West Africa, from 1999-2016.

Several models are under study to control the disease spread and infection rate and to detect possible factors that might favour them, with a focus on understanding the correlation between the disease and specific geophysical parameters. However, the pandemic does not present evident environmental hindrances in the infected countries. Nevertheless, a lower rate of infections has been observed in some countries, which might be related to particular population and climatic conditions. In this paper, infection rate of COVID-19 is modelled globally at a 0.5 resolution, using a Maximum Entropy-based Ecological Niche Model that identifies geographical areas potentially subject to a high infection rate. The model identifies locations that could favour infection rate due to their particular geophysical (surface air temperature, precipitation, and elevation) and human-related characteristics (CO 2and population density). It was trained by facilitating data from Italian provinces that have reported a high infection rate and subsequently tested using datasets from World countries reports. Based on this model, a risk index was calculated to identify the potential World countries and regions that have a high risk of disease increment. The distribution outputs foresee a high infection rate in many locations where real-world disease outbreaks have occurred, e.g. the Hubei province in China, and reports a high risk of disease increment in most World countries which have reported significant outbreaks (e.g. Western U.S.A.). Overall, the results suggest that a complex combination of the selected parameters might be of integral importance to understand the propagation of COVID-19 among human populations, particularly in Europe. The model and the data were distributed through Open-science Web services to maximise opportunities for re-usability regarding new data and new diseases, and also to enhance the transparency of the approach and results.","output":"A global-scale ecological niche model to predict SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intoxication from calcium channel blockers exhibits almost 50% mortality rates.

Although the etiology remains unknown, infectious agents could play a key role. The aim of this analysis was to examine the role of human astrovirus (HAstV) in infants with NEC. PATIENTS AND METHODS All patients admitted during a 5-year period at a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit with NEC (Bell stage I-III) who had examination of stool specimens for bacterial and for viral infections were included. Clinical data were reviewed and compared between infants with NEC and astrovirus detection (NEC + HAstV) and infants with NEC without astrovirus detection (NEC - HAstV) in stool specimens. RESULTS Forty infants with NEC were identified between 2002 and 2006 and 8 patients were excluded from statistical evaluation because of incomplete viral examinations. HAstV was detected in stool specimens of 6 (19%) of the remaining 32 patients with NEC. Double infection with rotavirus was identified in 1 patient. No other viruses were detected. Significant differences in patients with NEC - HAstV and NEC + HAstV were only shown for age at onset of illness (P < 0.001) but not for severity of illness, need for surgical intervention, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that HAstV may be associated with the development of NEC in a subgroup of patients and provides further evidence for the important role of gastrointestinal viral infections in this most common gastrointestinal emergency in premature infants.

Several classification and reporting schemes were developed for chest imaging early during the pandemic for patients with suspected COVID-19 to aid in triage when the availability of RT-PCR testing was limited and its performance unclear. Interobserver agreement for categories with findings typical of COVID-19 and those suggesting an alternative diagnosis is high across multiple studies. Furthermore, some studies looking at the extent of lung involvement on chest radiography and CT showed correlations with critical illness and need for mechanical ventilation.

This balance is crucial in core functional organs, such as the central nervous system (CNS), where minor changes in neuronal microenvironments and the production of immune factors can result in significant disease with fatal consequences or permanent neurological sequelae. Viral encephalitis and multiple sclerosis are examples of important human diseases in which the pathogenic contribution of monocytes recruited from the bone marrow plays a critical role in the clinical expression of disease, as they differentiate into macrophage or dendritic cells in the CNS to carry out effector functions. While antigen-specific lymphocyte populations are central to the adaptive immune response in both cases, in viral encephalitis a prominent macrophage infiltration may mediate immunopathological damage, seizure induction, and death. However, the autoimmune response to non-replicating, non-infectious, but abundant, self antigen has a different disease progression, associated with differentiation of significant numbers of infiltrating monocytes into dendritic cells in the CNS. Whilst a predominant presence of macrophages or dendritic cells in the inflamed CNS in viral encephalitis or multiple sclerosis is well described, the way in which the inflamed CNS mobilizes monocytes in the bone marrow to migrate to the CNS and the key drivers that lead to these specific differentiation pathways in vivo are not well understood. Here we review the current understanding of factors facilitating inflammatory monocyte generation, migration and entry into the brain, as well as their differentiation towards macrophages or dendritic cells in viral and autoimmune disease in relation to their respective disease outcomes.","output":"The plasticity of inflammatory monocyte responses to the inflamed central nervous system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Though COVID-19 is primarily characterized by symptoms in the periphery, it can also affect the central nervous system (CNS).

Both experiences of care and satisfaction are important to measure so that quality can be monitored and improved. Globally, women experience mistreatment during childbirth at facilities; however, there is limited evidence exploring the mistreatment and women's satisfaction with care during childbirth. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey within the WHO study 'How women are treated during facility-based childbirth' exploring the mistreatment of women during childbirth in Ghana, Guinea, Myanmar and Nigeria. Women's experiences of mistreatment and satisfaction with care during childbirth was explored. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was conducted to evaluate the association between mistreatment, women's overall satisfaction with the care they received, and whether they would recommend the facility to others. RESULTS: 2672 women were included in this analysis. Despite over one-third of women reporting experience of mistreatment (35.4%), overall satisfaction for services received and recommendation of the facility to others was high, 88.4% and 90%, respectively. Women who reported experiences of mistreatment were more likely to report lower satisfaction with care: women were more likely to be satisfied if they did not experience verbal abuse (adjusted OR (AOR) 4.52, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.85), or had short waiting times (AOR 5.12, 95% CI 3.94 to 6.65). Women who did not experience any physical or verbal abuse or discrimination were more likely to recommend the facility to others (AOR 3.89, 95% CI 2.98 to 5.06). CONCLUSION: Measuring both women's experiences and their satisfaction with care are critical to assess quality and provide actionable evidence for quality improvement.

It proceeds through refinements and revisions. To support assurance that the system satisfies its requirements, it is desirable that continuous verification can be performed after each refinement or revision step. To achieve practical adoption, formal verification must accommodate continuous verification efficiently and effectively. Model checking provides developers with information useful to improve their models only when a property is not satisfied, i.e., when a counterexample is returned. However, it is desirable to have some useful information also when a property is instead satisfied. To address this problem we propose TOrPEDO, an approach that supports verification in two complementary forms: model checking and proofs. While model checking is typically used to pinpoint model behaviors that violate requirements, proofs can instead explain why requirements are satisfied. In our work, we introduce a specific notion of proof, called Topological Proof. A topological proof produces a slice of the original model that justifies the property satisfaction. Because models can be incomplete, TOrPEDO supports reasoning on requirements satisfaction, violation, and possible satisfaction (in the case where satisfaction depends on unknown parts of the model). Evaluation is performed by checking how topological proofs support software development on 12 modeling scenarios and 15 different properties obtained from 3 examples from literature. Results show that: (i) topological proofs are [Formula: see text]60% smaller than the original models; (ii) after a revision, in [Formula: see text]78% of cases, the property can be re-verified by relying on a simple syntactic check.","output":"Integrating Topological Proofs with Model Checking to Instrument Iterative Design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review uses a more holistic approach to provide comprehensive information and up-to-date knowledge on solar energy development in India and scientific and technological advancement.

In addition, we evaluated the prospects of solar energy and the revival of growth in solar energy installation post-COVID-19. Further, we described the challenges caused by transitions and cloud enhancement on smaller and larger PV systems on the solar power amended grid-system. While the review is focused on evaluating the solar energy growth in India, we used a broader approach to compare the existing solar technologies available across the world. The need for recycling waste from solar energy systems has been emphasized. Improved PV cell efficiencies and trends in cost reductions have been provided to understand the overall growth of solar-based energy production. Further, to understand the existing technologies used in PV cell production, we have reviewed monocrystalline and polycrystalline cell structures and their limitations. In terms of solar energy production and the application of various solar technologies, we have used the latest available literature to cover stand-alone PV and on-grid PV systems. More than 5000 trillion kWh/year solar energy incidents over India are estimated, with most parts receiving 4C7 kWh/m2. Currently, energy consumption in India is about 1.13 trillion kWh/year, and production is about 1.38 trillion kWh/year, which indicates production capacities are slightly higher than actual demand. Out of a total of 100 GW of installed renewable energy capacity, the existing solar capacity in India is about 40 GW.

The pandemic has caused reduced volumes of emergency department (ED) patients, except for those with COVID-19 infections, and this may reduce the case exposure of EM residents. The primary objective of this study was to compare the clinical exposure of EM residents between the prepandemic and pandemic periods. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of EM resident physicians' training in a tertiary teaching hospital with two branch regional hospitals in Taiwan. We retrieved data regarding patients seen by EM residents in the ED between September 1, 2019, and April 30, 2020. The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Taiwan was reported on January 11, so the pandemic period in our study was defined as spanning from February 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. The number and characteristics of patients seen by residents were recorded. We compared the data between the prepandemic and pandemic periods. RESULTS: The mean number of patients per hour (PPH) seen by EM residents in the adult ED decreased in all three hospitals during the pandemic. The average PPH of critical area of medical ED was 1.68 in the pre-epidemic period and decreased to 1.33 in the epidemic period (p value < 0.001). The average number of patients managed by residents decreased from 1.24 to 0.82 in the trauma ED (p value = 0.01) and 1.56 to 0.51 in the pediatric ED (p value = 0.003) during the pandemic, respectively. The severity of patient illness did not change significantly between the periods. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic engendered a reduced ED volume and decreased EM residents' clinical exposure. All portion of EM residency training were affected by the pandemic, with pediatric EM being the most affected. The patient volume reduction may persist and in turn reduce patients' case exposure until the pandemic subsides.

Managed entry agreements (MEAs) are tools that are used to improve access to expensive technologies that would otherwise not be deemed to be cost-effective to payers. While simple discount on the list price is the most commonly applied MEA type, there are different forms, each having a different impact on the cost-effectiveness of the technology, on the lifetime DCF-per-patient and on the decision uncertainty. We aim to analyze the sequential decision-making (SDM) of different MEAs (i.e. simple discount, free treatment initiation, lifetime treatment acquisition cost-capping [LTTACC], performance-based money-back guarantee [MBG]) at the manufacturer and at the payer level, respectively. METHODS: We first model the SDM of the manufacturer and the payer as a sequential game and explain the challenges to find an equilibrium analytically. Then we propose a heuristic computational method to follow for each of the MEA types, based on practice. To demonstrate this SDM on a case study, a UK-based cost-utility analysis using a three-state, partitioned-survival-model was constructed to determine the cost-effectiveness of regorafenib versus best-supportive-care for the second-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. The optimal agreement terms that would maximise the lifetime DCF-per-patient for each MEA, whilst remaining below the CE-threshold (50,000/QALY gained) were obtained in the deterministic base-case. Robustness for each optimized MEA was then assessed using probabilistic sensitivity and scenario analyses, the value of information (VoI), and HTA-risk analyses. RESULTS: As expected, the introduction of all MEAs improved the probabilistic ICER and NMB values to (almost) acceptable levels, compared to the \\"no-MEA\\" case (ICER ~ 78,000/QALY-gained). The expected DCFs across the explored MEAs were all similar, whilst the payer strategy & uncertainty burden (PSUB) for regorafenib decreased in all MEAs explored. VoI analyses revealed that regorafenib mean-dose-intensity and time-on-treatment (ToT) parameters attributed most to the decision uncertainty. LTTACC provided the smallest PSUB and the most robust NMB estimates under parametric uncertainty. For scenarios assuming increased regorafenib ToT or mean-dose-intensity, LTACC again provided acceptable cost-effectiveness outcomes, whereas for scenarios assuming decreased regorafenib progression-free/overall survival effectiveness, only MBG resulted in plausible ICER values. In scenarios, where the source of uncertainty was not targeted by MEA parameters (e.g. the scenario assuming higher progressed disease resource utilization), all investigated MEA types resulted in unacceptable cost-effectiveness outcomes. CONCLUSION: Each MEA type has a different implication. The impact of different MEAs on the NMB is more noteworthy than on the DCF, in relative terms, hence payers will benefit from the early participation of the MEA design rather than leaving this up to the prerogative of the manufacturer. While simple discount might be practical for implementation purposes, other MEAs can provide additional benefits to the payer in terms of increased NMB, reduced decision risk and reduced uncertainty. MEA performance should be investigated not only under parametric uncertainty, but also under-identified structural uncertainty, and the barriers of implementation should be considered thoroughly before choosing the most appropriate MEA type.","output":"A MEA is a MEA is a MEA?

In COVID-19, additional pathologies, such as endotheliitis, may further increase the risk of bleeding complications. To assess the frequency of bleeding events, we analyzed data from the German COVID-19 autopsy registry (DeRegCOVID). METHODS: The electronic registry uses a web-based electronic case report form. In November 2021, the registry included N = 1129 confirmed COVID-19 autopsy cases, with data on 63 ECMO autopsy cases and 1066 non-ECMO autopsy cases, contributed from 29 German sites. FINDINGS: The registry data showed that ECMO was used in younger male patients and bleeding events occurred much more frequently in ECMO cases compared to non-ECMO cases (56% and 9%, respectively). Similarly, intracranial bleeding (ICB) was documented in 21% of ECMO cases and 3% of non-ECMO cases and was classified as the immediate or underlying cause of death in 78% of ECMO cases and 37% of non-ECMO cases.

COVID-19 has been associated with a number of cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias. The aim of the current study was to evaluate P-wave dispersion (PWD) as a predictor of atrial fibrillation in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. In addition, the relationship between the PWD and inflammation parameters was investigated. METHODS: A total of 140 newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients and 140 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were included in the study. The risk of atrial fibrillation was evaluated by calculating the electrocardiographic PWD. C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell, neutrophil and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were measured in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19. RESULTS: PWD, white blood cell, NLR and CRP levels were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than the control group. There was a significant positive correlation between PWD and CRP level (rsa=a0.510, Pa<a0.001) and NLR in COVID-19 group (rsa=a0.302, Pa=a0.001). In their follow-up, 13 (9.3%) patients, 11 of whom were in the ICU, developed new atrial fibrillation. CONCLUSION: Our study showed for the first time in literature that the PWD, evaluated electrocardiographically in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19, was prolonged compared with normal healthy individuals. A positive correlation was found between PWD, CRP level and NLR. We believe that pretreatment evaluation of PWD in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19 would be beneficial for predicting atrial fibrillation risk.","output":"Evaluation of P-wave dispersion in patients with newly diagnosed coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the impact of a strategy for international collaboration and rapid information dissemination on Twitter among the pediatric critical care community during a global pandemic. DESIGN: Analysis of #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 Twitter data in the Symplur Signals Database between February 1, 2020, and May 1, 2020. SETTING: Social media platform Twitter. PATIENTS: None. INTERVENTIONS: Promotion of the joint usage of #PedsICU and #COVID19 throughout the international pediatric critical care community in tweets relevant to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and pediatric critical care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We collected data on all tweets containing the hashtag #PedsICU in addition to those containing both #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags. Tweets including #PedsICU were shared 49,865 times on six continents between February 1, 2020, and May 1, 2020; between February 1 and March 13, only 8% of #PedsICU tweets included a coronavirus disease 2019 hashtag. After a sharp rise during the week of March 14, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 content has dominated the #PedsICU conversation on Twitter, comprising 69% of both #PedsICU tweets and impressions (p < 0.001). The most commonly used coronavirus disease 2019 hashtag over the study period was #COVID19 (69%). Proportionately, a greater percentage of #PedsICU tweets including the coronavirus disease 2019 hashtag (vs not) had images or videos (45% vs 41%; p < 0.001). In addition, non-physician healthcare providers were the largest group of users (46%) of the combination of #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags. The most popular tweets shared on Twitter were open-access resources, including links for updated literature, narrative reviews, and educational videos relevant to coronavirus disease 2019 clinical care. Concurrent hashtags and words in tweets containing #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags spanned several different disciplines and topics in pediatric critical care. CONCLUSION: Twitter has been used widely for real-time information sharing and collaboration among the international pediatric critical care community during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Targeted use of #PedsICU and #COVID19 for engagement on Twitter is a conduit to combat misinformation and optimize reach to pediatric critical care stakeholders across the globe when rapid dissemination is needed.","output":"Using Social Media for Rapid Information Dissemination in a Pandemic: #PedsICU and Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Mineworkers in South Africa experience a triple burden of disease due to their distinct work experience. Silicosis increases their risk of tuberculosis (TB), exacerbated by the HIV epidemic. Work-related factors are likely to increase transmission, severity, and post infection sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Understanding these relationships is important to control the impact of the epidemic. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among mineworkers exceed the population rates in the provinces in which those mines are located. Migrant work, living in crowded hostels, working in narrow poorly ventilated shafts mainly underground constitute important factors that increase transmission risk. Mineworkers continue to experience high levels of silica exposure. The prevalences of silicosis, HIV and pulmonary TB, remain high. Interstitial lung disease, pulmonary TB, and HIV have all been associated with poorer outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Mineworkers with post infection respiratory sequelae are likely to lose their jobs or lose income, due to the physically demanding nature of underground minework. SUMMARY: Further research into the unique work-related risk factors in mining that influence the COVID-19 epidemic is crucial for optimizing current interventions. Reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission, health monitoring of infected and vulnerable workers, and following up of postinfection outcomes is essential to protect the respiratory health of miners.","output":"COVID-19: a new burden of respiratory disease among South African miners?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The partial shutdown of the economy following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the lack of measurements of economic activity that are available with a short lag and at high frequency.

Patients were aged 55 years, had type 1 or 2 diabetes with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography evidence of ESASO classification Early DMO. Group 1 eyes (78 eyes, 78 patients) underwent phacoemulsification-based cataract surgery. Group 2 eyes (65 eyes, 65 patients) had E-DMO and either clear media or had undergone uncomplicated cataract surgery 1 year previously. Central subfield thickness (CST) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were assessed in both groups. RESULTS: The negative impact of surgery on CST was evident after the first postoperative week; CST peaked during the first month, then rapidly decreased. CST worsening 10 m was observed in 63/78 eyes (80.7%) and 29/65 eyes (44.6%) in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p < 0.0001). CST worsening of 50 m was observed in 51 eyes (65.4%) and 10 eyes (15.4%) in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p < 0.0001). Mean CST worsening was lower in Group 2 than in Group 1 (38.6  30.4 m vs 85.5  55.3 m, p < 0.0001) with a lower BCVA loss (?2.6  3.5 letters vs ?8.2  6.2 letters, p < 0.0001).

Availability of testing is a bottleneck due to constrained resources and effective prioritization of individuals is necessary. Here, we discuss the impact of different prioritization policies on COVID-19 patient discovery and the ability of governments and health organizations to use the results for effective decision making. We suggest a framework for testing that balances the maximal discovery of positive individuals with the need for population-based surveillance aimed at understanding disease spread and characteristics. This framework draws from similar approaches to prioritization in the domain of cyber-security based on ranking individuals using a risk score and then reserving a portion of the capacity for random sampling. This approach is an application of Multi-Armed-Bandits maximizing exploration/exploitation of the underlying distribution. We find that individuals can be ranked for effective testing using a few simple features, and that ranking them using such models we can capture 65% (CI: 64.7%-68.3%) of the positive individuals using less than 20% of the testing capacity or 92.1% (CI: 91.1%-93.2%) of positives individuals using 70% of the capacity, allowing reserving a significant portion of the tests for population studies.

The convolutional neural network (CNN) was utilized most widely in extracting representative features of bearing faults. Fundamental to this, the hybrid models based on the CNN and individual classifiers were proposed to diagnose bearing faults. However, CNN may not be suitable for all bearing fault classifiers. It is crucial to identify the classifiers which can maximize the CNN feature extraction ability.

Meanwhile, recent studies provide compelling evidence on how contact distancing, the use of face masks, and handwashing habits can reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In this context, we investigated the effect that these personal protection habits can have in preventing new waves of contagion. Methods: We extended an agent-based COVID-19 epidemic model in a simulated community to incorporate the mechanisms of these aforementioned personal care habits and measure their incidence in person-to-person transmission. A full factorial experiment design was performed to illustrate the extent to which the interplay between these personal habits is effective in mitigating the spread of disease. A global sensitivity analysis was performed on the parameters that control these habits to further validate the results. Results: We found that observing physical distance is the dominant habit in reducing disease transmission, although adopting either or both of the other two habits is necessary to some extent to suppress a new outbreak entirely. When physical distance is not observed, adherence to the use of masks or handwashing has a significant decrease in infections and mortality, but the epidemic still unfolds. We also found that in all scenarios, the combined effect of adhering to the three habits is more powerful than adopting them separately. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a broad adherence of the population to voluntary self-care habits would help contain unfold of new outbreaks. The purpose of our model is illustrative and contributes to ratify the importance of urging citizens to adopt the amalgam of personal care habits as a primary collective protection measure to prevent communities from returning to confinements, while immunisation is carried out in late stages of the pandemic.","output":"Impact of Personal Protection Habits on the Spread of Pandemics: Insights from an Agent-Based Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Patients with cancer are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease, but have heterogeneous presentations and outcomes. Decision-making tools for hospital admission, severity prediction, and increased monitoring for early intervention are critical. We sought to identify features of COVID-19 disease in patients with cancer predicting severe disease and build a decision support online tool, COVID-19 Risk in Oncology Evaluation Tool (CORONET). METHODS Patients with active cancer (stage I-IV) and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease presenting to hospitals worldwide were included. Discharge (within 24 hours), admission ( 24 hours inpatient), oxygen (O2) requirement, and death were combined in a 0-3 point severity scale. Association of features with outcomes were investigated using Lasso regression and Random Forest combined with Shapley Additive Explanations. The CORONET model was then examined in the entire cohort to build an online CORONET decision support tool. Admission and severe disease thresholds were established through pragmatically defined cost functions. Finally, the CORONET model was validated on an external cohort. RESULTS The model development data set comprised 920 patients, with median age 70 (range 5-99) years, 56% males, 44% females, and 81% solid versus 19% hematologic cancers. In derivation, Random Forest demonstrated superior performance over Lasso with lower mean squared error (0.801 v 0.807) and was selected for development. During validation (n = 282 patients), the performance of CORONET varied depending on the country cohort. CORONET cutoffs for admission and mortality of 1.0 and 2.3 were established. The CORONET decision support tool recommended admission for 95% of patients eventually requiring oxygen and 97% of those who died (94% and 98% in validation, respectively). The specificity for mortality prediction was 92% and 83% in derivation and validation, respectively. Shapley Additive Explanations revealed that National Early Warning Score 2, C-reactive protein, and albumin were the most important features contributing to COVID-19 severity prediction in patients with cancer at time of hospital presentation. CONCLUSION CORONET, a decision support tool validated in health care systems worldwide, can aid admission decisions and predict COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer.","output":"Establishment of CORONET, COVID-19 Risk in Oncology Evaluation Tool, to Identify Patients With Cancer at Low Versus High Risk of Severe Complications of COVID-19 Disease On Presentation to Hospital."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective: based on the analysis of published data and results of own research, to present scientifically valid procedures for respiratory support in acute respiratory distress syndrome of various origins.

Drug repurposing is an emerging and practical approach where existing drugs, safe for humans, are redeployed to fight this harder to treat disease. A number of multi clinical studies have repurposed combined cocktail (remdesivir + chloroquine and favipiravir + chloroquine) to be effective against COVID-19.

METHODS AND RESULTS 94 halotolerant strains of Bacillus isolated from soil and salt-lake sediment samples in Algeria were examined for the presence of QQ activity against AHLs, the presence of the aiiA gene, encoding an AHL lactonase enzyme typical of Bacillus spp., antimicrobial, and anti-biofilm activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus mutans. Of all strains of Bacillus spp. isolated, 48.9% showed antibacterial activity. In addition, 40% of these isolates showed a positive QQ activity against long-chain AHLs, of which seven strains presented the aiiA gene. Among the species with broad-spectrum QQ activity, the cell extract of Bacillus thuringiensis DZ16 showed antibiofilm activity against P. aeruginosa PAO1, reducing 60% using the Amsterdam active attachment (AAA) biofilm cultivation model.

Moreover, these networks can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia usually from healthy subjects only or occasionally, from limited pneumonia types. Thus, there is a need for a robust and accurate COVID-19 detector evaluated over a large CXR dataset. To address this need, in this study, we propose a reliable COVID-19 detection network: ReCovNet, which can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia from 14 different thoracic diseases and healthy subjects. To accomplish this, we have compiled the largest COVID-19 CXR dataset: QaTa-COV19 with 124,616 images including 4603 COVID-19 samples. The proposed ReCovNet achieved a detection performance with 98.57% sensitivity and 99.77% specificity.","output":"Reliable COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has posed challenges to community-based rehabilitation (CBR) for persons with mental illness, especially in resource-constrained settings.

SARS-CoV-2 has an exceptionally high level of transmissibility and extremely broad tissue tropism. However, the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for sustaining this degree of virulence remains largely unexplored. In this article, we review the current knowledge and crucial information about how SARS-CoV-2 attaches on the surface of host cells through a variety of receptors, such as ACE2, neuropilin-1, AXL, and antibody-Fc?3R complexes. We further explain how its spike (S) protein undergoes conformational transition from prefusion to postfusion with the help of proteases like furin, TMPRSS2, and cathepsins. We then review the ongoing experimental studies and clinical trials of antibodies, peptides, or small-molecule compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, and discuss how these antiviral therapies targeting host-pathogen interaction could potentially suppress viral attachment, reduce the exposure of fusion peptide to curtail membrane fusion and block the formation of six-helix bundle (6-HB) fusion core. Finally, the specter of rapidly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants deserves a serious review of broad-spectrum drugs or vaccines for long-term prevention and control of COVID-19 in the future.","output":"Molecular mechanism of interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host cells and interventional therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Countries with high COVID-19 vaccination rates have seen the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant result in rapidly increasing case numbers. This study evaluated the impact on the health system which may occur following introduction of the Omicron variant into Western Australia following state border reopening. We aimed to understand the effect of high vaccine coverage levels on the population health burden in the context of lower vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron variant, the impact of a third dose booster regime, and ongoing waning of vaccine-induced immunity. Originally scheduled for 5th February 2022, the Western Australian border was opened on 3rd March 2022, we also aimed to determine the impact of delaying border reopening on the COVID-19 health burden and whether the West Australian health system would be able to manage the resulting peak demand. Methods: An agent-based model was used to evaluate changes in the COVID-19 health burden resulting from different border openings, at monthly intervals. We assumed immunity was derived from vaccination with the BNT162b2 Pfizer BioNTech vaccine and waned at observed rates taken from the UK. The model was calibrated against outbreaks in two other Australian states, Queensland and South Australia, both of which were in a similar situation to Western Australia with negligible COVID-19 transmission prior to Omicron variant introduction. Age-specific infections generated by the model, together with recent UK data, permitted resulting outbreak health burden to be quantified, in particular peak ICU demand. Results: Overall population immunity in Western Australia is shown to peak and then plateau for a period of 5 months, between February and June 2022, resulting in a similar health burden if the border is reopened prior to June 2022. For an opening date of 5th March 2022, hospitalisations are predicated to peak at 510 beds, 51 of which will be in ICU, with a total of 383 deaths. If the border reopened on 5th June 2022, hospitalisations are expected to peak with 750 beds required, 75 of which would be in ICU, and a total of 478 deaths. With a total surge capacity of 52 fully staffed ICU beds, West Australian hospitals are predicted to have adequate ICU capacity for future COVID-19 demands if border reopening occurs prior to May 2022. Conclusions: Our results show that with extremely high SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rates in Western Australian, and documented vaccine-induced vaccine waning rates, the overall population immunity in Western Australia will be at its highest in the period of February 2022 to June 2022. Opening the Western Australian border prior to the end this period will result in the lowest health burden in comparison to opening in June 2022 or later. With a border reopening of 3rd March 2022 announced by the Western Australian government, our data for a 5th March 2022 opening date may be used to predict the progression of this resulting outbreak. These data show expected peak demand of 510 hospital beds, 51 of which will be in ICU, with a total of 383 deaths. With a surge capacity of 52 ICU beds, it is expected that the Western Australian hospital system will be able to handle the additional load during the peak of the wave.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Omicron disease burden in Australia following border reopening: a modelling analysis"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/64.md","filePath":"drive/64.md"}'),R={name:"drive/64.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
