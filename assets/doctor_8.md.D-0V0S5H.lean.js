Methods: The study was conducted between August 1 and August 11, 2021. A total of 18 terms related to reconstructive urology were determined. Public interest in all terms were evaluated with the GT application using the filters worldwide, all categories, and web search. To determine public interest in reconstructive urology during the COVID-19 pandemic, three 12-week periods following the declaration of COVID-19 (March 11 to June 4, 2020, June 5 to August 29, 2020, and August 30 to November 23, 2020) were compared with the same periods in the past four years (2016-2019). Results: Comparisons of March 11 to June 4, 2020, and the same days in the previous four years revealed that total public attention to reconstructive urology significantly declined (?16.2%, p=0.035). In the comparison of the second 12-week duration (June 5 to August 29, 2020, vsJune 5 to August 29, 2016-2019), only the bladder augmentation term had significantly lower search frequency during COVID-19 (?46.3%, p=0.043), but buried penis (50.3%, p=0.001), urinary incontinence (15.3%, p=0.001), and stress urinary incontinence (21.7%, p=0.001) keywords had significantly higher inquiries. The comparison of the third 12-week period searches for only urinary incontinence significantly increased (p=0.001). Conclusion: Present study showed that public interest in reconstructive urology significantly reduced in the first 12 weeks after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. However, public attention to reconstructive urology reached similar levels after 12 weeks from the beginning of COVID-19.

Although the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is less clinically apparent, collecting high-quality biospecimens from infants, children, and adolescents in a standardized manner during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential to establish a biologic understanding of the disease in the pediatric population. This biorepository enables pediatric centers world-wide to collect samples uniformly to drive forward our understanding of COVID-19 by addressing specific pediatric and neonatal COVID-19-related questions. METHODS: A COVID-19 biospecimen collection study was implemented with strategic enrollment guidelines to include patients seen in urgent care clinics and hospital settings, neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, and asymptomatic children. The methodology described here, details the importance of establishing collaborations between the clinical and research teams to harmonize protocols for patient recruitment and sample collection, processing and storage. It also details modifications required for biobanking during a surge of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Considerations and challenges facing enrollment of neonatal and pediatric cohorts are described. A roadmap is laid out for successful collection, processing, storage and database management of multiple pediatric samples such as blood, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, saliva, tracheal aspirates, stool, and urine. Using this methodology, we enrolled 327 participants, who provided a total of 972 biospecimens. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric biospecimens will be key in answering questions relating to viral transmission by children, differences between pediatric and adult viral susceptibility and immune responses, the impact of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on fetal development, and factors driving the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children. The specimens in this biorepository will allow necessary comparative studies between children and adults, help determine the accuracy of current pediatric viral testing techniques, in addition to, understanding neonatal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease abnormalities. The successful establishment of a pediatric biorepository is critical to provide insight into disease pathogenesis, and subsequently, develop future treatment and vaccination strategies.","output":"Establishment of a pediatric COVID-19 biorepository: unique considerations and opportunities for studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During 2020, a total of 64 wild boar carcasses were tested for Enterobacteriaceae count (EBC), Salmonella and Yersinia enterocolitica in the abdominal region (i) within 5 h after hunting in the game collection point and (ii) before dressing and processing in the game-handling establishment (GHE) (49 carcassesaverage time interval between (i) and (ii): 4.3 days).

In general, temporal variations in the ambient aerosol backscattering coefficient (p) and ALWC followed each other. However, the surface p and 532-m p had generally opposite diurnal variation patterns, caused by dramatic differences in PM2.5 and ambient RH between the surface and the upper boundary layer. The ambient 532-m RH was systematically higher than the surface RH, with the latter having a much pronounced diurnal cycle than the former. The surface PM2.5 concentration was systematically higher than the PM2.5 concentration at 532 m, and their diurnal cycle patterns were overall opposite. These dramatic differences reveal that the atmospheric variables, i.e., ambient RH and the PM2.5 concentration in the upper boundary layer, cannot be directly represented by the same variables at the surface. Vertical variability should be considered. Clear differences in the sensitivities of aerosol light scattering to ambient RH, PM2.5, and aerosol hygroscopicity between the two levels were found and examined. Aerosol chemical composition played a minor role in causing the differences between the two levels. In particular, p was more sensitive to PM2.5 at the surface level but more to the ambient RH in the upper boundary layer. The larger contribution of aerosol loading to the variability in p at the surface implies that local emission controls can decrease p and further improve atmospheric visibility effectively at the surface during winter in the PRD region.","output":"The different sensitivities of aerosol optical properties to particle concentration, humidity, and hygroscopicity between the surface level and the upper boundary layer in Guangzhou, China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: In January 2020, World Health Organization declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus a pandemic (global health emergency).

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary-care medical center in Thailand. Hospitalized patients with Enterobacterales infection were included. Infections were classified as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) or carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacterales (CSE). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to examine the association between CRE with DAAT and 30-day mortality. Generalized linear models were used to examine length of stay (LOS) and in-hospital costs. RESULTS: In total, 4,509 patients with Enterobacterales infection (age, mean 65.2 18.7 years; 43.3% male) were included; 627 patients (13.9%) had CRE infection. Among these CRE patients, 88.2% received DAAT. CRE was associated with additional medication costs of $177 (95% confidence interval [CI], 114-239; P < .001) and additional in-hospital costs of $725 (95% CI, 448-1,002; P < .001).

The current study investigated if systemic neutrophil activity, estimated by human neutrophil lipocalin (HNL) concentration in peripheral blood, is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) development. A total of 103 adult patients admitted to intensive care, with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, were prospectively included (Clinical Trials ID: NCT04316884). HNL was analyzed in plasma (P-HNL Dimer) and in whole blood (B-HNL). The latter after ex vivo activation with N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine. All patients developed respiratory dysfunction and 62 (60%) were treated with invasive ventilation. Sixty-seven patients (65%) developed AKI, 18 (17%) progressed to AKI stage 3, and 14 (14%) were treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). P-HNL Dimer was higher in patients with invasive ventilation, vasopressors, AKI, AKI stage 3, dialysis, and 30-day mortality (p < 0.001C0.046). B-HNL performed similarly with the exception of mild AKI and mortality (p < 0.001C0.004). The cohort was dichotomized by ROC estimated cutoff concentrations of 13.2 g/L and 190 g/L for P-HNL Dimer and B-HNL respectively. Increased cumulative risks for AKI, AKI stage 3, and death were observed if above the P-HNL cutoff and for AKI stage 3 if above the B-HNL cutoff. The relative risk of developing AKI stage 3 was nine and 39 times greater if above the cutoffs in plasma and whole blood, respectively, for CRRT eight times greater for both.

Yeast one-hybrid assay confirmed that Ron1 could bind to specific cis-acting elements in the promoters of chitinase and hexokinase. In addition, Ron1 displayed an impaired chitin component of the cell wall, with a chitin synthetase (ChsVII) predicted to function downstream of Ron1.

We evaluated the acceptability and feasibility of using the Tasso OnDemand? device as a self-sampling method for PrEP monitoring tests and compared results from samples obtained using the Tasso device to clinician-collected blood samples. METHODS: We enrolled study subjects online and in a sexual health clinic and HIV clinic in Seattle, WA, USA to assess the acceptability of blood self-sampling and preferences for home-based PrEP monitoring. We compared HIV antigen/antibody, quantitative rapid plasma reagin and creatinine results in paired self-collected and clinical specimens collected from a subset of participants. RESULTS: Of 141 participants, 124 (88%) were interested in collecting samples for PrEP monitoring at home. Among 48 who completed blood collections, 94% found the Tasso device easy to use and 95% felt they could perform self-sampling at home. Of 27 participants who used two devices, 100% collected sufficient blood to perform up to two tests while 33% collected sufficient serum for three tests.

It forms skip lesions, sparing the areas in between the affected parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn's disease could have one of three complications; fistula, intestinal obstruction due to stricture, or gastrointestinal inflammation presenting as severe diarrhoea. Stem cell therapy (SCT) is an innovative treatment that has been recently used in CD. The exact role of SCT in CD is still unclear. Stem cells modify the immunity of the patients or act as a \\"reset tool\\" for the immune system as in the case of systemically-injected stem cells, or regenerate the affected area of necrotic and inflammatory tissue as in the case of local injection into the lesion. Stem cells are a wide variety of cells including pluripotent stem cells or differentiated stem cells. The hazards range from rejection to symptomatic manifestations as fever or increase infection. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this Cochrane systematic review is to assess the effects of stem cell transplantation compared to standard of care alone or with placebo on efficacy and safety outcomes in patients with refractory CD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and clinical trial registries (Clinicaltrials.gov, World Health Organization-International Clinical Trials Registry Platform WHO ICTRP) from inception to 19 March 2021, without any language, publication year, or publication status restrictions. In addition, we searched references of included studies and review articles for further references. An update of the published studies was done during the writing of the review. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effectiveness and safety of SCT in refractory CD versus standard care alone (control) or with placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (SEN and SFA) independently screened the studies retrieved from the search results for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreement was resolved through a consensus between the authors. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We conducted our search on 19 March 2021 and identified 639 records. We added two records by a manual search of the published reviews on the topic to a total of 641 records. The Covidence program removed 125 duplicates making a total of 516 reports. Two review authors (SEN and SFA) screened titles and abstracts and excluded 451 records with the remaining 65 for full-text records screened independently by the two authors; only 18 studies were considered for inclusion. We included seven RCTs with a total of 442 participants for the meta-analysis. The intervention group included 234 patients, and the control group included 208 patients. Nine trials are ongoing and, two abstracts are awaiting classification. All patients in the control and intervention groups received the standard therapy for CD. Only three studies used blinding methods for the control group in the form of a placebo, with one study of the three stated that the blinding method was inefficient. The patients and personnel were aware of the intervention in the rest of the four studies as they were open-label trials. However, the effect of unblinding was balanced by the low risk of detection bias in five of the included studies. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of SCT on achieving clinical remission as compared to control/placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.88, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.80 to 4.41; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of SCT on achieving Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) <150 at 24 weeks compared to control (RR1.02 95% CI 0.67 to 1.56; 4 studies; very-low certainty evidence). SCT is likely to achieve fistula closure as compared to the control/placebo both in the short term (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.96); low-certainty evidence) and in the long term (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.87; 4 studies; low-certainty evidence) follow-up. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of SCT to cause no difference in the number of total adverse events as compared to the control/placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI [0.88 to 1.13); 4 studies; very-low-certainty evidence). However, SCT is likely to increase the number of serious adverse events as compared to the control/placebo (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.67; 7 studies; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of SCT to decrease the withdrawal due to adverse events as compared to the control/placebo (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.89; 3 studies; very-low certainty evidence). Funding by pharmaceutical companies was found in three studies, with one including more than 50% of our studied population. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: SCT shows an uncertain effect on clinical remission with low certainty of evidence. SCT shows an uncertain effect on CDAI score to reach <150 after 24 weeks of treatment, with very low certainty evidence. SCT shows beneficial effects on fistula-closure during short and long-term follow-up with low-certainty evidence in both outcomes. There was no change in the total number of adverse events with SCT as compared to control, with very low certainty evidence. While there was a moderate effect on increasing the number of serious adverse events in the SCT group, as compared to the control with low-certainty evidence. Withdrawal due to adverse events was slightly higher in the control group with very low certainty evidence. All the participants were refractory to standard medical treatment, but the number of participants was small, this may limit the generalizability of the results. Further research is needed for validation.

But its effect in infectious diseases remains unclear. We conducted a single-center prospective study to investigate association of TMAO with in-hospital mortality in septic patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Totally 95 septic, mechanically ventilated patients were enrolled. Blood samples were obtained within 24 h after ICU admission, and plasma TMAO concentrations were determined. Septic patients were grouped into tertiles according to TMAO concentration. The primary outcome was in-hospital death, which further classified as CV and non-CV death. Besides, we also compared the TMAO concentrations of septic patients with 129 non-septic patients who were admitted for elective coronary angiography (CAG). RESULTS: Septic patients had significantly lower plasma TMAO levels than did subjects admitted for CAG (1.0 vs. 3.0 mol/L, p < 0.001). Septic patients in the lowest TMAO tertile (< 0.4 mol/L) had poorer nutrition status and were given longer antibiotic courses before ICU admission. Circulating TMAO levels correlated positively with daily energy intake, the albumin and prealbumin concentration. Compared with those in the highest TMAO tertile, septic patients in the lowest TMAO tertile were at greater risk of non-CV death (hazard ratio 2.51, 95% confidence interval 1.21C5.24, p = 0.014). However, TMAO concentration was no longer an independent predictor for non-CV death after adjustment for disease severity and nutritional status. CONCLUSION: Plasma TMAO concentration was inversely associated with non-CV death among extremely ill septic patients, which could be characterized as TMAO paradox. For septic patients, the impact of malnutrition reflected by circulating TMAO levels was greater than its pro-inflammatory nature.

Here, we asked whether naturally-occurring polymorphisms in DPP4, that alter amino acid residues required for MERS-CoV S binding, influence cellular entry of MERS-CoV. By screening of public databases, we identified fourteen such polymorphisms. Introduction of the respective mutations into DPP4 revealed that all except one (346-348) were compatible with robust DPP4 expression. Four polymorphisms (K267E, K267N, A291P and 346-348) strongly reduced binding of MERS-CoV S to DPP4 and S protein-driven host cell entry, as determined using soluble S protein and S protein bearing rhabdoviral vectors, respectively. Two polymorphisms (K267E and A291P) were analyzed in the context of authentic MERS-CoV and were found to attenuate viral replication.

Treatment of these tumors remains challenging, as both surgical removal and expectant management can result in symptom progression. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been investigated for the management of NF2-associated VS; however, the role, promises, and pitfalls of this treatment modality remain unclear. METHODS Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Reviews were searched for studies assessing SRS outcome in NF2-associated VS only. Primary endpoints included tumor control, serviceable hearing, presence of tinnitus, and cranial nerve V and VII symptoms. RESULTS A total of 16 studies (589 patients harboring 750 tumors) were analyzed. Clinical tumor control was achieved in 88% of cases (95% CI 80-95%); salvage surgery was needed in 8% (95% CI 4-13%) of cases. Treatment resulted in a worsening of pre-treatment serviceable hearing (OR = 0.26, p < 0.01), increased facial nerve (OR = 1.62, p < 0.01) and trigeminal nerve (OR = 1.42, p = 0.07) impairment. The incidence of vestibular symptoms and hydrocephalus were not consistently reported and thus could not be assessed. CONCLUSIONS The treatment of NF2-associated VS continues to pose a challenge, as current SRS regimens result in impaired hearing and worse cranial nerve comorbidities, despite achieving high tumor control. It remains unclear if these findings have to be regarded as treatment complications or, rather, continued disease progression.","output":"Stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas in neurofibromatosis type 2 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Long COVID has become a burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Research into the etiology and risk factors has been impeded by observing all diverse manifestations as part of a single entity. We aimed to determine patterns of symptoms in convalescing COVID-19 patients. Methods: Symptomatic patients were recruited from four countries. Data were collected regarding demographics, comorbidities, acute disease and persistent symptoms. Factor analysis was performed to elucidate symptom patterns. Associations of the patterns with patients characteristics, features of acute disease and effect on daily life were sought. Results: We included 1027 symptomatic post-COVID individuals in the analysis. The majority of participants were graded as having a non-severe acute COVID-19 (N = 763, 74.3%). We identified six patterns of symptoms: cognitive, pain-syndrome, pulmonary, cardiac, anosmia-dysgeusia and headache. The cognitive pattern was the major symptoms pattern, explaining 26.2% of the variance; the other patterns each explained 6.5C9.5% of the variance. The cognitive pattern was higher in patients who were outpatients during the acute disease. The pain-syndrome pattern was associated with acute disease severity, higher in women and increased with age. The pulmonary pattern was associated with prior lung disease and severe acute disease. Only two of the patterns (cognitive and cardiac) were associated with failure to return to pre-COVID occupational and physical activity status. Conclusion: Long COVID diverse symptoms can be grouped into six unique patterns.

Here we show that unlike the initial virus, VOCs are able to infect common laboratory mice, replicating to high titers in the lungs. This host range expansion is explained in part by the acquisition of changes at key positions of the receptor binding domain that enable binding to the mouse angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor, although differences between viral lineages suggest that other factors are involved in the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs to infect mice.

The Netherlands started with containment yet shifted to mitigation when a 'mild' lockdown was implemented. The initial focus was to obtain herd immunity while preventing Intensive Care Units from getting overwhelmed. Methods: An in-depth analysis of available national and international COVID-19 data sources was conducted. Due to regional variation in COVID-19 hospitalization rates, this paper focuses on three distinct regions; the initial epicenter; the most northern provinces which - contrary to national policy - decided not to switch to mitigation; and the Bible Belt, as congregations of religious groups were initially excluded from the ban on group formation. Results: On August 11th, 6,159 COVID-19 deaths were reported with excess mortality rates about 70% higher. As a result of the pandemic, the economy took a severe hit and is predicted to reduce by 6.5% compared to prognosis. The hospitalization rates in the northern regions are over 70% lower as compared to the rest of the country (18 vs 66 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively). Differences between the Bible Belt and the rest of the country were hardly detectable. Conclusion: the Dutch have shown a way to effectively slow down transmission while allowing more personal and economic freedom than most other countries. Furthermore, the regional differences suggest that containment with testing and tracing reduced the virus dissemination.

METHODS: We included all patients seen in consultation in two French liver transplant centres between January 1, 2021, and March 15, 2021. RESULTS: 598 liver transplant recipients were enrolled and 327 were included for analysis. Sixteen patients received one dose, 63 patients two doses and 248 patients three doses. Anti\\\\SARS\\\\Cov\\\\2 antibodies were detected in 242 out of 327 (74.0%) liver transplant patients after vaccination. Considering an optimal serologic response defined as an antibody titre >260 BAU/ml, 172 patients (52.6%) were responders. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) treatment was an independent risk factor for a failure to develop anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 antibodies after vaccination (OR 0.458; 95%CI 0.258C0.813; p = .008).

This pilot study examined the feasibility of providing an in-person nutrition intervention for families at high risk of developing prediabetes or type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk-factors. METHODS Eligible families had at least one member with a non-communicable disease (NCD) or metabolic risk factor, fluency in English, willingness to attend all three educational sessions and complete questionnaires as a family unit. Sessions included didactic and experiential activities on food label reading, portion sizing, physical activity and modifiable lifestyle factors to reduce NCD risk. Demographics and fruit and vegetable screeners were collected from all participants at baseline and after completion of sessions. Families participated in focus groups to evaluate the program. RESULTS Twelve families (n=35;17 adults;18 children) were recruited from New York City. Participants self-identified as Asian, Hispanic or Black. Adults had a mean age of 40y, BMI of 32.29kg/m2, household income of $35,000-$49,000y, and 13 of 17 adult participants had college degrees. Children ranged from 1-17y. Based on focus group feedback, three sessions were acceptable, families reported enjoying interactive activities and group learning and requested child-friendly activities. They reported improved knowledge of food labels, strategies for grocery shopping, portion-sizing, and increased awareness of the links between diet quality and NCDs.

On the 7th day, the patient developed severe complications which led to cardiac arrest. DISCUSSION: PE is the buildup of fluid in the pericardium. It has been rarely observed in relation to COVID-19, both during and after the viral infection. If PE is suspected, Echocardiography can be used to confirm its diagnosis. There is no standard management for these cases and only non-hemorrhagic patients with mild to moderate effusion can be treated using conservative measures. CONCLUSION: Hemorrhagic PE can be a rare but possible post-COVID-19 sequel, and Echo can be used to confirm its diagnosis. Drainage is necessary to resolve the effusion.","output":"Post COVID-19 hemorrhagic pericardial effusion; a case report with literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene polymorphisms have been associated with severity and outcomes in patients with respiratory and nonrespiratory viral infections.

Previous studies have suggested that neutrophils may suppress or activate T cells. Despite these studies, the interaction between neutrophils and T cells has remained a largely unexplored field. Here, based on our RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, we found that neutrophils have differential transcriptional and functional profiling depending on the CD4 T-cell count of the HIV-infected individual. In particular, we identified that neutrophils in healthy individuals express surface Galectin-9 (Gal-9), which is down-regulated upon activation, and is consistently down-regulated in HIV-infected individuals. However, down-regulation of Gal-9 was associated with CD4 T-cell count of patients. Unstimulated neutrophils express high levels of surface Gal-9 that is bound to CD44, and, upon stimulation, neutrophils depalmitoylate CD44 and induce its movement out of the lipid raft. This process causes the release of Gal-9 from the surface of neutrophils. In addition, we found that neutrophil-derived exogenous Gal-9 binds to cell surface CD44 on T cells, which promotes LCK activation and subsequently enhances T-cell activation. Furthermore, this process was regulated by glycolysis and can be inhibited by interleukin (IL)-10. Together, our data reveal a novel mechanism of Gal-9 shedding from the surface of neutrophils. This could explain elevated plasma Gal-9 levels in HIV-infected individuals as an underlying mechanism of the well-characterized chronic immune activation in HIV infection. This study provides a novel role for the Gal-9 shedding from neutrophils. We anticipate that our results will spark renewed investigation into the role of neutrophils in T-cell activation in other acute and chronic conditions, as well as improved strategies for modulating Gal-9 shedding.","output":"Neutrophils promote T-cell activation through the regulated release of CD44-bound Galectin-9 from the cell surface during HIV infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease and is frequently associated with type 2 diabetes.

DESIGN: Before-and-after intervention study without a control group (interrupted time-series analysis). SETTING: All 29 Israeli general hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: All HCWs. INTERVENTIONS: Two national regulations were issued on March 25, 2020: one required universal masking of HCWs, patients, and visitors in general hospitals and the second defined what constitutes HCW exposure to severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and when quarantine is required. RESULTS: Overall, 283 HCWs were infected at work or from an unknown source. Before the intervention, the number of HCWs infected at work increased by 0.5 per day (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2-0.7; P < .001), peaking at 16. After the intervention, new infections declined by 0.2 per day (95% CI, -0.3 to -0.1; P < .001). Before the intervention, the number of HCWs in quarantine or isolation increased by 97 per day (95% CI, 90-104; P < .001), peaking at 2,444. After the intervention, prevalence decreased by 59 per day (95% CI, -72 to -46; P < .001). Epidemiological investigations determined that the most common source of HCW infection (58%) was a coworker. CONCLUSIONS: Universal masking in general hospitals reduced the risk of hospital-acquired COVID-19 among HCWs.

Methods Twenty antimicrobial coating products, predominantly composed of organosilane quaternary ammonium compounds, were applied to stainless steel coupons, dried overnight and evaluated for efficacy against 6, an enveloped bacteriophage. Additionally, two peel and stick polymer-based films, a copper-based film, and three copper alloys were evaluated. Efficacy was determined by comparison of recoveries from uncoated (positive control) and coated (test) surfaces. RESULTS indicated that some of the coating products initially demonstrated >3-log reduction of 6; no direct correlation of efficacy was observed with active ingredient or its concentration. The peel and stick films and copper alloys each demonstrated efficacy in initial testing. However, none of the spray-based products retained efficacy after subjecting the coating to abrasion with either a hypochlorite or quaternary ammonium-based solution applied in accordance with EPA Interim Guidance for Evaluating the Efficacy of Antimicrobial Surface Coatings. Of the products tested for this durability, only one peel and stick polymeric film retained efficacy; the copper alloys were not tested for their durability in this study.

This 1-year cross-sectional study was aimed at documenting the prevalence of BRD-related pathogens and clinical signs before and after a long journey and at identifying possible predisposition factors. Male Limousine beef steers (n = 169) traveling from France to Italy were health checked and sampled with Deep Nasopharyngeal Swabs (DNS) at loading (T0) and 4 days after arrival (T1). Real-time quantitative PCR was used to quantify the presence of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis, and Pasteurella multocida. Weather conditions at departure and arrival were recorded, and the travel conditions were taken from the travel documentation. At T0, even if no animals displayed clinical signs, some of them were already positive for one or more pathogens. At T1, the number of animals displaying clinical signs and positive for BCoV, BAdV, BRSV, H. somni, M. haemolytica, M. bovis, and P. multocida increased dramatically (p < 0.001). Transport also significantly increased co-infection passing from 16.0% at T0 to 82.8% at T1 (p < 0.001). An extra stop during the journey seemed to favor BRSV, M. haemolytica, and P. multocida (p < 0.05). Weather conditions, in particular sudden climate changes from departure to arrival and daily temperature variance, were found to be predisposing factors for many of the pathogens. The farm of arrival also played a role for BRSV, BAdV, and H. somni (p < 0.05). BCoV increased dramatically, but no associations were found confirming that it spreads easily during transport phases.

Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) were conducted in 2013 (failed in NWU) and 2017 (all three EUs failed). In 2018, Samoa was the first in the world to distribute nationwide triple-drug MDA using ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole. Surveillance and Monitoring to Eliminate LF and Scabies from Samoa (SaMELFS Samoa) is an operational research program designed to evaluate the effectiveness of triple-drug MDA on LF transmission and scabies prevalence in Samoa, and to compare the usefulness of different indicators of LF transmission. This paper reports results from the 2018 baseline survey and aims to i) investigate antigen (Ag) prevalence and spatial epidemiology, including geographic clustering; ii) compare Ag prevalence between two different age groups (5C9 years versus 10 years) as indicators of areas of ongoing transmission; and iii) assess the prevalence of limb lymphedema in those aged 15 years. METHODS: A community-based cluster survey was conducted in 30 randomly selected and five purposively selected clusters (primary sampling units, PSUs), each comprising one or two villages. Participants were recruited through household surveys (age 5 years) and convenience surveys (age 5C9 years). Alere Filariasis Test Strips (FTS) were used to detect Ag, and prevalence was adjusted for survey design and standardized for age and gender. Adjusted Ag prevalence was estimated for each age group (5C9, 10, and all ages 5 years) for random and purposive PSUs, and by region. Intraclass correlation (ICC) was used to quantify clustering at regions, PSUs, and households. RESULTS: A total of 3940 persons were included (1942 children aged 5C9 years, 1998 persons aged 10 years). Adjusted Ag prevalence in all ages 5 years in randomly and purposively selected PSUs were 4.0% (95% CI 2.8C5.6%) and 10.0% (95% CI 7.4C13.4%), respectively. In random PSUs, Ag prevalence was lower in those aged 5C9 years (1.3%, 95% CI 0.8C2.1%) than 10 years (4.7%, 95% CI 3.1C7.0%), and poorly correlated at the PSU level (R-square = 0.1459). Adjusted Ag prevalence in PSUs ranged from 0% to 10.3% (95% CI 5.9C17.6%) in randomly selected and 3.8% (95% CI 1.3C10.8%) to 20.0% (95% CI 15.3C25.8%) in purposively selected PSUs. ICC for Ag-positive individuals was higher at households (0.46) compared to PSUs (0.18) and regions (0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed ongoing transmission of LF in Samoa, in accordance with the 2017 TAS results. Ag prevalence varied significantly between PSUs, and there was poor correlation between prevalence in 5C9 year-olds and older ages, who had threefold higher prevalence. Sampling older age groups would provide more accurate estimates of overall prevalence, and be more sensitive for identifying residual hotspots. Higher prevalence in purposively selected PSUs shows local knowledge can help identify at least some hotspots.","output":"Lymphatic filariasis epidemiology in Samoa in 2018: Geographic clustering and higher antigen prevalence in older age groups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a potentially fatal zoonosis. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including diffuse alveolar haemorrhage which occurs in a minority of cases but carries a mortality of over 70%. These patients may present with severe acute respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis for diffuse alveolar haemorrhage is broad whereas prompt diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old previously fit and well trout farm worker presented with a 3-day history of malaise, fevers, diarrhoea, vomiting and jaundice. He developed haemoptysis, severe headaches, neck stiffness and photophobia on the day of emergency admission. He was anaemic and thrombocytopenic. Anuric acute kidney injury (urea 32, creat 507) required immediate haemofiltration. In view of progressive respiratory failure with four-quadrant lung infiltrates on imaging, he was given broad spectrum antibiotics and pulsed methylprednisolone empirically, in case of a vasculitic pulmonary-renal presentation. He was intubated within 48 h of admission. Despite attempted protective ventilatory management, he remained hypoxaemic and developed pneumomediastinum. He was retrieved to a specialist cardiorespiratory intensive care unit on femoro-femoral mobile VV-ECMO. Three days from admission, results showed positive Leptospira IgM and real-time PCR. Serial bronchoscopies showed old and fresh clots, but not the classical progressive late red tinge of the returned lavage fluid. After eight days, VV-ECMO was weaned, he was extubated three days later, and made a full recovery. At 9 months follow-up, he was clinically better, with resolution of the CT scan findings and near normal lung function, albeit with low normal gas transfer. CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis is a rare but important differential to be considered in diffuse alveolar haemorrhage presenting to the ICU, especially in young males. A thorough history for occupational or recreational risk factors may offer the diagnostic clue. Most patients recover fully with antibiotics. However, resulting acute severe respiratory failure can ensue. In this situation, early consideration for respiratory ECMO support offers time for clearance of endobronchial clot, parenchymal recovery, and prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury. Steroids have no clear evidence but may be used to avoid delay in treating suspected vasculitic or autoimmune causes of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.","output":"Leptospirosis as an important differential of pulmonary haemorrhage on the intensive care unit: a case managed with VV-ECMO"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a nationwide lockdown is imposed in India initially for three weeks from 24th March to 14th April 2020 and extended up to 3rd May 2020. Due to the forced restrictions, pollution level in cities across the country drastically slowed down just within few days which magnetize discussions regarding lockdown to be the effectual alternative measures to be implemented for controlling air pollution. The present article eventually worked on this direction to look upon the air quality scenario amidst the lockdown period scientifically with special reference to the megacity Delhi. With the aid of air quality data of seven pollutant parameters (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and NH3) for 34 monitoring stations spread over the megacity we have employed National Air Quality Index (NAQI) to show the spatial pattern of air quality in pre and during-lockdown phases. The results demonstrated that during lockdown air quality is significantly improved. Among the selected pollutants, concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 have witnessed maximum reduction (>50%) in compare to the pre-lockdown phase. In compare to the last year (i.e. 2019) during the said time period the reduction of PM10 and PM2.5 is as high as about 60% and 39% respectively. Among other pollutants, NO2 (?52.68%) and CO (?30.35%) level have also reduced during-lockdown phase. About 40% to 50% improvement in air quality is identified just after four days of commencing lockdown. About 54%, 49%, 43%, 37% and 31% reduction in NAQI have been observed in Central, Eastern, Southern, Western and Northern parts of the megacity. Overall, the study is thought to be a useful supplement to the regulatory bodies since it showed the pollution source control can attenuate the air quality. Temporary such source control in a suitable time interval may heal the environment.","output":"Effect of lockdown amid COVID-19 pandemic on air quality of the megacity Delhi, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the spread of COVID-19 to vast geographical regions and populations, it is not feasible to undergo or recommend the RT-PCR based tests to all individuals with flu-like symptoms. The reach of RT-PCR based testing is still limited due to the high cost of the test and huge population in few countries. Thus, alternative methods for COVID-19 infection risk prediction can be useful. We built an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) based integrated web-based prospective framework for COVID-19 risk prediction. We employed a two-step procedure for the non-clinical prediction of COVID19 infection risk. In the first step we assess the initial risk of COVID19 infection based on carefully selected parameters associated with COVID-19 positive symptoms from recent research. Generally, X-ray scans are cheaper and easily available in most government and private health centres. Therefore, based on the outcome of the computed initial risk in first step, we further provide an optional prediction using the chest X-ray scans in the second step of our proposed AI based prospective framework. Since there is a bottleneck to undergo an expensive RT-PCR based confirmatory test in economically backward nations, this is a crucial part of our explainable AI based prospective framework. The initial risk assessment outcome is analysed in combination with the advanced deep learning-based analysis of chest X-ray scans to provide an accurate prediction of COVID-19 infection risk. This prospective web-based AI framework can be employed in limited resource settings after clinical validation in future.

The virus circulates as many different types (~160), each generating strong homologous, but weak heterotypic, immunity. The influence of these features on transmission patterns of HRV in the community is understudied. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI) at nine out-patient facilities across a Health and Demographic Surveillance System between December 2015 and November 2016. HRV was diagnosed by real-time RT-PCR, and the VP4/VP2 genomic region of the positive samples sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine the HRV types. Classification models and G-test statistic were used to investigate HRV type spatial distribution. Demographic characteristics and clinical features of ARI were also compared. Results: Of 5,744 NPS samples collected, HRV was detected in 1057 (18.4%), of which 817 (77.3%) were successfully sequenced. HRV species A, B and C were identified in 360 (44.1%), 67 (8.2%) and 390 (47.7%) samples, respectively.

Conclusion: This study records a high prevalence of HRV in out-patient presentations exhibiting high type diversity. Patterns of occurrence suggest frequent and independent community invasion of different types. Temporal differences of persistence between types may reflect variation in type-specific population immunity. Spatial patterns suggest either rapid spread or multiple invasions of the same type, but evidence of similar types amongst close health facilities, or along road systems, indicate type partitioning structured by local spread.","output":"Human rhinovirus spatial-temporal epidemiology in rural coastal Kenya, 2015-2016, observed through outpatient surveillance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Why you should read this article: ?

METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study on real field data from a county health department (CHD), all PCR-confirmed cases and related contact persons put into quarantine were analysed. Hh-Q2 was used in our CHD from the onset of the pandemic. RESULTS: From 9 March to 8 December 2020, 353 PCR-confirmed cases were registered in the CHD Ploen, Northern Germany: 225 (63.7%) primary, 107 (30.3%) secondary and 21 (5.9%) tertiary cases.

It is widely understood that the existing mechanisms which shape health inequalities have resulted in COVID-19 outcomes following this same, familiar, pattern. Our aim was to estimate inequalities in the population health impact of COVID-19 in Scotland, measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2020. Our secondary aim was to scale overall, and inequalities in, COVID-19 DALYs against the level of pre-pandemic inequalities in all-cause DALYs, derived from the Scottish Burden of Disease (SBoD) study. METHODS: National deaths and daily case data were input into the European Burden of Disease Network consensus model to estimate DALYs. Total Years of Life Lost (YLL) were estimated for each area-based deprivation quintile of the Scottish population. Years Lived with Disability were proportionately distributed to deprivation quintiles, based on YLL estimates. Inequalities were measured by: the range, Relative Index of Inequality (RII), Slope Index of Inequality (SII), and attributable DALYs were estimated by using the least deprived quintile as a reference. RESULTS: Marked inequalities were observed across several measures. The SII range was 2048 to 2289 COVID-19 DALYs per 100,000 population. The rate in the most deprived areas was around 58% higher than the mean population rate (RII = 1.16), with 40% of COVID-19 DALYs attributed to differences in area-based deprivation. Overall DALYs due to COVID-19 ranged from 7 to 20% of the annual pre-pandemic impact of inequalities in health loss combined across all causes. CONCLUSION: The substantial population health impact of COVID-19 in Scotland was not shared equally across areas experiencing different levels of deprivation. The extent of inequality due to COVID-19 was similar to averting all annual DALYs due to diabetes. In the wider context of population health loss, overall ill-health and mortality due to COVID-19 was, at most, a fifth of the annual population health loss due to inequalities in multiple deprivation.

Infants and young children are especially at risk because children are particularly vulnerable to climate-related stressors. The childhood diseases most affected, the breadth and magnitude of future health problems and the time frame over which these problems will manifest remain largely unknown. OBJECTIVES To review the possibility that spacially explicit analyses can be used to determine how climate change has affected children's health to date and whether these analyses can be used for future projections. METHODS As an example of whether these objectives can be achieved, all available Australian environmental and health databases were reviewed. RESULTS Environmental and health data in Australia have been collected for up to 30 years for the same spatial areas at 'Statistical Area level 1' (SA1) scale. SA1s are defined as having a population of between 200 and 800 people and collectively they cover the whole of Australia without gaps or overlap. Although the SA1 environmental and health data have been collected separately, they can be merged to allow detailed statistical analyses that can determine how climate change has affected the health of children. CONCLUSIONS The availability of environmental and health datasets that share the same precise spatial coordinates provides a pathway whereby past and emerging effects on child health can be measured and predicted into the future.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively selected a cohort of 86 COVID-19 patients (with positive RT-PCR), from March-May 2020 at a tertiary hospital in the northeastern USA, who underwent chest CT and CXR within 48 hrs. The ground truth volumetric percentage of COVID-19 related AD (POv) was established by manual AD segmentation on CT. The resulting 3D masks were projected into 2D anterior-posterior digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) to compute area-based AD percentage (POa). A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained with DRR images generated from a larger-scale CT dataset of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, automatically segmenting lungs, AD and quantifying POa on CXR. CNN POa results were compared to POa quantified on CXR by two expert readers and to the POv ground-truth, by computing correlations and mean absolute errors.

METHODS: Telemedicine service was established by Faisalabad Medical University at two of its affiliated locations: (i) a 24-hour COVID-19 Telephone Helpline was established at the Director Emergency Office, Allied Hospital, and District Headquarter (DHQ) Hospital. (ii) A Telemedicine Clinic comprising consultants and postgraduate residents from different specialties was established at Chief Office, Allied Hospital. The data related to the number and categories of calls and advice provided were collected from 27th March 2020 to 31st July 2020. RESULTS: A total of 4582 calls were received, at both locations, during the study period, out of which 2325 callers (51%) were male, and 2257 (49%) were females. At Allied Hospital, 172 patients were advised accordingly for their complaints, whereas, at DHQ Hospital, 320 patients were advised accordingly for their complaints.

Here we profile the antibody responses of 162 COVID-19 symptomatic patients in the COVID-BioB cohort followed longitudinally for up to eight months from symptom onset to find SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, as well as antibodies either recognizing SARS-CoV-2 spike antigens and nucleoprotein, or specific for S2 antigen of seasonal beta-coronaviruses and hemagglutinin of the H1N1 flu virus. The presence of neutralizing antibodies within the first weeks from symptoms onset correlates with time to a negative swab result (p = 0.002), while the lack of neutralizing capacity correlates with an increased risk of a fatal outcome (p = 0.008). Neutralizing antibody titers progressively drop after 5-8 weeks but are still detectable up to 8 months in the majority of recovered patients regardless of age or co-morbidities, with IgG to spike antigens providing the best correlate of neutralization. Antibody responses to seasonal coronaviruses are temporarily boosted, and parallel those to SARS-CoV-2 without dampening the specific response or worsening disease progression. Our results thus suggest compromised immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike to be a major trait of COVID-19 patients with critical conditions, and thereby inform on the planning of COVID-19 patient care and therapy prioritization.","output":"Neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic COVID-19 is persistent and critical for survival"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines brings hope for successful pandemic mitigation and getting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control. The vaccines authorized in Europe displayed a good safety profile in the clinical trials. However, during their post-authorization use, unusual thrombotic events associated with thrombocytopenia have rarely been reported for vector vaccines. This led to the temporary suspension of the AZD1222 vaccine (Oxford/AstraZeneca) in various European countries and the Ad26.COV2 vaccine (Janssen/Johnson&Johnson) in the United States, with regulatory bodies launching investigations into potential causal associations. The thromboembolic reactions were also rarely reported after mRNA vaccines. The exact cause of these adverse effects remains to be elucidated. The present paper outlines the hypotheses on the mechanisms behind the very rare thrombotic thrombocytopenia reported after the COVID-19 vaccination, along with currently existing evidence and future research prospects. The following are discussed: (i) the role of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4), (ii) the direct interaction between adenoviral vector and platelets, (iii) the cross-reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with PF4, (iv) cross-reactivity of anti-adenovirus antibodies and PF4, (v) interaction between spike protein and platelets, (vi) the platelet expression of spike protein and subsequent immune response, and (vii) the platelet expression of other adenoviral proteins and subsequent reactions. It is also plausible that thrombotic thrombocytopenia after the COVID-19 vaccine is multifactorial. The elucidation of the causes of these adverse events is pivotal in taking precautionary measures and managing vaccine hesitancy. It needs to be stressed, however, that the reported cases are currently sporadic and that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines vastly outweigh their potential risks.","output":"Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia after COVID-19 Vaccination: In Search of the Underlying Mechanism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater surveillance has become essential for monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

An effective tool is urgently needed to clarify the relevant issues and discern the cause-and-effect relationships among them in these conflicts.

METHODS: Adult patients hospitalized 5/1/2020C12/31/2020 with a discharge diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified from the Premier Healthcare Database. Patient and hospital characteristics, treatments, baseline severity based on oxygen support, length of stay (LOS), ICU utilization and mortality were examined. RESULTS: The study included 295 657 patients (847 hospitals), with median age(IQR) of 66(54-77) years. Majority were male, white, and over 65. Approximately 85% had no supplemental oxygen charges (NSOc) or low-flow oxygen (LFO) at baseline, while 75% received no more than NSOc or LFO as maximal oxygen support at any time during hospitalization. Remdesivir (RDV) and corticosteroid treatment utilization increased over time. By December, 50% were receiving RDV and 80% were receiving corticosteroids. A higher proportion initiated COVID-19 treatments within two days of hospitalization in December vs May (RDV: 87% vs 40%; corticosteroids: 93% vs 62%; convalescent plasma: 68% vs 26%). There was a shift toward initiating RDV in patients on NSOc or LFO (68.0% (May) vs. 83.1% (December)). Median LOS decreased over time.

The manner in which human infections respond to therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including convalescent plasma therapy (CPT), remains to be fully elucidated. METHODS: Here, we conducted a proof-of-principle study of CPT based on a phase I trial in thirty hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a median interval between the onset of symptoms and the first transfusion of 9 days (IQR, 7-11.8 days). A comprehensive longitudinal monitoring of the virologic, serologic, and disease status of recipients allowed deciphering of parameters on which plasma therapy efficacy depends. RESULTS: In the context of this trial CPT was safe as evidenced by the absence of transfusion related adverse events and a low mortality (3.3%). Treatment with highly neutralizing plasma was significantly associated with faster virus clearance, as demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier analysis (p= 0.034) and confirmed in a parametric survival model including viral load and comorbidity (adjusted hazard ratio (HR)= 3.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1;8.1], p= 0.026). The onset of endogenous neutralization had a noticeable effect on viral clearance but, importantly, even after adjusting for their pre-transfusion endogenous neutralization status recipients benefitted from plasma therapy with high neutralizing antibodies (HR= 3.5 [95% CI 1.1;11], p= 0.034). CONCLUSION: In summary, our data demonstrate a clear impact of exogenous antibody therapy on the rapid clearance of viremia before and after onset of the endogenous neutralizing response and more broadly point beyond antibody-based interventions to critical laboratory parameters for improved evaluation of current and future SARS-CoV-2 therapies.

Currently, the backbone of human GWAS approaches is allele-counting-based methods where the signal of association is derived from alleles that are identical-by-state. Borrowing this approach from human GWAS, allele-counting-based methods have been popularized in microbial GWAS, notably the generalized linear model using either dimension reduction for fixed covariates and/or a genetic relationship matrix as a random effect in a mixed model to control for population stratification. In this work, we show how the effects of linkage disequilibrium (LD) can potentially obscure true-positive genotype-phenotype associations (i.e., genetic variants causally associated with the phenotype of interest) and also lead to unacceptably high rates of false-positive associations when applying these classical approaches to GWAS in weakly recombining microbial genomes. We developed a GWAS method called POUTINE (https://github.com/Peter-Two-Point-O/POUTINE), which relies on homoplastic mutation to both clarify the source of putative causal variants and reduce likely false-positive associations compared to traditional allele counting methods. Using datasets of M. tuberculosis genomes and antibiotic-resistance phenotypes, we show that LD can in fact render all association signals from allele counting methods to be fully indistinguishable from hundreds to thousands of sites scattered across an entire genome. These classic GWAS methods thus fail to pinpoint likely causal genotype-phenotype associations and separate them from background noise, even after applying methods to correct for population structure.

To explore these questions, we present an agent-based model of ideological polarization that differentiates between the tendency for two actors to interact (exposure) and how they respond when interactions occur, positing that interaction between similar actors reduces their difference while interaction between dissimilar actors increases their difference. Our analysis explores the effects on polarization of different levels of tolerance to other views, responsiveness to other views, exposure to dissimilar actors, multiple ideological dimensions, economic self-interest, and external shocks. The results suggest strategies for preventing, or at least slowing, the development of extreme polarization.","output":"Preventing Extreme Polarization of Political Attitudes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International air travel is increasingly affecting the epidemiology of infectious diseases. A particular public health, economic, and political concern is the role of air travel in bringing infectious passengers or vectors to previously non-endemic areas. Yet, little research has been done to investigate either the infection risks associated with air travel or the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of infection control measures on aircraft and at borders. We briefly review the interface between international and national legislation, policy, and guidelines in the context of existing infection risks and possible scenarios. We have found that public health guidance and legislation, which airlines are required to follow, are often contradictory and confusing. Infection control measures for air travel need to be underpinned by coherent and enforceable national and international legislation that is based on solid epidemiological evidence. We recommend further research investment into more effective on-board vector control, health screening, and risk communications strategies, and the development of enforceable and harmonised international legislation.","output":"Guidelines, law, and governance: disconnects in the global control of airline-associated infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lymphopenia has been a common feature and prognostic marker of COVID-19 disease and the 2003 SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection Lymphopenia, comprising of l","output":"Thymic Dysfunction and Atrophy in COVID-19 Disease Complicated by Inflammation, Malnutrition and Cachexia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, can elites severe acute respiratory syndrome, severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and even death and became a worldwide pandemic.

The present study aims to investigate preventive behaviors associated with COVID-19 including wearing masks and keeping physical distance among the passengers on buses and public taxis measures to evaluate the ventilation systems in these vehicles. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on 753 passengers on buses and taxis in Tabriz, northwestern Iran, from 15 February to 1 March 2021. Multistage sampling method was used to select the participants. Tabriz was socioeconomically divided into three areas, including high, moderate, and low socioeconomic status. Three researchers were observed passengers behaviors standing at the selected stations and assessed their behaviors according to study checklist. RESULTS: In total, the data were gathered from 358 (47.5%) female and 395 (52.5%) male in public transport systems. The results of this study indicated that female passengers used masks significantly more than men (P < 0.001). About 40% of men and women did not keep a physical distance of at least one meter in the public transportation system. Failing to keep social distancing was mostly observed among people with low SES (N = 103, 54%) and those who were in city center (N = 88, 48.5%). According to the multivariate regression analysis, for not wearing mask: being male [OR 4.94; 95%CI (2.62C9.28)] and using bus [(OR 3.27, 95%CI (1.73,6.19)], and for not physical distancing: having age under 25 years [OR 2.58; 95%CI (1.53,4.36)] and low socioeconomic status (SES) [OR 5.19; 95%CI (3.25,8.30)], and for no ventilation: using bus [OR 1.57; 95%CI (1.05,2.34)] were significant predictors. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that gender, type of vehicle, age, and SES were significant predictors of non-adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviors in public transport during the pandemic. Given that social distancing is less observed in the public transportation system in Tabriz, Iran, it is necessary for government to consider and monitor guidelines to protect the passengers from COVID-19 infections by providing measures to maintain physical distance in public transportation systems. It may be possible to force vehicle owners who do not comply with health protocols to keep some distance by imposing fines.","output":"Investigating the COVID-19 related behaviors in the public transport system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic is a modern social emergency and the biggest global challenge since the Second World War.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional telephone interview survey. SETTING: Academic sleep labs. PARTICIPANTS: Iranian adults  18 years old with confirmed OSA. RESULTS: Among 275 participants with OSA, 20% (n = 55) were suspected to have history of COVID-19 but had no positive test, and 18% (n = 51) were in the definite COVID-19 group according to their reported symptoms or confirmed positive test. Having severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index  30) was associated with an increased risk of definite COVID-19, with an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 2.31 (0.87-5.55) compared to having mild OSA in definite COVID-19 group. Those not undergoing treatment for OSA had an OR (95% CI) of 2.43 (1.26-4.67) for definite COVID-19 compared to those accepting treatment in definite COVID-19 group.

We sought to determine the prevalence and predictors of medication-related emergency department admissions, among patients with cardiovascular diseases at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, Uganda. METHODS: Institutional research ethics approval was secured to conduct a cross-sectional study at the Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital emergency department, between February and September, 2020. All eligible and consenting patients were enrolled in a consecutive manner after a preliminary diagnosis was made by the attending physician. Structured questionnaire interview and comprehensive medication history reviews were used to identify medication therapy problems, in collaboration with a resident physician present on duty. We used sequential categorization for medication therapy problem(s). Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were used to determine prevalence and predictors of medication-related emergency department admissions. RESULTS: Out of the 128 patients interviewed, 105 (82%) patient admissions were associated with a medication therapy problem: ineffectiveness of drug therapy (53.3%, 56), medication non-adherence (42.9%, 45), and adverse drug reactions (3.8%, 4). Out of a total of 90 incidences of medication non-adherence, 34.4% (31/90) were due to lack of understanding of patient medication regimen, and 27.8% (25/90) due to unaffordable cost of medicines. Female gender (AOR = 4.31 [1.43, 13.03 at 95% CI]; P-value = 0.010]) and a history of tobacco use (AOR = 9.58 [1.14, 80.28 at 95% CI]; P-value = 0.037) were statistically significant predictors of medication-related emergency department admissions in adjusted analysis. CONCLUSION: Four in five emergency department admissions were associated with medication-related causes, majorly due to ineffectiveness of drug therapy.

Agricultural trade will be less significantly affected, being insulated by its relatively low income elasticities of demand. However, a drop in the range of 12 to 20 percent in real trade value should be expected. Canada can be expected to share in this, but, within agricultural exports, cereals will be least affected. This minimal expected impact to cereals stems from the risk of wheat export bans by Russia and Kazakhstan, due to the resulting increase in wheat prices. Livestock, pulses, and horticulture can be expected to face a larger decline in trade prospects and revenues. An equally large threat to falling incomes in our trade partners is their policy responses, particularly the potential increase in import restrictions.

Here, we report that for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) this paradigm does not apply. By investigating temporal IFN and inflammatory cytokine patterns in 32 moderate-to-severe patients with COVID-19 hospitalized for pneumonia and longitudinally followed for the development of respiratory failure and death, we reveal that IFN-&#955; and type I IFN production were both diminished and delayed, induced only in a fraction of patients as they became critically ill. On the contrary, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 were produced before IFNs in all patients and persisted for a prolonged time. This condition was reflected in blood transcriptomes wherein prominent IFN signatures were only seen in critically ill patients who also exhibited augmented inflammation. By comparison, in 16 patients with influenza (flu) hospitalized for pneumonia with similar clinicopathological characteristics to those of COVID-19 and 24 nonhospitalized patients with flu with milder symptoms, IFN-&#955; and type I IFN were robustly induced earlier, at higher levels and independently of disease severity, whereas pro-inflammatory cytokines were only acutely produced. Notably, higher IFN-&#955; concentrations in patients with COVID-19 correlated with lower viral load in bronchial aspirates and faster viral clearance and a higher IFN-&#955; to type I IFN ratio correlated with improved outcome for critically ill patients. Moreover, altered cytokine patterns in patients with COVID-19 correlated with longer hospitalization and higher incidence of critical disease and mortality compared to flu.

Between July 2020 and February 2021, we included symptomatic unvaccinated patients evaluated in the Emergency Department of our institution for suspected SARS-CoV-2. All patients had testing by real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction. The performance characteristics of five commercial enzymatic serology assays testing for different antibody isotypes were evaluated in a derivation cohort and the assay with the best performance was further tested on a validation cohort. Optimal cut-off points were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and further tested using logistic regression. Results. The derivation and validations cohorts included 72 and 319 patients, respectively. Based on its initial performance, the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Diagnostics) was further tested in the validation cohort.

In this article, we propose an automatic and unsupervised method for the detection and localization of the pleural line in LUS data based on the hidden Markov model and Viterbi Algorithm. The pleural line localization step is followed by a supervised classification procedure based on the support vector machine (SVM). The classifier evaluates the healthiness level of a patient and, if present, the severity of the pathology, i.e., the score value for each image of a given LUS acquisition. The experiments performed on a variety of LUS data acquired in Italian hospitals with both linear and convex probes highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of CLD in COVID-19 patients and to analyze the course of the infection, compared with patients with non-liver disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: this was a retrospective single center study of all patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from March 23rd to April 30th, 2020. Clinical and biochemical data of patients with and without CLD and COVID-19 were collected from the medical records. RESULT: four hundred and forty-seven patients with a SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR were included, 6.3 % had CLD; 69.7 % of patients with CLD were male, with a median age of 65.5 years and active alcohol consumption and smoking; 75 % had non-advanced liver fibrosis and most had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The hospital admission rate (92.9 % vs 47.7 %, p < 0.001), concomitant comorbidities (diabetes 38.5 vs 16.5 %, p = 0.011; obesity 30.8 vs 8.5 %, p = 0.033; cancer 23.1 vs 5 %, p = 0.027; and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 19.2 vs 9 %, p = 0.009) and concomitant antibiotics treatment (19.3 vs 5 %, p = 0.018) were higher in patients with CLD than in those without CLD. In-patient hospital mortality rates were similar in both groups (30.8 vs 19.6 %, p = 0.289). The presence of CLD was not associated with mortality (OR = 1.06; 95 % CI = 0.35-3.18; p = 0.924). However, patients with CLD and COVID-19 who were male, obese or under concomitant antibiotic treatment had the highest risk of mortality according to the univariate analysis. CONCLUSION: patients with CLD had a higher risk of hospital admission, with worse outcomes during the COVID-19 infection associated to other concomitant comorbidities and a suspicion of bacterial co-infection.","output":"Liver manifestations in COVID-19 and the influence of pre-existing liver disease in the course of the infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the effectiveness of virtual team learning for entrepreneurship competence in the Chinese higher education sector. Related research on the effectiveness of virtual team learning is sparse, especially in the area of entrepreneurship education. We assumed four hypotheses to analyze two sorts of relationships: one between input, respondents demographics or characteristics, and mediators, namely virtual teamwork, virtual taskwork, information and communication technology; the other between mediators and output, thus the effectiveness of entrepreneurship education. An online survey was carried out to collect respondents perceptions of virtual team learning in entrepreneurship education from teamwork, taskwork, and information and communication technology aspects, considering respondents demographics or characteristics. By explaining factors of the team process, the findings show that virtual teamwork, taskwork, and information and communication technology positively affect the entrepreneurial outcome of virtual team learning. Additionally, individual characteristics, including gender, education degree, education field, entrepreneurial family history, and prior entrepreneurial experience have different effects on three elements of virtual teams.

Our purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this suture for renorrhaphy during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN). PATIENTS AND METHODS Thirteen consecutive patients underwent LPN using V-Loc? 180 (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) suture, and a nonconsecutive control group of 24 patients, matched according to tumor size and R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score, underwent LPN using absorbable polyglactin suture. All 37 patients underwent LPN performed by a single surgeon. Perioperative and postoperative indicators of morbidity, estimated blood loss, and warm ischemia time (WIT) were compared between the groups. RESULTS Baseline characteristics including age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, tumor size, laterality, and R.E.N.A.L nephrometry score were identical between the groups. On multivariable analysis, there were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to operative time, estimated blood loss, transfusion rates, rates of surgical complications, and length of hospital stay. However, mean WIT was significantly shorter in the V-Loc group compared with the control group (24.55.3 minutes versus 31.98.9 minutes, P=.01). CONCLUSIONS The use of V-Loc sutures for renorrhaphy during LPN is safe and feasible and, in our series, significantly reduces WIT.

We examined the impact of integrative medicine (IM) intervention for HCPs working in isolated COVID-19 in-patient departments, addressing concerns and well-being. METHODS: HCPs working in 3 isolated COVID-19 in-patient departments underwent 40-min IM treatment sessions (including acupuncture, manual movement, and/or mindCbody modalities) provided by integrative oncology practitioners. The MYCAW (Measure Yourself Concerns and Well-being) questionnaire examined HCP concerns and free-text narratives following IM treatments. Data were qualitatively analyzed using ATLAS.Ti software for systematic coding. RESULTS: A total of 181 HCPs underwent 305 IM treatments. Narrative themes focused on physical symptoms (primarily pain and fatigue) and emotional concerns, including perceived communication barriers with patients, and reflections on well-being and insights following IM treatments. HCPs reported feeling a sense of relief which was likely related to the 3 main effects of the IM intervention: a sense of being cared for and treated; experiencing emotional, sometimes spiritual effects of the treatment; and the feeling of relaxation, combined with the relief of pain. Qualitative analysis identified clusters of emotional and spiritual-related keywords such as calming, release, relaxation, and disengagement following the first IM session (119 of 181 narratives, 65.7%).

Patients with hematologic malignancies appear to have a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease due to myelosuppression and lymphopenia. The first challenge, therefore, is how to continue to deliver effective, curative therapy to vulnerable patients and at the same time avoid exposing them, and their health care teams (HCT), to SARS-CoV-2. An additional challenge is the timely completion of the diagnostic and staging studies required to formulate appropriate treatment plans. Deferred procedures and avoidance of multiple trips to the surgical, diagnostic, and laboratory suites require same day consolidation of all procedures. With laboratory medicine absorbed by the need to deploy large scale COVID-testing, the availability of routine molecular tests is affected. Finally, we are increasingly faced with the challenge of making complex treatment decisions in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with aggressive but potentially curable blood cancers.

PARTICIPANTS: 53 healthcare workers who were or were not diagnosed with COVID-19. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers were initially not sufficiently psychologically prepared. Then they suffered from severe anxiety and apprehension during the peak stage, regardless of whether they were infected with SARS-CoV-2 or not. These negative emotions were exacerbated by four drivers, namely infection risk, supplies, isolation and media. As the epidemic gradually came under control, healthcare workers experienced less anxiety from these factors, but became concerned about their low financial status. To reduce anxiety, healthcare workers diverted their attention from the risk of infection through personal entertainment and religious beliefs and focused on treating their patients. Furthermore, assistance from other people, including colleagues, families, friends, patients and society, helped protect healthcare workers from anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Personal and social support can relieve healthcare workers anxiety to some extent during the different stages of an epidemic.

This manuscript describes the development and pilot feasibility testing of a motivational interviewing-derived communication training for caregivers of individuals with untreated or under-treated early course psychosis. Individuals with lived experience were consulted in the intervention development process. The training consisted of four 60-min sessions teaching the philosophy and basic skills of motivational interviewing as well as two brief practice calls.

Here we first examined the contribution of the NTD to infection and cell-cell fusion by constructing different VOC-based chimeric spikes bearing B.1617 lineage (Delta and Kappa variants) NTDs and generating spike pseudotyped lentivirus (PV). We found the Delta NTD on a Kappa or WT background increased spike S1/S2 cleavage efficiency and virus entry, specifically in Calu-3 lung cells and airway organoids, through use of TMPRSS2. We have previously shown Delta spike confers rapid cell-cell fusion kinetics; here we show that increased fusogenicity can be conferred to WT and Kappa variant spikes by transfer of the Delta NTD. Moving to contemporary variants, we found that BA.2 had higher entry efficiency in a range of cell types as compared to BA.1. BA.2 showed higher fusogenic activity than BA.1, but the BA.2 NTD could not confer higher fusion to BA.1 spike. There was low efficiency of TMPRSS2 usage by both BA.1 and BA.2, and chimeras of Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 spikes with a Delta NTD did not result in more efficient use of TMRPSS2 or cell-cell fusogenicity. We conclude that the NTD allosterically modulates S1/S2 cleavage and spike-mediated functions such as entry and cell-cell fusion in a spike context dependent manner, and allosteric interactions may be lost when combining regions from more distantly related spike proteins. These data may explain the lack of successful SARS-CoV-2 inter-variant recombinants bearing breakpoints within spike.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike N-Terminal Domain modulates TMPRSS2-dependent viral entry and fusogenicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: the quality of maternity services is an essential factor in reducing maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality, which remains extremely high in Africa. In Mozambique, maternal mortality rate is 451.6 deaths per 100,000 live births (2017). The reasons for this are complex, but one important factor to reduce this burden is to provide effective and efficient care, to improve institutional deliveries. To reduce maternal and newborn mortality rates in Nampula, researchers from Lrio University and the University of Saskatchewan, carried out an implementation research program, including various interventions such as training activities for health professionals in maternal and child health care. We planned a mid-project evaluation, to assess the trainings impact on the quality of services at Marrere Hospital Maternity. METHODS: quantitative pre-post study, carrying out two cross-sectional surveys about maternity service quality, one being conducted after five health professionals trainings and the other after six more trainings. The two surveys included samples of post-partum women in the maternity, calculated with a 10% margin error and 90% confidence interval for the first survey, and with a 7% margin error and 95% confidence interval for the second. The surveys were entered into REDCap and analysed to assess frequencies, percentages, mean and standard deviations. This research was approved by the Institutional Committees of Bioethics at Lrio University and at the University of Saskatchewan. RESULTS: one hundred and sixteen post-partum women were surveyed at the maternity, assessing standards of patient centred care during delivery labour. Most areas showed no improvement. Some positive improvements were delivering women were given the option to have a person of their choice accompany them during labour (75%), notably a traditional birth attendant (34%), and they had continuous support from a health professional (68%). But many shortcomings persisted in areas of privacy (33%) and confidentiality (57%). CONCLUSION: the quality of patient centred care at Marrere Hospital Maternity did not improve much with health professionals trainings.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in the Iranian adult population and surveyed 256 study participants from the first to the 30th of June 2020 with a web-based self-administered questionnaire. We used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to investigate the interrelationship between COVID-19 vaccination intention and perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived self-efficacy, and perceived response efficacy. RESULTS: SEM showed that perceived severity to COVID-19 (? = .17, p < .001), perceived self-efficacy about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (? = .26, p < .001), and the perceived response efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine (? = .70, p < .001) were significant predictors of vaccination intention. PMT accounted for 61.5% of the variance in intention to COVID-19 vaccination, and perceived response efficacy was the strongest predictor of COVID-19 vaccination intention. CONCLUSIONS: This study found the PMT constructs are useful in predicting COVID-19 vaccination intention.

Participants with a mental health condition reported lower wellbeing, as did younger groups, women and participants not in employment. To cope with restrictions, more participants engaged in healthier behaviours over unhealthy behaviours, and relaxing reduced the association between stressors and poor wellbeing. Some participants reported increasing alcohol and unhealthy dietary behaviours to cope with restrictions, however, these behaviours did not mitigate the impact of COVID-19 stressors and were instead negatively associated with wellbeing. Around half of participants helped neighbours during the pandemic, a behaviour positively associated with wellbeing particularly among older adults.

Although evidence suggests that children generally display mild symptoms, the size of the school-age population means the total impact of reopening schools is unclear. Here, we present work from mid-May 2020 that focused on the imminent opening of schools and consider what these results imply for future policy. We compared eight strategies for reopening primary and secondary schools in England. Modifying a transmission model fitted to UK SARS-CoV-2 data, we assessed how reopening schools affects contact patterns, anticipated secondary infections and the relative change in the reproduction number, R. We determined the associated public health impact and its sensitivity to changes in social distancing within the wider community. We predicted that reopening schools with half-sized classes or focused on younger children was unlikely to push R above one. Older children generally have more social contacts, so reopening secondary schools results in more cases than reopening primary schools, while reopening both could have pushed R above one in some regions. Reductions in community social distancing were found to outweigh and exacerbate any impacts of reopening. In particular, opening schools when the reproduction number R is already above one generates the largest increase in cases. Our work indicates that while any school reopening will result in increased mixing and infection amongst children and the wider population, reopening schools alone in June 2020 was unlikely to push R above one. Ultimately, reopening decisions are a difficult trade-off between epidemiological consequences and the emotional, educational and developmental needs of children. Into the future, there are difficult questions about what controls can be instigated such that schools can remain open if cases increase.

In order to fully appraise the available data, we performed a meta-analysis of 18 published studies. METHODS A thorough systematic search was conducted. The studies enrolling critically ill patients receiving thiamine supplementation was compared with the standard of care (SOC) group. Data was analyzed using RevMan 5.4. Clinical outcomes were pooled using Odds Ratio (OR) and mean differences. RESULT Eighteen studies (8 RCTs and 10 cohort studies) met the criteria for quantitative synthesis. In the analysis of RCTs, thiamine supplementation showed 42% lower odds of developing ICU delirium (OR 0.58, 95% CI, 0.34-0.98). A reduction in mortaliy was observed on performing fixed effect model analysis however, a level of statistical significance could not be reached on performing randon effect model analysis (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.04). Further sub-group analysis of 13 studies in patients with sepsis, there was no difference in mortality between the two groups (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.09). CONCLUSION Thiamine supplementation in critically ill patients showed a reduction in the incidence of ICU delirium among RCTs. However, there was no significant benefit in terms of overall mortality, and mortality in patients with sepsis.

The main protease (Mpro) is an attractive target for anti-COVID-19 agents. Unexpected difficulties have been encountered in the design of specific inhibitors. Here, by analyzing an ensemble of 30 000 SARS-CoV-2 Mpro conformations from crystallographic studies and molecular simulations, we show that small structural variations in the binding site dramatically impact ligand binding properties. Hence, traditional druggability indices fail to adequately discriminate between highly and poorly druggable conformations of the binding site. By performing 200 virtual screenings of compound libraries on selected protein structures, we redefine the proteins druggability as the consensus chemical space arising from the multiple conformations of the binding site formed upon ligand binding. This procedure revealed a unique SARS-CoV-2 Mpro blueprint that led to a definition of a specific structure-based pharmacophore. The latter explains the poor transferability of potent SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitors to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, despite the identical sequences of the active sites. Importantly, application of the pharmacophore predicted novel high affinity inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, that were validated by in vitro assays performed here and by a newly solved X-ray crystal structure. These results provide a strong basis for effective rational drug design campaigns against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and a new computational approach to screen protein targets with malleable binding sites.","output":"A Blueprint for High Affinity SARS-CoV-2 Mpro Inhibitors from Activity-Based Compound Library Screening Guided by Analysis of Protein Dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Restrictions of the freedom of movement of psychiatric patients in terms of mechanical restraint are regulated within the frame work of the Austrian law on involuntary commitment (Unterbringungsgesetz) to prevent endangerment of oneself or of others, provided that the application of these restrictions is proportionate.

Otherwise, the control effect will be much worse. This gives a theoretical interpretation to the practical experiences that the early quarantine and isolation strategies are critically important to control the outbreaks of epidemics.

The aim of this study was to assess the trends of medication use among COVID-19 patients. Methods: The study was conducted at a large university-affiliated hospital system. The study collected data from electronic medical records on all COVID-19 patients from March-November 2020. Data was also collected on medication usage for all patients in 2019. The association of death/hospice with each medication usage among inpatient COVID-19 patients was assessed using unadjusted logistic regression analyses. Results: Among all COVID-19 inpatient admissions, up to 50% of all hospitalized patients received Hydroxychloroquine and 7% overall during the study period. Hydroxychloroquine was not associated with death/hospice in inpatient COVID-19 patients. The use of Hydroxychloroquine was higher in the initial months of the pandemic coinciding with initial recommendations and increased news media coverage.

At Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust a programme of live, face-to-face music has been delivered by Wellspring Music on Healthcare of Older Peoples wards since 2015. In response to COVID-19, face-to-face delivery was stopped and a virtual method was proposed. This project investigated feasibility of virtual live music delivery. METHOD: Twelve, two-hour music therapy sessions were delivered by Wellspring Music to 41 patients over six weeks. The validated Arts-obs tool was used by staff members facilitating the sessions to record observations of patient mood, relaxation, and distraction from the ward setting on Likert scales. Patient, ward staff, and facilitator feedback were also recorded. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted by an Occupational Therapist. RESULTS: Data from the Arts-obs tool showed that thirty-two patients had an observable improvement in mood, seven had no mood change, and two presented a slightly worsened mood. Fourteen patients were fully engaged with the music therapy, sixteen were partially engaged, and eleven were focussed on the hospital environment. Thirty-four patients were visibly more relaxed, and seven showed no change. Patient feedback ranged from gratitude and expressions of enjoyment of the session to finding it too loud. Ward staff feedback ranged from appreciation to finding the music too distracting. The Wellspring musician and staff facilitators reported occasional loss of internet connection, and patients sometimes focusing on the facilitator rather than the musician.

The federal government has allowed states to seek approval for certain flexibilities to better serve this population, including increasing provider payment rates, allowing family members to be caregivers, and permitting case management entities to provide direct services. This study uses cross-sectional data to identify factors associated with states adopting these Medicaid flexibilities using multivariate methods. The results indicate that the factors associated with state adoption varied depending on the flexibility. The findings suggest that states increased provider payment rates in response to prevalence of COVID-19 within their state. As cases increase, states may come under pressure to increase provider rates further which may not be feasible because of budget constraints. The results also suggest that demand for and supply of services may be a factor in whether states allowed family members to be paid caregivers. States with a higher proportion of individuals aged 85 years and older were more likely to permit caregivers to be paid which may suggest that these states may not have enough providers to care for the population. Lastly, the results suggest that provider supply was associated with whether a state allowed case management entities to provide direct care services. States with fewer home health agencies were more likely to allow this flexibility.

INTERVENTIONS Data were collected via electronic survey with the use of a 50-item questionnaire in two different periods: prepandemic (October-December 2019) and during the second wave of COVID-19 (September-November 2020). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS During the prepandemic and pandemic periods, 1,065 (57.1% nurses) and 1,115 (58.5% nurses) HCPs completed the questionnaire, respectively. Higher MD levels were reported during COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among ICU nurses, when compared with the prepandemic period. Before COVID-19, physicians reported significantly higher levels of MD than ICU nurses (80.0 [interquartile range {IQR}, 40.0-135.0] vs 61.0 [IQR, 35.0-133.0]; p = 0.026). These differences disappeared during the pandemic period (81.0 [IQR, 39.0-138.5] vs 74.0 [IQR, 41.0-143.0]; p = 0.837). During the pandemic, younger and less experienced HCPs working in hospital areas that were converted in ICU or in ICUs with multiple occupancy rooms reported higher MD levels. In addition, HCPs who were off work for psychologic burden reported higher MD levels (108.0 [IQR, 66.0-139.0] vs 76.0 [IQR, 40.0-141.0]; p < 0.05). In the prepandemic period, patient-level root causes were the most morally distressing for nurses, whereas physicians reported higher MD on system-level root causes. During the pandemic, both groups reported higher MD on system-level root causes. During COVID-19, significantly more HCPs considered leaving their job due to MD.

The RT-LAMP assay demonstrated exceptionally higher sensitivity compared to that of RT-PCR, with a detection limit of 0.1 PFU. The specificities of the selected primer sets were established by cross-reactivity studies with other closely related members of the JEV serocomplex as well as by evaluation of healthy human volunteers. The comparative evaluation of the RT-LAMP assay for clinical diagnosis with a limited number of patient cerebrospinal fluid samples revealed 85% concordance with conventional RT-PCR, with a sensitivity and a specificity of 100% and 86%, respectively. The concentration of virus in most of the clinical samples was 10(2) to 10(5) PFU/ml, as determined from the standard curve based on the time of positivity in the samples. In addition, the monitoring of gene amplification can also be visualized with the naked eye by using SYBR green I fluorescent dye. Thus, due to easy operation without a requirement of sophisticated equipment and skilled personnel, the RT-LAMP assay reported here is a valuable tool for the rapid and real-time detection of JEV not only by well-equipped laboratories but also by peripheral diagnostic laboratories with limited financial resources in developing countries.","output":"Development and evaluation of reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for rapid and real-time detection of Japanese encephalitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During a global pandemic, it is critical that the public is able to rapidly acquire new and accurate health information. The internet is a major source of health information. eHealth literacy is the ability of individuals to find, assess, and use health information available on the internet. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to assess coronavirus-related eHealth literacy and examine the relationship between eHealth literacy and COVID-19?related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs). METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey of a representative sample of 1074 US adults. We adapted the 8-item eHealth Literacy Scale to develop the Coronavirus-Related eHealth Literacy Scale (CoV-eHEALS) to measure COVID-19?related knowledge, conspiracy beliefs, and adherence to protective behaviors (eg, wearing facial masks and social distancing). Our analyses identified sociodemographic associations with the participants CoV-eHEALS scores and an association between the CoV-eHEALS measure and COVID-19 KAPs. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the adapted CoV-eHEALS measure was high (Cronbach =.92). The mean score for the CoV-eHEALS was 29.0 (SD 6.1). A total of 29% (306/1074) of the survey participants were classified as having low coronavirus-related eHealth literacy (CoV-eHEALS score <26). Independent associations were found between CoV-eHEALS scores and ethnicity (standardized =C.083, P=.016 for Black participants) and education level (standardized =C.151, P=.001 for participants with high-school education or lower). Controlling for demographic characteristics, CoV-eHEALS scores demonstrated positive independent associations with knowledge (standardized =.168, P<.001) and adherence to protective behaviors (standardized =.241, P<.001) and a negative association with conspiracy beliefs (standardized =C.082, P=.009). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an estimate of coronavirus-related eHealth literacy among US adults. Our findings suggest that a substantial proportion of US adults have low coronavirus-related eHealth literacy and are thus at a greater risk of lower and less-protective COVID-19 KAPs. These findings highlight the need to assess and address eHealth literacy as part of COVID-19 control efforts. Potential strategies include improving the quality of health information about COVID-19 available on the internet, assisting or simplifying web-based search for information about COVID-19, and training to improve general or coronavirus-specific search skills.","output":"Relationship Between Coronavirus-Related eHealth Literacy and COVID-19 Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices among US Adults: Web-Based Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The chronic neurological aspects of traumatic brain injury, post\\\\stroke syndromes, long COVID\\\\19, persistent Lyme disease, and influenza encephalopathy having close pathophysiological parallels that warrant being investigated in an integrated manner.

In Portugal, an increase in mortality beyond that attributed solely to COVID-19 was observed. We aimed to realize how COVID-19 has changed the activity of our Interventional Cardiology Unit. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed all patients submitted to any interventional procedure in 2019 and 2020 in our hospital. A total of 7621 patients and 9163 procedures were evaluated. The mean weekly numbers of coronarography, angioplasty, right heart catheterization and structural heart intervention during 2019 were assessed and were compared with the first COVID-19 wave (comprising March and April 2020) and the second COVID-19 wave (including the time period from October to end of December 2020). RESULTS: Mean age was 65.216.6 years with 72% being male. In the first COVID-19 wave there was a significant reduction in the mean weekly numbers of all procedures, with a 64% decline in coronarographies (30.929.3 vs 87.212.9, P<0.001), 48% in angiographies (15.710.9 vs 30.25.7, P=0.004), 51% in right heart catheterizations (5.35.9 vs 10.94.5, P=0.002) and 57% in structural heart interventions (1.11.9 vs 2.62, P=0.044). Although there was an evident recovery in activity (figure 1), comparing to 2019, the second wave also showed a significant lower number of procedures, with 24% fewer coronarographies (66.620.6 vs 87.212.9, P=0.003) and 13% fewer angiographies (26.47.6 vs 30.25.7, P=0.004). Contrariwise, in the second wave there was no difference in the number of right heart catheterizations (7.36.1 vs 10.94.5, P=0.055) or structural heart interventions (1.61.6 vs 2.62, P=0.106). CONCLUSIONS: In our Interventional Cardiology Unit, COVID-19 led to a significant reduction of procedures in the first and second pandemic waves. The effect on the increase in morbidity and mortality has yet to be determined. Health authorities should focus attention in defining measures to amend the consequences of this documented activity reduction.

We aimed to identify countries with emerging success stories from whom policymakers might draw important lessons. Methods: We developed a process to first include countries with large enough populations that results were unlikely to be due to chance, that had sufficient cases for response mechanisms to be tested, and that shared the necessary publicly available data. Within these countries, we looked at indicators suggesting success in terms of detecting disease, containing the outbreak, and treating those who were unwell. To support comparability, we measured indicators per capita (per million) and across time. We then used the indicators to identify three countries with emerging success stories to include some diversity in global region, population demographics and form of government. Results: We identified 66 countries that met our inclusion criteria on 18 th May 2020. Several of these countries had indicators of success against the set indicators at different times in the outbreak. Vietnam had high levels of testing and successful containment with no deaths reported. South Korea had high levels of testing early in the outbreak, supporting containment. Germany had high levels of sustained testing and slower increases in cases and deaths than seen in other comparable settings. Conclusions: At the time of our assessment, Vietnam and South Korea were able to contain the outbreak of COVID-19 and avoid the exponential growth in cases seen elsewhere. Germany had more cases and deaths, but was nevertheless able to contain and mitigate the outbreak.

These included a national 'initial' lockdown (March-May), and 'ongoing' lockdown (July-November) for metropolitan Victorian residents only. Australia's experience offers an opportunity to assess impacts of lockdown on families with children, in the relative absence of disease morbidity and mortality. This study (1) described the experience of initial lockdown and (2) evaluated the impact of ongoing lockdown, on family finances and mental health. Methods: Data were drawn from the June and September 2020 Royal Children's Hospital National Child Health Polls. Caregivers of children from the states of Victoria and New South Wales reported on job/income loss; material deprivation (inability to pay for essential items); income-poverty; mental health (Kessler-6); impact on caregiver/child mental health; and caregiver/child coping. Data from N=1207/902 caregivers in June/September were analyzed; Aim (1) with weighted descriptives; Aim (2) with Difference-in-Difference adjusted linear regression models (New South Wales provided the comparator). Results: Following initial lockdown, one-quarter of families reported job/income loss; one-third reported material deprivation. Negative impacts on mental health were reported for half the caregivers and one-third of children. Few caregivers or children had difficulties coping. During Victoria's ongoing lockdown, job/income loss increased by 11% (95%CI: 3-18%); Kessler-6 poor mental health by 6% (95%CI: 0.3-12%) and negative mental health impacts by 12% for caregivers (95%CI: 6-23%) and 14% for children (95%CI: 4-20%). Female (versus male) caregivers, metropolitan (versus regional/rural) families, and families with elementary school-aged children (versus pre-/high-school) were most affected. Conclusions: Ongoing lockdown had negative impacts on mental health, employment, and income, but not deprivation or poverty, likely because of the government income supplements introduced early in the pandemic.

We develop the concept of the HIC as a novel descriptive and analytical lens for the study of contemporary global governance. The core structural difference between HICs and regime complexes is the greater diversity of institutional forms within HICs. Because of that diversity, HICs operate differently than regime complexes in two significant ways: (1) HICs exhibit relatively greater functional differentiation among their component institutions, and hence suffer from relatively fewer overlapping claims to authority; and (2) HICs exhibit greater informal hierarchy among their component institutions, and hence benefit from greater ordering. Both are systemic features. HICs have characteristic governance benefits: they offer good substantive fit for multi-faceted governance problems and good political fit for the preferences of diverse constituents; constrain conflictive cross-institutional strategies; and are conducive to mechanisms of coordination, which enhance substantive coherence. Yet HICs also pose characteristic governance risks: individual institutions may take on aspects of problems for which they are ill-suited; multiple institutions may create confusion; HICs can amplify conflict and contestation rather than constraining them; and the soft institutions within HICs can reduce the focality of incumbent treaties and intergovernmental organizations and forestall the establishment of new ones.

The time to positivity for which SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in these positive saliva samples was proportional to the real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR cycle threshold (CT), with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in as little as 05:43 (CT 21.08), 07:59 (CT 24.47) and 08:35 (CT 25.27) minutes, respectively. The highest CT where direct RT-LAMP detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 31.39 corresponding to a 1 in 40 dilution of a positive saliva sample (1:1 in MucolyseTM) with a starting CT of 25.27. When RT-LAMP was performed on pools of SARS-CoV-2 negative saliva samples spiked with whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, RNA was detected at dilutions spanning 1 in 5 to 1 in 160 representing CTs spanning 22.49-26.43.

This study surveyed current strategies for the prevention of the spread of COVID-19 in medical institutions. METHODS: Upon systematic review of the guidelines at the national level, 14 key topics were selected. Six hospitals were provided an open survey that assessed their responses to these topics between August 11 and 25, 2020. Using these data, an online questionnaire was developed and sent to the infection control teams of 46 hospitals in South Korea. The survey was conducted between January 31, 2021, and February 20, 2021. RESULTS: All 46 hospitals responded to the survey, and 24 hospitals (52.2%) had treated 100 or more cases of COVID-19. All hospitals operated screening clinics, and the criteria were respiratory symptoms (100%), fever (97.8%), and epidemiological association (93.5%). It was found that 89.1% (41/46) of hospitals allowed symptomatic patients to visit their general outpatient clinics if fever or respiratory symptoms were not associated with COVID-19. Most hospitals (87.2%; 34/39) conducted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for all hospitalized patients. Moreover, 76.1% (35/46) of hospitals implemented preemptive isolation policies for hospitalized patients, of which 97.1% (34/35) were released from isolation after a single negative PCR test. A little over half of the hospitals (58.7%; 27/46) treated patients that met the national criteria for release from isolation but consistently had positive PCR results. Of these hospitals, 63% (17/27) used N95/KF94 masks, and 40.7% (11/27) used surgical masks without other personal protective equipment for treating them. Most hospitals (76.9%; 20/26) accommodated them in shared rooms when the cycle threshold value of the PCR test was more than a certain value (34.6%; 9/26), or after a certain period that satisfied the national criteria (26.9%; 7/26). Finally, 76.1% (35/46) of hospitals performed emergency procedures or operations on suspected patients. Table 1.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP) and Wanfang (up to October 2020). Studies in languages other than English and Chinese were excluded. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the impact of dexmedetomidine on emergence agitation (EA), the need for postoperative rescue analgesics, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and other adverse events in paediatric patients during CLP repair. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The quality of evidence was assessed by using the Cochrane Review Methods and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Data were screened, extracted and assessed by two independent authors. Outcomes were reported as a risk ratio (RR) with a 95% CI. A random-effect model was used when heterogeneity was detected. RESULTS: Thirteen studies including 1040 children met the inclusion criteria. The incidence of EA was significantly decreased in the dexmedetomidine group (RR, 0.19; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.36; p<0.00001; I2=56%) as compared with the control group. Paediatric patients receiving dexmedetomidine had lower postoperative analgesic requirements (RR, 0.27; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.73; p=0.01; I2=84%) and a lower incidence of respiratory adverse events (RR, 0.49; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.78; p=0.003; I2=0%). There were no significant differences in the risk of PONV and cardiovascular adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: There was a lack of high-quality studies in this field. Perioperative administration of dexmedetomidine reduced the need for postoperative rescue analgesics and the incidence of EA in children without side effects undergoing CLP repair.

The traditional view of these elements is that of local RNA structures. This perspective, however, is changing due to increasing discoveries of functional viral RNA elements that are formed by long-range RNACRNA interactions, often spanning thousands of nucleotides. The plus-strand RNA genomes of tombusviruses exemplify this concept by possessing different long-range RNACRNA interactions that regulate both viral translation and transcription. Here we report that a third fundamental tombusvirus process, viral genome replication, requires a long-range RNACbased interaction spanning 3000 nts. In vivo and in vitro analyses suggest that the discontinuous RNA platform formed by the interaction facilitates efficient assembly of the viral RNA replicase. This finding has allowed us to build an integrated model for the role of global RNA structure in regulating the reproduction of a eukaryotic RNA virus, and the insights gained have extended our understanding of the multifunctional nature of viral RNA genomes.","output":"A Discontinuous RNA Platform Mediates RNA Virus Replication: Building an Integrated Model for RNACbased Regulation of Viral Processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the dynamic changes observed in serum levels of interleukins (ILs), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS Sixty-one cases of SARS were classified into the following categories according to the duration from the onset of illness to the time blood was drawn: 3-7 day group, 8-14 day group and over 14 day group. Forty-four healthy individuals served as the control. Serum levels of ILs, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 were measured in all cases. Serum antibodies to SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were measured only in SARS cases. RESULTS The mean concentration of serum IL-6 in SARS patients did not differ from the control group in 3-7 day group and 8-14 day group, but became significantly higher in over 14 day group as compared to the control group, 3-7 day group and 8-14 day group (P < 0.01). The mean concentration of serum IL-8 in SARS patients did not differ from the control group in 3-7 day group, were significantly higher than the control group in 8-14 days group and in over 14 day group (P < 0.05) and significantly higher in over 14 day group than in 3-7 day group and 8-14 day group (P < 0.01). The mean concentration of IL-16 and TNF-alpha in all groups of SARS was higher than that of the control group, but it was the highest in over 14 day group (P < 0.01). SARS patients experienced higher concentration of serum IL-13 as compared to controls in 3-7 day group (P < 0.01), but it returned to normal levels in 8-14 day group and the over 14 day group. The mean concentration of serum IL-18 in SARS patients was significantly lower than that of the control group during all groups of SARS patients (P < 0.05); The mean concentration of TGF-beta1 in all groups of SARS patients was higher than that of the control group. Although TGF-beta1 in sera decreased in over 14 day group, the average was still higher than that of the control group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Proinflammatory cytokines and TGF-beta1 were elevated during the early phase of SARS, a phenomenon which may be associated with lung infiltration and proliferation. Concurrently, the mean concentration of serum IL-13 decreased gradually and the mean concentration of serum IL-18 level in SARS patients was lower than that of the control group during the whole disease course.

Classical assimilation theory has studied such mixed migrant-non-migrant unions mainly with a focus on the members of ethnic minorities. However, this perspective neglects the question of the social consequences of exogamy for the members of the majority group. We aim to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the association of being in a mixed union and the employment patterns of the couple. Our theoretical considerations and working hypotheses are derived from modernization theories, welfare state and labor market theories, gender studies, and social boundary-crossing frameworks. Drawing on the scientific use file of the German Microcensus of 2013, our sample consists of 44,499 non-migrant men (about 7% of whom are in a mixed union with a migrant) and 43,722 non-migrant women (about 5% of whom are in a mixed union). We estimate multinomial logistic regression models. We conclude that the persistent disadvantage for immigrants on the labor market in Germany shapes the gendered employment patterns of their unions, which, in turn, affect the members of the majority population. For non-migrant men, exogamy is associated with a re-traditionalization of employment patterns, whereby a man is more likely to be the main earner if he is in an exogamous union than if he is in an endogamous union. For non-migrant women, by contrast, we find evidence of a role reversal in exogamous unions, whereby the woman is more likely to be the main earner.","output":"Crossing Social Boundaries in an Immigration Context: Exogamy and Gendered Employment Patterns in Unions in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the surge of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections in March and April 2020, many skilled-nursing facilities in the Boston area closed to COVID-19 post-acute admissions because of infection control concerns and staffing shortages.

Our research examines this phenomenon, termed unanswered support. Drawing from Self-Determination Theory, we expected that lower need satisfaction would mediate the negative relationship between unanswered support and its predicted outcomes (well-being, performance, and relational outcomes). We also expected that attributions for the lack of support would moderate these indirect effects. In Study 1, 280 employees in the United Kingdom took part in a quasi-experimental field study, where we examined the nature of the relationships between the variables. In Study 2, we recruited 267 undergraduate students at an Australian university and experimentally manipulated unanswered support during a work simulation to investigate its causal effects. Across both studies, unanswered support indirectly affected the outcomes through lower need satisfaction. There was minimal evidence for the hypothesized moderating role of attributions. Unanswered supervisor support appears to reduce employees' psychological need satisfaction, negatively impacting how they feel, behave, and connect with others. Our research highlights the importance of leaders answering requests for support, and the findings have implications for employees, supervisors, and organizations.

Reactogenicity was higher with Ad26.COV2.S than with placebo but was generally mild to moderate and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the two groups. Three deaths occurred in the vaccine group (none were Covid-19-related), and 16 in the placebo group (5 were Covid-19-related). CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S protected against symptomatic Covid-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and was effective against severe-critical disease, including hospitalization and death.

Mathematical models of plant-pollinator interactions can help understand key determinants in pollination success. However, most previous models have not addressed pollinator behavior and plant biology combined. Information generated from such a model can inform optimal design of crop orchards and effective utilization of managed pollinators like western honey bees (Apis mellifera), and help generate hypotheses about the effects of management practices and cultivar selection. We expect that the number of honey bees per flower and male to female flower ratio will influence fruit yield. To test the relative importance of these effects, both singly and simultaneously, we utilized a delay differential equation model combined with Latin hypercube sampling for sensitivity analysis. Empirical data obtained from historical records and collected in kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis) orchards in New Zealand were used to parameterize the model. We found that, at realistic bee densities, the optimal orchard had 65-75% female flowers, and the most benefit was gained from the first 6-8 bees/1000 flowers, with diminishing returns thereafter. While bee density significantly impacted fruit production, plant-based parameters-flower density and male:female flower ratio-were the most influential. The predictive model provides strategies for improving crop management, such as choosing cultivars which have their peak bloom on the same day, increasing the number of flowers with approximately 70% female flowers in the orchard, and placing enough hives to maintain more than 6 bees per 1000 flowers to optimize yield.","output":"Orchard layout and plant traits influence fruit yield more strongly than pollinator behaviour and density in a dioecious crop"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The COVID-19 pandemic and associated 'lockdown' confinement restrictions have resulted in multiple challenges for those living with eating disorders. This qualitative study aimed to examine the lived, psychosocial experiences of individuals with anorexia nervosa from within COVID-19 'lockdown' confinement. METHODS Audio-recorded semi -structured interviews were conducted online during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic during confinement with a purposive sample of 12 participants who identified as having Anorexia Nervosa. Interviews were transcribed and anonymous data analysed using Thematic Analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). RESULTS Three key themes with six contributory subthemes were identified. Key themes were: loss of control, support during confinement, and time of reflection on recovery. Theme content varied according to stage of recovery and current clinical management. Availability of 'safe' foods, increases in compensatory exercise and symptomology, and enhanced opportunities for \\"secrecy\\" were described. CONCLUSIONS These findings provide a unique insight for a vulnerable group from within COVID-19 confinement. The data demonstrated that the impact for individuals with anorexia nervosa has been broadly negative, and participants voiced concerns over the long-term effects of the pandemic on their recovery. The findings highlight the risks of tele-health support and an important role for health professionals in enhancing targeted support during, and after confinement.","output":"Narratives from within 'lockdown': A qualitative exploration of the impact of COVID-19 confinement on individuals with anorexia nervosa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are frequent and could be associated with improved response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).

However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. AIM: To explore the mediating role of nutritional status in the relationship between sarcopenia and cognitive impairment. METHODS: Three thousand eight hundred and ten participants (mean age 61.94  8.01 years) from the West China Health and Aging Trend (WCHAT) study were included. We defined sarcopenia using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019 criteria. Cognitive status and nutritional status were measured using the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) and the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form (MNA-SF). Relationships between sarcopenia, nutritional status, and cognitive function were explored using multiple linear regression. Two mediation models were generated to examine whether nutritional status mediates the association between sarcopenia and cognitive function using PROCESS macro version 3.5. RESULTS: The study involved 3147 (82.6%) non-sarcopenic, 387 (10.2%) sarcopenic, and 276 (7.2%) severely sarcopenic individuals. In mediation model 1, sarcopenia ( = 0.208, 95% CI 0.072 to 0.344, P = 0.0028) was significantly associated with cognitive impairment, and nutritional status mediated this association (indirect effect = 0.162, bootstrap 95% CI 0.116 to 0.212).

Thus, we report strategies and preliminary results in LT during the peak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic from a single center in France. Our strategy to reorganize the transplant program included 4 main steps: optimization of available resources, especially intensive care unit capacity; multidisciplinary risk stratification of LT candidates on the waiting list; implementation of a systematic SARS-CoV-2 screening strategy prior to transplantation; and definition of optimal recipient-donor matching. After implementation of these 4 steps, we performed 10 successful LTs during the peak of the pandemic with a short median intensive care unit stay (2.5 days), benchmark posttransplant morbidity, and no occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during follow-up.

We recently described a way to induce a potent SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T immune response through the generation of engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) emerging from muscle cells. This method relies on intramuscular injection of DNA vectors expressing different SARS-CoV-2 antigens fused at their N-terminus with Nefmut protein, i.e., a very efficient EV-anchoring protein. However, quality, tissue distribution, and efficacy of these SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells remained uninvestigated. To fill the gaps, antigen-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes induced by the immunization through the Nefmut-based method were characterized in terms of their polyfunctionality and localization at lung airways, i.e., the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that injection of vectors expressing Nefmut/S1 and Nefmut/N generated polyfunctional CD8+ T lymphocytes in both spleens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs). When immunized mice were infected with 4.4 lethal doses 50% of SARS-CoV-2, all S1-immunized mice succumbed, whereas those developing the highest percentages of N-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes resisted the lethal challenge.

As the death toll rises, scientists begin to fall toward new avenues of research, with novelty showing itself to be an incredible and so far, underrated resource. In this case, the use of biosurfactants in dealing with this pandemic justifies extensive study with their potential applications being in the prevention of viral spread; dealing with the symptoms that develop after the incubation period; directly targeting viral infected cells and preventing the spread of the virus throughout the host, all in addition to also acting as potential drug delivery systems and cleaning agents. This extensive avenue of biosurfactants owes to the simplicity in their amphiphilic structure which permits them to interact directly with the lipid membrane of the coronavirus, in a way which wouldn't be of significant threat to the host. Although it could possibly interact and affect the virus, it could also affect human internal organs/cells by interacting with lipid membrane, if (biosurfactant is) ingested, and it still needs further studies in human models. The structure of the coronavirus, in this case SARS-CoV-2, is detrimentally dependent on the integrity of its lipid membrane which encloses its vital proteins and RNA. Biosurfactants possess the innate ability to threaten this membrane, a result of their own hydrophobic domains across their amphiphilic structure.

We compared the characteristics, postoperative outcomes, and pathologic results for the patients who underwent RPLS and for the patients who underwent MPLS. We also compared the clinical outcomes of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) and 3-port laparoscopic surgery. RESULTS Of the 115 patients in the RPLS group, 59 underwent SILS and 56 underwent 3-port laparoscopic surgery. The MPLS group included 490 patients. The RPLS group had shorter operating time (137.4  43.2 minutes vs. 155.5  47.9 minutes, P < 0.001) and shorter incision length (5.3  2.2 cm vs. 7.8  1.2 cm, P < 0.001) than the MPLS group. In analyses of SILS and 3-port laparoscopic surgery, the SILS group showed younger age, longer operating time, and shorter incision length than the 3-port surgery group and exhibited a more advanced T stage, more lymphatic invasion, and larger tumor size.

A process of coevolution has probably involved exchanges of genetic information between cells and viruses for long evolutionary periods. From this point of view present-day viruses show flexibility in receptor usage and a capacity to alter through mutation their receptor recognition specificity. It is possible that for the complex DNA viruses, due to a likely limited tolerance to generalized high mutation rates, modifications in receptor specificity will be less frequent than for RNA viruses, albeit with similar biological consequences once they occur. It is found that different receptors, or allelic forms of one receptor, may be used with different efficiency and receptor affinities are probably modified by mutation and selection. Receptor abundance and its affinity for a virus may modulate not only the efficiency of infection, but also the capacity of the virus to diffuse toward other sites of the organism.

Women reporting at least monthly engagement in formal social activities were more likely to report emotional mistreatment (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.33). Among men, monthly organized meeting attendance was associated with increased odds of emotional mistreatment (AOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01-1.93). Weekly informal socializing was inversely associated with emotional mistreatment (AOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44-0.78) and financial mistreatment (AOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42-0.85) among women. CONCLUSION In this national cohort, older adults who were frequently engaged in formal social activities reported similar or higher levels of mistreatment than those with less frequent organized social participation. Older women with regular informal contact with family or friends were less likely to report some kinds of mistreatment. Strategies for detecting and mitigating elder mistreatment should consider differences in patterns of formal and informal social participation and their potential contribution to mistreatment risk.","output":"Formal and informal social participation and elder mistreatment in a national sample of older adults."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus Corona atau Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) adalah jenis virus yang menyerang sistem pernapasan dan kekebalan tubuh manusia.

Bacteria use these proteins to actively transport antibiotics to the extracellular medium, preventing the pharmacological action of these drugs. This study aimed to evaluate in vitro the antibacterial activity of 1,8-naphthyridines sulfonamides as well as its ability to inhibit efflux systems of Staphylococcus aureus strains expressing different levels of the NorA efflux pump. METHODS: The broth microdilution test was performed to assess antibacterial activity. Efflux pump inhibition was evaluated in silico by molecular docking and in vitro,by fluorometric tests, and determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The MIC was determined in the association between 1,8-naphthyridine and norfloxacin or ethidium bromide. RESULTS: The 1,8-naphthyridines did not show direct antibacterial activity. In contrast, they effectively reduced the MIC of multidrug-resistant bacteria by associating with norfloxacin and ethidium bromide, in addition to increasing the fluorescence emission of this. The in silico analysis addressing the binding between NorA and 1,8-naphthyridines suggests that hydrogen bonds and hydrophilic interactions represent the interactions with the most favorable binding energy, corroborating the experimental data. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our data suggest that 1,8-naphthyridines sulfonamides inhibit bacterial resistance through molecular mechanisms associated with inhibition of the NorA efflux pump in S. aureus strains.","output":"The 1,8-naphthyridines sulfonamides are NorA efflux pump inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] COVID-19 remains an ongoing issue across the globe, highlighting the need for a rapid, selective, and accurate sensor for SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants. The chemical specificity and signal amplification of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) could be advantageous for developing a quantitative assay for SARS-CoV-2 with improved speed and accuracy over current testing methods. Here, we have tackled the challenges associated with SERS detection of viruses. As viruses are large, multicomponent species, they can yield different SERS signals, but also other abundant biomolecules present in the sample can generate undesired signals. To improve selectivity in complex biological environments, we have employed peptides as capture probes for viral proteins and developed an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mimetic peptide-based SERS sensor for SARS-CoV-2. The unique vibrational signature of the spike protein bound to the peptide-modified surface is identified and used to construct a multivariate calibration model for quantification. The sensor demonstrates a 300 nM limit of detection and high selectivity in the presence of excess bovine serum albumin. This work provides the basis for designing a SERS-based assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 as well as engineering SERS biosensors for other viruses in the future.","output":"Catching COVID: Engineering Peptide-Modified Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy Sensors for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although mortality due to COVID-19 is, for the most part, robustly tracked, its indirect effect at the population level through lockdown, lifestyle changes, and reorganisation of health-care systems has not been evaluated. We aimed to assess the incidence and outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in an urban region during the pandemic, compared with non-pandemic periods. METHODS: We did a population-based, observational study using data for non-traumatic OHCA (N=30a768), systematically collected since May 15, 2011, in Paris and its suburbs, France, using the Paris Fire Brigade database, together with in-hospital data. We evaluated OHCA incidence and outcomes over a 6-week period during the pandemic in adult inhabitants of the study area. FINDINGS: Comparing the 521 OHCAs of the pandemic period (March 16 to April 26, 2020) to the mean of the 3052 total of the same weeks in the non-pandemic period (weeks 12-17, 2012-19), the maximum weekly OHCA incidence increased from 1342 (95% CI 1277-1407) to 2664 (2572-2753) per million inhabitants (p<00001), before returning to normal in the final weeks of the pandemic period. Although patient demographics did not change substantially during the pandemic compared with the non-pandemic period (mean age 697 years [SD 17] vs 685 [18], 334 males [644%] vs 1826 [599%]), there was a higher rate of OHCA at home (460 [902%] vs 2336 [768%]; p<00001), less bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (239 [478%] vs 1165 [639%]; p<00001) and shockable rhythm (46 [92%] vs 472 [191%]; p<00001), and longer delays to intervention (median 104 min [IQR 84-138] vs 94 min [79-126]; p<00001). The proportion of patients who had an OHCA and were admitted alive decreased from 228% to 128% (p<00001) in the pandemic period. After adjustment for potential confounders, the pandemic period remained significantly associated with lower survival rate at hospital admission (odds ratio 036, 95% CI 024-052; p<00001). COVID-19 infection, confirmed or suspected, accounted for approximately a third of the increase in OHCA incidence during the pandemic. INTERPRETATION: A transient two-times increase in OHCA incidence, coupled with a reduction in survival, was observed during the specified time period of the pandemic when compared with the equivalent time period in previous years with no pandemic. Although this result might be partly related to COVID-19 infections, indirect effects associated with lockdown and adjustment of health-care services to the pandemic are probable. Therefore, these factors should be taken into account when considering mortality data and public health strategies.

Recognizing this, the Global Initiative for Asthma neither recommends SABA monotherapy nor regards this formulation as a preferred reliever. Many health systems and healthcare professionals (HCPs) experience practical issues in implementing guidelines. Clear quality standards can drive improvements in asthma care and encourage implementation of global and national medical guidelines. METHODS: A steering group of global asthma experts came together between May and September 2019 to develop quality statements codifying the minimum elements of good quality asthma care. These statements were either evidence based (when robust evidence was available) or reflected a consensus based on clinical expertise and experience of the group. RESULTS: The quality statements (and associated essential criteria) developed emphasize key elements concerning (1) objective diagnosis specific to individual symptoms, (2) treatment appropriate to the long-term management of asthma as an inflammatory disease, consistent with evidence-based recommendations, (3) controlled dispensing of SABA canisters and monitoring to prevent overuse, (4) regular review of patients after treatment initiation or change, and (5) follow-up of patients in primary care after treatment for an exacerbation in a hospital or an emergency department. CONCLUSIONS: The steering group proposes quality statements that national and local clinical groups can implement as quantitative quality standards that are appropriate to their local circumstances, including during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. By translating these statements into locally relevant quality standards, primary care physicians and HCPs can encourage optimal management and reduce preventable healthcare interactions. The evidence-based evolution of care encapsulated in these statements will further engender high-quality, patient-centered holistic management that addresses asthma as an inflammatory disease. In particular, the statements empower self-management by patients and encourage health-promoting behaviors, which are essential to reduce exacerbations, the primary goal of asthma management.

However, data regarding persistent cardiac involvement in patients who recovered from COVID-19 are limited. Our goal is to further explore the sustained impact of COVID-19 during follow-up, focusing on the cardiac involvement in the recovered patients. Methods: In this prospective observational follow-up study, we enrolled a total of 40 COVID-19 patients (20 with and 20 without cardiac injury during hospitalization) who were discharged from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University for more than 6 months, and 27 patients (13 with and 14 without cardiac injury during hospitalization) were finally included in the analysis. Clinical information including self-reported symptoms, medications, laboratory findings, Short Form 36-item scores, 6-min walk test, clinical events, electrocardiogram assessment, echocardiography measurement, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was collected and analyzed. Results: Among 27 patients finally included, none of patients reported any obvious cardiopulmonary symptoms at the 6-month follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences in terms of the quality of life and exercise capacity between the patients with and without cardiac injury. No significant abnormalities were detected in electrocardiogram manifestations in both groups, except for nonspecific ST-T changes, premature beats, sinus tachycardia/bradycardia, PR interval prolongation, and bundle-branch block. All patients showed normal cardiac structure and function, without any statistical differences between patients with and without cardiac injury by echocardiography. Compared with patients without cardiac injury, patients with cardiac injury exhibited a significantly higher positive proportion in late gadolinium enhancement sequences [7/13 (53.8%) vs. 1/14 (7.1%), p = 0.013], accompanied by the elevation of circulating ST2 level [median (interquartile range) = 16.6 (12.1, 22.5) vs. 12.5 (9.5, 16.7);p = 0.044]. Patients with cardiac injury presented higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, high-sensitivity troponin I, lactate dehydrogenase, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide than those without cardiac injury, although these indexes were within the normal range for all recovered patients at the 6-month follow-up. Among patients with cardiac injury, patients with positive late gadolinium enhancement presented higher cardiac biomarker (high-sensitivity troponin I) and inflammatory factor (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) on admission than the late gadolinium enhancement-negative subgroup. Conclusions: Our preliminary 6-month follow-up study with a limited number of patients revealed persistent cardiac involvement in 29.6% (8/27) of recovered patients from COVID-19 after discharge. Patients with cardiac injury during hospitalization were more prone to develop cardiac fibrosis during their recovery. Among patients with cardiac injury, those with relatively higher cardiac biomarkers and inflammatory factors on admission appeared more likely to have cardiac involvement in the convalescence phase.","output":"Cardiac Involvement in Recovered Patients From COVID-19: A Preliminary 6-Month Follow-Up Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of the national emergency triggered by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic, government\\\\mandated public health directives have drastically changed not only social norms but also the practice of oncologic medicine.

This study aimed to document the patterns of perception of health personnel toward the threat of an influenza pandemic. METHODS: Q methodology was applied to a set of 385 health personnel in charge of influenza pandemic preparedness in the three southernmost provinces of Thailand. Subjects were asked to rank 33 statements about various issues of influenza pandemic according to a pre-designed score sheet having a quasi-normal distribution on a continuous 9-point bipolar scale ranging from -4 for strongly disagree to +4 for strongly agree. The Q factor analysis method was employed to identify patterns based on the similarity and dissimilarity among health personnel. RESULTS: There were three main patterns of perception toward influenza pandemic with moderate correlation coefficients between patterns ranging from 0.37 to 0.55. Pattern I, health personnel, which we labeled pessimistic, perceived themselves as having a low self-efficacy. Pattern II, which we labeled optimistic, perceived the threat to be low severity and low vulnerability. Pattern III, which we labeled mixed, perceived low self-efficacy but low vulnerability. Across the three patterns, almost all the subjects had a high expectancy that execution of recommended measures can mitigate impacts of the threat of an influenza pandemic, particularly on multi-measures with high factor scores of 4 in all patterns. The most conflicting area was vulnerability on the possible impacts of an influenza pandemic, having factor scores of high (3), low (-4), and neutral (0) for patterns I, II, and III, respectively. CONCLUSION: Strong consistent perceptions of response efficacy against an influenza pandemic may suggest a low priority to convince health personnel on the efficacy of the recommended measures.

Previous research showed that endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) of human glomerular endothelial cells (HGECs) is involved in the progression of DN. Moreover, SET domain-containing protein 8 (SETD8), ETS-domain containing protein (ELK1) and BTB and CNC homology 1 (bach1) all participate in endothelial injury. In this study, we hypothesize that the SETD8/ELK1/bach1 functional axis is involved in mediating EndMT in diabetic nephropathy. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and qPCR were performed to determine the protein and mRNA levels of genes in HGECs and the kidney tissues of participants and rats. Immunofluorescence, Co-IP and GST pulldown assays were performed to verify the direct interaction between SETD8 and ELK1. ChIP and dual-luciferase assays were performed to determine the transcriptional regulation of bach1 and Snail. AVV-SETD8 injection in rat kidney was used to verify the potential protective effect of SETD8 on DN. RESULTS: Our current study showed that hyperglycaemia triggered EndMT by increasing Snail expression both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, high glucose increased bach1 expression in HGECs, positively regulating Snail and EndMT. As a transcription factor, ELK1 was augmented and participated in hyperglycaemia-induced EndMT via modulation of bach1 expression. Moreover, ELK1 was found to associate with SETD8. Furthermore, SETD8 negatively regulated EndMT by cooperating with bach1 to regulate Snail transcription. Furthermore, histone H4-Lys-20 monomethylation (H4K20me1), which is downstream of SETD8, was accompanied by ELK1 localization at the same promoter region of bach1. ELK1 overexpression enhanced bach1 promoter activity, which disappeared after specific binding site deletion. Mutual inhibition between ELK1 and SETD8 was found in HGECs. In vivo, SETD8 overexpression decreased ELK1 and bach1 expression, as well as EndMT. Moreover, SETD8 overexpression improved the renal function of rats with DN. CONCLUSIONS: SETD8 cooperates with ELK1 to regulate bach1 transcription, thus participating in the progression of DN. In addition, SETD8 interacts with bach1 to modulate Snail transcription, thus inducing EndMT in DN. SETD8 plays a core role in the SETD8/ELK1/bach1 functional axis, which participates in hyperglycaemia-mediated EndMT in DN, and SETD8 may be a potential therapeutic target for DN.

Method: From a meta-analysis of external quality assessments of RT-PCR assays of RNA viruses, we derived a conservative estimate of the range of false positive rates that can reasonably be expected in SARS-CoV-2 testing, and analyzed the effect of such rates on analyses of regional test data and estimates of population prevalence and asymptomatic ratio. Findings: Review of external quality assessments revealed false positive rates of 0-16.7%, with an interquartile range of 0.8-4.0%. Such rates would have large impacts on test data when prevalence is low. Inclusion of such rates significantly alters four published analyses of population prevalence and asymptomatic ratio. Interpretation: The high false discovery rate that results, when prevalence is low, from false positive rates typical of RT-PCR assays of RNA viruses raises questions about the usefulness of mass testing; and indicates that across a broad range of likely prevalences, positive test results are more likely to be wrong than are negative results, contrary to public health advice about SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Clinical samples were collected from eight pig farms in Guangdong province between 2018 and 2019 and tested for the major porcine enteric pathogens, including PEDV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), Swine enteric coronavirus (SeCoV), Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and porcine rotavirus (RV). As a result, only PEDV and RV were detected at a rate of 47.0% (16/34) and 18.6% (8/34), respectively. Coinfectoin with PEDV and RV occurred at a rate of PEDV 12.5% (2/16). Subsequently, the full-length S gene sequences of 13 PEDV strains were obtained, and phylogenetic analysis suggested the presence of GII-c group PEDV strains in this region (non-S-INDEL). Two novel common amino acid insertions ((55)T/IG(56) and 551L) and one novel glycosylation site (1199(G+)) were detected when the CV777 and ZJ08 vaccine strains were compared. Furthermore, intragroup recombination events in the S gene regions 51C548 and 2478C4208 were observed in the PEDV strains studied. In summary, the observations provide current information on the incidence of viral agents causing swine diarrhea in southern China and detailed the genetic characteristics and evolutionary history of the dominant PEDV field strains. Our findings will aid in the development of an updated vaccine for the prevention and control of PEDV variant strains.","output":"Genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in Guangdong, China, between 2018 and 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infectious diarrhoea. However, it is increasingly appreciated that healthcare-associated infections derive from both community and healthcare environments, and that the primary sites of C. difficile transmission may be strain-dependent. We conducted a multisite genomic epidemiology study to assess differential genomic evidence of healthcare vs community spread for two of the most common C. difficile strains in the USA: sequence type (ST) 1 (associated with ribotype 027) and ST2 (associated with ribotype 014/020). We performed whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses on 382 ST1 and ST2 C. difficile isolates recovered from stool specimens collected during standard clinical care at 3 geographically distinct US medical centres between 2010 and 2017. ST1 and ST2 isolates both displayed some evidence of phylogenetic clustering by study site, but clustering was stronger and more apparent in ST1, consistent with our healthcare-based study more comprehensively sampling local transmission of ST1 compared to ST2 strains. Analyses of pairwise single-nucleotide variant (SNV) distance distributions were also consistent with more evidence of healthcare transmission of ST1 compared to ST2, with 44a% of ST1 isolates being within two SNVs of another isolate from the same geographical collection site compared to 5.5a% of ST2 isolates (P-value=<0.001). Conversely, ST2 isolates were more likely to have close genetic neighbours across disparate geographical sites compared to ST1 isolates, further supporting non-healthcare routes of spread for ST2 and highlighting the potential for misattributing genomic similarity among ST2 isolates to recent healthcare transmission. Finally, we estimated a lower evolutionary rate for the ST2 lineage compared to the ST1 lineage using Bayesian timed phylogenomic analyses, and hypothesize that this may contribute to observed differences in geographical concordance among closely related isolates. Together, these findings suggest that ST1 and ST2, while both common causes of C. difficile infection in hospitals, show differential reliance on community and hospital spread. This conclusion supports the need for strain-specific criteria for interpreting genomic linkages and emphasizes the importance of considering differences in the epidemiology of circulating strains when devising interventions to reduce the burden of C. difficile infections.","output":"A multisite genomic epidemiology study of Clostridioides difficile infections in the USA supports differential roles of healthcare versus community spread for two common strains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Case isolation is a strategy with the potential to curb infectious disease epidemics.

Considering that symptoms of influenza are largely undistinguishable from COVID-19, both SARS-CoV-2 and the Influenza viruses require concurrent testing by RT-PCR in patients presenting with symptoms of respiratory tract infection. In this study, we adapted and evaluated a laboratory developed multiplex RT-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 (dual-target), Influenza-A and Influenza-B (SC2/InflA/InflB-UCT) on a fully automated high-throughput system (cobas6800). Methods: Analytical performance was assessed by serial dilution of quantified reference material and cell culture stocks in transport medium, including pre-treatment for chemical inactivation. For clinical evaluation, residual portions of 164 predetermined patient samples containing SARS-CoV-2 (n=52), Influenza-A (n=43) or Influenza-B (n=19), as well as a set of negative samples was subjected to the novel multiplex assay. Results: The assay demonstrated analytical performance comparable to currently available commercial tests, with limits of detection of 94.9 cp/ml for SARS-CoV-2, 14.6 cp/ml for Influenza-A and 422.3 cp/ml for Influenza-B. Clinical evaluation showed excellent agreement with the comparator assays (sensitivity 98.1%, 97.7% and 100% for Sars-CoV-2, Influenza-A and -B respectively). Conclusion: The SC2/InflA/InflB-UCT allows for efficient high-throughput testing for all three pathogens and thus provides streamlined diagnostics while conserving resources during the Influenza-season.","output":"Clinical evaluation of a fully automated, lab developed multiplex RT-PCR assay integrating dual-target SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza-A/B detection on a high-throughput platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To determine whether changes in the transiting nerve rootlet or its surroundings, as seen on MRI performed after lumbar hemilaminectomy, are associated with persistent postoperative pain (PPP), commonly known as the failed back surgery syndrome.

Two musculoskeletal radiologists evaluated transiting nerve rootlet abnormalities (thickening, signal alteration, distinction, and displacement), epidural fibrosis, and intrathecal arachnoiditis on MRI obtained one year after the operations. A spine surgeon blinded to the radiologic findings evaluated each patient for PPP. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the association between the MRI findings and PPP. RESULTS The presence of transiting nerve rootlet thickening, signal alteration, and ill-distinction was significantly different between the patients with PPP and those without, for both readers (p  0.020). Conversely, the presence of transiting nerve rootlet displacement, epidural fibrosis, and intrathecal arachnoiditis was not significantly different between the two groups (p  0.128).

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital-based HCWs with exposure to patients with COVID-19 using a pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 With Hydroxychloroquine Study) was conducted at 2 tertiary urban hospitals, with enrollment from April 9, 2020, to July 14, 2020; follow-up ended August 4, 2020. The trial randomized 132 full-time, hospital-based HCWs (physicians, nurses, certified nursing assistants, emergency technicians, and respiratory therapists), of whom 125 were initially asymptomatic and had negative results for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab. The trial was terminated early for futility before reaching a planned enrollment of 200 participants. Interventions: Hydroxychloroquine, 600 mg, daily, or size-matched placebo taken orally for 8 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by a nasopharyngeal swab during the 8 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects, treatment discontinuation, presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, frequency of QTc prolongation, and clinical outcomes for SARS-CoV-2-positive participants. Results: Of the 132 randomized participants (median age, 33 years [range, 20-66 years]; 91 women [69%]), 125 (94.7%) were evaluable for the primary outcome. There was no significant difference in infection rates in participants randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo (4 of 64 [6.3%] vs 4 of 61 [6.6%]; P > .99). Mild adverse events were more common in participants taking hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo (45% vs 26%; P = .04); rates of treatment discontinuation were similar in both arms (19% vs 16%; P = .81). The median change in QTc (baseline to 4-week evaluation) did not differ between arms (hydroxychloroquine: 4 milliseconds; 95% CI, -9 to 17; vs placebo: 3 milliseconds; 95% CI, -5 to 11; P = .98). Of the 8 participants with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 (6.4%), 6 developed viral symptoms; none required hospitalization, and all clinically recovered. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, although limited by early termination, there was no clinical benefit of hydroxychloroquine administered daily for 8 weeks as pre-exposure prophylaxis in hospital-based HCWs exposed to patients with COVID-19.

Moreover, studies have shown links between PUI and symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This meta-analysis investigated whether children and adolescents with ADHD are more often affected by PUI compared to control groups. Method Multiple databases (EBSCOhost, Pubmed) were reviewed. Studies were eligible if individuals (aged 6-18 years) were diagnosed with ADHD, assessed on PUI-related measures, and compared to non-clinical or/and clinical controls without a diagnosis of ADHD. Out of 3,859 identified studies, 14 studies assessing 2,488 participants met all inclusion criteria. Four meta-analyses examining time-based and scale-based measures, different informants and non-clinical vs. clinical controls using random-effects models were performed. Funnel plots were used to investigate publication bias. Results The analyses revealed significantly more severe PUI in individuals with ADHD compared to controls, both when PUI was assessed via rating scale (scaled-based) and via units for time (time-based measures). Different informants (self- vs. parent-rating) had no impact on results. Differences in PUI between groups with ADHD and non-clinical controls were significant, whereas differences between ADHD and clinical controls were not. Due to the high heterogeneity observed and the small sample sizes, these latter findings should be interpreted cautiously. Conclusion Children and adolescents with ADHD show more severe PUI compared to non-clinical controls without ADHD.

In particular, we propose a novel online attention module with a 3D convolutional network (CNN) to focus on the infection regions in lungs when making decisions of diagnoses. Note that there exists imbalanced distribution of the sizes of the infection regions between COVID-19 and CAP, partially due to fast progress of COVID-19 after symptom onset. Therefore, we develop a dual-sampling strategy to mitigate the imbalanced learning.

Objective To perform a systematic review to evaluate the evidence on effectiveness and feasibility of different processes used for decontaminating N95 respirators. Evidence Review A search of PubMed and EMBASE (through January 31, 2021) was completed for 5 types of respirator-decontaminating processes including UV irradiation, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, moist-heat incubation, microwave-generated steam, and ethylene oxide. Data were abstracted on process method, pathogen removal, mask filtration efficiency, facial fit, user safety, and processing capability. Findings Forty-two studies were included that examined 65 total types of masks. All were laboratory studies (no clinical trials), and 2 evaluated respirator performance and fit with actual clinical use of N95 respirators. Twenty-seven evaluated UV germicidal irradiation, 19 vaporized hydrogen peroxide, 9 moist-heat incubation, 10 microwave-generated steam, and 7 ethylene oxide. Forty-three types of N95 respirators were treated with UV irradiation. Doses of 1 to 2 J/cm2 effectively sterilized most pathogens on N95 respirators (>103 reduction in influenza virus [4 studies], MS2 bacteriophage [3 studies], Bacillus spores [2 studies], Escherichia virus MS2 [1 study], vesicular stomatitis virus [1 study], and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus/SARS-CoV-1 [1 study]) without degrading respirator components. Doses higher than 1.5 to 2 J/cm2 may be needed based on 2 studies demonstrating greater than 103 reduction in SARS-CoV-2. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide eradicated the pathogen in all 7 efficacy studies (>104 reduction in SARS-CoV-2 [3 studies] and >106 reduction of Bacillus and Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores [4 studies]). Pressurized chamber systems with higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide caused FFR damage (6 studies), while open-room systems did not degrade respirator components. Moist heat effectively reduced SARS-CoV-2 (2 studies), influenza virus by greater than 104 (2 studies), vesicular stomatitis virus (1 study), and Escherichia coli (1 study) and preserved filtration efficiency and facial fit for 11 N95 respirators using preheated containers/chambers at 60 C to 85 C (5 studies); however, diminished filtration performance was seen for the Caron incubator. Microwave-generated steam (1100-W to 1800-W devices; 40 seconds to 3 minutes) effectively reduced pathogens by greater than 103 (influenza virus [2 studies], MS2 bacteriophage [3 studies], and Staphylococcus aureus [1 study]) and maintained filtration performance in 10 N95 respirators; however, damage was noted in least 1 respirator type in 4 studies. In 6 studies, ethylene oxide preserved respirator components in 16 N95 respirator types but left residual carcinogenic by-product (1 study). Conclusions and Relevance Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, moist heat, and microwave-generated steam processing effectively sterilized N95 respirators and retained filtration performance.

The results showed that ASGM-impacted soils had Cu, Pb, Zn and As up to 3.6, 83, 73 and 68 times higher than background levels, respectively and were classified as 'extremely' polluted (CD = 30-228; PLI = 5.5-34.8).

Although very high Pb and Zn were found in ASGM-impacted soils, they were relatively immobile under oxidising conditions around pH 8.5 because of their retention via adsorption to hydrous ferric oxides (HFOs), montmorillonite and kaolinite. In contrast, Cu and As release from the historic ASGM site samples exceeded the environmental limits for Class A and Class C effluents, which could be attributed to the removal of calcite and dolomite by weathering.

Compared with pharmaceuticals that treat disease, however, preventative vaccines have received less attention from both biomedical researchers and innovation scholars. This neglect has substantial human and financial costs, as vividly illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we argue that the large number of \`\`missing'' vaccines is likely due to more than lack of scientific opportunities. Two key aspects of vaccines help account for their anemic development pipeline: (1) they are preventatives rather than treatments; and (2) they are generally durable goods with long-term effects rather than products purchased repeatedly. We explain how both aspects make vaccines less profitable than repeat-purchase treatments, even given comparable IP protection. We conclude by arguing that innovation policy should address these market distortions by experimenting with larger government-set rewards for vaccine production and use. Most modestly, policymakers should increase direct fundingincluding no grants and public-private partnershipsand insurance-based market subsidies for vaccine development. We also make the case for a large cash prize for any new vaccine made available at low or zero cost.","output":"Innovation policy and the market for vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Not needed.","output":"Cardiovascular risks of hydroxychloroquine in treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 patients: A scientific statement from the Indian Heart Rhythm Society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To evaluate the overall health and functioning in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and related factors affecting these during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures. METHODS: Data from 587 axSpA patients participating in the first phase (AprilCJuly 2020) of the REUMAVID study who completed the ASAS Health Index (ASAS-HI) were analysed. REUMAVID is a cross-sectional study that collects data through an online survey to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases across seven European countries. Poor health was defined as ASAS-HI ? 12. The World Health Organization Five well-being index, self-perceived health status and change in health status during COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Logistic regression models were used to identify the factors associated with poor health. RESULTS: According to the ASAS-HI, 147 (25.0%) patients reported poor health. Pain and moving around were the main affected categories. In addition, 14.0% reported their self-perceived health status as bad or very bad and 46.8% as worse than before the pandemic. In the multivariate analysis, smoking (OR = 1.98), diabetes (OR = 4.89) and taking painkillers (OR = 2.82) or corticosteroids use (OR = 2.20) were significantly associated with poor health, while engaging in physical activity (OR = 0.54) and being actively employed (OR = 0.48) were inversely associated with this.

By moving enterprise workloads to managed cloud offerings (private, public, hybrid), customers are delegating mundane tasks and labor-intensive maintenance activities related to network connectivity, procurement of cloud resource, application deployment, software patches, and upgrades, etc., This often translates to benefits such as high availability and reduced cost. The popularity of container and micro-services-based deployment has made Kubernetes the de-facto standard to deliver applications. However, even with Kubernetes orchestration, cloud service providers frequently have operational scalability issues due to lack of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD) automation and increased demand for human operators when managing a large number of software deployments across multiple data centers/availability zones. Kubernetes solves this in a novel way by creating and managing custom applications using Operators. Agile methodology advocates incremental CICD which are adopted by cloud providers. However, ironically, it is this same continuous delivery feature of application updates, Kubernetes cluster upgrades, etc., that is also a bane to cloud providers. In this paper, we will demonstrate the use of IBM open-source project Razee as a scalable continuous deployment framework to deploy open-source RStudio and Nginx Operators.

METHODS: This was a retrospective and observational study of adult patients who were admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit between January 2014 and March 2018 and underwent tracheostomy. In this study, primary endpoints were incidence of SAE: cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, hypertension, hypotension, desaturation, bradypnea, or ventilatory distress. The secondary endpoint was procedure-induced complications. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients underwent tracheostomy during the study. Elective surgery of brain tumors (34.0%) and intracranial hemorrhage (20.5%) were the most common reasons for admission. The most common reasons for tracheostomy were difficult ventilator weaning or prolonged intubation (42.9%) and sedative reduction (23.7%). Tachycardia (30.1%) and hypertension (30.1%) were the most common SAE. Incidence of SAE was more common in conventional tracheostomy compared to PDT (67.1% vs. 42.3%, P = 0.002). The total duration of SAE (19.8  23.0 min vs. 3.4  5.3 min, P < 0.001) and procedural time (42.2  21.8 min vs. 17.7  9.2 min, P < 0.001) were longer in conventional tracheostomy compared to PDT. Multivariable adjustment revealed that only PDT by a neurointensivist significantly reduced the incidence of SAE by one third (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.187C0.691). In addition, PDT by a neurointensivist deceased the duration of SAE by 8.64 min (: -8.64, 95% CI: ? 15.070 C -2.205, P = 0.009) and prolonging the procedure time by every one minute significantly increased the duration of SAE by 6.38 min (: 6.38, 95% CI: 0.166C0.470, P < 0.001). Procedure-induced complications were more common in conventional tracheostomy compared to PDT (23.5% vs. 11.3%, P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective and exploratory study of our single-center limited cohort of tracheostomy patients revealed that decreased SAE may be associated with short procedural time during the PDT procedure performed by a neurointensivist.

Therefore, we assessed stressors, coping behaviors, and resources needed in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of 162 perinatal (125 pregnant and 37 postpartum) women in the United States. METHODS: A mixed-methods study captured quantitative responses regarding stressors and coping, along with qualitative responses to open-ended questions regarding stress and resources needed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic and linear regression models were used to analyze differences between pregnant and postpartum participants, as well as differences across key demographic variables. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze open-ended questions. RESULTS: During the COVID-pandemic, food scarcity and shelter-in-place restrictions made it difficult for pregnant women to find healthy foods. Participants also reported missing prenatal appointments, though many reported using telemedicine to obtain these services. Financial issues were prevalent in our sample and participants had difficulty obtaining childcare. After controlling for demographic variables, pregnant women were less likely to engage in healthy stress-coping behaviors than postpartum women. Lastly, we were able to detect signals of increased stressors induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, and less social support, in perinatal women of racial and ethnic minority, and lower-income status. Qualitative results support our survey findings as participants expressed concerns about their baby contracting COVID-19 while in the hospital, significant others missing the delivery or key obstetric appointments, and wanting support from friends, family, and birthing classes. Financial resources, COVID-19 information and research as it relates to maternal-infant health outcomes, access to safe healthcare, and access to baby supplies (formula, diapers, etc.) emerged as the primary resources needed by participants. CONCLUSIONS: To better support perinatal women's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers should engage in conversations regarding access to resources needed to care for newborns, refer patients to counseling services (which can be delivered online/via telephone) and virtual support groups, and consistently screen pregnant women for stressors.","output":"Stressors, coping, and resources needed during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of perinatal women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China.

Fine-Gray subdistribution and Cox proportional hazards modeling were conducted to determine variables associated with the rate of infective endocarditis recurrence and mortality, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 310 persons who inject drugs with infective endocarditis, 236 experienced a single episode and 74 experienced recurrent episodes. Peripherally inserted central catheter misuse was associated with an increased rate of infective endocarditis recurrence (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR]=2.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-4.98, P=0.02) and mortality (hazard ratio [HR]=2.44, 95% CI 1.15-5.17, P=0.02).

METHODS: A retrospective observational case-controlled cohort study was performed between March and September 2020, including adults with COVID-19 in a single-center in Turkey. We categorized patients into age-sex matched three groups, group 1 (n = 48) and group 2 (n = 48) included patients treated with the combination of FPV plus Hydroxychloroquine (HQ) early and late, respectively. Group 3 (n = 48) consisted of patients on HQ monotherapy. In Group 2, if the respiratory or clinic condition had not improved sufficiently, FPV was added on or after day 3. RESULTS: We found that starting FPV early had an impact on PCR negativity and the progression of the disease. 'No progression' was defined as the absence of a new finding in the control radiological examination and the absence of accompanying clinical deterioration. Also, the decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) was greater in Group 1 than Group 3 (p < 0.001).

Innate and adaptive immune responses to PEG-fused sciatic PNAs were analyzed using electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for morphological features, T cell and macrophage infiltration, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, apoptosis, expression of cytokines, chemokines, and cytotoxic effectors. PEG-fused PNAs exhibited attenuated innate and adaptive immune responses by 14-21 days postoperatively, as evidenced by (a) many axons and cells remaining viable, (b) significantly reduced infiltration of cytotoxic and total T cells and macrophages, (c) significantly reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and MHC proteins, (d) consistently low apoptotic response.

Small animal models are crucial for the successful development and validation of antiviral vaccines, therapies and to study the role that comorbidities have on the outcome of viral infections. The initially available SARS-CoV-2 isolates require adaptation in order to use the mouse angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (mACE-2) entry receptor and to productively infect the cells of the murine respiratory tract. We have mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 by serial passaging a clinical virus isolate in the lungs of mice. We then used low doses of this virus in mouse models for advanced age, diabetes and obesity. Similar to SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, the outcome of infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 resulted in enhanced morbidity in aged and diabetic obese mice. Mutations associated with mouse adaptation occurred in the S, M, N and ORF8 genes. Interestingly, one mutation in the receptor binding domain of the S protein results in the change of an asparagine to tyrosine residue at position 501 (N501Y). This mutation is also present in the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses reported in the U.K. (20B/501Y.V1, B1.1.7 lineage) that is epidemiologically associated with high human to human transmission. We show that human convalescent and post vaccination sera can neutralize the newly emerging N501Y virus variant with similar efficiency as that of the reference USA-WA1/2020 virus, suggesting that current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will protect against the 20B/501Y.V1 strain.","output":"The N501Y mutation in SARS-CoV-2 spike leads to morbidity in obese and aged mice and is neutralized by convalescent and post-vaccination human sera"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cholesterol, certain lipids, membrane-bound and soluble proteins, as well as viruses that are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), reach the plasma membrane (PM) via non-classical pathway(s) that remain poorly understood.

SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious through saliva droplets. The structural analysis suggests that the virus enters human cells through the ligation of the spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The progression of Covid-19 has been divided into three main stages: stage I-viral response, stage II-pulmonary phase, and stage III-hyperinflammation phase. Once the patients enter stage III, it will likely need ventilation and it becomes difficult to manage. Thus, it will be of paramount importance to find therapies to prevent or slow down the progression of the disease toward stage III. The key event leading to hyperinflammation seems to be the activation of Th-17 immunity response and Cytokine storm. B2-adrenergic receptors (B2ARs) are expressed on airways and on all the immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, B and T lymphocytes. Blocking (B2AR) has been proven, also in clinical settings, to reduce Th-17 response and negatively modulate inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 while increasing IFN?3. Non-selective beta-blockers are currently used to treat several diseases and have been proven to reduce stress-induced inflammation and reduce anxiety. For these reasons, we speculate that targeting B2AR in the early phase of Covid-19 might be beneficial to prevent hyperinflammation.","output":"Can Beta-2-Adrenergic Pathway Be a New Target to Combat SARS-CoV-2 Hyperinflammatory Syndrome?-Lessons Learned From Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In case of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected patients, the invasive ventilation in prone position can improve the prognosis, albeit with an increased risk of facial pressure ulcers.

METHODS: We included laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, who were hospitalized in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital and excluded those who had not received anal swabs for SARS-COV-2 RNA testing. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained. Throat swabs and anal swabs were collected periodically for SARS-COV-2 RNA detection. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventeen eligible patients (median aged 50 years, 50.2% were females) were analyzed. 21.2% (46/217) of the patients were detected with SARS-CoV-2 RNA in anal swabs. The duration of viral RNA was longer, but the viral load was lower in anal swabs than throat swabs in the early stage of the disease. During a median follow-up of 20 days, 30 (13.8%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for high-flow nasal cannula or higher-level oxygen support measures to correct hypoxemia. Detectable viral RNA in anal swabs (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-5.24), increased C-reactive protein (aHR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.35-7.32) and lymphocytopenia (aHR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.46-6.67) were independently associated with ICU admission.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional research. METHODS: Data were taken from the Hamburg survey of homeless individuals (n = 151). HRQoL was assessed using the EQ-5D tool. More precisely, the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire was used to quantify problems in five health dimensions (i.e. mobility, self-care, usually activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), and its visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) was used to record the according self-rated health status. Explanatory variables include sex, age, education, marital status, country of origin, health insurance, and chronic alcohol consumption. RESULTS: With regard to HRQoL, most frequently, problems were reported as pain/discomfort (47.3%), followed by anxiety/depression (32.4%), mobility (29.7%), usual activities (20.7%) and self-care (4.6%). The mean EQ-VAS score was 75.34 (SD 22.23; range 1-100), and the mean EQ-5D-5L index was 0.84 (SD 0.23; range 0.32-1).

CONCLUSION The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in HCWs was higher than general population indicating a higher viral transmission via close exposure with COVID-19 patients.","output":"Prevalence of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Specific Antibodies in Health-Care Workers Compared to General Population during an Early Phase of the Pandemic, Tehran-Iran."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PROBLEM: Lymphocyte immunotherapy (LIT) emerged in the early 1980s as a new therapeutic proposal for couples with a history of recurrent miscarriages (RM). However, in the early 2000s, the effectiveness of LIT was questioned. Recently, meta-analyses have observed the effectiveness and safety of LIT in treating couples with RM. Some studies evaluated the use of LIT in recurrent implantation failure (RIF) in in vitro fertilization cycles. METHODS: This systematic and narrative review evaluated the data available in the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of the use of LIT. Searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were conducted, using the following keywords: \\"recurrent miscarriage,\\" \\"lymphocyte immunotherapy,\\" and \\"recurrent implantation failure\\". RESULTS: This review describes the historical aspects of LIT and discusses its protocols, mechanisms of action, side effects, complications, and current evidence of the effectiveness in cases of reproductive failure. It also discusses the use of LIT during the COVID-19 pandemic and new immunological therapies. CONCLUSION: In the vast majority of studies, the use of LIT for RM couples has shown an improvement in pregnancy outcomes. The most of the current studies that support the evidence are quasi-experimental, with few randomized, double-blind studies (Level of evidence III).

SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), which is a multiorgan hyperinflammatory condition based on the hyperactivation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, macrophages, and natural killer cells, leading to multiorgan failure (including myocarditis, venous thromboembolism, and acute respiratory distress syndrome) and consequently to death. We highlight the major cardiovascular and coagulative complications of COVID-19 with particular reference to cancer patients by analyzing the retrospective clinical studies currently available. Discussions on the harmful or beneficial effects of anticancer therapies as well as on the type of tumor during SARS-CoV-2 infection have been made, with the addition of practical recommendations for the risk reduction of coagulation dysfunctions, myocarditis, venous thromboembolism, and mortality in cancer patients. ABSTRACT: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly transmissible viral illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, which has been defined by the World Health Organization as a pandemic, considering its remarkable transmission speed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and TMPRSS2, which is a serine protease both expressed in lungs, the gastro-intestinal tract, and cardiac myocytes. Patients with COVID-19 experienced adverse cardiac events (hypertension, venous thromboembolism, arrhythmia, myocardial injury, fulminant myocarditis), and patients with previous cardiovascular disease have a higher risk of death. Cancer patients are extremely vulnerable with a high risk of viral infection and more negative prognosis than healthy people, and the magnitude of effects depends on the type of cancer, recent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery and other concomitant comorbidities (diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome). Patients with active cancer or those treated with cardiotoxic therapies may have heart damages exacerbated by SARS-CoV-2 infection than non-cancer patients. We highlight the cardiovascular side effects of COVID-19 focusing on the main outcomes in cancer patients in updated perspective and retrospective studies. We focus on the main cardio-metabolic risk factors in non-cancer and cancer patients and provide recommendations aimed to reduce cardiovascular events, morbidity, and mortality.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Cardioncology: From Cardiometabolic Risk Factors to Outcomes in Cancer Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The complete picture of transmission modes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unknown.

Domain III (DIII) of the ZIKV envelope (E) protein is an important vaccine target, and a vaccine developed using a mutant DIII of E (EDIII) protein protects adult and pregnant mice, and unborn offspring, against ZIKV infection. Here, we have used immunocompetent BALB/c mice treated with anti-interferon-/ receptor 1 (Ifnar1) antibodies to investigate whether three adjuvants (aluminum (Alum), monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), and MF59), either alone or in combination, could improve the efficacy of this EDIII subunit vaccine. Our data show that, although vaccine formulated with a single adjuvant induced a specific antibody and cellular immune response, and reduced viral load in mice challenged with ZIKV, the combination of Alum and MPL adjuvants led to a more robust and balanced immune response, stronger neutralizing activity against three recent ZIKV human strains, and greater protection against a high-dose ZIKV challenge. Particularly, the combination of Alum with MPL significantly reduced viral titers and viral RNA copy numbers in sera and tissues, including the male reproductive organs. Overall, this study has identified the combination of Alum and MPL as the most effective adjuvant for ZIKV EDIII subunit vaccines, and it has important implications for subunit vaccines against other enveloped viruses, including non-ZIKV flaviviruses.","output":"Effects of Adjuvants on the Immunogenicity and Efficacy of a Zika Virus Envelope Domain III Subunit Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La Fdration de Chirurgie Viscrale et Digestive (FCVD) a enqut sur les consquences personnelles et professionnelles des dcisions prises pour faire face  la pandmie COVID 19 chez les chirurgien(ne)s de la spcialit.

While the systemic actions of the RAS are widely accepted, the role of the RAS in the brain, its regulation of cardiovascular function, and sympathetic outflow remain controversial. In this report, we discuss the current understanding of central RAS on blood pressure (BP) regulation, in light of recent literature and new experimental techniques. RECENT FINDINGS Studies using neuronal or glial-specifc mouse models have allowed for greater understanding into the site-specific expression and role centrally expressed RAS proteins have on BP regulation. While all components of the RAS have been identified in cardiovascular regulatory regions of the brain, their actions may be site specific. In a number of animal models of hypertension, reduction in Ang II-mediated signaling, or upregulation of the central ACE2/Ang 1-7 pathway, has been shown to reduce BP, via a reduction in sympathetic signaling and increase parasympathetic tone, respectively. Emerging evidence also suggests that, in part, the female protective phenotype against hypertension may be due to inceased ACE2 activity within cardiovascular regulatory regions of the brain, potentially mediated by estrogen. Increasing evidence suggests the importance of a central renin-angiotensin pathway, although its localization and the mechanisms involved in its expression and regulation still need to be clarified and more precisely defined. All reported studies/experiments with human or animal subjects performed by the authors have been previously published and complied with all applicable ethical standards (including the Helsinki declaration and its amendments, institutional/national research committee standards, and international/national/institutional guidelines).","output":"Integrative Physiological Aspects of Brain RAS in Hypertension."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a camel-borne zoonotic virus endemic across Eastern Africa and the Middle East, with evidence of circulation in Bangladesh and Mongolia.

RESULTS: The reduction of pressure support was associated with an increased respiratory rate and a reduced tidal volume, while minute ventilation was unchanged. &#916;Pes significantly increased with reducing support (5 [3; 8] vs. 8 [14; 13] vs. 12 [6; 16] cmH2O, p < 0.0001), as did the diaphragm TR (9.2  6.1 vs. 17.6  7.2 vs. 28.0  10.0%, p < 0.0001) and the &#916;CVP (4 [3; 7] vs. 8 [5; 9] vs. 10 [7; 11] cmH2O, p < 0.0001). &#916;CVP was significantly associated with &#916;Pes (R2 = 0.810, p < 0.001), as was diaphragm TR, albeit with a lower coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.399, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19-associated respiratory failure undergoing assisted mechanical ventilation, &#916;CVP is a better estimate of inspiratory effort than diaphragm ultrasound.","output":"Central venous pressure swing outperforms diaphragm ultrasound as a measure of inspiratory effort during pressure support ventilation in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One side-effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has been increased enrollment in online classes. The paper explores the surge in activity from March through June 2020 in two massive open online classes (MOOCs) on Astronomy, offered by Coursera and Udemy. The increase in enrollment in both classes was an order of magnitude over the similar time span in previous years. Learners enrolling during the pandemic were more likely to be younger than thirty and less likely to have advanced degrees. A majority were full-time undergraduate students, and relatively few were professionals working in technical fields. The largest number of new students were from India and overall, the biggest surge in enrollment came from people in developing countries, particularly in Asia. Those who enrolled during the pandemic were more likely to take the course to get a certificate or to further their career goals than because they had intrinsic interest in the subject. Social motivations were important, particularly among full-time students in the course. These results, albeit limited to MOOCs in astronomy, suggest that new audiences have been turning to online classes during the pandemic for gaining credentials or advancing their professional skills.","output":"MOOCS and 100 Days of COVID: Enrollment surges in massive open online astronomy classes during the coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect firm-supplier-customer relationships?

It involves atrophy of the frontal and temporal regions of the brain affecting language, memory, and behavior. Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology is found in most FTD and ALS cases. It plays a role in transcription, translation and serves as a shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Prior to its aggregation, TDP-43 exists as polyubiquitinated, hyperphosphorylated C-terminal fragments that correlate well with FTD disease progression. Because of the importance of TDP-43 in these diseases, reagents that can selectively recognize specific toxic TDP variants associated with onset and progression of FTD can be effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools. RESULTS We utilized a novel atomic force microscopy (AFM) based biopanning protocol to isolate single chain variable fragments (scFvs) from a phage display library that selectively bind TDP variants present in human FTD but not cognitively normal age matched brain tissue. We then used the scFvs (FTD-TDP1 through 5) to probe post-mortem brain tissue and sera samples for the presence of FTD related TDP variants. The scFvs readily selected the FTD tissue and sera samples over age matched controls. The scFvs were used in immunohistochemical analysis of FTD and control brain slices where the reagents showed strong staining with TDP in FTD brain tissue slice. FTD-TDP1, FTD-TDP2, FTD-TDP4 and FTD-TDP5 all protected neuronal cells against FTD TDP induced toxicity suggesting potential therapeutic value. CONCLUSIONS These results show existence of different disease specific TDP variants in FTD individuals. We have identified a panel of scFvs capable of recognizing these disease specific TDP variants in postmortem FTD tissue and sera samples over age matched controls and can thus serve as a biomarker tool.","output":"Isolation and characterization of antibody fragments selective for human FTD brain derived TDP-43 variants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The U S has merely 4% of the world population, but contains 25% of the world&rsquo;s COVID-19 cases Since the COVID-19 outbreak in the U S , Massachusetts has been leading other states in the total number of COVID-19 cases Racial residential segregation is a fundamental cause of racial disparities in health Moreover, disparities of access to health care have a large impact on COVID-19 cases Thus, this study estimates racial segregation and disparities in testing site access and employs economic, demographic, and transportation variables at the city/town level in Massachusetts Spatial regression models are applied to evaluate the relationships between COVID-19 incidence rate and related variables This is the first study to apply spatial analysis methods across neighborhoods in the U S to examine the COVID-19 incidence rate The findings are: (1) Residential segregations of Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black/African Americans have a significantly positive association with COVID-19 incidence rate, indicating the higher susceptibility of COVID-19 infections among minority groups (2) Non-Hispanic Black/African Americans have the shortest drive time to testing sites, followed by Hispanic, Non-Hispanic Asians, and Non-Hispanic Whites The drive time to testing sites is significantly negatively associated with the COVID-19 incidence rate, implying the importance of the accessibility of testing sites by all populations (3) Poverty rate and road density are significant explanatory variables Importantly, overcrowding represented by more than one person per room is a significant variable found to be positively associated with COVID-19 incidence rate, suggesting the effectiveness of social distancing for reducing infection (4) Different from the findings of previous studies, the elderly population rate is not statistically significantly correlated with the incidence rate because the elderly population in Massachusetts is less distributed in the hotspot regions of COVID-19 infections The findings in this study provide useful insights for policymakers to propose new strategies to contain the COVID-19 transmissions in Massachusetts","output":"Racial Segregation, Testing Site Access, and COVID-19 Incidence Rate in Massachusetts, USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In early 2021, vaccination against COVID-19 became one of the most important measures needed to control the pandemic.

The aim of this study was to provide an action plan for mitigation of occupational hazards and nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2 through a failure mode analysis based on observations during in situ simulations. METHODS: A multicenter, cross-sectional, observational, simulation-based study was performed in Latvia from March 2 to 26, 2020. This study was conducted at 7 hospitals affiliated with Riga Stradins University. The presentation of a COVID-19 patient was simulated with an in situ simulations, followed by a structured debrief. Healthcare Failure Modes and Effects Analysis is a tool for conducting a systematic, proactive analysis of a process in which harm may occur. We used Healthcare Failure Modes and Effects Analysis to analyze performance gaps and systemic issues. RESULTS: A total of 67 healthcare workers from 7 hospitals participated in the study (range = 4-17). A total of 32 observed failure modes were rated using a risk matrix. Twenty-seven failure modes (84.4%) were classified as either medium or high risk or were single-point weaknesses, hence evaluated for action type and action; 11 (40.7%) were related to organizational, 11 (40.7%) to individual, and 5 (18.5%) to environmental factors. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation-based failure mode analysis helped us identify the risks related to the preparedness of the healthcare workers and emergency departments for the COVID-19 pandemic in Latvia.

Understanding the association may help develop policies and interventions targeting specific screen activities to promote healthful screen use and mental health in children and youth. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether specific forms of screen use (television [TV] or digital media, video games, electronic learning, and video-chatting time) were associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, conduct problems, irritability, hyperactivity, and inattention in children and youth during COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A longitudinal cohort study with repeated measures of exposures and outcomes was conducted in children and youth aged 2 to 18 years in Ontario, Canada, between May 2020 and April 2021 across 4 cohorts of children or youth: 2 community cohorts and 2 clinically referred cohorts. Parents were asked to complete repeated questionnaires about their childrens health behaviors and mental health symptoms during COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The exposure variables were childrens daily TV or digital media time, video game time, electronic-learning time, and video-chatting time. The mental health outcomes were parent-reported symptoms of child depression, anxiety, conduct problems and irritability, and hyperactivity/inattention using validated standardized tools. RESULTS: This study included 2026 children with 6648 observations. In younger children (mean [SD] age, 5.9 [2.5] years; 275 male participants [51.7%]), higher TV or digital media time was associated with higher levels of conduct problems (age 2-4 years: , 0.22 [95% CI, 0.10-0.35]; P < .001; age 4 years: , 0.07 [95% CI, 0.02-0.11]; P = .007) and hyperactivity/inattention (, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.006-0.14]; P = .04).

These food shortages can be acutely felt by vulnerable populations, comprising people in communities who are already dealing with social or economic disadvantages. Despite growing calls to ensure food access for everyone during and following disasters, efforts are still largely ad hoc, champion based and highly variable in their reliability and quality of supply. There is also a disconnect between disaster-related food relief and improving business continuity towards local economic resilience. This study sought to tackle these challenges by exploring how local food access could be integrated within disaster management mechanisms, to support the most vulnerable and also contribute to local economic resilience. This paper discusses the findings of a study undertaken in Cairns, a north-eastern Australian regional authority, and involves a review of disaster management planning and policy artifacts, an online survey, and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders providing care and advocacy for vulnerable populations. Synthesizing the findings, we present a disaster-management-focused Local Food Access Model that connects shorter food supply chains to improved disaster response, resilience and contingency-planning agendas. Applying this model to Cairns, we conclude the multiple benefits and immediate stakeholder readiness for a virtual (online) food resilience and contingency hub, to enable the connection of local food availability and access information within existing disaster management processes. The research method used, the model, and the case-specific findings provide government decision makers with a useful process, a local food-access schematic and a case study example to support immediate improvements in disaster resilience for vulnerable populations.","output":"Working through Disaster Risk Management to Support Regional Food Resilience: A Case Study in North-Eastern Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, prone position (PP) has been frequently used in the intensive care units to improve the prognosis in patients with respiratory distress.

The aim of this paper is to describe the prevalence and characteristics of prone-positioning pressure sores (PPPS) and analyze the related risk factors. METHODS: A case-control study was performed in Gregorio Maranon hospital in Madrid during the COVID-19 pandemic between April and May 2020. We enrolled 74 confirmed COVID-19 patients in critical care units with invasive mechanical ventilation who were treated with pronation therapy. There were 57 cases and 17 controls. Demographic data, pronation maneuver characteristics and PPPS features were analyzed. RESULTS: In the case group, a total number of 136 PPPS were recorded. The face was the most affected region (69%). Regarding the severity, stage II was the most frequent. The main variables associated with an increased risk of PPPS were the total number of days under pronation cycles, and PP maintained for more than 24a?h. The prealbumin level at admission was significantly lower in the case group. All of the ulcers were treated with dressings. The most frequent acute complication was bleeding (5%).

Many age-related disorders have a direct or indirect impact on nutrition, both in terms of nutrient assimilation and food access, which may result in vitamin deficiencies and may lead to or worsen disabilities. Frailty is characterized by reduced functional abilities, with a key role of malnutrition in its pathogenesis. Aging is associated with various changes in body composition that lead to sarcopenia. Frailty, aging, and sarcopenia all favor malnutrition, and poor nutritional status is a major cause of geriatric morbidity and mortality. In the present narrative review, we focused on vitamins with a significant risk of deficiency in high-income countries: D, C, and B (B6/B9/B12). We also focused on vitamin E as the main lipophilic antioxidant, synergistic to vitamin C. We first discuss the role and needs of these vitamins, the prevalence of deficiencies, and their causes and consequences. We then look at how these vitamins are involved in the biological pathways associated with sarcopenia and frailty. Lastly, we discuss the critical early diagnosis and management of these deficiencies and summarize potential ways of screening malnutrition. A focused nutritional approach might improve the diagnosis of nutritional deficiencies and the initiation of appropriate clinical interventions for reducing the risk of frailty.

Rapid R&D and PAR strategies have allowed COVID-19 vaccines to become available globally. We compare COVID-19 vaccines with other innovative therapies with expedited approvals to learn from and potentially model future frameworks when bringing new therapies to market. Methods: As a comparative exploratory case, two innovative therapies, tisagenlecleucel, and pembrolizumab, with expedited approval designation, variable profitability, and adequate public data were identified. Each therapy lifecycle was outlined through a targeted literature review from 2006 to 2021. A descriptive analysis was conducted for concept elicitation and the identified categories were interpreted accordingly. Key features of product lifecycles and barriers were compared. Finally, potential adaptation strategies for future innovative therapies were outlined. Results: Each comparator had notable differences in R&D and PAR such as therapeutic expansion strategy for pembrolizumab and safety program hurdle for tisagenlecleucel. Likewise, various strategies were implemented for COVID-19 vaccines. Existing and novel stakeholders shared data to accelerate R&D through global collaborations. Risk-pooling, government development funds, and early contracted purchases ensured limited profitability and mitigated associated risk. Various phases of clinical trials and manufacturing processes occurred in parallel with ongoing pooled data analysis of outcomes, compared to the traditional method of the interim and final analysis of clinical trial endpoints. The need for paradigm shift during the pandemic highlighted the important evolution of digitalization, advanced technologies, and reconsideration of evidence acceptability criteria in rapid R&D and PAR strategies.

Yet, diagnostic technologies only have an impact if they are put to use in a correct and timely manner. Views of the intended beneficiaries are important in uptake of diagnostics, and their effective use also depends on those implementing testing programmes, including providers, laboratory professionals, and staff in health ministries. Otherwise, there is a risk these technologies will not fit their intended use and setting, cannot be made to work and scale up, and are not used by, or not accessible to, those in need. OBJECTIVES: To synthesize end\\\\user and professional user perspectives and experiences with low\\\\complexity nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for detection of tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance; and to identify implications for effective implementation and health equity. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Science Citation Index Expanded databases for eligible studies from 1 January 2007 up to 20 October 2021. We limited all searches to 2007 onward because the development of Xpert MTB/RIF, the first rapid molecular test in this review, was completed in 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis, and were focused on perspectives and experiences of users and potential users of low\\\\complexity NAATs to diagnose tuberculosis and drug\\\\resistant tuberculosis. NAATs included Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, Xpert MTB/XDR, and the Truenat assays. Users were people with presumptive or confirmed tuberculosis and drug\\\\resistant tuberculosis (including multidrug\\\\resistant (MDR\\\\TB)) and their caregivers, healthcare providers, laboratory technicians and managers, and programme officers and staff; and were from any type of health facility and setting globally. MDR\\\\TB is tuberculosis caused by resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, the two most effective first\\\\line drugs used to treat tuberculosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used a thematic analysis approach for data extraction and synthesis, and assessed confidence in the findings using GRADE CERQual approach. We developed a conceptual framework to illustrate how the findings relate. MAIN RESULTS: We found 32 studies. All studies were conducted in low\\\\ and middle\\\\income countries. Twenty\\\\seven studies were conducted in high\\\\tuberculosis burden countries and 21 studies in high\\\\MDR\\\\TB burden countries. Only one study was from an Eastern European country. While the studies covered a diverse use of low\\\\complexity NAATs, in only a minority of studies was it used as the initial diagnostic test for all people with presumptive tuberculosis. We identified 18 review findings and grouped them into three overarching categories. Critical aspects users value People with tuberculosis valued reaching diagnostic closure with an accurate diagnosis, avoiding diagnostic delays, and keeping diagnostic\\\\associated cost low. Similarly, healthcare providers valued aspects of accuracy and the resulting confidence in low\\\\complexity NAAT results, rapid turnaround times, and keeping cost to people seeking a diagnosis low. In addition, providers valued diversity of sample types (for example, gastric aspirate specimens and stool in children) and drug resistance information. Laboratory professionals appreciated the improved ease of use, ergonomics, and biosafety of low\\\\complexity NAATs compared to sputum microscopy, and increased staff satisfaction. Challenges reported to realizing those values People with tuberculosis and healthcare workers were reluctant to test for tuberculosis (including MDR\\\\TB) due to fears, stigma, or cost concerns. Thus, low\\\\complexity NAAT testing is not implemented with sufficient support or discretion to overcome barriers that are common to other approaches to testing for tuberculosis. Delays were reported at many steps of the diagnostic pathway owing to poor sample quality; difficulties with transporting specimens; lack of sufficient resources; maintenance of low\\\\complexity NAATs; increased workload; inefficient work and patient flows; over\\\\reliance on low\\\\complexity NAAT results in lieu of clinical judgement; and lack of data\\\\driven and inclusive implementation processes. These challenges were reported to lead to underutilization. Concerns for access and equity The reported concerns included sustainable funding and maintenance and equitable use of resources to access low\\\\complexity NAATs, as well as conflicts of interest between donors and people implementing the tests. Also, lengthy diagnostic delays, underutilization of low\\\\complexity NAATs, lack of tuberculosis diagnostic facilities in the community, and too many eligibility restrictions hampered access to prompt and accurate testing and treatment. This was particularly the case for vulnerable groups, such as children, people with MDR\\\\TB, or people with limited ability to pay. We had high confidence in most of our findings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Low\\\\complexity diagnostics have been presented as a solution to overcome deficiencies in laboratory infrastructure and lack of skilled professionals. This review indicates this is misleading. The lack of infrastructure and human resources undermine the added value new diagnostics of low complexity have for recipients and providers. We had high confidence in the evidence contributing to these review findings. Implementation of new diagnostic technologies, like those considered in this review, will need to tackle the challenges identified in this review including weak infrastructure and systems, and insufficient data on ground level realities prior and during implementation, as well as problems of conflicts of interest in order to ensure equitable use of resources.","output":"Rapid molecular tests for tuberculosis and tuberculosis drug resistance: a qualitative evidence synthesis of recipient and provider views"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the coronavirus (COVID-19), is the virus responsible for over 69,613,607 million infections and over 1,582,966 deaths worldwide.

These phytopharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals can be more economic, available, safe and lower side effects. This is in silico comparison study of ten phenolic antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2, as well as isolation of the most active metabolite from natural sources. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) were also then prepared using these metabolite as a reducing agent. All tested compounds showed predicted anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Hesperidin showed the highest docking score, this leads us to isolate it from the orange peels and we confirmed its structure by conventenional spectroscopic analysis. In addition, synthesis of hesperidin zinc oxide nanoparticles was characterized by UV, IR, XRD and TEM. In vitro antiviral activity of hesperidin and ZnO NPs was evaluated against hepatitis A virus as an example of RNA viruses. However, ZnO NPs and hesperidin showed antiviral activity against HAV but ZnO NPs showed higher activity than hesperidin. Thus, hesperidin and its mediated ZnO nanoparticles are willing antiviral agents and further studies against SARS-CoV-2 are required to be used as a potential treatment.","output":"Antiviral zinc oxide nanoparticles mediated by hesperidin and in silico comparison study between antiviral phenolics as anti-SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"India's Battle against COVID-19: Progress and Challenges.","output":"Indias Battle against COVID-19: Progress and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in infancy with a metastases-related death risk.

Many risk factors are associated with a high mortality rate in COVID-19. Establishment of a common pathway among these risk factors could improve our understanding of COVID-19 severity and mortality. This review aims at establishing this common pathway and its possible effect on COVID-19 mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS The current review was executed in five consecutive stages starting from determining the risk factors of COVID-19 mortality and trying to find a common pathway among them depending on the available literature. This was followed by proposing a mechanism explaining how this common pathway could increase the mortality. Finally, its potential role in managing COVID-19 was proposed. RESULTS This review identified this common pathway to be a low baseline of reduced glutathione (i.e., GSH) level. In particular, this review provided an in-depth discussion regarding the pathophysiology by which COVID-19 leads to GSH depletion, tissue damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In addition, the current review demonstrated how GSH depletion could result in failure of the immune system and rendering the end organs vulnerable to damage from the oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS This preclinical study shows that GSH depletion may have a central role in COVID-19 mortality and pathophysiology. Therefore, elevating the GSH level in tissues may decrease the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19.","output":"Could glutathione depletion be the Trojan horse of COVID-19 mortality?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the extent to which the worlds largest companies (in terms of revenues), achieve sales around the globe, and have been able to penetrate markets outside of their home region.

Rugman & Verbeke (2004) found that few of the 2002 Fortune Global 500 (Fortune Magazine 2002) firms, accounting for over 90% of the worlds stock of FDI, actually had a global sales orientation. A majority of multinational enterprises (MNEs) were home-region oriented, suggesting that much work on corporate globalization was normative, rather than accurately describing reality. We present the equivalent data for the 2017 Fortune Global 500 (Fortune Magazine 2017) list. Our data confirm that many large firms are still home-region oriented, but to a lesser extent than before, with 36 MNEs (up from only nine in the 2002 list), now having widely distributed sales across the worlds core economic regions.

Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild disease with unspecific symptoms, but about 5% become critically ill with respiratory failure, septic shock and multiple organ failure. An unknown proportion of infected individuals never experience COVID-19 symptoms although they are infectious, that is, they remain asymptomatic. Those who develop the disease, go through a presymptomatic period during which they are infectious. Universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections to detect individuals who are infected before they present clinically, could therefore be an important measure to contain the spread of the disease. Objectives: We conducted a rapid review to assess (1) the effectiveness of universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with no screening and (2) the accuracy of universal screening in people who have not presented to clinical care for symptoms of COVID-19. Search methods: An information specialist searched Ovid MEDLINE and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) COVID-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database up to 26 May 2020. We searched Embase.com, the CENTRAL, and the Cochrane Covid-19 Study Register on 14 April 2020. We searched LitCovid to 4 April 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases and in PubMed up to 15 April 2020. We also searched three model repositories (Covid-Analytics, Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study [MIDAS], and Society for Medical Decision Making) on 8 April 2020. Selection criteria: Trials, observational studies, or mathematical modelling studies assessing screening effectiveness or screening accuracy among general populations in which the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 is unknown. Data collection and analysis: After pilot testing review forms, one review author screened titles and abstracts. Two review authors independently screened the full text of studies and resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Abstracts excluded by a first review author were dually reviewed by a second review author prior to exclusion. One review author independently extracted data, which was checked by a second review author for completeness and accuracy. Two review authors independently rated the quality of included studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for diagnostic accuracy studies and a modified form designed originally for economic evaluations for modelling studies. We resolved differences by consensus. We synthesized the evidence in narrative and tabular formats. We rated the certainty of evidence for days to outbreak, transmission, cases missed and detected, diagnostic accuracy (i.e. true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives) using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included 22 publications. Two modelling studies reported on effectiveness of universal screening. Twenty studies (17 cohort studies and 3 modelling studies) reported on screening test accuracy. Effectiveness of screening. We included two modelling studies. One study suggests that symptom screening at travel hubs, such as airports, may slightly slow but not stop the importation of infected cases (assuming 10 or 100 infected travellers per week reduced the delay in a local outbreak to 8 days or 1 day, respectively). We assessed risk of bias as minor or no concerns, and certainty of evidence was low, downgraded for very serious indirectness. The second modelling study provides very low-certainty evidence that screening of healthcare workers in emergency departments using laboratory tests may reduce transmission to patients and other healthcare workers (assuming a transmission constant of 1.2 new infections per 10,000 people, weekly screening reduced infections by 5.1% within 30 days). The certainty of evidence was very low, downgraded for high risk of bias (major concerns) and indirectness. No modelling studies reported on harms of screening. Screening test accuracy. All 17 cohort studies compared an index screening strategy to a reference reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. All but one study reported on the accuracy of single point-in-time screening and varied widely in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, settings, and methods of measurement. We assessed the overall risk of bias as unclear in 16 out of 17 studies, mainly due to limited information on the index test and reference standard. We rated one study as being at high risk of bias due to the inclusion of two separate populations with likely different prevalences. For several screening strategies, the estimates of sensitivity came from small samples. For single point-in-time strategies, for symptom assessment, the sensitivity from 12 cohorts (524 people) ranged from 0.00 to 0.60 (very low-certainty evidence) and the specificity from 12 cohorts (16,165 people) ranged from 0.66 to 1.00 (low-certainty evidence). For screening using direct temperature measurement (3 cohorts, 822 people), international travel history (2 cohorts, 13,080 people), or exposure to known infected people (3 cohorts, 13,205 people) or suspected infected people (2 cohorts, 954 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.00 to 0.23 (very low- to low-certainty evidence) and specificity ranged from 0.90 to 1.00 (low- to moderate-certainty evidence). For symptom assessment plus direct temperature measurement (2 cohorts, 779 people), sensitivity ranged from 0.12 to 0.69 (very low-certainty evidence) and specificity from 0.90 to 1.00 (low-certainty evidence). For rapid PCR test (1 cohort, 21 people), sensitivity was 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.96; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 0.73 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.94; very low-certainty evidence). One cohort (76 people) reported on repeated screening with symptom assessment and demonstrates a sensitivity of 0.44 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.59; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity of 0.62 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.79; low-certainty evidence). Three modelling studies evaluated the accuracy of screening at airports. The main outcomes measured were cases missed or detected by entry or exit screening, or both, at airports. One study suggests very low sensitivity at 0.30 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.53), missing 70% of infected travellers. Another study described an unrealistic scenario to achieve a 90% detection rate, requiring 0% asymptomatic infections. The final study provides very uncertain evidence due to low methodological quality. Authors' conclusions: The evidence base for the effectiveness of screening comes from two mathematical modelling studies and is limited by their assumptions. Low-certainty evidence suggests that screening at travel hubs may slightly slow the importation of infected cases. This review highlights the uncertainty and variation in accuracy of screening strategies. A high proportion of infected individuals may be missed and go on to infect others, and some healthy individuals may be falsely identified as positive, requiring confirmatory testing and potentially leading to the unnecessary isolation of these individuals. Further studies need to evaluate the utility of rapid laboratory tests, combined screening, and repeated screening. More research is also needed on reference standards with greater accuracy than RT-PCR. Given the poor sensitivity of existing approaches, our findings point to the need for greater emphasis on other ways that may prevent transmission such as face coverings, physical distancing, quarantine, and adequate personal protective equipment for frontline workers.","output":"Universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection: a rapid review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus pandemic visualized the inequality in the community living standards and how housing is a fundamental requirement to ensure a livable environment. However, even before the pandemic, unequal housing access resulted in more than 150 million homeless people worldwide, and more than 22 million new people were added to this inventory for climate-related issues. This homeless population has a counterproductive effect on the social, psychological integration efforts by the community and exposure to other severe health-related issues. Methods: We systematically identified and reviewed 24 articles which met all three requirements we set forth- i. samples include homeless people, ii. focused on public health-related issues among the same group of people, and iii. used geospatial analysis tools and techniques in conducting the research. Result: Our review findings indicated a major disparity in the geographic distribution of the case study locations- all the articles are from six (6) countries- USA (n = 16), Canada (n = 3), UK (n = 2), and one study each from Brazil, Ireland, and South Africa. Majority of the studies used spatial analysis tools to identify the hotspots, clustering and spatial patterns of patient location and distribution. ArcGIS is the most frequently used GIS application, however, studies also used other statistical applications with spatial analysis capabilities. These studies reported relationship between the location of homeless shelters and substance use, discarded needles, different infectious and non-infectious disease clusters. Conclusion: Although, most studies were restricted in analyzing and visualizing the trends, patterns, and disease clusters, geospatial analyses techniques can be used to assess health problems such as disease distributions and associated factors across communities. Moreover, health and services and accessibility concerns could be well addressed by integrating spatial analysis into homelessness-related research.

Several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been approved and are widely used to stem the recurring waves of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Post-marketing surveillance is essential to record even rare safety issues related to these new vaccines. Among these issues, several autoimmune phenomena have been recorded in temporal association with and feasibly triggered by a vaccination. Acquired haemophilia A (AHA) is a rare condition characterized by new-onset haemorrhagic diathesis caused by an inhibitor of blood clotting factor VIII (FVIII), often in the elderly and most commonly associated with autoimmune or malignant disease. There have been a small number of AHA cases triggered by vaccinations, including those against SARS-CoV-2. We report the first case of AHA in temporal association with an mRNA-1273 booster vaccination. The diagnosis was made promptly, and the patient received appropriate care including immunosuppression using glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide (CYC) and rituximab (RTX). The haemorrhage ceased after escalation of treatment, and the patient is recovering. Concurrent malignancy was initially ruled out using a wide scope of diagnostic tests, but pleomorphic dermal sarcoma (PDS) of the forehead occurred after initiation of specific AHA immunosuppressive treatment. Since large vaccination programs are ongoing worldwide and potential adverse events during post-marketing surveillance have been reported following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, this case illustrates challenges in rare events occurring in association with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and to proof a causal relationship. Therefore, there is an urgent need for reporting any events in association with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, but also a crucial discussion about possible concurrent triggers and follow-up information about individual patients.","output":"Case Report: Acquired Haemophilia A Following mRNA-1273 Booster Vaccination Against SARS-CoV-2 With Concurrent Diagnosis of Pleomorphic Dermal Sarcoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the etiological agent of an acute and highly contagious disease Infectious bronchitis (IB) affects chicken of all ages and poses major economic loses to the poultry industry worldwide The continuous evolution of the spike protein (S1) of IBV is responsible for the prevalence of many serotypes/genotypes around the world Multiple lineages of IBV strains have been detected in chicken flocks in India since 2003 Aims: To detect IBV genotypes prevalent in India Methods: Organ samples from 20 IBV-positive flocks with variable clinical signs were used for the amplification of the S1 gene of IBV by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Results: Positive PCR amplicons were sequenced Sequence analysis showed that 14 field isolates belonged to the GI-1 genetic lineage (Mass 41 serotype), two field isolates belonged to the GI- 13 (UK 4/91 variant IBV strain), one field isolate grouped with GIII, GV, and GVI genetic lineage and three belonged to a variant genotype unique to India (GI-24) Phylogenetic analysis also showed a similar type of grouping within the field isolates Among the fourteen GI-1 isolates, 12 were isolated between 2003 and 2006 and only two were isolated between 2009 and 2011 The two field isolates belonging to GI-13 were isolated in 2007, another one belonging to GIII, GV, and GVI was isolated in 2010 and three field isolates were not close to any reference IBV sequences isolated in 2006 (IND-TN-168-06), 2010 (IND-TN-280-10) and 2011 (INDTN- 290-11) Conclusion: A unique variant of IBV is emerging in India (GI-24) Our findings will have important implications for future vaccine intervention","output":"Emergence of variant avian infectious bronchitis virus in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Considering the anti\\\\inflammatory effect of atorvastatin and the role of medical comorbidities such as hypertension and coronary artery disease on the prognosis of the COVID\\\\19 patients, we aimed to assess the effect of atorvastatin add\\\\on therapy on mortality caused by COVID\\\\19.

In this study, the HilbertCHuang transform (HHT) method was used to analyze the timeCfrequency characteristics of the PM(10) concentration data series measured at three different sites at the Xinglong Port of Zhenjiang, China, over three months. The HHT method consists of two main stages, namely, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert spectrum analysis (HSA), where the EMD technique is used to pre-process the HSA in order to determine the intrinsic mode function (IMF) components of the raw data series. The results show that the periods of the IMF components exhibit significant differences, and the short-period IMF component provides a modest contribution to all IMF components. Using HSA technology for these IMF components, we discovered that the variations in the amplitude of the PM(10) concentration over time and frequency are discrete, and the range of this variation is mainly concentrated in the low-frequency band. We inferred that long-term influencing factors determine the PM(10) concentration level in the port, and short-term influencing factors determine the difference in concentration data at different sites. Therefore, when formulating PM(10) emission mitigation strategies, targeted measures must be implemented according to the period of the different influencing factors.

CT are crucial to obtain high quality literature evidence and poor accrual is the most common reason for their early discontinuation (ED). At our best knowledge, no data are available on ED of cancer CT after the beginning of C19P. Methods: ClinicalTrial.gov was queried for terminated (T), withdrawn (W) and suspended (S) CT for the following terms: cancer, neoplasm, and tumor. The search was made for all the CT available from the inception to 26th February 2021, without any restrictions. The following characteristics were extracted: reason for ED, study type (interventional [In] vs observational), sponsored (yes vs not). ED rate was compared between CT discontinued for C19P or not (2);p<0.05 was set as statistically significant. A multiple linear regression analysis was also conducted to identify independent factors of ED. Results: 9990 CT were identified, but 765 CT were excluded as not related to cancer. Thus, 9225 CT were included (66% was T, 23% was W and 4% was S). Among CT classified as T, W and S, the frequency of In CT was 92%, 88% and 85% respectively, while the frequency of sponsored CT was 46%, 35% and 26% respectively. The most common reasons for ED were: poor accrual (29%), lack of funding (6%) and sponsor decision (5%). No reason for ED was available for 15% of CT. One hundred (1%) CT were discontinued due to C19P (27% was T, 7% was W and 66% was S). Comparing CT discontinued due to C19P with those discontinued due to other reasons, a lower rate of In-CT (73% vs 91%, p<0.05) and sponsored CT (14% vs 42%, p<0.05) was found in the C19P group. At the multiple linear regression analysis, C19P was strongly positively correlated with ED (coefficient 0.59952, p<0.0001) whereas sponsored CT resulted as negatively correlated with ED (coefficient -0.02746, p<0.0001). Conclusions: Poor accrual continues to be the main reason for ED of cancer CT, but C19P represents a new additional cause of ED. Sponsored trials showed less risk for ED.

Worrisome declines in diagnostic procedures and cancer diagnoses in 2020 have been reported; however, nationwide, population-based evidence is limited. Quantification of the magnitude and distribution of the remaining outstanding diagnoses is likewise lacking. METHODS: Using accelerated delivery of data from pathology laboratories to the Belgian Cancer Registry, we compared the nationwide rates of new diagnoses of invasive cancers in 2020 to 2019. RESULTS: We observed a 44% reduction in total diagnoses of invasive cancers in April 2020 compared with April 2019, coinciding with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reduction was largest in older patients and for skin cancers (melanoma and nonmelanoma). Reductions in diagnosis were less pronounced among children and adolescents (0-19 years). A smaller decline was observed for most cancers with typically poorer prognosis or obvious symptoms, including some hematological malignancies, lung, and pancreatic cancer. Suspension of organized population screening programs was reflected in a strong decline in diagnosis in the screening age groups for female breast cancer (56%) and for colorectal cancer in both men (49%) and women (60%). The number of diagnoses began to increase from the end of April and stabilized at the beginning of June at or just above 2019 levels. There has yet to be a complete recovery in cancer diagnoses, with an estimated 6%, or 4000 diagnoses, still outstanding for all of 2020. Among solid tumors, head and neck cancers have the largest remaining year-over-year decrease in diagnoses at 14%. CONCLUSION: These results add to the evidence of a profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on oncological care and identify groups at risk for continuing diagnostic delays. These data should stimulate health care providers worldwide to facilitate targeted, accessible, and efficient procedures for detection of cancers affected by this delay.","output":"Decline and incomplete recovery in cancer diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium: a year-long, population-level analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More than half a century has passed since the Great Chinese Famine (1959-1961), and China has transformed from a poor, underdeveloped country to the world's leading emerging economy.

The myths on the COVID-19 vaccine are spreading widely, causing a hindrance to this noble preventive measure. The prevalence of such myths among the healthcare professionals may be toxic and deadly. Aim & Objectives: To assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of the healthcare professionals regarding the myths on COVID-19 vaccination and to demystify them. Materials and Methods: An 18-item questionnaire evaluating knowledge, attitude, and practice based on the existing myths on COVID-19 vaccination was circulated through Google Forms among the 412 healthcare professionals of six disciplines belonging to a private University. The responses obtained were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS 20 software package. Results: A total of 385 health professionals participated in this study. The majority of them had medium knowledge (165) and positive attitude (273) with the mean knowledge and attitude scores of 3.82 (SD-1.55) out of 6 and 4.3 (SD-1.58) out of 7 respectively. Even though 312 participants got vaccinated, 72 of them failed to receive it. The knowledge scores showed a high statistically significant difference among the participants of different designations (p=0.001), but not with gender, field, and staff with different years of experience (p>0.05). The attitude scores were statistically different among participants of fields and designation (p<0.05) but not among genders (p=0.31) and staff with different years of experience (p=0.87). Knowledge and attitude scores showed a positive linear correlation and a high statistically significant difference (p<0.001).

Severe pediatric COVID-19 disease is rare, limiting potential data accumulation on associated respiratory failure in children. Pediatric intensivists and pulmonologists managing COVID-19 patients look to adult guidelines and pediatric-specific consensus statements to guide management. The purpose of this article is to review the current literature and recommended strategies for the escalation of noninvasive and invasive respiratory support for acute respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 disease in children. RECENT FINDINGS: There are no prospective studies comparing COVID-19 treatment strategies in children. Adult and pediatric ventilation management interim guidance is based on evidence-based guidelines in non-COVID acute respiratory distress syndrome, with considerations of (1) noninvasive positive pressure ventilation versus high-flow nasal cannula and (2) high versus lower positive end expiratory pressure strategies related to lung compliance and potential lung recruitability. SUMMARY: Management of acute respiratory failure from COVID-19 requires individualized titration of noninvasive and invasive ventilation modalities with consideration of preserved or compromised pulmonary compliance. Research regarding best practices in the management of pediatric severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure is lacking and is acutely needed as the pandemic surges and vaccination of the pediatric population will be delayed compared to adults.","output":"Invasive and noninvasive ventilation strategies for acute respiratory failure in children with coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Chronic pain remains a frequent complication after Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair. As a consequence, mesh fixation using glue instead of sutures has become popular. This meta-analysis aimed to clarify which fixation technique is to be preferred for elective Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair. METHODS A meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Articles published between January 1990 and April 2012 were searched for in MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing glue and sutured mesh fixation in elective Lichtenstein repair for unilateral inguinal hernia were included. The quality of the RCTs and the potential risk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS Of 254 papers found in the initial search, a meta-analysis was conducted of seven RCTs comprising 1185 patients. With the use of glue mesh fixation, the duration of operation was shorter (mean difference -257 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) -488 to -026) min; P = 003), patients had lower visual analogue scores for postoperative pain (mean difference -075 (-118 to -033); P = 0001), early chronic pain occurred less often (risk ratio 052, 95 per cent c.i. 031 to 087; P = 001), and time to return to daily activities was shorter (mean difference -117 (-230 to -003) days; P = 004). The hernia recurrence rate did not differ significantly. CONCLUSION Elective Lichtenstein repair for inguinal hernia using glue mesh fixation compared with sutures is faster and less painful, with comparable hernia recurrence rates.","output":"Meta-analysis of glue versus sutured mesh fixation for Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The etiology of osteonecrosis of the hip may have a genetic basis.

This study is the first to characterize the long-term clinical and patient-reported outcomes of these components to better inform patients about the postreconstruction period. METHODS A retrospective review of medical records and phone-based survey of adult patients who underwent free flap reconstruction of the heel/ankle with 6-month minimum clinical follow-up was performed. RESULTS Forty-three patients, with 31 (72.1%) NWB and 12 (27.9%) WB defects, treated from January 1, 2000 to February 28, 2017 were included. Muscle flaps were more common than fasciocutaneous flaps (N = 36 [83.7%] vs. 7 [16.3%]). Flap survival rate was 95.3% and limb salvage rate was 93.0% at median follow-up of 12.0 months (interquartile range [IQR] 6.2, 25.5). Flap ulceration occurred more frequently in the WB region (41.7 vs. 6.5%, p = .0123). The survey response rate was 63.6%.

Therefore, some authors recommend the use of prosthetic meshes. Considering the dynamic area between the esophagus and the diaphragmatic crura with its constant motion, it is astonishing that only a minor number of surgeons describe mesh-associated complications. METHODS Between January 2000 and August 2008, 26 patients of the Centre Hospitalier Emile Mayrisch (CHEM, Luxembourg) underwent laparoscopic repair for large paraesophageal hiatal hernia (median age, 70 (range, 39-90) years). In nine patients, prosthetic mesh reinforcement was performed (7 composite/2 mono-phase mesh). Crural repair without tension was performed only with sutures. There were no conversions. Follow-up assessment was prospective with the GIQL (Gastro-Intestinal Quality of Life) Index. RESULTS Responses to the GIQLI questionnaires were obtained from 20 patients (6 died of unrelated causes). Nineteen patients were satisfied with their symptom control 1 year after the operation (GIQLI 127). Sixteen patients had radiological follow-up (median, 24 months). Three patients treated without mesh (3/10) showed a radiological recurrence. All of them (3/10) had symptoms. None of the controlled patients with mesh (0/6) showed a recurrence. One patient developed a severe aortal bleeding 1, 2, and 3 weeks after the laparoscopic mono-phase mesh repair. During conventional operation, the bleeding stopped. Three years later, the follow-up showed a satisfied patient (GIQLI 127). CONCLUSIONS In view of the described complication, there is still considerable controversy regarding the routine use of mesh.

With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, wildlife agencies were concerned whether the activities they authorize might increase the risk of viral transmission from humans to North American bats but had a limited amount of time in which to make decisions. We provide a description of how decision analysis provides a powerful framework to analyze and re-analyze complex natural resource management problems as knowledge evolves. Coupled with expert judgment and avenues for the rapid release of information, risk assessment can provide timely scientific information for evolving decisions. In April 2020, the first rapid risk assessment was conducted to evaluate the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to North American bats. Based on the best available information, and relying heavily on formal expert judgment, the risk assessment found a small possibility of transmission during summer work activities. Following that assessment, additional knowledge and data emerged, such as bat viral challenge studies, that further elucidated the risks of human-to-bat transmission and culminated in a second risk assessment in the fall of 2020. We update the first SARS-CoV-2 risk assessment with new estimates of little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) susceptibility and new management alternatives, using findings from the prior two risk assessments and other empirical studies. We highlight the strengths of decision analysis and expert judgment not only to frame decisions and produce useful science in a timely manner, but also to serve as a framework to reassess risk as understanding improves. For SARS-CoV-2 risk, new knowledge led to an 88% decrease in the median number of bats estimated to be infected per 1000 encountered when compared to earlier results. The use of facemasks during, or a negative COVID-19 test prior to, bat encounters further reduced those risks. Using a combination of decision analysis, expert judgment, rapid risk assessment, and efficient modes of information distribution, we provide timely science support to decision makers for summer bat work in North America.","output":"Evaluating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to bats using a decision analytical framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has left many people isolated within their homes; these people are turning to social media for news and social connection, which leaves them vulnerable to believing and sharing misinformation. Health-related misinformation threatens adherence to public health messaging, and monitoring its spread on social media is critical to understanding the evolution of ideas that have potentially negative public health impacts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to use Twitter data to explore methods to characterize and classify four COVID-19 conspiracy theories and to provide context for each of these conspiracy theories through the first 5 months of the pandemic. METHODS: We began with a corpus of COVID-19 tweets (approximately 120 million) spanning late January to early May 2020. We first filtered tweets using regular expressions (n=1.8 million) and used random forest classification models to identify tweets related to four conspiracy theories. Our classified data sets were then used in downstream sentiment analysis and dynamic topic modeling to characterize the linguistic features of COVID-19 conspiracy theories as they evolve over time. RESULTS: Analysis using model-labeled data was beneficial for increasing the proportion of data matching misinformation indicators. Random forest classifier metrics varied across the four conspiracy theories considered (F1 scores between 0.347 and 0.857); this performance increased as the given conspiracy theory was more narrowly defined. We showed that misinformation tweets demonstrate more negative sentiment when compared to nonmisinformation tweets and that theories evolve over time, incorporating details from unrelated conspiracy theories as well as real-world events. CONCLUSIONS: Although we focus here on health-related misinformation, this combination of approaches is not specific to public health and is valuable for characterizing misinformation in general, which is an important first step in creating targeted messaging to counteract its spread. Initial messaging should aim to preempt generalized misinformation before it becomes widespread, while later messaging will need to target evolving conspiracy theories and the new facets of each as they become incorporated.","output":"\\"Thought I'd Share First\\" and Other Conspiracy Theory Tweets from the COVID-19 Infodemic: Exploratory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Millions of older Americans depend on services provided by Area Agencies on Aging to support their nutritional, social, and health needs.

The combination of DPSIR with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a useful method to study low-carbon evaluation because the AHP model has a special advantage in multi-indexes evaluation. This paper constructs the low-carbon economy evaluation system and comprehensively evaluates the numerical value of low-carbon economic development of Chinas 30 regions from 2000 to 2015 by using the AHP method. It shows that the numerical value of low-carbon economy of Chinas 30 regions varies in terms of growth rate. The numerical value of east regional low-carbon economy shows a pattern that is gradually higher than that of the west region. The numerical value of low carbon economic development in the south region is higher than that of the north region by degrees. In addition, based on the model of coordination degree in 2015, the result indicated that the four subsystems have primary coordination in the east area and bare coordination in the central and west areas. It is indicated that the four sub-indexes should be developed at the same pace and promoting the development of a low-carbon economy in the mid-west areas is the key in China. Finally, we proposed that environmental regulations and policies should be formulated to improve coordination in various aspects and various departments. Calculating the degree of low-carbon economic coupling coordination may be helpful for policy makers to formulate effective policies and take actions in the future.","output":"Synthetic Evaluation of Chinas Regional Low-Carbon Economy Challenges by Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this meeting overview, we summarise the scientific program and organisation of the 16th International Society for Computational Biology Student Council Symposium in 2020 (ISCB SCS2020).

We designed the CROWN Program, a Home-Care based ambulatory protocol to evaluate, monitor, and treat moderate to high risk COVID-19 patients in their homes, with escalation to hospital care when necessary. Patients were evaluated with telehealth visits with a Pulmonologist, and a Home-Care protocol, including RN visit, pulse-oximetry, and oxygen, lab-work, intravenous fluids, medication if needed patient data, comorbidities, and symptoms were collected. Labs, including COVID-19 PCR, D Dimer, CRP, Ferritin, Procalcitonin, CBC, and metabolic panel were measured, as were homecare, home oxygen, and intravenous fluids orders, radiographic studies and initiation of an anticoagulant. Emergency Department visits and need for hospital admission during the study period were recorded. A total of 182 patients were enrolled between the start date of April 27th and June 1st, and fell into two categories: not-admitted (101) and post-discharge (81). Two patients were referred for hospital admission, seven were treated and released from the ED, and one was referred to home hospice. There were no unexpected admissions or deaths.

Specifically, technologies that provide high performance and maximal use of biomass feedstocks into commodities with reduced environmental impact have been highly pursued. A key example comprises the extraction and/or dissolution of polysaccharides, one of the most abundant fractions of biomass, which still need to be improved regarding these processes' efficiency and selectivity parameters. In this context, the use of alternative solvents and the application of less energy-intensive processes in the extraction of polysaccharides might play an important role to reach higher efficiency and sustainability in biomass valorization. This review debates the latest achievements in sustainable processes for the extraction of polysaccharides from a myriad of biomass resources, including lignocellulosic materials and food residues. Particularly, the ability of ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) to dissolve and extract the most abundant polysaccharides from natural sources, namely cellulose, chitin, starch, hemicelluloses and pectins, is scrutinized and the efficiencies between solvents are compared. The interaction mechanisms between solvent and polysaccharide are described, paving the way for the design of selective extraction processes. A detailed discussion of the work developed for each polysaccharide as well as the innovation degree and the development stage of dissolution and extraction technologies is presented. Their advantages and disadvantages are also identified, and possible synergies by integrating microwave- and ultrasound-assisted extraction (MAE and UAE) or a combination of both (UMAE) are briefly described. Overall, this review provides key information towards the design of more efficient, selective and sustainable extraction and dissolution processes of polysaccharides from biomass.","output":"Use of Ionic Liquids and Deep Eutectic Solvents in Polysaccharides Dissolution and Extraction Processes towards Sustainable Biomass Valorization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Messaging from authorities about COVID-19 has been widely divergent.

Participants were less willing to help COVID-19 victims, who they considered riskier to help, more contaminated, and more responsible for their condition. Additionally, politics and demographic factors predicted attitudes about victims of COVID-19 above and beyond moral values;whereas attitudes about the other kinds of victims were primarily predicted by moral values.

The objectives of this study were to find out if it was possible to prevent, or delay, the local outbreaks of COVID-19 through restrictions on travel from abroad and if the virus has already established in-country transmission, to what extent would its impact be mitigated through quarantine of symptomatic patients? METHODS: These questions were addressed in the context of India, using simple mathematical models of infectious disease transmission. While there remained important uncertainties in the natural history of COVID-19, using hypothetical epidemic curves, some key findings were illustrated that appeared insensitive to model assumptions, as well as highlighting critical data gaps. RESULTS: It was assumed that symptomatic quarantine would identify and quarantine 50 per cent of symptomatic individuals within three days of developing symptoms. In an optimistic scenario of the basic reproduction number (R(0)) being 1.5, and asymptomatic infections lacking any infectiousness, such measures would reduce the cumulative incidence by 62 per cent. In the pessimistic scenario of R(0)=4, and asymptomatic infections being half as infectious as symptomatic, this projected impact falls to two per cent. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Port-of-entry-based entry screening of travellers with suggestive clinical features and from COVID-19-affected countries, would achieve modest delays in the introduction of the virus into the community. Acting alone, however, such measures would be insufficient to delay the outbreak by weeks or longer. Once the virus establishes transmission within the community, quarantine of symptomatics may have a meaningful impact on disease burden. Model projections are subject to substantial uncertainty and can be further refined as more is understood about the natural history of infection of this novel virus. As a public health measure, health system and community preparedness would be critical to control any impending spread of COVID-19 in the country.","output":"Prudent public health intervention strategies to control the coronavirus disease 2019 transmission in India: A mathematical model-based approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) are prone to severe complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The pandemic requires adaptation of the health care standards, including epidemiologic surveillance, logistics of home supply, and monitoring. Potential lack of medical professionals may worsen the standard of care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the medical staff resources in HPN units. RESULTS: The study was conducted by major Polish scientific societies in clinical nutrition. A questionnaire was distributed among all Polish adult HPN centers concerning statistics from the first 3 mo of the pandemic (March through May 2020). Data on medical staff resources and organizational issues of the units were collected. Modifications of the home procedures, SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of HPN patients and health care workers (HCW) were analyzed. Influence of the pandemic on the rates of new qualifications for home artificial nutrition (HAN) was estimated. Fourteen of 17 adult Polish HPN units took part in the study. The point prevalence of HPN in Poland was 30.75/1 million citizens. Of HCWs, 344 were involved in patient care in Polish HPN units; 18.9% were physicians (49% surgeons, 18.46% internal medicine specialists, 15.38% anesthesiologists, 7.69% pediatricians, 1.54% palliative care specialists), 32.27% nurses, 5.23% dietitians, 9.01% pharmacists, 4.94% pharmacy technicians, 3.2% pharmacy assistants, 5.81% administrative workers, 3.49% physiotherapists. HAN patient-to-HCW ratios for physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dietitians were 49.5, 29.15, 111.6, and 181.6, respectively. Medium ages of physicians and nurses were 45.6 and 44.15 y, respectively. Slightly less than half (53.8%) of physicians and 31.53% of nurses worked parallelly in hospital wards. Thirty-one pharmacists overall were working in all HPN units (2.21 per unit) as were 18 dietitians (1.3 per unit). Nine patients had a confirmed COVID-19 infection (four HPN, five home enteral nutrition). All the units introduced telemedicine solutions in the first months of the pandemic. The number of new qualifications for HPN and home enteral nutrition in the units did not significantly decline from March through May in comparison with a similar period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: A shortage of HPN medical professionals requires attention when planning health care organization, especially during a pandemic. Severe restrictions in public health systems may not reduce the number of new qualifications for the HPN procedure. There is a need for the continuation of data collection during the evolution of the pandemic as it may have a detrimental effect on HPN including serious issues with access to professional HCWs.","output":"Organizational issues of home parenteral nutrition during COVID-19 pandemic: Results from multicenter, nationwide study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a strong drive and desire to find effective treatments for and protection against the disease.

Because the remnant stomach and the pancreas share an arterial blood supply, it is often unclear whether the remnant stomach can be safely preserved when performing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) or distal pancreatectomy (DP) post gastrectomy. We herein report two cases in which the remnant stomach was safely preserved using near-infrared spectroscopy to assess the regional saturation of oxygen (rSO2) in the remnant stomach during operation. PRESENTATION OF CASE The first patient, a 68-year-old man, was diagnosed with cancer of the pancreatic head and underwent PD a year after proximal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The remnant stomach was safely preserved by evaluation of the rSO2 before and after reconstruction of the arteries. The second patient, an 82-year-old woman with a history of distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer 40 years previously, was diagnosed with a main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreatic body, requiring DP. As in the previous case, we could safely preserve the remnant stomach through assessing the intraoperative rSO2 of the remnant stomach.

These compounds accumulate differentially in the root, stem, and leaf; however, the molecular basis of such tissue-specific accumulation remains poorly understood. Because tissue-specific accumulation of compounds is usually associated with tissue-specific expression of the related biosynthetic enzyme genes and regulators, we aimed to clarify and compare the transcripts expressed in different tissues of P. cuspidatum in this study. RESULTS: High-throughput RNA sequencing was performed using three different tissues (the leaf, stem, and root) of P. cuspidatum. In total, 80,981 unigenes were obtained, of which 40,729 were annotated, and 21,235 differentially expressed genes were identified. Fifty-four candidate synthetase genes and 12 transcription factors associated with stilbene, flavonoid, and anthraquinone biosynthetic pathways were identified, and their expression levels in the three different tissues were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of polyketide synthase gene families revealed two novel CHS genes in P. cuspidatum. Most phenylpropanoid pathway genes were predominantly expressed in the root and stem, while methylerythritol 4-phosphate and isochorismate pathways for anthraquinone biosynthesis were dominant in the leaf. The expression patterns of synthase genes were almost in accordance with metabolite profiling in different tissues of P. cuspidatum as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography or ultraviolet spectrophotometry. All predicted transcription factors associated with regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway were expressed at lower levels in the stem than in the leaf and root, but no consistent trend in their expression was observed between the leaf and the root. CONCLUSIONS: The molecular knowledge of key genes involved in the biosynthesis of P. cuspidatum stilbenes, flavonoids, and anthraquinones is poor. This study offers some novel insights into the biosynthetic regulation of bioactive compounds in different P. cuspidatum tissues and provides valuable resources for the potential metabolic engineering of this important medicinal plant.

As the vehicle moves forward, its interior will exchange air from the surroundings. The CFD model captures the flow patterns generated both outside and inside the vehicle. This internal aerodynamics will in turn dictate how aerosols will spread across the interior and whether or not they will be transported outside the vehicle. A Lagrangian approach is used to determine the transport of the aerosol particles and the effect of particle size on the simulation result has been studied. Four sets of scenarios of practical interest have been considered. The first set shows the effect of vehicle speed on aerosol transport, and the second set describes what happens when some of the windows are closed, while the third set describes how aerosol transport is affected by the location of the passenger speaking. The fourth set describes how a gush of cross wind affects aerosol transport. Simulation results reveal that when all windows are open, aerosols can go out of one window and then return back to the vehicle interior through another window.

A total of 759 competitive athletes (49% female; mean age: 27  10 years old) completed the cross-sectional study. Participants were invited to state their expertise, training status before and during the lockdown (did they have a training program), and whether they were injured at the start of the lockdown. Additionally, participants filled out psychometric self-report measures of anxiety (TFAI-return) and motivation (SMS-return) to return to sport. Due to non-normal distributions in the TFAI and SMS scores, non-parametric group comparisons were performed to compare participants for each categorical variable: non-parametric correlation tests were also performed to test the associations between continuous variables. Group comparisons showed higher scores of anxiety for females, younger athletes, athletes practicing and competing at the highest level, and athletes without a training program during the lockdown. Moreover, results suggested lower motivation scores (i.e., autonomous and controlled) for older athletes, experts (practicing for more than 10 years), athletes practicing and competing at a lower level, and athletes without a training program during the lockdown.

The number of newly confirmed cases in 25 of Chinas most-affected cities for the COVID-19 epidemic from January 11 to February 10 was collected. The heterogeneity and effectiveness of these 25 cities prevention and control measures for COVID-19 were analysed by using an estimated time-varying reproduction number method and a serial correlation method. The results showed that the effective reproduction number (R) in 25 cities showed a downward trend overall, but there was a significant difference in the R change trends among cities, indicating that there was heterogeneity in the spread and control of COVID-19 in cities. Moreover, the COVID-19 control in 21 of 25 cities was effective, and the risk of infection decreased because their R had dropped below 1 by February 10, 2020. In contrast, the cities of Wuhan, Tianmen, Ezhou and Enshi still had difficulty effectively controlling the COVID-19 epidemic in a short period of time because their R was greater than 1.","output":"Heterogeneity and effectiveness analysis of COVID-19 prevention and control in major cities in China through time-varying reproduction number estimation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 or coronavirus disease - 2019 as named by World Health Organization has grappled the world since first case emerged from wet market of Wuhan in Hubei province, People's Republic of China.

DESIGN: A nested case-matched control analysis. SETTING: Three hospital sites in Bronx, NY. PATIENTS: Adult coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted between March 1, 2020, and April 1, 2020. We excluded patients with do-not-intubate orders. Cases were defined by invasive mechanical ventilation or inhospital mortality. Each case was matched with two controls based on age, gender, admission date, and hospital length of stay greater than index time of matched case via risk-set sampling. The presence of nonintubated proning was identified from provider documentation. INTERVENTION: Nonintubated proning documented prior to invasive mechanical ventilation or inhospital mortality for cases or prior to corresponding index time for matched controls. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 600 patients, 41 (6.8%) underwent nonintubated proning. Cases had lower Spo(2)/Fio(2) ratios prior to invasive mechanical ventilation or inhospital mortality compared with controls (case median, 97 [interquartile range, 90C290] vs control median, 404 [interquartile range, 296C452]). Although most providers (58.5%) documented immediate improvement in oxygenation status after initiating nonintubated proning, there was no difference in worst Spo(2)/Fio(2) ratios before and after nonintubated proning in both case and control (case median Spo(2)/Fio(2) ratio difference, 3 [interquartile range, C3 to 8] vs control median Spo(2)/Fio(2) ratio difference, 0 [interquartile range, C3 to 50]). In the univariate analysis, patients who underwent nonintubated proning were 2.57 times more likely to require invasive mechanical ventilation or experience inhospital mortality (hazard ratio, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.17C5.64; p = 0.02). Following adjustment for patient level differences, we found no association between nonintubated proning and invasive mechanical ventilation or inhospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.34C2.45; p = 0.86).

Such family carers are central to the approach in Japan to achieving a sustainable and resilient society in response to ageing. Contrasting family carers COVID-19 vaccine literacy with their overall health literacy provides insights into their preparedness for COVID-19 vaccinations. The purpose of this study is to understand how vaccine literacy, compared to health literacy, varies across family carers and the sources of information they use.

We conducted a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted to general wards and evaluated demographic and clinical parameters as well as laboratory parameters, including coagulation parameters. CWA data from patients (n = 62) with COVID-19 prior to the initiation of anticoagulation therapy were compared with those from healthy controls (n = 67). The measured CWA parameters were min1, min2, max2, and delta change. CWA, fibrinogen, and D-dimer values were higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls (p < 0.001). CWA profiles were consistent with hypercoagulability and characterized by an increase in density, velocity, and acceleration of clot formation. Activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein (CRP) values were higher in patients in whom all CWA parameters were raised than in patients with just a few elevated CWA parameters, while Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, prothrombin time, fibrin degradation product levels and platelet counts did not differ between the two groups. CWA variables showed hypercoagulopathy on admission in COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the general ward, and this pattern was more pronounced in critically ill patients with elevated fibrinogen, D-dimer, and CRP levels.

Therefore, investigating the conformational differences of the DPP4 receptors can aid in developing new small animal models for MERS-CoV vaccines and antiviral agents evaluation. Here we used MD simulations and docking techniques to investigate these structural differences in DPP4 receptors. The results showed chimeric mouse mDPP4 (cmDPP4) has a similar compact conformation as wild-type hDPP4 based on the structural analysis. Interestingly, a single Thr288Ala mutation induced a relaxed conformation in chimeric 2 hDPP4 (c2hDPP4) and chimeric 2 mDPP4 (c2mDPP4); in addition to its significant effect on the DPP4 flexibility.

Based on the communication characteristics of diseases, it is necesssery to add fast and slow process into the model of infectious diseases, which more effectively shows the transmission mechanism of infectious diseases. METHODS This paper proposes an age structure epidemic model with fast and slow progression. We analyze the model's dynamic properties by using the stability theory of differential equation under the assumption of constant population size. RESULTS The very important threshold R0 was calculated. If R0<1, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, whereas if R0>1, the Lyapunov function is used to show that endemic equilibrium is globally stable. Through more in-depth analysis for basic reproduction number, we obtain the greater the rate of slow progression of an infectious disease, the fewer the threshold results. In addition, we also provided some numerical simulations to prove our result. CONCLUSIONS Vaccines do not provide lifelong immunity, but can reduce the mortality of those infected. By vaccinating, the rate of patients entering slow progression increases and the threshold is correspondingly reduced. Therefore, vaccination can effectively control the transmission of Coronavirus.

To select effective siRNAs targeting RV-G, a plasmid-based transient co-transfection approach was used. In this, siRNAs were expressed as short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), and their ability to inhibit RV-G gene expression was evaluated in cells transfected with a plasmid expressing RV-G. The nine different siRNAs designed to target RV-G exhibited varying degrees of knockdown of RV-G gene expression. One siRNA (si-G7) with considerable effect in knockdown of RV-G expression also demonstrated significant inhibition of RV multiplication in BHK-21 cells after in vitro challenge with the RV Pasteur virus-11 (PV-11) strain. A decrease in the number of fluorescent foci in siRNA-treated cells and a reduction (86.8 %) in the release of RV into infected cell culture supernatant indicated the anti-rabies potential of siRNA. Similarly, treatment with one siRNA targeting RV-N resulted in a decrease in the number of fluorescent foci and a reduction (85.9 %) in the release of RV. As a dual gene silencing approach where siRNAs targeting RV-G and RV-N genes were expressed from single construct, the anti-rabies-virus effect was observed as an 87.4 % reduction in the release of RV. These results demonstrate that siRNAs targeting RV-G and N, both in single and dual form, have potential as antiviral agent against rabies.

In this study, two families of non-human primates, Old world monkeys (12 Macaca mulatta, 6 Macaca fascicularis) and New world monkeys (6 Callithrix jacchus), were experimentally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical signs were recorded. Samples were collected for analysis of viral shedding, viremia and histopathological examination. Increased body temperature was observed in 100% (12/12) M. mulatta, 33.3% (2/6) M. fascicularis and none (0/6) of C. jacchus post inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. All of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis showed chest radiographic abnormality. Viral genomes were detected in nasal swabs, throat swabs, anal swabs and blood from all 3 species of monkeys. Viral shedding from upper respiratory samples reached the peak between day 6 and day 8 post inoculation. From necropsied M. mulatta and M. fascicularis, the tissues showing virus positive were mainly lung, weasand, bronchus and spleen. No viral genome was seen in any of tissues from 2 necropsied C. jacchus. Severe gross lesions and histopathological changes were observed in lung, heart and stomach of SARS-CoV-2 infected animals.

Material and methods: Retrospective observational study including 2191 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Mean age was 68,0  17,8 years and 597 (27,3%) patients died during follow-up. A total of 827 patients (37,7% of the whole sample), received chronic treatment with statins. Even though they underwent more frequent admissions in critical care units, chronic treatment with statins was not independently associated with all-cause mortality [HR 0,95 (0,72-1,25)]. During the whole hospital admission, 371 patients (16,9%) received at least one dose of statin. Although these patients had a significantly worse clinical profile, both treatment with statins during admission [HR 1,03 (0,78-1,35)] and withdrawal of chronic statin treatment [HR 1,01 (0,78-1,30)] showed a neutral effect in mortality.

As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, the combined risk of concurrent influenza epidemics and the COVID-19 pandemic are a concern. When the status of influenza virus infections during the 2020-2021 flu season was compared to the 2011 to 2020 flu seasons, data indicated the absence of seasonal influenza outbreaks in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated physical, psychological, and social stressors that may create a uniquely difficult recovery and reintegration environment for injured patients. METHODS: Adult (&#8805;18ayears) survivors of moderate-to-severe injury completed a survey 6-14amonths post-injury during the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey queried individuals about the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on injury recovery and assessed post-injury functional and mental health outcomes. Regression models were built to identify factors associated with a perceived negative impact of the pandemic on injury recovery, and to define the relationship between these perceptions and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: Of 597 eligible trauma survivors who were contacted, 403 (67.5%) completed the survey. Twenty-nine percent reported that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted their recovery and 24% reported difficulty accessing needed healthcare. Younger age, lower perceived-socioeconomic status (SES), extremity injury, and prior psychiatric illness were independently associated with negative perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on injury recovery. In adjusted analyses, patients who reported a negative impact of the pandemic on their recovery were more likely to have new functional limitations, daily pain, lower physical and mental component scores of the SF-12 and to screen positive for PTSD and depression.

According to the Fifth Edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines by the National Health Commission, the patients were divided into common type, severe type and critical type. The imaging characteristics including the lung sides of the lesions, lung segment involved, lesion distribution, and lesion number and density were compared among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19. RESULTS: Seventy-seven of the patients had common type, 18 had severe type and 7 had critical type of COVID-19. The main clinical manifestations included fever, cough and fatigue. Severe and critical types were more frequently seen in elderly patients, who were more prone to show such symptoms as asthenia, breathing difficulty and dyspnea. Two patients presented with no obvious abnormality in the first CT examinations; in the remaining 100 patients, 89.0% had bilateral lung lesions, 16.0% had diffuse lesions, involving a mean of 6.564.22 lung segments.

The delivery of viral RNA into most cells hence triggers innate antiviral defenses that recognize viral RNA as foreign. In turn, viruses have evolved mechanisms to subvert these defenses, allowing them to thrive in target cells. Therefore, drugs activating defense to exogenous RNA could serve as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Here we show that transcriptional signatures associated with cellular responses to the delivery of a non-viral exogenous RNA sequence into human cells predict small molecules with broad-spectrum antiviral activity. In particular, transcriptional responses to the delivery of Cas9 mRNA into human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) highly matches those triggered by small molecules with broad-spectrum antiviral activity such as emetine, homoharringtonine, pyrvinium pamoate and anisomycin, indicating that these drugs are potentially active against other RNA viruses. Furthermore, these drugs have been approved for other indications and could thereby be repurposed to novel viruses. We propose that the antiviral activity of these drugs to SARS-CoV-2 should therefore be determined as they have been shown as active against other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Indeed, two of these drugs- emetine and homoharringtonine- were independently shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 as this article was in preparation.

Of the more than 4000 species that make up this family, about a hundred varieties of 6C8 genera are extensively cultivated. One of the most interesting aspects is its high content of glucosinolates, which are plant secondary metabolites with widely demonstrated anti-oncogenic properties that make them healthy. The most relevant Brassicaceae studies related to food and melatonin are examined in this paper. The role of melatonin as a beneficial agent in seedling grown mainly in cabbage and rapeseed and in the postharvest preservation of broccoli is especially analyzed. The beneficial effect of melatonin treatments on the organoleptic properties of these commonly consumed vegetables can be of great interest in the agri-food industry. Melatonin application extends the shelf life of fresh-cut broccoli while maintaining optimal visual and nutritional parameters. In addition, an integrated model indicating the role of melatonin on the organoleptic properties, the biosynthesis of glucosinolates and the regulatory action of these health-relevant compounds with anti-oncogenic activity is presented.","output":"Melatonin in Brassicaceae: Role in Postharvest and Interesting Phytochemicals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mindfulness is the awareness that arises from paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment non-judgmentally as defined by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn. Mindfulness has been practiced for centuries in various traditions and religions. During the last decade, mindfulness has been implemented in clinical trials, psychotherapy, vacation retreats, and even in technology with smartphone applications. AIMS: The aim of this manuscript is to study the interest in mindfulness online. METHODS: A Google Trends analysis was performed for the years 2004C2020, worldwide. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increase for the term mindfulness for the period studied (: 2.14, 95%, confidence interval: 1.96C2.32, P < 0.001). Countries that searched for the term the most were Ireland, Denmark, The Netherlands, Sweden, and New Zealand, while the continent of Africa had the lowest searches. Searches for mindfulness peaked in April 2020, which is possible because of the anxiety caused worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Several successive reports confirmed retrospectively that this new human coronavirus was circulating in different countries worldwide. However, the impact and the role of the emerging HCoV-HKU1 were not defined in children with ARTI. The objective of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology and clinical characteristics of HCoV-HKU1 infection in children with ARTI in Lanzhou, China. METHOD Nasopharyngeal aspiration (NPA) samples were collected from 301 children with ARTI at the First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Gansu Province, China, between November 2007 and October 2008. Demographic data and clinical findings of these children were collected at the same time. The informed consent was obtained from their parents. This study protocol was approved by the hospital ethics committee. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to screen HCoV-HKU1. Furthermore, other common respiratory viruses were screened in HCoV-HKU1 positive samples. All PCR positive products were sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis was conducted. RESULT The overall frequency of HCoV-HKU1 infection was 5.0% (15/301). The HCoV-HKU1 pol gene sequences shared a 95.8% - 99.6% nucleotide identity with the human coronavirus-HKU1 strain, whereas the amino acid identity was 90.7% - 99.3%. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the HCoV-HKU1 strain pol gene clustered with the HCoV-HKU1 strain N15 genotype B (no. DQ415911); 11 of 15 HCoV-HKU1 positive sample tested were mixed-infection. HCoV-HKU1 was detected only from November to April. Positive specimens peaked in November. Children with HCoV-HKU1 infection varied in age from 15 day to 12-years (median age, 10 months). The clinical diagnoses of HCoV-HKU1 positive patients included those with AURI and LURI. The clinical presentations of HCoV-HKU1 positive children included fever, cough, sputum production, diarrhea, vomiting; pharynx engorgement, crackles, and wheezing. The mean hospital stay of the 14 patients was 9.9 days. Six of 15 HCoV-HKU1 positive patients had an underlying illness, and they were all inpatients (hospital stay, mean, 11.2 days). There was no statistically significant difference in the detection rate between the two groups with and without underlying illnesses. CONCLUSION Human CoV-HKU1 infection exists in children with respiratory tract infections in Lanzhou region. A single HCoV-HKU1 genotype B was circulating locally. The symptoms and clinical diagnoses of those infected with HCoV-HKU1 had no specificity as compared with patients with other common respiratory viruses infection.","output":"[Molecular epidemiological and clinical features of coronavirus HKU1 in children with acute respiratory tract infection in Lanzhou]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To analyze the relationship between the traffic inflow and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence in South Korea for formulating prevention policies for novel infections. METHODS: We evaluated the traffic inflow and newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in eight regions of Korea from January 1, 2020, to January 31, 2021. The toll collection system (TCS) traffic volume in 2019-2020 and traffic inflow trends were analyzed using independent samples t-test and nonlinear regression, respectively. The association between the TCS traffic volume and confirmed COVID-19 cases by city was analyzed using correlation analysis. RESULTS: The traffic volume in 2020 showed a 3.7% decrease from that in 2019. The TCS traffic trend in the eight provinces decreased during the first COVID-19 wave, gradually increased until the second wave, decreased after the second wave, and showed a sharp decrease in the third wave. There was a positive correlation between the traffic inflow volume and newly confirmed cases in Busan-Gyeongnam and Jeonbuk, but not in Daegu-Gyeongbuk or Gangwon. CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in the number of new COVID-19 cases in the regions was associated with an increase in traffic inflow. Therefore, the Korean government will be able to establish preventive social distancing policies by identifying increases or decreases in traffic volume. Furthermore, it will be necessary to establish social distancing regulations according to the vaccine supplies in each area in relation to the traffic volume.","output":"Association between the traffic level from other areas and the COVID-19 prevalence at the provincial levels in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, often as a result of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Respiratory failure is characterized by a hyperinflammatory immune response, lung vascular injury, and edema formation. The potential for immunomodulatory therapy to prevent lung vascular injury and edema formation is not well understood. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We show that SARS-CoV-2 infection in humanized K18-hACE-2 mice activated inflammatory NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3)Ccaspase-1 pyroptotic signaling in lungs, release of IL (interleukin)-1, and downregulation of the lung endothelial adherens junction protein VE (vascular endothelial)-cadherin. Primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and displayed pyroptosis-like injury. We observed profound lung vascular injury postCSARS-CoV-2 infection and resultant protein-rich lung edema formation. Selective blockade of IL-1 receptor signaling by IL-1RA (IL-1 receptor antagonist) anakinra prevented downregulation of VE-cadherin, as well as accompanying lung vascular hyperpermeability. IL-1RA also significantly increased survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide insights into the central role of NLRP3Ccaspase-1 pyroptotic innate immune signaling and loss of lung endothelial adherens junctions in the mechanism of acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by SARS-CoV-2.

Antisense RNAs are single-stranded RNAs that occur naturally or are synthetic and enable hybridizing and protein-blocking translation. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to identify target markers in the RNA of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, with a length between 21 and 28 bases that could enable the development of vaccines and therapies based on antisense RNA. We used a search algorithm in C language to compare 3159 complete nucleotide sequences from SARS-CoV-2 downloaded from the repository of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The objective was to verify whether any common sequences were present in all 3159 strains of SARS-CoV-2. In the first of three datasets (SARS-CoV-2), the algorithm found two sequences each of 21 nucleotides (Sequence 1: CTACTGAAGCCTTTGAAAAAA; Sequence 2: TGTGGTTATACCTACTAAAAA).

To prevent further spread of the disease, restrictions of population flow from the government and measures to reduce virus transmission from hospitals may lead to the delay of diagnosis and treatment in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: All NPC patients with radiotherapy indications were included from 20 weekdays before (group A) and after (group B) January 31, 2020, when the institute began to take measures against COVID-19. The waiting intervals of each step and variation from the diagnosis and treatment path of NPC between two groups were compared. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between the group A and group B in the median waiting days for pathological biopsy (5 vs 15, P=0.012), radiotherapy immobilization and simulation (3.5 vs 16.5, P<0.001), validation of position and plan (20 vs 61, P<0.001) and initiation of radiotherapy (28 vs 36, P=0.005). During the waiting period of radiotherapy, 32.4% of the NPC patients received an additional one cycle of chemotherapy to the original treatment strategy. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of COVID-19 caused delay in the diagnosis and treatment of NPC patients to a certain extent. Additional chemotherapy could be considered to counteract the effect of treatment delay.

Though dentists and physicians have different scopes of practice, their trainings share many similarities. Hence, dental professionals, with their knowledge of basic human science and sterile surgical techniques, are an invaluable resource in the COVID-19 pandemic response. Overall, it is commendable that many dentists have risen to the challenge in the fight against COVID-19.

Dental practice will be considerably changed in the post-COVID-19 era. There is a greater need to have refresher courses for practicing dentists on new infection control strategies. Moreover, the curriculum in dental schools should be expanded to include competencies in pandemic and disaster relief.

However, there appears to be a gap between these axiomatic studies and the actual determination of appropriate procedures, as an axiomatic characterization does not directly answer which axiom should be appropriateparticularly when there is no agreement on the relative desirability of criteria. The present study proposes a formal model of procedural choice based on preferences over criteria (PCBPC). Specifically, we focus on the aggregation rule that maps a dichotomous preference profile over criteria for decision procedures to a nonempty set of decision procedures. We prove that the counting rule, which chooses the decision procedures with greatest supports, is the unique aggregation rule that satisfies anonymity (A), neutrality (N), strict monotonicity (SM), and partition consistency (PC), where PC is proposed based on the idea that representations of equivalent criteria in different ways should not affect the results. Two distinct standpoints for PCBPC are highlighted: one is to regard criteria as atomic, i.e., inseparable, objects and the other as composite, i.e., separable, objects.

Interestingly, the genomic architecture of the virus did not match with any of the existing genomic sequencing data of previously sequenced CoVs.

The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of vildagliptin at 24 weeks in the change in HbA(1c) from baseline. The objective of the additional 28 weeks of the study was to assess long-term safety, while also assessing mean change from baseline to study end in HbA(1c), fasting plasma glucose and body weight. RESULTS When added to a stable dose of metformin (mean baseline dose approximately 2 g/day), the non-inferiority of HbA(1c) lowering of vildagliptin to pioglitazone over 24 weeks was established at the non-inferiority margin of 0.3% (between-group difference = 0.1%). During the remaining 28 weeks, comparable HbA(1c) decreases were recorded in both groups. Overall adverse event (AE) rates were similar in both groups, as was the occurrence of peripheral oedema. Hypoglycaemia occurred rarely in both groups. Serious AEs occurred more frequently with pioglitazone group. While mean body weight increased significantly in the pioglitazone group (+2.6 kg) from baseline, there was no significant weight gain with vildagliptin (+0.2 kg). CONCLUSIONS When added to metformin, vildagliptin demonstrates favourable safety and tolerability over 1 year.

The site is an evolutionarily fold unit which is structurally conserved among proteins belonging to the same enzyme class (EC 3). The highly conserved sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro has a Cys-His dyad at the catalytic site that are characteristic of metal-dependent or metal-inhibited hydrolases. Therefore, Mpro was superimposed to the human protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (hPTP1B) which is a key regulator at an early stage in the signalling cascade of the insulin hormone for glucose uptake into cells. Comparatively, the vanadium-ligand binding site of hPTP1B is located in a larger groove on the surface of Mpro. Vanadium constitutes a well-known phosphate analogue. Hence, its study offers possibilities to design promising vanadium-containing binders to SARS-CoV-2.

We now have vaccines to prevent more than 20 life-threatening diseases, helping people of all ages live longer, healthier lives. Yet despite tremendous progress, far too many people around the world, including nearly 20 million infants yearly have insufficient access to vaccines. In some countries, progress has stalled or even reversed, and there is a real risk that complacency will undermine past achievements. Purpose: The current study aimed to explores vaccine hesitancy, its barriers and impact studies regarding COVID-19 decision impacts and to provide policy and decision makers and operational staff with evidence to inform decisions to promote vaccine uptake across Bayelsa State. Methods: : A literature review tried to do a deep dive by using a variety of search engines such as Scopus, Research Gate, Mendeley, Summon, PubMed, Google Scholar, Hinari, Dimension, Academia, CAB Abstract, OARE Abstract, SSRN search strategy to retrieve research publications, grey literature and expert working group reports, including authors field experience. Findings: Absence of uniform methods of organization in the various health care facilities upon which we were obliged to rely. Thus, affecting the overall immunization programme and health system. Hence, policy must urgently address these challenges with emphasis on policy clarity while continuously improving infrastructure. Conclusions: : The findings suggest that the involvement of community-based leaders can improve community participation and acceptance, while enhancing and strengthening integrated disease surveillance and adverse events following immunization (AEFI) monitoring and reporting systems;and conducting integrated advocacy and communications activities to promote demand for vaccination as part of increasing overall demand and acceptability of all essential PHC services.

Specific advice offered by older adults is generally underrepresented in the literature. This qualitative study explores advice offered by older adults to others on how to cope through the COVID-19 pandemic as well as advice for the community about the needs of older adults. A Midwestern sample of 67 older adults aged 70-97 completed one phone interview in June of 2020 as part of a larger study about their experiences with social distancing and isolation. Participants were asked what advice they would give to others during the pandemic and what advice they would give to communities and families about the needs of older adults during the pandemic. Transcripts of these conversations were coded using in vivo and holistic coding as first-cycle methods. These codes were then analyzed using pattern coding as a second-cycle method. Results indicated older adults offered advice along three domains: fostering physical and mental wellbeing, promoting positive life perspectives, and maintaining connections. Advice to communities regarding the needs of older adults included having a selfless attitude and taking intentional actions like grocery shopping and writing letters. However, older adults also recommended avoiding extremes to allow them to maintain their independence and preserve physical distance for safety. Older adults utilized their life perspective and their own coping strategies when offering advice.

The fluorescence microscopy was used to quantify the microvascular parameters. Hypoperfusion and reperfusion caused vasoconstriction, disruption of bloodCbrain barrier, reduction of capillary perfusion and an increase in reactive oxygen species production. Rats treated with Ang II showed exacerbated microvascular damage with stronger vasoconstriction compared to hypoperfused rats, a further increase in leakage, higher decrease in capillary perfusion and marker oxidative stress. Candesartan cilexetil (specific Ang II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) antagonist) administration prior to Ang II prevented the effects induced by Ang II, blunting the hypoperfusionCreperfusion injury. Ang 1-7 or ACE2 activator administration, preserved the pial microcirculation from hypoperfusionCreperfusion damage. These effects of Ang 1-7 were blunted by a Mas (Mas oncogene-encoded protein) receptor antagonist, while Ang II type 2 receptor antagonists did not affect Ang 1-7-induced changes.

However, minimal exploration has been attempted of farmers confidence in agricultural production recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study intends to explore the determinants of farmers confidence in agricultural production recovery in China during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, we analyzed the relationship between risk expectation and social support on the farmers confidence in agricultural production recovery by using the ordered probit model. Cross-sectional survey data were collected from February to March 2020 from 458 farm households in the 7 provinces of China to produce the findings. We found that the risk expectation of farmers had a significant negative impact on farmers confidence in agricultural production recovery. Social support seemingly had a significant positive impact on the farmers confidence in agricultural production recovery, and could play a supportive role in moderating the relationship between risk expectation and farmers confidence in recovery. However, social support alleviates the adverse effect of risk expectation on farmers confidence in agricultural production recovery to a certain extent. In addition, there were intergenerational differences in the effects of risk expectation and social support on farmers confidence in agricultural production recovery. These results imply that policies establishing the risk early warning mechanisms for agricultural production and strengthening the social support from governments and financial institutions are likely to significantly impact agricultural development in the post-COVID-19 era.

Sulodexide is a heparin and glycosaminoglycan compound that has pleiotropic properties within the vascular endothelium that can prove beneficial in COVID-19 patients. Aims: We aimed to evaluate the effect of sulodexide when used in the early clinical stages of COVID-19. Methods: In an outpatient setting, we conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial. Key inclusion criteria were patients within three days of COVID-19 clinical onset and being deemed at high risk (> 50%) of severe clinical disease progression. The risk was assessed using the COVID-19 Health Complication (C19HC) calculator, which clusters the importance of various chronic comorbidities into a percentage value. After inclusion, patients were randomly assigned to receive an oral dose of sulodexide (500 LRU twice a day) or a placebo for 21 days. We performed follow-ups to assess the study endpoints via remote communication with participants or household members every seven days or as deemed necessary. Participants continued the standard of care under the supervision of their healthcare provider's primary physician. The need for hospital care was the primary outcome. Also evaluated, were the need for supplemental oxygen support, D-dimer and C reactive protein (CRP) serum levels, thromboembolic events, and mortality. Physicians responsible to determine the need for hospital care or supplemental oxygen at home were blinded to group allocation. This trial was conducted throughout the regional lockdown caused by the first wave of COVID-19 which caused some unforeseen limitations during the trial. Differences in means were calculated using the Student's t-test, while differences in percentages were assessed using the  2 test. Before and after serum levels in the same patients were analyzed using two paired t-tests. If the data were not normally distributed, a Wilcoxon test was used. A Kaplan-Meier curve was used to graphically compare time-to-endpoint for hospital admission and mortality. Results: 312 patients were included in the intent to treat analysis. At 21 days follow-up, 23 of 155 patients required hospitalization in the sulodexide group compared to 38 of 157 in the placebo group [relative risk (RR), 0.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.38-0.97; p=0.037]. The benefit persisted with a per-protocol analysis (RR 0.6, p=0.031). Fewer patients required oxygen support in the sulodexide group [39 of 155 vs. 56 of 157; RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.9; p=0.04], and for fewer days (9  7.2 in the sulodexide group vs. 11.5  9.6 in the placebo group; p=0.02). Mean D-dimer levels at week 2 were significantly higher in the placebo group than in the sulodexide group (p < 0.01). 28 of the 155 patients (18%) in the sulodexide group showed a D-dimer value > 500 ng/dl, compared to 59 out of 157 (37.5%) in the placebo group (RR of 0.48; 95% CI of 0.31 to 0.67; p > 0.01). Mean C-reactive protein levels at week 2 were lower in the sulodexide group than in the placebo group (p < 0.01). There was no between-group difference concerning, hospital length of stay, thromboembolic events, major bleeding, or mortality. Conclusions: Early intervention on COVID-19 patients with sulodexide resulted in a reduced need for supplemental oxygen and hospital care. The synergistic activity of sulodexide's antithrombotic and non-antithrombotic effects on different biological targets may play an essential role in limiting disease progression. Added a low risk of bleeding or significant side effects, sulodexide might be an alternative to other oral anticoagulants which makes it a valuable medication in the outpatient treatment of COVID-19.

How the epithelium coordinates these tasks remains a question of significant interest. We used imaging and an optical flow analysis pipeline to study the dynamicity of untransformed murine and human intestinal epithelia, cultured atop flexible hydrogel supports. Infection with the pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium (S.Tm) within minutes elicited focal contractions with inward movements of up to 1,000 IECs. Genetics approaches and chimeric epithelial monolayers revealed contractions to be triggered by the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome, which sensed type-III secretion system and flagellar ligands upon bacterial invasion, converting the local tissue into a contraction epicenter. Execution of the response required swift sublytic Gasdermin D pore formation, ion fluxes, and the propagation of a myosin contraction pulse across the tissue. Importantly, focal contractions preceded, and could be uncoupled from, the death and expulsion of infected IECs. In both two-dimensional monolayers and three-dimensional enteroids, multiple infection-elicited contractions coalesced to produce shrinkage of the epithelium as a whole. Monolayers deficient for Caspase-1(-11) or Gasdermin D failed to elicit focal contractions but were still capable of infected IEC death and expulsion. Strikingly, these monolayers lost their integrity to a markedly higher extent than wild-type counterparts. We propose that prompt NAIP/NLRC4/Caspase-1/Gasdermin D/myosinCdependent contractions allow the epithelium to densify its cell packing in infected regions, thereby preventing tissue disintegration due to the subsequent IEC death and expulsion process.","output":"Bacterial detection by NAIP/NLRC4 elicits prompt contractions of intestinal epithelial cell layers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prompt rollout of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA vaccine is facilitating population immunity, which is becoming more dominant than natural infection-mediated immunity. In the midst of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine deployment, understanding the epitope profiles of vaccine-elicited antibodies will be the first step in assessing the functionality of vaccine-induced immunity. In this study, the high-resolution linear epitope profiles of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and COVID-19 patients were delineated by using microarrays mapped with overlapping peptides of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The vaccine-induced antibodies targeting the RBD had a broader distribution across the RBD than that induced by the natural infection. Half-maximal neutralization titers were measured in vitro by live virus neutralization assays. As a result, relatively lower neutralizability was observed in vaccine recipient sera, when normalized to a total anti-RBD IgG titer. However, mutation panel assays targeting the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have shown that the vaccine-induced epitope variety, rich in breadth, may grant resistance against future viral evolutionary escapes, serving as an advantage of vaccine-induced immunity. IMPORTANCE Establishing vaccine-based population immunity has been the key factor in attaining herd protection. Thanks to expedited worldwide research efforts, the potency of mRNA vaccines against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now incontestable. The next debate is regarding the coverage of SARS-CoV-2 variants. In the midst of vaccine deployment, it is of importance to describe the similarities and differences between the immune responses of COVID-19 vaccine recipients and naturally infected individuals. In this study, we demonstrated that the antibody profiles of vaccine recipients are richer in variety, targeting a key protein of the invading virus, than those of naturally infected individuals. Vaccine-elicited antibodies included more nonneutralizing antibodies than infection-elicited antibodies, and their breadth in antibody variations suggested possible resilience against future SARS-CoV-2 variants. The antibody profile achieved by vaccinations in naive individuals provides important insight into the first step toward vaccine-based population immunity.","output":"High-Resolution Linear Epitope Mapping of the Receptor Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein in COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most mathematical models for the spread of disease use differential equations based on uniform mixing assumptions or ad hoc models for the contact process.

We find that the contact network among people is a strongly connected small-world-like graph with a well-defined scale for the degree distribution. However, the locations graph is scale-free, which allows highly efficient outbreak detection by placing sensors in the hubs of the locations network. Within this large-scale simulation framework, we then analyse the relative merits of several proposed mitigation strategies for smallpox spread.

A combination of early case identification, physical distancing, public health measures and a reduction in international travel have been effective in slowing the spread of disease in Australia. Of the 215 cases notified between 8 and 21 June, 75% (163 cases) were notified from Victoria. Most of these cases were acquired locally. In contrast, cases notified from other states (NSW, Qld and WA) over this period were mostly overseas-acquired. Of locally-acquired cases in Victoria in this period, 51% were associated with contacts of a confirmed case or in a known outbreak, while 49% were unable to be linked to another case or were under investigation at the time of reporting. There are several clusters across a range of settings, including extended families, hotel quarantine facilities and a retail store, with most cases limited in geographic spread to a number of Local Government Areas around Melbourne. In response, the Victorian Government has re-introduced restrictions for household and outdoor gatherings, has delayed plans to ease other restrictions and has implemented enhanced public health response activities, particularly with regard to testing and contact tracing. A small proportion of overall cases have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care, with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.4%.

DESIGN: We used a retrospective cohort study to explore cause of death and a nested caseCcontrol study to identify risk factors. SETTING: We explored factors associated with mortality using primary care population data from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2014. Data were obtained from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink which compiles anonymised patient data from primary care in the UK. Cause of death data was supplemented from the Office of National Statistics when available. PARTICIPANTS: The analysis included 70 431 PWE, with 11 241 registered deaths. RESULTS: The number of deaths within the database increased by 69% between the first and last year of the study.

METHODS Twenty-one pigs were divided into four groups: sham group (n=3), control group (n=6), ethyl pyruvate group (n=6) and glycyrrhizin group (n=6). Pigs were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, monitored and given a continuous intravenous infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Twelve hours after the start of the LPS infusion, ethyl pyruvate (30 mg/kg/hr) or glycyrrhizin (1 mg/kg/hr) was administered for 12 hours. Systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics, oxygen exchange, and metabolic status were measured. The concentrations of cytokines in serum and the corresponding gene and protein expressions in tissue samples from liver, lungs, kidneys, small intestine and lymph nodes were measured. RESULTS GL maintained the stability of systemic hemodynamics and improved pulmonary oxygen exchange and metabolic status. GL also attenuated organ injury and decreased the serum levels of HMGB1 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting their gene and protein expression. CONCLUSIONS GL improved systemic hemodynamics and protected vital organs against porcine endotoxemia through modulation of the systemic inflammatory response.

We compared the antibody levels obtained in saliva versus serum/plasma samples from a group of children and adults tested weekly by RT-PCR over 35 days and diagnosed as positive (n=58), and a group of children and adults who consistently tested negative over the follow up period (n=61), in the Summer of 2020 in Barcelona, Spain. Antibody levels in saliva samples from individuals with confirmed RT-PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were significantly higher than in negative individuals and correlated with those measured in sera/plasmas. Higher levels of anti-S IgG were found in asymptomatic individuals that could indicate protection against disease in infected individuals. Higher anti-S IgG and IgM levels in serum/plasma and saliva, respectively, in infected children compared to infected adults could also be related to stronger clinical immunity in them. Among infected children, males had higher levels of saliva IgG to N and RBD than females. Despite overall correlation, individual clustering analysis suggested that responses that may not be detected in blood could be patent in saliva, and vice versa, and therefore that both measurements are complementary. In addition to serum/plasma, measurement of SARS-CoV-2-specific saliva antibodies should be considered as a complementary non-invasive assay to better estimate the percentage of individuals who have experienced coronavirus infection.

Such integration creates a Schottky junction depth that is larger than the UV absorption depth to sufficiently separate the photoinduced electron/hole pairs, boosting the peak internal quantum efficiency over the unity and the external quantum efficiency over 99% under weak UV light without bias. The proposed Ti3 C2 Tx /GaN vdWH UV photodiode demonstrates pronounced photoelectric performances working in self-powered mode, including a large responsivity (284 mA W-1 ), a high specific detectivity (7.06  1013 Jones), and fast response speed (rise/decay time of 7.55 s/1.67 ms). Furthermore, the remarkable photovoltaic behavior leads to an impressive power conversion efficiency of 7.33% under 355 nm UV light illumination. Additionally, this work presents an easy-processing spray-deposition route for the fabrication of large-area UV photodiode arrays that exhibit highly uniform cell-to-cell performance. The MXene/GaN photodiode arrays with high-efficiency and self-powered ability show high potential for many applications, such as energy-saving communication, imaging, and sensing networks.","output":"Self-Powered MXene/GaN van der Waals Heterojunction Ultraviolet Photodiodes with Superhigh Efficiency and Stable Current Outputs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract A recent development in the production of experimental vaccines has been the use of the smallpox vaccine virus (vaccinia virus) as a carrier (vector) of the genes (immunogenes) which code for the protection-inducing proteins (immunogens) of unrelated viruses. The potential of these vector vaccines lies in the hope that such a vaccine would be cheaper, safer and/or more effective than existing vaccines to some pathogens. Vaccinia virus as a vector has attracted most attention to date because: (a) several immunogenes can be inserted into its genome without destroying its infectivity; (b) the immunogens appear to be produced normally; (c) vaccinia virus has been used highly successfully to eradicate smallpox; and (d) it has a wide host-range and thus might find veterinary as well as human medical application. Experimental vaccines, successfully tested in animals, have been prepared using immunogenes from influenza virus, hepatitis B virus and herpes simplex virus. Apathogenic enteric bacteria have some potential as vectors, most probably against enteric pathogens, although the potential of viral vectors is likely to be realized first. Parasitic worms and protozoa devastate millions of people.

Patients with hematologic malignancies typically are known to have higher levels of immunosuppression and may develop more severe respiratory viral infections than patients with solid tumors. Data on COVID-19 in patients with hematologic malignancies are limited. Here we characterize disease severity and mortality and evaluate potential prognostic factors for mortality. METHODS: In this population-based registry study, we collected de-identified data on clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes in adult patients with hematologic malignancies and confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection within the Madrid region of Spain. Our case series included all patients admitted to 22 regional health service hospitals and 5 private healthcare centers between February 28 and May 25, 2020. The primary study outcome was all-cause mortality. We assessed the association between mortality and potential prognostic factors using Cox regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, hematologic malignancy and recent active cancer therapy. RESULTS: Of 833 patients reported, 697 were included in the analyses. Median age was 72 years (IQR 60-79), 413 (60%) patients were male and 479 (69%) and 218 (31%) had lymphoid and myeloid malignancies, respectively. Clinical severity of COVID-19 was severe/critical in 429 (62%) patients. At data cutoff, 230 (33%) patients had died. Age &#8805; 60 years (hazard ratios 3.17-10.1 vs < 50 years), > 2 comorbidities (1.41 vs &#8804; 2), acute myeloid leukemia (2.22 vs non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and active antineoplastic treatment with monoclonal antibodies (202) were associated with increased mortality; conventional chemotherapy showed borderline significance (1.50 vs no active therapy). Conversely, Ph-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (0.33) and active treatment with hypomethylating agents (0.47) were associated with lower mortality. Overall, 574 (82%) patients received antiviral therapy. Mortality with severe/critical COVID-19 was higher with no therapy vs any antiviral combination therapy (2.20). CONCLUSIONS: In this series of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19, mortality was associated with higher age, more comorbidities, type of hematological malignancy and type of antineoplastic therapy. Further studies and long-term follow-up are required to validate these criteria for risk stratification.","output":"Impact of hematologic malignancy and type of cancer therapy on COVID-19 severity and mortality: lessons from a large population-based registry study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, countries applied trade restrictions to insulate their domestic markets from the world market. However, these trade policies could have amplified international market price fluctuations. This paper explores the effects of trade restrictions on international agricultural price volatility. A theoretical model is developed to quantify how trade policies amplify the initial shock. Using panel data covering 71 countries from January 2020 to July 2021, we examine empirically the effects of trade policies on world agricultural price volatility. The results show that trade distortions further induced volatility of world agricultural prices by around 22 percent during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. The multiplier effects are much more substantial in agricultural exporting countries than in importing countries.

METHODS Medical students from any year of training were recruited through the MSN, local radiology interest groups, and social media to attend a 2-week online series of interactive sessions via Zoom with program representatives from Canadian radiology residency programs. A survey evaluating the online series, in particular its impact on residency and career planning, was administered to program representatives and students. RESULTS Fifteen of Canada's 16 radiology residency programs participated in the online series. A total of 212 students attended at least one session and nearly half were participating in the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) this year. The postsurvey revealed that 77% of students agreed that the online series helped prepare them for CaRMS and ranking programs. The online series also benefited pre-CaRMS students as significantly more students were considering radiology as a specialty on the postsurvey compared to the presurvey. Students and program representatives agreed that this series should be held in future years, regardless of whether health and travel restrictions are lifted.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Re\\\\presentation within 10 days for patients discharged from the ED. RESULTS: 83 centres submitted 765 tonsillitis and 416 PTA cases. 54.4% (n = 410) of tonsillitis and 45.3% (187/413) of PTAs were discharged from ED. 9.6% (39/408) of tonsillitis and 10.3% (19/184) of PTA discharges re\\\\presented within 10 days, compared to 9.7% (33/341) and 10.6% (24/224) for those admitted from ED. The subsequent admission rate of those initially discharged from ED was 4.7% for tonsillitis and 3.3% for PTAs. IV steroids and antibiotics increased the percentage of patients able to swallow from 35.8% to 72.5% for tonsillitis (n = 270/754 and 441/608) and from 22.3% to 71.0% for PTA (n = 92/413 and 265/373). 77.2% of PTAs underwent drainage (n = 319/413), with no significant difference in re\\\\presentations in those drained vs not\\\\drained (10.6% vs 9.5%, n = 15/142 vs 4/42, P = .846).

We have selected two geological field sites that expose faulted Miocene sedimentary rocks. We visited these sites with geology undergraduates to teach them the field components of the courses on Field Mapping and Structural Geology at the Universiti Brunei Darussalam. A field assignment was given to students, which had to be submitted at the end of the fieldwork. The same exercise was repeated in the classroom with the UAV aided field data as virtual field exercises. The geological outcrop details were captured at kilometer and millimeter (mm) scales with both the static and dynamic mode of operations. The drone-based imagery was used to generate the 3D point clouds that used 67 oriented photographs to recreate the outcrop details. We discovered that both the traditional and drone based field data are highly useful to capture kilometer to mm scale details. Our results also revealed that students were very engaged during the virtual field exercises, and completed the field assignment with care, which was largely missing during the onsite field exercises.

Folic acid, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and choline have been investigated for this purpose. Folic acid supplementation throughout pregnancy has well-established positive effects. Vitamin D, administered to the mother before birth or to the newborn, has also been shown to reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy have a more uncertain role, with recent trials questioning a beneficial effect on cognition and attention deficit disorder, despite positive effects on prematurity and neonatal wheezing prevention. Choline supplementation is associated with positive effects on cognition and behavior, including early behaviors associated with the development of autism and schizophrenia. There is no experience yet with COVID-19, but adverse effects on fetal brain development of most common coronaviruses are mitigated by higher choline levels. Maternal dietary supplementation of nutrients is a benign and inexpensive intervention in pregnancy to prevent life-long disability from mental illness.

In the United Kingdom, one service that has benefitted from this response is the provision of early medical abortion. England, Wales, and Scotland have all issued approval orders to this effect. These orders allow women to terminate pregnancies up to certain gestational limits, removing the need for them to contravene social distancing measures to access care. However, they are intended only as temporary measures for the duration of the pandemic response. In this paper, we chart these developments and further demonstrate the already acknowledged politicisation of abortion care. We focus on two key elements of the orders: (1) the addition of updated clinical guidance in the Scottish order that suggests an extended gestational limit, and (2) sunset clauses in the English and Welsh orders, as well as an indication of similar intentions in Scotland. In discussing these two issues, we suggest that the refusal of UK governments to introduce telemedical provision of early medical abortion previously has not been based on health concerns. Further, we question whether it would be appropriate for the approval orders to be lifted following the pandemic, suggesting that to do so would represent regressive and harmful policy.","output":"2020 developments in the provision of early medical abortion by telemedicine in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Some respiratory viruses demonstrate neurotropic capacities.

Materials and Methods: Thirty-three convalescents who underwent COVID-19 within the preceding 2C4 weeks, and 35 healthy controls were enrolled. The ground reaction forces were registered with the use of a force platform during quiet standing. The analysis of the resultant center of foot pressure (COP) decomposed into rambling (RAMB) and trembling (TREMB) and sample entropy was conducted. Results: Range of TREMB was significantly increased in subjects who experienced anosmia/hyposmia during COVID-19 when the measurement was performed with closed eyes (p = 0.03). In addition, subjects who reported dyspnea during COVID-19 demonstrated significant increase of length and velocity of COP (p < 0.001), RAMB (p < 0.001), and TREMB (p < 0.001), indicating substantial changes in postural control.

N. gonorrhoeae strain MS11 can express 11 isoforms of these adhesins, called opacity-related (Opa) proteins. Each MS11 Opa protein recognizes a distinct spectrum of CD66 receptors. CD66COpa binding is mediated by the NH(2)-terminal domain of the receptor and occurs through proteinCprotein interactions. In this report, we have investigated the molecular basis for the binding between the CD66 and Opa protein families by mapping amino acids in CD66 receptors that determine Opa protein binding. We performed homologue scanning mutagenesis between CD66e, which binds multiple Opa variants, and CD66b, which binds none, and tested both loss-of-function by CD66e and gain-of-function by CD66b in solution assays and in assays involving full-length receptors expressed by epithelial cells. We found that three residues in the CD66e N-domain are required for maximal Opa protein receptor activity. Opa proteins that recognize the same spectrum of native CD66 molecules showed differential binding of receptors with submaximal activity, indicating that the binding characteristics of these Opa proteins are actually slightly different.

The regulation of minus-strand RNA synthesis has been difficult to study because of the paucity of minus-strand RNA. We have optimized a ribonuclease (RNase) protection assay which enabled the detection of minus-strand RNA synthesis from nonreplicating RNAs, thus clearly separating minus-strand from plus-strand RNA synthesis. We used an MHV defective interfering (DI) RNA containing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene as a reporter to determine the cis-acting signal for MHV minus-strand RNA synthesis. It was found that minus-strand RNAs existed in double-stranded RNA form in the cell. By using various deletion clones, we demonstrated that the cis-acting signal for minus-strand RNA synthesis resides in the 55 nucleotides from the 3' end plus poly(A) tail of the MHV genome. This is much shorter than the 436 nucleotides previously reported for the 3'-end replication signal. No specific upstream MHV sequence was required for the initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis. This finding suggests that the requirement for minus-strand RNA synthesis is much less stringent than that for genomic and subgenomic plus-strand RNA synthesis and that some of the minus-strand RNAs made may not be functional since they may lack the recognition signals for RNA replication or transcription. We further showed that the DI clones which actively transcribed a subgenomic mRNA from an internal intergenic sequence synthesized much less minus-strand RNA than those clones which did not transcribe subgenomic mRNAs, indicating that minus-strand RNA synthesis was inhibited by transcription from an internal promoter of the same DI RNA. This result also suggests that the regulation of the quantities of subgenomic mRNAs is not at the point of minus-strand RNA synthesis but rather at plus-strand RNA synthesis. Furthermore, the finding that the leader sequence was not required for minus-strand RNA synthesis suggests that the leader RNA regulates mRNA transcription during plus-strand RNA synthesis.","output":"Identification of the cis-acting signal for minus-strand RNA synthesis of a murine coronavirus: implications for the role of minus-strand RNA in RNA replication and transcription."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As social work educators and students, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our teaching and learning in challenging ways.

While living in multigenerational households does not protect family members from declining economic well-being, older people living in one- and two-generation households were found to be least affected economically during the crisis. They were also less likely to resort to these coping strategies, insofar as their income was mainly secured from pensions. Although female-headed households did not show a greater reduction in income than male-headed households, they were more likely to adopt income-generating strategies. This article draws attention to the possible effects of decapitalisation and indebtedness on the long-term economic well-being of households with different structures, and the resulting inequalities in their capacity to recover from the effects of the pandemic. The findings suggest that having a source of family income that is not dependent on labour market flows is crucial in times of crises.","output":"Household Coping Strategies During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Chile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Overall, there was no difference in the primary endpoint of days alive without delirium or coma during the intervention period of 14 days (adjusted median 10.7 vs 10.8 days;OR 0.96;95% CI 0.74 to 1.26).

The purpose of this study was to assess whether the stress related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected disease activity in patients with Crohns disease. BASIC METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed to patients through gastroenterology clinics and networks. Patients were asked to report their Crohns disease symptoms in the months prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and again during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic using the Manitoba inflammatory bowel disease index in addition to questions about stress, perception of reasons for symptom change and personal impact. MAIN RESULTS: Out of 243 individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of Crohns disease, there was a 24% relative increase in active symptoms between the pre-COVID-19 period to the during-COVID-19 period (P < 0.0001) reflecting an absolute change from 45 to 56%, respectively. The most frequent reported reason for a change in symptoms was Increased stress/and or feeling overwhelmed (118/236), and personal impact of the pandemic was, Im worrying a lot about the future (113/236), both reported by approximately half of respondents. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: This study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating the impact of a significant and uniquely uniform stressor as a natural experiment on Crohns disease activity. The severity of symptoms of Crohns disease increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary reported reason for symptom change was an increase in stress, not a change in diet, exercise or other lifestyle behaviours, corroborating the hypothesis that stress affects Crohns disease activity.","output":"Stress-related consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on symptoms of Crohns disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ISSUED ADDRESSED: COVID\\\\19 has highlighted the disruptive, cross\\\\sectorial effects a sudden\\\\onset pandemic has on a globally interconnected world.

METHODS: We included all COVID\\\\19 patients admitted to Wenzhou Central Hospital from January to February, 2020. Patients underwent multiple chest CT scans at intervals of 3C10 days. CT features were recorded, such as the lesion lobe, distribution characteristics (subpleural, scattered, or diffused), shape of the lesion, maximum size of the lesion, lesion morphology (ground\\\\glass opacity, GGO), and consolidation features. When consolidation was positive, the boundary was identified to determine its clarity. RESULTS: The ratios of some representative features differed between the remission stage and the progression phase, such as round\\\\shape lesion (8.0% vs. 34.4%), GGO (65.0% vs. 87.5%), consolidation (62.0% vs. 31.3%), large cable sign (59.0% vs. 9.4%), and crazy\\\\paving sign (20.0% vs. 50.0%).

The effects of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China are unknown. Data on COVID-19 daily confirmed cases and daily mean temperatures were collected from 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China between Jan. 20 and Feb. 29, 2020. Locally weighted regression and smoothing scatterplot (LOESS), distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs), and random-effects meta-analysis were used to examine the relationship between daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 and temperature conditions. The daily number of new cases peaked on Feb. 12, and then decreased. The daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 had a biphasic relationship with temperature (with a peak at 10 C), and the daily incidence of COVID-19 decreased at values below and above these values. The overall epidemic intensity of COVID-19 reduced slightly following days with higher temperatures with a relative risk (RR) was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). A random-effect meta-analysis including 28 provinces in mainland China, we confirmed the statistically significant association between temperature and RR during the study period (Coefficient = ?0.0100, 95% CI: ?0.0125, ?0.0074). The DLNMs in Hubei Province (outside of Wuhan) and Wuhan showed similar patterns of temperature. Additionally, a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model, with adjustment for climatic factors, was used to provide a complete characterization of the impact of climate on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic.","output":"Impact of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intermittent and periodic outbreaks of infectious diseases have had profound and lasting effects on societies throughout human history. During the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting coronavirus disease (COVID-19), social distance has been imposed worldwide to limit the spread of the virus. An additional deliberate intention of keeping a minimum safety distance from neighbors can fundamentally alter the social force between individuals. Here, we introduce a new social distance term inspired by gas molecular dynamics and integrate it into an existing agent-based social force model to describe the dynamics of crowds under social-distanced conditions. The advantage of this social distance term over the simple increasing of the repulsive range of other alternatives is that the fundamental crowd properties are precisely described by our model parameters. We compare the new model with the Helbing and Molnars classical model and experimental data, and show that this new model is superior in reproducing experimental data. We demonstrate the usability of this model with a bottleneck motion base case. The new model shows that the bottleneck effect can be significantly alleviated through small wall modifications. Lastly, we explain the mechanism of this improvement and conclude that this improvement is due to spatial asymmetry.","output":"A novel social distance model reveals the sidewall effect at bottlenecks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A health care crisis such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires allocation of hospital staff and resources on short notice.

The most predominant enteroviruses that cause HFMD have traditionally been attributed to enterovirus A71 (EVA71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). Since its first large outbreak in 2008, the dominant HFMD pathogens are constantly changing. In 2013 and 2015, CVA6 exceeded both EVA71 and CVA16 to become the leading cause of HFMD in some provinces. However, there still lacks a comprehensive overview on the molecular epidemiology and evolution of HFMD-related enteroviruses at the national level. In this study, we performed systematic epidemiological analyses of HFMD-related enteroviruses using the data of 64 published papers that met the inclusion criteria, and conducted phylogenetic analyses based on 12,080 partial VP1 sequences identified in China before 31st June 2018. We found that EVA71 prevalence has decreased sharply but other enteroviruses have increased rapidly from 2008 to 2016 and that one subtype of each enterovirus is represented during the epidemic. In addition, four genotypes EVA71_C4, CVA16_B1, CVA6_D and CVA10_C are the most predominant enterovirus strains and collectively they cause over 90% of all HFMD cases in China according to the phylogenetic trees using representative partial VP1 sequences. These four major enterovirus genotypes have different geographical distributions, and they may co-circulate with other genotypes and serotypes. These results suggest that more molecular epidemiological studies should be performed on several enteroviruses simultaneously, and such information should have implications for virological surveillance, disease management, vaccine development and policy-making on the prevention and control of HFMD.

We caution against performance measures that rely solely on restoring testing volumes to pre-pandemic levels because they will be less effective at mitigating excess cancer diagnoses than will targeted measures. These measures might exacerbate pre-existing inequalities in accessing cervical screening by disregarding the risk profile of the individuals attending. Modelling of cervical screening outcomes before and during the pandemic supports risk-based strategies as the most effective way for screening services to recover.

In this specific regard, it is not yet known which are the main psychophysiological drivers of olfactory-related pleasantness, as the current literature has demonstrated the relationship between odor familiarity and odor valence, but has not clarified the consequentiality between the two domains. Here, we enrolled a group of university students to whom olfactory training lasting 3 months was administered. Thanks to the analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) signals at the beginning and at the end of the training period, we observed different autonomic responses, with higher parasympathetically-mediated response at the end of the period with respect to the first evaluation. This possibly suggests that an increased familiarity to the proposed stimuli would lead to a higher tendency towards relaxation.

We studied their association and interactions with lifestyles in 40,768 adults aged over 40 years from a large-scale, hospital-based cohort study collected during 2010C2013. White blood cell counts (WBC) and serum C-reactive protein concentrations (CRP) were used as indexes of immune status. The participants were categorized into four groups by the cutoff points of 6.2  10(9)/L WBC(L-WBC) and <0.5 mg/dL CRP(L-CRP): L-WBC+L-CRP(n = 25,604), H-WBC+L-CRP(n = 13,880), L-WBC+H-CRP(n = 464), and H-WBC+H-CRP(n = 820). The participants in the H-WBC+L-CRP were younger and had higher numbers of males than the L-WBC+L-CRP. MetS risk was higher by 1.75- and 1.86-fold in the H-WBC+L-CRP and H-WBC+H-CRP, respectively, than the L-WBC+L-CRP. MetS components, including plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations, and SBP were elevated in H-WBC+L-CRP and H-WBC+H-CRP compared with L-WBC+L-CR+P. The risk of hyperglycemia and high HbA1c was the highest in the H-WBC+H-CRP among all groups. Areas of WBC counts and serum CRP concentrations were 0.637 and 0.672, respectively, in the receiver operating characteristic curve. Daily intake of energy, carbohydrate, protein, and fat was not significantly different in the groups based on WBC counts and CRP. However, a plant-based diet (PBD), physical activity, and non-smoking were related to lowering WBC counts and CRP, but a Western-style diet was linked to elevating CRP. A high PBD intake and smoking status interacted with immunity to influence MetS risk: a low PBD and current smoking were associated with a higher MetS risk in the H-WBC+H-CRP. In conclusion, overactivated immunity determined by CRP and WBC was associated with MetS risk.

In this paper, we propose a U-Net based segmentation network using attention mechanism. As not all the features extracted from the encoders are useful for segmentation, we propose to incorporate an attention mechanism including a spatial attention module and a channel attention module, to a U-Net architecture to re-weight the feature representation spatially and channel-wise to capture rich contextual relationships for better feature representation. In addition, the focal Tversky loss is introduced to deal with small lesion segmentation. The experiment results, evaluated on a COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset where 473 CT slices are available, demonstrate the proposed method can achieve an accurate and rapid segmentation result on COVID-19.

One of the most prone individuals, even in normal situations is patients with HIV. Currently, the evidence regarding the link between HIV and COVID-19 is still limited and conflicting. This study aims to analyze the relationship between HIV and poor outcomes of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed and Europe PMC database using specific keywords related to our aims until January 12th, 2021. All articles published on COVID-19 and HIV were retrieved. The quality of the study was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) tool for observational studies. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3 software. RESULTS: A total of 38 studies with 18,271,025 COVID-19 patients were included in this meta-analysis.

Although several treatment modalities have been proposed, none have generated satisfying results. Our experiences with PCA-dissecting aneurysms are reviewed and the treatment strategies discussed. METHODS All consecutive patients with PCA-dissecting aneurysm who were treated in a tertiary referral hospital between January 1998 and March 2014 were identified by retrospective review. Their clinical characteristics, radiological findings, treatment modalities and outcomes were documented. RESULTS Of the 21 patients with 21 PCA-dissecting aneurysms, 9 had subarachnoid hemorrhage and 3 had acute infarction of the thalamus at presentation. The aneurysms involved P1 (n = 4), the P1-2 junction (n = 3), mid-P2 (n = 6), P2A (n = 3), P2P (n = 1) and the P2-3 junction (n = 4). The aneurysm shapes were as follows: fusiform (n = 12), partially thrombosed (n = 8) and blood blister-like aneurysms (n = 1). The mean size was 16.6  9.7 mm. Parent artery occlusion (PAO) without bypass (n = 15), PAO with bypass (n = 2), stent-assisted endosaccular coiling (n = 3) and stent placement only (n = 1) were performed. All three patients who underwent stent-assisted endosaccular coiling and the single patient who underwent PAO without bypass developed aneurysm recurrence. Six of the ten patients who received a PAO without a balloon test occlusion (BTO) experienced PCA territory infarction, whereas only one of the five patients who received a PAO after passing the BTO experienced an infarction. CONCLUSIONS PAO for PCA-dissecting aneurysm was effective in preventing recurrence.

Moral injury (MI) has been described as the lasting psychological, biological, spiritual, behavioral and social impact of perpetrating, failing to prevent, or bearing witness to acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectations. These events can provoke emotions such as remorse, guilt and shame, and affects someones self-image and identity. Objective: The aim of the study is to evaluate a treatment protocol that addresses the specific characteristics of moral trauma in treatment of PTSD, next to anxiety. Method: Brief Eclectic Psychotherapy for Moral Trauma (BEP-MT) is an adaptation of the evidence-based Brief Eclectic Psychotherapy for PTSD (BEPP). BEP-MT integrates components of cognitive-behavioural, psychodynamic, constructivist, and systemic psychotherapy. In the current study treatment progress of a refugee Dusan was monitored. Prior to and after treatment the Clinical-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5, the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the Moral Injury Appraisal Scale (MIAS) were administered. Every session moral emotions were assessed on a Likert scale. Results: Whereas PTSD complaints and strong feelings of guilt and shame were manifest prior to treatment, during BEP MT a gradual decline in the intensity of the moral emotions was found. After BEP-MT Dusan no longer met criteria for PTSD and his psychological complaints diminished.

The biodistribution of (111)In-DTPA-MN-14-IRDye 800CW in mice with subcutaneous LS174T tumors showed tumor uptake after 3 d (19.7%  17.0% injected dose/g) comparable to that of (111)In-DTPA-MN-14 but higher accumulation in the liver. The optimal time for imaging after administration of the dual-labeled antibody was 2-3 d after injection. Finally, in mice with intraperitoneally growing LS174T tumor nodules that received (111)In-DTPA-MN-14-IRDye 800CW, intraperitoneal tumor nodules could be localized with SPECT imaging after 3 d and subsequently resected using fluorescence image-guided surgery. CONCLUSION Thus, we showed the feasibility for assessment and image-guided resection of CEA antigen-expressing tumors using dual-labeled MN-14. Both radionuclide detection and fluorescence imaging may provide useful information to improve localization of tumors and radical excision of tumor tissue. Because humanized MN-14 (labetuzumab) is available for clinical use, translation to a clinical setting is the next step.","output":"SPECT- and fluorescence image-guided surgery using a dual-labeled carcinoembryonic antigen-targeting antibody."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing measures implemented by governments worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic have proven an effective intervention to control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. There is a growing literature on predictors of adherence behaviours to social distancing measures, however, there are no comprehensive insights into the nature and types of non-adherence behaviours. To address this gap in the literature, we studied non-adherence in terms of counts of infringements and people's accounts on their behaviours in a sample of North London residents. We focused on the following social distancing rules: keeping 2 mts. distancing, meeting family and friends, and going out for non-essential reasons. A mixed-methods explanatory sequential design was used comprising an online survey (May 1-31, 2020) followed by semi-structured in-depth interviews held with a purposive sample of survey respondents (August 5 -September 21, 2020). A negative binomial regression model (quantitative) and Framework Analysis (qualitative) were undertaken.681 individuals completed the survey, and 30 individuals were interviewed. We integrated survey and interview findings following three levels of the Social Ecological model: individual, interpersonal and community levels. We identified non-adherence behaviours as unintentional (barriers beyond individual's control) and intentional (deliberate decision). Unintentional adherence was reported by interviewees as, lack of controllability in keeping 2 mts. distancing, environmental constraints, social responsibility towards the community and feeling low risk. Intentional non-adherence was statistically associated with and reported as lack of trust in Government, support from friends, and lack of knowledge about rules. In addition, interviewees reported individual risk assessment and decision making on the extent to following the rules, and perceived lack of adherence in the local area. Our findings indicate that unintentional and intentional non-adherence should be improved by Government partnerships with local communities to build trust in social distancing measures;tailored messaging to young adults emphasising the need of protecting others whilst clarifying the risk of transmission;and ensuring COVID-secured environments by working with environmental health officers.

The prevalence and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in inpatients with schizophrenia (SCZ) are unclear. AIM: To assess the prevalence of COVID-19 among inpatients with SCZ and compare the infected to uninfected SCZ patients in a Wuhan psychiatric hospital. METHODS: We retrospectively collected demographic characteristics and clinical profiles of all SCZ patients with COVID-19 at Wuhans Youfu Hospital. RESULTS: Among the 504 SCZ patients, 84 had COVID-19, and we randomly sampled 174 who were uninfected as a comparison group. The overall prevalence of COVID-19 in SCZ patients was 16.7%. Among the 84 SCZ patients with confirmed COVID-19, the median age was 54 years and 76.2% were male. The most common symptom was fever (82%), and less common symptoms were cough (31%), poor appetite (20%), and fatigue (16%). Compared with SCZ patients without COVID-19, those with COVID-19 were older (P = 0.006) and significantly lighter (P = 0.002), and had more comorbid physical diseases (P = 0.001). Surprisingly, those infected were less likely to be smokers (< 0.001) or to be treated with clozapine (P = 0.03). Further logistic regression showed that smoking [odds ratio (OR) = 5.61], clozapine treated (OR = 2.95), and male (OR = 3.48) patients with relatively fewer comorbid physical diseases (OR = 0.098) were at a lower risk for COVID-19. SCZ patients with COVID-19 presented primarily with fever, but only one-third had a cough, which might otherwise be the most common mode of transmission between individuals. CONCLUSION: Two unexpected protective factors for COVID-19 among SCZ inpatients are smoking and clozapine treatment.","output":"Prevalence and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in inpatients with schizophrenia in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organic acidemias such as methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) are a group of inborn errors of metabolism that typically arise from defects in the catabolism of amino and fatty acids.

Here, we surveyed hepatic explants from patients with MMA and unaffected donors, in parallel with samples from various mouse models of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency. We found a widespread posttranslational modification, methylmalonylation, that inhibited enzymes in the urea cycle and glycine cleavage pathway in MMA. Biochemical studies and mouse genetics established that sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) controlled the metabolism of MMA-related posttranslational modifications. SIRT5 was engineered to resist acylation-driven inhibition via lysine to arginine mutagenesis. The modified SIRT5 was used to create an adeno-associated viral 8 (AAV8) vector and systemically delivered to mutant and control mice.

This study aimed to evaluate the relationships between persistent lymphopenia and ARDS. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 125 patients with COVID-19 admitted to government-designated treatment center between 14 January 2020, and 20 March 2020 was conducted. We recorded all complete blood cell counts during the day 0th, 3rd, and 7th following the diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients were grouped based on the depression of the lymphocyte cell count, their return, or their failure to normal. The primary outcome was the occurrence of ARDS, and secondary outcomes included developing vital organ dysfunction and hospital lengths of stay. Results: 17.6% (22/125) patients developed ARDS. The lymphocyte counts with ARDS and non-ARDS were 0.94  109/L, 1.20  109/L at admission, respectively (p = 0.02). On the 3rd and 7th day, the median of lymphocyte count in ARDS was significantly lower than that of non-ARDS. Multivariable logistic regression, which was adjusting for potentially confounding factors (including age, comorbidities, and APACHE II score), showed that persistent lymphopenia within the 7th day was independently associated with ARDS (OR, 3.94 [95% CI, 1.26C12.33, p = 0.018). Further, patients with persistent lymphopenia had longer hospital lengths of stay (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The results showed persistent lymphopenia predicted ARDS after COVID-19. Further studies are needed to investigate whether immunostimulation of lymphocytes within 1 week can reduce ARDS occurrence in patients with COVID-19.

Material and methods This was an online survey on the preparedness for COVID-19 epidemic of medical/non-medical staff and medical students. Questions included in the survey concerned participants socio-demographic characteristics, hospital staff involvement in the training, knowledge about the hand hygiene, and adherence to IPC measures. Knowledge and Performance Index (K&PI) based on selected questions was constructed for to reflect both subjective (self-evaluation) of preparedness and objective IPC knowledge and skills of HCWs participated in the IPC training. Results A total of 1412 health care workers, including 129 medical students, participated in the study. The largest group, 53.6%, was made up of nurses and paramedics. Age of respondents significantly correlated with knowledge of IPC and with K&PI. The mean age of workers with high K&PI was 42.39  12.53, and among those with low, 39.71  13.10, p < 0.001. 51% UHK workers participated in IPC training, but 11.3% of physicians, 28.8% of other HCWs, and 55.8% of students did not know the IPC standard precaution. Most participants, 72.3%, felt that they had received sufficient training; however, 45.8% of students declined this. There was no correlation between self-reported preparedness and the K&PI, indicating that self-reported preparedness was inadequate for knowledge and skills. Nurses and paramedics assessed their knowledge most accurately. Participants with low K&PI and high subjective evaluation constituted a substantial group in all categories. Students least often overestimated (23.8%) and most often (9.6%) underestimated their knowledge and skills. Conclusions Our study revealed inadequate IPC practice, especially as it refers to the training programme.

Although tumor organoids hold significant promise as cancer models, they are also more costly and labor-intensive to cultivate than traditional 2D cell culture. We sought to identify critical factors regulating organoid growth ex vivo, and to use these observations to develop a more efficient organoid expansion method. Using time-lapse imaging of mouse mammary tumor organoids in 3D culture, we observed that outgrowth potential varies non-linearly with initial organoid size. Maximal outgrowth occurred in organoids with a starting size between ~10 to 1000 cells. Based on these observations, we developed a suspension culture method that maintains organoids in the ideal size range, enabling expansion from 1 million to over 100 million cells in less than 2 weeks and less than 3 hours of hands-on time. Our method facilitates the rapid, cost-effective expansion of organoids for CRISPR based studies and other assays requiring a large amount of organoid starting material.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the experience of students with the online education program offered during the initial phase of the pandemic. METHODS: In April 2020, an anonymous online survey was distributed to 248 undergraduate dental and dental hygiene students in Dalhousie University's faculty of dentistry. The survey contained 10 Likert-type and 3 open-ended questions asking students to evaluate their online learning experience and their preferences regarding in-person and online learning. RESULTS: The response rate was 62.5%. Two-thirds (65.8%) of respondents reported that their educational experience in a virtual setting was very or somewhat positive, while only 14.8% said it was negative or somewhat negative. However, 60.6% agreed or strongly agreed that they preferred face-to-face learning over virtual classroom learning. Students were evenly split on whether online teaching should replace classroom teaching where possible (38.1% agreed/strongly agreed, 39.3% disagreed/strongly disagreed). Analysis of the responses to open-ended questions gave rise to 6 themes: online teaching and assessment methods;helpful online instructor behaviours/traits;advantages of online learning;disadvantages of online learning;combining online and in-person learning;online learning during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Although the sudden transition to online learning was generally well received by students, there still appears to be support for maintaining some form of traditional, face-to-face learning methods in dental education.

In this study we established for the first time the prevalence of allergic sensitization in the Norwegian king- and edible crab processing industry and characterized the IgE-reactive proteins. Materials and Methods: Two populations of crab processing workers participated; 119 king crab and 65 edible crab workers. The investigation included information on work tasks and health through a detailed questionnaire. Allergic sensitization was investigated by crab-specific IgE quantification and skin prick tests (SPT) to four in-house prepared crab extracts; raw meat, cooked meat, raw intestines and raw shell. Allergen-specific IgE binding patterns were analyzed by IgE immunoblotting to the four allergen extracts using worker serum samples. Total proteins in crab SPT extracts and immunoblot-based IgE binding proteins were identified by mass spectrometric analysis. Results: Positive SPTs were established in 17.5% of king- and 18.1% of edible crab workers, while elevated IgE to crab were demonstrated in 8.9% of king- and 12.2% of edible crab processing workers. There was no significant difference between the king and edible crab workers with respect to self-reported respiratory symptoms, elevated specific IgE to crab or SPT results. Individual workers exhibited differential IgE binding patterns to different crab extracts, with most frequent binding to tropomyosin and arginine kinase and two novel IgE binding proteins, hemocyanin and enolase, identified as king- and edible crab allergens. Conclusions: Occupational exposure to king- and edible crabs may frequently cause IgE mediated allergic sensitization.

METHODS After standard induction of anesthesia, 135 patients were randomized into three groups: group C (conventional C-MAC videolaryngoscope), group K (King Vision videolaryngoscope), and group D (D blade C-MAC videolaryngoscope). Cervical immobilization was maintained with Manual in line stabilization with anterior part of cervical collar removed. First pass intubation success, time for intubation, and glottic visualization (Cormack - Lehane grade and percentage of glottic opening) were noted. Intubation difficulty score (IDS) was used for grading difficulty of intubation. Five-point Likert scale was used for ease of insertion of laryngoscope. RESULTS First attempt success rate were 100% (45/45), 93.3% (42/45), and 95.6% (43/45) in patients using conventional C-MAC, King Vision, and D blade C-MAC videolaryngoscopes, respectively. Time for intubation in seconds was significantly faster with conventional C-MAC videolaryngoscope (23.3  4.7) compared to D blade C-MAC videolaryngoscope (26.7  7.1), whereas conventional C-MAC and King Vision were comparable (24.9  7.2). Good grade glottic visualization was obtained with all the three videolaryngoscopes. CONCLUSION All the videolaryngoscopes provided good glottic visualization and first attempt success rate. Conventional C-MAC insertion was significantly easier. We conclude that all the three videolaryngoscopes can be used effectively in patients with cervical spine injury.","output":"Comparison of intubation success and glottic visualization using King Vision and C-MAC videolaryngoscopes in patients with cervical spine injuries with cervical immobilization: A randomized clinical trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to understand how chaplains delivered spiritual care to staff during the Covid-19 pandemic.

To this end, health reporting formats should be tailored to the needs and competencies of the target groups and provide comparable and high-quality information. Within the Joint Action on Health Information InfAct, we aimed at gaining an overview of health reporting practices in the EU Member States and associated countries, and developed quality criteria for the preparation of public health reports. The results are intended to facilitate making health information adequately available while reducing inequalities in health reporting across the EU. METHODS: A web-based desk research was conducted among EU Member States and associated countries to generate an overview of different formats of national health reporting and their respective target groups. To identify possible quality criteria for public health reports, an exploratory literature review was performed and earlier projects were analysed. The final set of criteria was developed in exchange with experts from the InfAct consortium. RESULTS: The web-based desk research showed that public health reports are the most frequently used format across countries (94%), most often addressed to scientists and researchers (51%), politicians and decision-makers (41%). However, across all reporting formats, the general public is the most frequently addressed target group. With regards to quality criteria for public health reports, the literature review has yielded few results. Therefore, two earlier projects served as main sources: the Evaluation of National and Regional Public Health Reports and the guideline Good Practice in Health Reportingfrom Germany. In collaboration with experts, quality criteria were identified and grouped into eight categories, ranging from topic selection to presentation of results, and compiled in a checklist for easy reference. CONCLUSION: Health reporting practices in the EU are heterogeneous across Member States. The assembled quality criteria are intended to facilitate the preparation, dissemination and access to better comparable high-quality public health reports as a basis for evidence-based decision-making. A comprehensive conceptual and integrative approach that incorporates the policy perspective would be useful to investigate which dissemination strategies are the most suitable for specific requirements of the targeted groups.","output":"Overview of national health reporting in the EU and quality criteria for public health reports C results of the Joint Action InfAct"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The initial cases of novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in a country are of utmost importance given their impact on healthcare providers, the country's preparedness response, and the initial molding of the public perception toward this pandemic.

The secondary objective is to evaluate the association of elevated cTn with stroke recurrence and death. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will include all cross-sectional, case-control, cohort studies and clinical trials involving IS and ICH adult patients (18 years), published between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 2020 in English or Spanish, reporting the proportion with elevated cTn. We will search PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science by applying predefined search terms. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, retrieve full texts, extract the data in a predesigned form, and assess the risk of bias. We will apply random-effects or fixed-effects meta-analyses to estimate the association between cardiovascular comorbidities, stroke characteristics and renal failure with cTn elevation. We will report results as risk ratios or ORs. We will perform sensitivity analyses for subtypes of cTn (cTn-I and cTn-T), regular versus high-sensitivity assays, and type of stroke (IS vs ICH).

This study was the final stage of a 3-year anxiety screening tool development project that evaluated the psychometric properties and diagnostic screening utility of the Mental Health Screening Tool for Anxiety Disorders (MHS: A), which measures GAD. A total of 527 Koreans completed online and offline (i.e., paper-and pencil) versions of the MHS: A, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ). The participants had an average age of 38.6 years and included 340 (64.5%) females. Participants were also administered the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Internal consistency, convergent/criterion validity, item characteristics, and test information were assessed based on the item response theory (IRT), and a factor analysis and cut-off score analyses were conducted. The MHS: A had good internal consistency and good convergent validity with other anxiety scales. The two versions (online/offline) of the MHS: A were nearly identical (r = 0.908). It had a one-factor structure and showed better diagnostic accuracy (online/offline: sensitivity = 0.98/0.90, specificity = 0.80/0.83) for GAD detection than the GAD-7 and BAI. The IRT analysis indicated that the MHS: A was most informative as a screening tool for GAD. The MHS: A can serve as a clinically useful screening tool for GAD in Korea.

Aim The purpose of this study is to analyze the results of implementing the mini-CEX into the one-month postgraduate residency training in EM. Materials and methods This study is a retrospective review of mini-CEXs completed by ED faculty members from August 2009 to December 2010. All PGY-1 residents enrolled in this study rotated through the one-month EM training. Each PGY-1 resident received one week of trauma training and three weeks of non-trauma training. The clinical competencies of each PGY-1 resident were evaluated with mini-CEXs, rated by a trauma surgeon and three emergency physicians (EPs). We analyzed the validity of weekly mini-CEX and the impact of seniority and specialty training of ED faculties on observation time, feedback time and rating scores. Results Fifty-seven ED faculty members (42 EPs and 15 trauma surgeons) evaluated 183 PGY-1 residents during the 17 months of EM training. ED faculties with different specialty training provided similar assessment processes. Most competencies were rated significantly higher by trauma surgeons than by EPs. On the computerized mini-CEX rating, no data was missed and junior EPs rated all competencies significantly higher. The evaluators and PGY-1 residents were generally satisfied with the computerized format. As compared to the first assessment, only some competencies of PGY-1 residents were rated significantly higher in subsequent evaluations. Conclusion The seniority and specialty training of ED faculty affected the mini-CEX ratings. The computer-based mini-CEX facilitated complete data gathering but showed differences for ED faculty with different levels of seniority. Further studies of the reliability and validity of the mini-CEX for PGY-1 EM training are needed.","output":"Implementation of the mini-clinical evaluation exercise in postgraduate Year 1 residency training in emergency medicine: Clinical experience at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV) has caused a large number of deaths around the globe. There is an urgent need to understand this new virus and develop prophylactic and therapeutic drugs. Since drug development is an expensive, intense and time-consuming path, timely repurposing of the existing drugs is often explored wherein the research avenues including genomics, bioinformatics, molecular modeling approaches offer valuable strengths. Here, we have examined the binding potential of Withaferin-A (Wi-A), Withanone (Wi-N) (active withanolides of Ashwagandha) and Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester (CAPE, bioactive ingredient of propolis) to a highly conserved protein, M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2. We found that Wi-N and CAPE, but not Wi-A, bind to the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) with efficacy and binding energies equivalent to an already claimed N3 protease inhibitor. Similar to N3 inhibitor, Wi-N and CAPE were interacting with the highly conserved residues of the proteases of coronaviruses. The binding stability of these molecules was further analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations. The binding free energies calculated using MM/GBSA for N3 inhibitor, CAPE and Wi-N were also comparable. Data presented here predicted that these natural compounds may possess the potential to inhibit the functional activity of SARS-CoV-2 protease (an essential protein for virus survival), and hence (i) may connect to save time and cost required for designing/development, and initial screening for anti-COVID drugs, (ii) may offer some therapeutic value for the management of novel fatal coronavirus disease, (iii) warrants prioritized further validation in the laboratory and clinical tests.

Website quality was evaluated using the Enlight Quality Assessment tool, a psychometrically validated instrument that addresses seven quality domains. RESULTS Ninety-three websites were identified: 59 for healthcare professionals (7 UK/52 US), and 34 for patients (5 UK/29 US). The websites functioned chiefly as archives for electronic copies of educational materials; a subset (31/93) had additional features. Mean quality ratings for Usability (mean 4.70, SD 0.59), Visual Design (mean 4.03, SD 0.87) and Content (mean 4.31, SD 0.82) were good. General Subjective Evaluation was fair (mean 3.15, SD 1.21).

Nucleic acids and proteins are the major targets in diagnostic assays of viral pathogens. Identification of novel sequences and conformations of nucleic acids as targets is desirable for developing diagnostic assays specific to a virus of interest. Here, we disclose the identification and characterization of a highly conserved antiparallel G-quadruplex (GQ)-forming DNA sequence present within the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The two-quartet GQ with unique loop compositions formed a distinct recognition motif. Design, synthesis, and fine tuning of structure-activity of a set of small molecules led to the identification of a benzobisthiazole-based fluorogenic probe which unambiguously recognizes the target SARS-CoV-2 GQ DNA. A robust cost-effective assay was developed through thermal cycler PCR-based amplification of the antiparallel GQ-forming ORF1ab region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and endpoint fluorescence detection with the probe. An exclusive pH window (3.5-4) helped trigger reliable conformational polymorphism (RCP) involving DNA duplex to GQ transformation, which aided the development of a GQ-RCP platform for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples.

Besides, brain stormoptimization (BSO) with deep belief network (DBN), called BSODBN model is employed for feature extraction. Moreover, beetle antenna search with extreme learning machine (BAS-ELM) method was utilized for classifying the sentiments as to various classes. The use of BSO and BAS algorithms helps to effectively modify the parameters involved in the DBN andELMmodels respectively. The performance validation of the AISA-HCM technique takes place using Twitter data and the outcomes are examined with respect to various measures. The experimental outcomes highlighted the enhanced performance of the AISA-HCM technique over the recent state of art SA approaches with the maximum precision of 0.89, recall of 0.88, Fmeasure of 0.89, and accuracy of 0.94. ? 2022 Tech Science Press.

Methods: We tested the prognostic value of exposure to RAS modifiers (either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE-Is] or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) in a prospective study of hypertensive patients with COVID-19. We analyzed data from 566 patients (mean age 75 years, 54% males, 162 ACE-Is users, and 147 ARBs users) hospitalized in five Italian hospitals. The study used systematic prospective data collection according to a pre-specified protocol. All-cause mortality during hospitalization was the primary outcome. Results: Sixty-six patients died during hospitalization. Exposure to RAS modifiers was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of in-hospital mortality when compared to other BP-lowering strategies (odds ratio [OR]: 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32 to 0.90, p = 0.019). Exposure to ACE-Is was not significantly associated with a reduced risk of in-hospital mortality when compared with patients not treated with RAS modifiers (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.36 to 1.20, p = 0.172). Conversely, ARBs users showed a 59% lower risk of death (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.84, p = 0.016) even after allowance for several prognostic markers, including age, oxygen saturation, occurrence of severe hypotension during hospitalization, and lymphocyte count (adjusted OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.80, p = 0.012). The discontinuation of RAS modifiers during hospitalization did not exert a significant effect (p = 0.515). Conclusions: This prospective study indicates that exposure to ARBs reduces mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","output":"Renin Angiotensin System Blockers and Risk of Mortality in Hypertensive Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19: An Italian Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chest X-ray images are useful for early COVID-19 diagnosis with the advantage that X-ray devices are already available in health centers and images are obtained immediately Some datasets containing X-ray images with cases (pneumonia or COVID-19) and controls have been made available to develop machine-learning-based methods to aid in diagnosing the disease However, these datasets are mainly composed of different sources coming from pre-COVID-19 datasets and COVID-19 datasets Particularly, we have detected a significant bias in some of the released datasets used to train and test diagnostic systems, which might imply that the results published are optimistic and may overestimate the actual predictive capacity of the techniques proposed In this paper, we analyze the existing bias in some commonly used datasets and propose a series of preliminary steps to carry out before the classic machine learning pipeline in order to detect possible biases, to avoid them if possible and to report results that are more representative of the actual predictive power of the methods under analysis CCBY","output":"Bias analysis on public X-ray image datasets of pneumonia and COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate regional classification of highways is a critical prerequisite to implement a tailored safety assessment.

Several active carbons with diverse oxygenated surface groups were obtained by oxidation and reduction methods. All samples were impregnated with [Bmim]Cl at different loadings. The blocked porosity of ionic liquid on SILP materials mainly depends on the amount of ionic liquid and surface oxygen content. In addition, stability of the supported IL in water was tested by analyzing the leached amount of IL. We found that the supported IL is not easily leached from the interface of carbon with low amount of surface oxygen. This may be due to the high free -electron density of oxygen-free supports, forming more CH- bonds with H atoms at the C2 position of the acidic cation. In addition, we propose that dispersion of ionic liquid in the pores depends on the density of surface free -electrons of carbon materials.","output":"Insight into the dispersion behavior of 1-butyl-3-methylimiazolium chloride confined in nanoscale pores of carbon materials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Using the Chinese version of the Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS), this article describes the prevalence of being bullied among a nationally representative sample of Chinese students in grades 6-10 and explores the relationships between being bullied and selected indicators of psychosocial adjustment. METHODS A total of 9015 students in middle schools in Beijing, Hangzhou, Wuhan, and Urumqi completed the Chinese version of the GSHS. Researchers analyzed the results from 2 questions about the frequency and form of being bullied and 11 questions about psychosocial adjustment. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used in the analysis. RESULTS About 25.7% of middle school students reported being bullied on 1 or more of the past 30 days. Rates of being bullied were similar for males and females, but the forms of being bullied were different. Being bullied was significantly lower in Beijing than in the other 3 cities. There were significant psychosocial differences between students who had been bullied and students who had not been bullied. Students who had been involved in a physical fight, often felt lonely, or had considered suicide in the past 30 days were more likely to report being bullied. Students who thought that other students in their school were often kind and helpful, who felt parents often understood their troubles, or who were taught in school how to handle stress were less likely to report being bullied. CONCLUSIONS Being bullied is not uncommon in Chinese middle schools. Chinese schools typically place great emphasis on academic achievement, perhaps at the expense of the social climate of the school.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a piloted survey was administered to CR programs globally via REDCap from April to June 2020. The 50 members of the International Council of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (ICCPR) and personal contacts facilitated program identification. RESULTS: Overall, 1062 (18.3% program response rate) responses were received from 70/111 (63.1% country response rate) countries in the world with existent CR programs. Of these, 367 (49.1%) programs reported they had stopped CR delivery, and 203 (27.1%) stopped temporarily (mean = 8.3  2.8 weeks). Alternative models were delivered in 322 (39.7%) programs, primarily through low-tech modes (n = 226,19.3%). Furthermore, 353 (30.2%) respondents were re-deployed, and 276 (37.3%) felt the need to work due to fear of losing their job, despite the perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 (mean = 30.0%  27.4/100). Also, 266 (22.5%) reported anxiety, 241(20.4%) were concerned about exposing their family, 113 (9.7%) reported increased workload to transition to remote delivery, and 105 (9.0%) were juggling caregiving responsibilities during business hours. Patients were often contacting staff regarding grocery shopping for heart-healthy foods (n = 333, 28.4%), how to use technology to interact with the program (n = 329, 27.9%), having to stop their exercise because they have no place to exercise (n = 303, 25.7%), and their risk of death from COVID-19 due to pre-existing cardiovascular disease (n = 249, 21.2%). Respondents perceived staff (n = 488, 41.3%) and patient (n = 453, 38.6%) personal protective equipment, as well as COVID-19 screening (n = 414, 35.2%), and testing (n = 411, 35.0%) as paramount to in-person service resumption. CONCLUSION: Given the estimated number of CR programs globally, these results suggest approximately 4400 CR programs globally have ceased or temporarily stopped service delivery. Those that remain open are implementing new technologies to ensure their patients receive CR safely, despite the challenges.

C In this cross-sectional study, a survey was completed by 1062 (18.3%) CR programs from 70 (63.1%) countries. C The pandemic has resulted in at least temporary cessation of ~75% of CR programs, with others ceasing initiation of new patients, reducing components delivered, and/or changing of mode delivery with little opportunity for planning and training. C There is also significant psychosocial and economic impact on CR providers.

We aimed to compare oesophageal and regional pleural pressures and to calculate transpulmonary pressures in a prospective physiological study on lung transplant recipients during their stay in the intensive care unit of a tertiary university hospital. Methods Lung transplant recipients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and monitored by oesophageal manometry and dependent and nondependent pleural catheters were investigated during the post-operative period. We performed simultaneous short-time measurements and recordings of oesophageal manometry and pleural pressures. Expiratory and inspiratory P L were computed by subtracting regional P pl or P oes from airway pressure; inspiratory P L was also calculated with the elastance ratio method. Results 16 patients were included. Among them, 14 were analysed. Oesophageal pressures correlated with dependent and nondependent pleural pressures during expiration (R2=0.71, p=0.005 and R2=0.77, p=0.001, respectively) and during inspiration (R2=0.66 for both, p=0.01 and p=0.014, respectively). P L values calculated using P oes were close to those obtained from the dependent pleural catheter but higher than those obtained from the nondependent pleural catheter both during expiration and inspiration. Conclusions In ventilated lung transplant recipients, oesophageal manometry is well correlated with pleural pressure. The absolute value of P oes is higher than P pl of nondependent lung regions and could therefore underestimate the highest level of lung stress in those at high risk of overinflation.","output":"Oesophageal pressure as a surrogate of pleural pressure in mechanically ventilated patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN: A multisite, randomized, controlled, double-blinded phase I/II clinical trial.

Thus, based on the clinical experience in Wuhan, we hypothesized that there is a relationship between the patient's CO2 levels and prognosis. Methods: COVID-19 patients' information was retrospectively collected from medical records at the Leishenshan Hospital, Wuhan. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were conducted to determine the correlation between decreased CO2 levels and disease severity or mortality risk. The Kaplan-Meier curve analysis was coupled with the log-rank test to understand COVID-19 progression in patients with decreased CO2 levels. Curve fitting was used to confirm the correlation between computed tomography scores and CO2 levels. Results: Cox regression analysis showed that the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients correlated with decreased CO2 levels. The adjusted hazard ratios for decreased CO2 levels in COVID-19 patients were 8.710 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.773-27.365, P < 0.001], and 4.754 (95% CI: 1.380-16.370, P = 0.013).

The severe economic crisis accompanying the public health crisis of the COVID-19 outbreak led to an unprecedented wave of State aid cases, which the Commission had to assess in record time. First, the paper analyses the Temporary Framework, a set of guidelines that the Commission announced for the assessment of compatibility of State aid in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The Temporary Framework concerns mainly aid to remedy the serious disturbance in the economy of Member States caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Second, the paper elaborates on cases of aid that also had such purpose but did not fall within the scope of the Temporary Framework, and therefore they were assessed directly under the Treaty. Third, the paper analyses cases of aid to compensate undertakings for damage directly caused by an exceptional occurrence such as the COVID-19 outbreak. Since such aid may cover only damage directly caused by the outbreak, it has a different scope of application than aid under the Temporary Framework, which addresses more generally the negative economic consequences of the outbreak. Finally, the paper addresses certain amendments to existing (at the moment that COVID-19 broke out) regulations and guidelines, which were adjusted in view of that outbreak.","output":"State aid in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, including the Temporary Framework 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this study is to compare the epidemiological variations in COVID-19 patients reported in studies from inside and outside of China. We selected COVID-19 observational studies from eight countries, including, China, Italy, Australia, Canada, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and the USA, comprising a total of 13 studies and performed a meta-analysis for age, gender, fatality rate, and clinical symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The meta-analysis shows that there are differences in symptoms and other characteristics reported by the patients of COVID-19 inside and outside China. Patients in China have a higher proportion of fever, cough, and shortness of breath as compared to patients outside of China. However, we found the opposite results for the gastrointestinal symptoms such as Diarrhea. Patients outside of China have a significantly higher proportion of Diarrhea as compared to patients within China. We also observed gender disparity among our studies, with the male population being more susceptible than the female population. Moreover, the analysis suggests that the fatality rate in China is relatively lower as compared to the fatality rate in other countries.

Human mobility is at the epicenter of that change, as the greatest facilitator for the spread of the virus. To study the change in mobility, to evaluate the efficiency of mobility restriction policies, and to facilitate a better response to possible future crisis, we need to properly understand all mobility data sources at our disposal. Our work is dedicated to the study of private mobility sources, gathered and released by large technological companies. This data is of special interest because, unlike most public sources, it is focused on people, not transportation means. i.e., its unit of measurement is the closest thing to a person in a western society: a phone. Furthermore, the sample of society they cover is large and representative. On the other hand, this sort of data is not directly accessible for anonymity reasons. Thus, properly interpreting its patterns demands caution. Aware of that, we set forth to explore the behavior and inter-relations of private sources of mobility data in the context of Spain. This country represents a good experimental setting because of its large and fast pandemic peak, and for its implementation of a sustained, generalized lockdown. We find private mobility sources to be both correlated and complementary.

Participants were asked to rate their level of agreement with two items about working mothers and childcare and working fathers and household care, and provided open-ended responses to explain their justifications for their rating. Open-ended responses were thematically coded. Results revealed that most participants wanted mothers to have the choice to work but considered childcare a limiting problem that (primarily) mothers should solve. Similarly, participants believed that working full-time did not excuse a husband from helping with chores, however they did not express concerns with the term helping which implies that the husband would not hold any primary responsibility. Overall, the findings suggest the importance for educational and policymaking interventions and future research to highlight practices that support and encourage the role of men in addressing childcare and household needs.","output":"Mother Like Mothers and Work Like Fathers: U.S. Heterosexual College Students Assumptions About Who Should Meet Childcare and Housework Demands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The New York City 911 system recorded 5,700 medical calls on Tuesday, March 24th, the most in recorded history.

Abstract Emerging infectious diseases like Covid-19 cause a major threat to global health. When confronted with new pathogens, individuals generate several beliefs about the epidemic phenomenon. Many studies have shown that individual protective behaviors largely depend on these beliefs. Due to the absence of treatment and vaccine against these emerging pathogens, the relation between these beliefs and these behaviors represents a crucial issue for public health policies. In the premises of the Covid-19 pandemic, several preliminary studies have highlighted a delay in the perception of risk by individuals, which potentially holds back the implementing of the necessary precautionary measures: people underestimated the risks associated with the virus, and therefore also the importance of complying with sanitary guidelines. During the peak of the pandemic, the salience of the threat and of the risk of mortality could then have transformed the way people generate their beliefs. This potentially leads to upheavals in the way they understand the world. Here, we propose to explore the evolution of beliefs and behaviors during the Covid-19 crisis, using the theory of predictive coding and the theory of terror management, two influential frameworks in cognitive science and in social psychology.","output":"Coronavirus: cerveau prdictif et gestion de la terreur"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is still spreading all over the world. As reported, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that initializes viral entry into host cells. Previously, the human defensin 5 (HD5) has been experimentally confirmed to be functional against the SARS-CoV-2. The present study proposes a human cathelicidin known as LL37 that strongly binds to the carboxypeptidase domain of human ACE2 compared to HD5. Therefore, LL37 bears a great potential to be tested as an anti-SARS-CoVD-2 peptide. We investigated the molecular interactions formed between the LL37 and ACE2 as well as HD5 and ACE2 tailed by their thermodynamic stability. The MM-PBSA and free energy landscape analysis outcomes confirmed its possible inhibitory effect against the SARS-CoV-2. The results obtained here could help propose a promising therapeutic strategy against the havoc caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections.

However, the effects of these changes on corticospinal and intracortical circuitry and the motor performance of the knee extensors are unknown. The present two-part investigation aimed to 1) determine the measurement error of an exercise task, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-, and motor nerve stimulation (MNS)-derived responses in women ingesting a monophasic oral contraceptive pill (hormonally-constant) and 2) investigate whether these measures were modulated by menstrual cycle phase (MCP), by examining them before and after an intermittent isometric fatiguing task (60% of maximal voluntary contraction, MVC) with the knee extensors until task failure in eumenorrheic women on days 2, 14, and 21 of the menstrual cycle. The repeatability of neuromuscular measures at baseline and fatigability ranged between moderate and excellent in women taking the oral contraceptive pill. MVC was not affected by MCP (P = 0.790). Voluntary activation (MNS and TMS) peaked on day 14 (P = 0.007 and 0.008, respectively). Whereas corticospinal excitability was unchanged, short-interval intracortical inhibition was greatest on day 21 compared with days 14 and 2 (P < 0.001). Additionally, time to task failure was longer on day 21 than on both days 14 and 2 (24 and 36%, respectively, P = 0.030). The observed changes were larger than the associated measurement errors. These data demonstrate that neuromuscular function and fatigability of the knee extensors vary across the menstrual cycle and may influence exercise performance involving locomotor muscles. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The present two-part study first demonstrated the repeatability of transcranial magnetic stimulation- and electrical motor nerve stimulation-evoked variables in a hormonally constant female population. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the eumenorrheic menstrual cycle affects neuromuscular function. Changing concentrations of neuroactive hormones corresponded to greater voluntary activation on day 14, greater intracortical inhibition on day 21, and lowest fatigability on day 21. These alterations of knee extensor neuromuscular function have implications for locomotor activities.","output":"Menstrual cycle-associated modulations in neuromuscular function and fatigability of the knee extensors in eumenorrheic women."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable and viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which arises in Wuhan, China, and spread all around the world The Genomic analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 is related to severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, so bats could be the possible primary reservoir for this disease Fractional Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine Booster and Rotavirus Study (FIPV) is a macrophage-tropic and it is believed that it causes aberrant cytokine/chemokine expression and lymphocyte depletion, resulting in a lethal disease Some strains of IBV, a V-coronavirus, also affect the urogenital tract of chickens causing renal disease Infections of the reproductive tract with IBV significantly diminish egg production, causing a substantial loss in the egg production industry each year Most adults or children with COVID-19 infection are with mild flu-like symptoms and a few patients are in critical condition and develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, even death of the individuals The intermediate source of origin and the transmission of the virus to humans is not known, the rapid human to human transfer has been confirmed widely There is no clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine available for COVID-19 Recombinant protein from the urban strain of SARS-CoV was administered to mice and hamsters, resulting in the production of antibodies and protection against COVID-19 Prevention is the best solution to stop the spread of coronavirus and hence the global pandemic The current review is about the history of COVID-19 Materials and Methods: We conducted a scoping review to draw information about the History of Coronavirus infection COVID-19 Literature Search and Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria: The information is retrieved by searching the keywords Sampling / Data collection was done by using search engines like Google Scholar, PubMed, Cochrane The total number of articles searched was 30 Conclusion: The present medical support is only by symptomatic treatment as the vaccine is still under trials, hence preventive measures and supportive therapies are the only treatments Most previous studies have focused on epidemiology and potential causes, whereas the current study explores the coronavirus as a whole, ranging from origin to prevention and control ?

However, some patients also experience gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in feces of infected patients. Currently there is huge evolving research interest in this potentially lethal disease. We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the evidence suggesting involvement of the digestive system in COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed, Medline and Embase databases were searched up to 10 April 2020, using suitable keywords. Individual and pooled prevalence rates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the fixed- or random-effects model as appropriate. Heterogeneity between studies was calculated employing the Cochran Q test and I(2) values, whereas the possibility of publication bias was examined by constructing funnel plots. Additionally, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In adult COVID-19 patients, the prevalence rates (95%CI) for all GI symptoms, and separately for diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal discomfort/pain were 9.8% (6.4-14.7), 10.4% (95%CI 7.7-13.9), 7.7% (95%CI 4.8-12.1), and 6.9% (95%CI 3.9-11.9) respectively. The prevalence rates for children were 9.6% (95%CI 6.3-14.3) for all symptoms, 9.6% (95%CI 6.3-14.3) for diarrhea, and 6.8% (95% CI 4.2-11) for nausea/vomiting.

The feasibility of this endovascular method has not been reported in children. OBJECTIVE To report our experience treating pediatric AVMs with the transvenous approach (TVA). METHODS A cohort of 7 pediatric patients (younger than 18 years of age) who underwent the TVA for cerebral AVMs between January 2012 and January 2014. The TVA was used alone or in conjunction with other arterial approaches in definitive embolization sessions. Patient demographics, AVM characteristics, clinical outcomes, and angiographic results were independently assessed. Pial arteriovenous fistulae and vein of Galen malformations were excluded. Control angiograms were obtained at 6 months, and curative treatment was determined by the anatomic obliteration of the nidus. RESULTS All patients had anatomic exclusion of the AVM. The mean size was 2  0.6 cm, and hemorrhage was the most common presentation (100%, n = 7). Most AVMs were deeply placed (71%, n = 5), and a proximal approach to the nidus was achieved in all cases. Transvenous embolization alone was performed in 3 patients (43%), whereas combined arterial and venous embolization was required in 4 patients (57%). The mean follow-up period was 20.2  10.5 months. There were no hemorrhagic or thromboembolic events, and venous infarction was not documented. No recurrence was documented.

It has become a challenge for a nations survival and hence has evolved to cyber warfare. Malware is a key component of cyber-crime, and its analysis is the first line of defence against attack. This work proposes a novel deep boosted hybrid learning-based malware classification framework and named as Deep boosted Feature Space-based Malware classification (DFS-MC). In the proposed framework, the discrimination power is enhanced by fusing the feature spaces of the best performing customized CNN architectures models and its discrimination by an SVM for classification. The discrimination capacity of the proposed classification framework is assessed by comparing it against the standard customized CNNs. The customized CNN models are implemented in two ways: softmax classifier and deep hybrid learning-based malware classification. In the hybrid learning, Deep features are extracted from customized CNN architectures and fed into the conventional machine learning classifier to improve the classification performance. We also introduced the concept of transfer learning in a customized CNN architecture based malware classification framework through fine-tuning. The performance of the proposed malware classification approaches are validated on the MalImg malware dataset using the hold-out cross-validation technique. Experimental comparisons were conducted by employing innovative, customized CNN, trained from scratch and fine-tuning the customized CNN using transfer learning.

Our atomic-detailed structural predictions reveal a rich dynamics in these RNA molecules, could help the experimental characterisation of these systems, and provide putative three-dimensional models for structure-based drug design studies.","output":"Conformational Ensembles of Non-Coding Elements in the SARS-CoV-2 Genome from Molecular Dynamics Simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The South Korean government effectively contained the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak primarily associated with a religious group.

The SL and SV interfacial tensions SL - S0 and SV - S0 relative to that for bare solid surface S0, respectively, were obtained by simple force balance relations on fluid-containing control volumes set around the bottom and top ends of the solid cylinder, which are subject to the fluid stress and the force from the solid. The theoretical contact angle calculated by Young's equation using these interfacial tensions agreed well with the apparent contact angle estimated by the analytical solution to fit the meniscus shape, showing that Young's equation holds even for the menisci around solids with nanoscale curvature. We have also found that the curvature effect on the contact angle was surprisingly small while it was indeed large on the local forces exerted on the solid cylinder near the contact line. In addition, the present results showed that the curvature dependence of the SL and SV interfacial free energies, which are the interfacial tensions, is different from that of the corresponding interfacial potential energies.","output":"Quantifying the solid-fluid interfacial tensions depending on the substrate curvature: Young's equation holds for wetting around nanoscale cylinder."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A study with a societal objective was carried out on people exchanging on social networks and more particularly on Twitter to observe their feelings on the COVID-19.

An umbrella and mapping review with metaCmeta-analysis (MMA) of the available scientific evidence was performed to determine if telerehabilitation could be an effective alternative to conventional rehabilitation in physical therapist practice. METHODS: A systematic review of reviews and a synthesis of the findings of all systematic evidence published to date with a visual map and a meta-meta-analysis (MMA) were performed. A systematic search was realized in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), MEDLINE (PubMed), and Google Scholar. Two independent reviewers performed a data analysis and assessed the quality of the included reviews, assessing the risk of bias using ROBIS. RESULTS: Twenty-nine articles that met the inclusion criteria were selected and divided according to the type of patient targeted for rehabilitation (patients with cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and neurological conditions). The MMA regarding physical function between telerehabilitation and usual care rehabilitation did not reveal a statistically significant difference for patients with cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal conditions. For patients with neurological conditions, the MMA revealed a statistically significant but negligible effect size in 6 reviews in favor of telerehabilitation (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.18; 95% CI = 0.03C0.34). CONCLUSION: The results of the present review showed that telerehabilitation offers positive clinical results, even comparable to conventional face-to-face rehabilitation approaches.

The present study aimed to estimate the prevalence of insomnia and explore its associations in the general population of Qatar. With almost 100 nationalities, Qatar is one of the most culturally diverse, richest, and fastest developing countries in the Arabian Peninsula. METHODS: A probability sample of community-dwelling adults were surveyed in February of 2019. A total of 1611 respondents completed face-to-face interviews in Arabic or English. Logistic regression modeled associations with insomnia, our dependent variable, as defined by a score of 16 on the eight-item Sleep Condition Indicator or according to criteria for insomnia in the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition or DSM-5. RESULTS: Approximately, 5.5% of the sample screened positive for insomnia and the 30-day prevalence of those who met all the DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder was 3.0%. In addition, 2.0% of the sample screened positive for depression and 3.4% for anxiety in the past 2 weeks. Multivariable analysis showed the following were significantly associated with insomnia: Arab ethnicity, young age, unemployment, being married, having less than high school education, fair or poor health, anxiety, and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia prevalence was in the lower range of previously reported DSM-defined estimates from developed Western countries. Our findings highlight the need for raising awareness and improving sleep hygiene in potential risk groups such as younger adults and those of Arab ethnicity, in addition to incorporating insomnia screening in the provision of mental health services.

This study was conducted in the immediate aftermath of this difficult period. OBJECTIVES: to describe clinical characteristics, short-term outcomes, and management of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that accessed the emergency department (ED) of the San Luigi Gonzaga hospital of Orbassano (Turin district, Piedmont Region, Northern Italy) in March and April 2020. Furthermore, this study aimed at investigating if a difference in patients characteristics, clinical management, and outcomes was present during time. DESIGN: comparison of different periods in a clinical cohort. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: for each patient who accessed the ED and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 swab, the ED medical record was collected and a descriptive analysis was performed on demographical characteristics, pre-existing comorbidities, parameters measured at triage, imaging exams results, lab tests results, separately for patients admitted at the ED in four different periods. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: discharge from ED, admission to hospital wards (low and high intensity of care), short term in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay. The association between patients' characteristics and the main outcomes was measured using multivariable logistic models. RESULTS: age of patients increased significantly from March to April, together with female prevalence and associated comorbid conditions. A significant difference in symptoms at presentation was not observed nor it was in laboratory test results. Severity at triage and need of intensive care resources were higher in the first weeks, together with the typical clinical presentation with respiratory failure and imaging with signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, in-hospital mortality was higher in the first period. Nevertheless, nearly half of patients in the first period were discharged directly from ED showing mild COVID-19 cases. On the contrary, in April an increasing need of hospitalisation in low intensity of care beds was observed, whereas mild cases stopped to access the ED. CONCLUSIONS: the results of this study suggest that in few weeks of COVID-19 epidemic both management of the patients at the hospital level - and probably at territorial level resulting in a different population who accessed to the ED - and the clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients changed.","output":"Clinical characteristics and management of COVID-19 patients accessing the emergency department in a hospital in Northern Italy in March and April 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rise in cases of COVID-19, a bizarre situation of pressure was mounted on each country to make arrangements to control the population and utilize the available resources appropriately.

The data collection tools used in the study include a demographic questionnaire and a Templer death-anxiety questionnaire. FINDINGS: The results showed that the level of death anxiety in nurses working at COVID-19 intensive care units is associated with age, working hours per week, childbearing, several patients needing end-of-life care, cases of direct participation in resuscitation operations, cases of patient death observations, and satisfaction with personal protective equipment (P < o.o5).

Stimulation of a proper immune response that leads to protection is highly dependent on presentation of epitopes to circulating T-cells via the HLA complex. SARS-CoV-2 is a large RNA virus and testing of all of its overlapping peptides in vitro to deconvolute an immune response is not feasible. Therefore HLA-binding prediction tools are often used to narrow down the number of peptides to test. We tested NetMHC suite tools' predictions by using an in vitro peptide-MHC stability assay. We assessed 777 peptides that were predicted to be good binders across 11 MHC alleles in a complex-stability assay and tested a selection of 19 epitope-HLA-binding prediction tools against the assay. In this investigation of potential SARS-CoV-2 epitopes we found that current prediction tools vary in performance when assessing binding stability, and they are highly dependent on the MHC allele in question. Designing a COVID-19 vaccine where only a few epitope targets are included is therefore a very challenging task.

Early cohort studies have suggested declines in levels of antibodies in individuals, associated with, for example, illness severity, age and co-morbidities. This protocol focuses on the seroprevalence among primary health care providers (PHCPs) in Belgium. They manage the vast majority of COVID-19 patients in addition to other patients and therefore play an essential role in the efficient organisation of health care. Currently, evidence is lacking on 1. how many PHCPs get infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Belgium, 2. the rate at which this happens, 3. their clinical spectrum, 4. their risk factors, 5. the effectiveness of the measures to prevent infection and 6. the accuracy of the serology-based point-of-care test in a primary care setting. Methods and analysis This study will be set up as a prospective cohort study. General practitioners (GPs) and other PHCPs (working in a GP practice) will be recruited via professional networks and professional media outlets to register online to participate. Registered GPs and other PHCPs will be asked at each testing point (n=9) to perform a capillary blood sample antibody point-of-care test (OrientGene) and complete an online questionnaire.

We identified 14 proteins that were predicted to interact with host RNAs or RNA binding proteins, based on published data for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Here, we describe a series of affinity-tagged and codon-optimized expression constructs for each of these 14 proteins. Each viral gene was separately tagged at the N-terminus with Flag-His (8), the C-terminus with His (8)-Flag, or left untagged. The resulting constructs were stably integrated into the HEK293 Flp-In T-REx genome. Each viral gene was expressed under the control of an inducible Tet-On promoter, allowing expression levels to be tuned to match physiological conditions during infection. Expression time courses were successfully generated for most of the fusion proteins and quantified by western blot. A few fusion proteins were poorly expressed, whereas others, including Nsp1, Nsp12, and N protein, were toxic unless care was taken to minimize background expression.

Random-effect meta-analysis was used to pool estimates of odds ratio (OR) or weighted mean difference (WMD) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across studies. Meta-analysis data were available for age, sex, hospital duration, disease severity, seven comorbidities, five symptoms, five indexes of blood routine, nine indexes of blood biochemistry, four treatment therapies, two antibodies, and history of high-risk contact. Among them, hospital duration of recurrence cases was significantly shorter than nonrecurrence subjects (WMD, -1.55 days; 95% CI, -2.66 to -0.45). Fatigue, positive Immunoglobulin M (IgM), and positive IgG were associated with an increased risk of recurrence cases, with ORs and 95% CIs of 4.06 (1.14-14.4), 2.95 (1.15-7.61), and 3.45 (1.58-7.54), respectively. In contrast, the odds of recurrence cases were observed to significantly lower in subjects with elevated lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein, low lymphocyte count, steroid and arbidol use, with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.08 (0.27-4.37), 0.49 (0.27-0.97), 0.64 (0.42-0.97), 0.48 (0.25-0.96), and 0.48 (0.25-0.92), respectively.

We developed the COVID-19 Acuity Score (CoVA) using automatically extracted data from the electronic medical record and learning-to-rank ordinal logistic regression modeling. Calibration was assessed using predicted-to-observed ratio (E/O). Discrimination was assessed by C-statistics (AUC). RESULTS. In the development cohort, 27.3%, 7.2%, and 1.1% of patients experienced hospitalization, critical illness, or death, respectively; and in the prospective cohort, 26.1%, 6.3%, and 0.5%. CoVA showed excellent performance in the development cohort (concurrent validation) for hospitalization (E/O: 1.00, AUC: 0.80); for critical illness (E/O: 1.00, AUC: 0.82); and for death (E/O: 1.00, AUC: 0.87). Performance in the prospective cohort (prospective validation) was similar for hospitalization (E/O: 1.01, AUC: 0.76); for critical illness (E/O 1.03, AUC: 0.79); and for death (E/O: 1.63, AUC=0.93).

As medical resources are limited, deciding on the proper allocation of these resources is a very crucial issue. Besides, uncertainty is a major factor that can affect decisions, especially in medical fields. To cope with these issues, we use fuzzy logic (FL) as one of the most suitable methods in modeling systems with high uncertainty and complexity. We intend to make use of the advantages of FL in decisions on cases that need to treat in ICU. In this study, an interval type-2 fuzzy expert system is proposed for the prediction of ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. For this prediction task, we also developed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Finally, the results of these fuzzy systems are compared to some well-known classification methods such as Naive Bayes (NB), Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), Decision Tree (DT), and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The results show that the type-2 fuzzy expert system and ANFIS models perform competitively in terms of accuracy and F-measure compared to the other diagnosis systems.","output":"Fuzzy expert systems for prediction of ICU admission in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At present, the whole world is facing the serious challenge of COVID-19, and it has reached a consensus that taking appropriate measures timely is the key to prevent and control infectious diseases.

First of all, we have compared various data structures for keeping the comparison results of alternatives. After comparisons, we adopt the hesitant fuzzy incomplete probabilistic linguistic preference relation matrix to save the information which can keep the first-hand valuable collected data to the maximum extent;then, we can obtain the missing values with the help of the fault tree analysis method, which can consider both subjective evaluation data and objective historical data simultaneously. Meanwhile, the fault tree analysis method can find development laws with the help of similar infectious diseases that have occurred in the past. The definition of consistency index is also introduced which can measure whether there are contradictions and the degree of contradiction in the decision results. Only those data that meet the consistency requirements can be used for decision-making and then a method is proposed to effectively reduce the degree of inconsistency. The information aggregation method will be adopted subsequently, and we can obtain the ranking of alternatives.

By considering the most up to date information on GDP and carbon intensity of production, this paper represents one of the first attempts to estimate the CO2 emissions change that have taken place in Europe during the first six months of 2020. Results show that more than 195,600 thousand tons of CO2 have been avoided between January and June 2020, compared to the same period of the previous year, representing a -12.1% emissions change. The largest reductions have taken place in the Manufacturing, Wholesale, Retail Trade, Transport, Accommodation and Food Service sectors, accounting for more than 93.7% of total CO2 change. Spain, Italy and France have been the most affected areas with -106,600 thousand tons emissions drop. In line with the results provided by previous studies, this paper highlights that the geographical and the sectoral distribution of the CO2 emissions change has been largely influenced by the magnitude of the COVID-19 impacts. In addition, the carbon intensity of production, characterizing the most affected economic activities, has been the main element of differentiation compared to the previous 2008 crisis. By providing preliminary estimation of the CO2 emissions change that have taken place across geographical and sectoral activities, this paper contributes to the existing climate policy debate and can support future estimation of CO2 variations both in a context of confinement release as well as in a context of reintroduced COVID-19 restrictions.","output":"Estimating the European CO2 emissions change due to COVID-19 restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human enteric pathogens are a major global concern, as they are responsible for thousands of preventable deaths every year. New pathogens in wastewater are constantly emerging. For example, SARS-CoV-2 has been recently detected in domestic sewage and primary sludge. Knowledge about the reduction of viruses in wastewater treatment and their partitioning between the treated liquid effluent versus the sludge or biosolids is still very scarce, especially in countries with emerging economies and tropical climates. Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors are among the top three most commonly used technologies for the treatment of sewage in Latin America and the Caribbean, and their use has become increasingly common in many other low- and middle-income countries. High-rate algal ponds (HRAP) are regarded as a sustainable technology for the post-treatment of UASB effluent. This study evaluated the overall reduction and the liquid-solid partitioning of somatic coliphages, F-specific coliphages, and E. coli in a pilot-scale system comprised of a UASB reactor followed by HRAPs treating real wastewater. Average log removal for somatic and F-specific coliphages were 0.40 and 0.56 for the UASB reactor, and 1.15 and 1.70 for HRAPs, respectively. The overall removal of both phages in the system was 2.06-log. Removal of E. coli was consistently higher. The number of viruses leaving the system in the UASB solids and algal biomass was less than 10% of the number leaving in the clarified liquid effluent. The number of E. coli leaving the system in solids residuals was estimated to be approximately one order of magnitude higher than the number of E. coli leaving in the liquid effluent. Results from this study demonstrate the suitability of UASB-HRAP systems to reduce viral and bacterial indicators from domestic sewage and the importance of adequately treating sludge for pathogen reduction before they are used as biosolids.","output":"Reduction and partitioning of viral and bacterial indicators in a UASB reactor followed by high rate algal ponds treating domestic sewage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The p28 and p65 proteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) are the most amino-terminal protein domains of the replicase polyprotein.

Although critical residues for CS1 cleavage have been mapped in vitro, the requirements for cleavage have not been studied in infected cells. To define the determinants of CS1 cleavage and the role of processing at this site during MHV replication, mutations and deletions were engineered in the replicase polyprotein at CS1. Mutations predicted to allow cleavage at CS1 yielded viable virus that grew to wild-type MHV titers and showed normal expression and processing of p28 and p65. Mutant viruses containing predicted noncleaving mutations or a CS1 deletion were also viable but demonstrated delayed growth kinetics, reduced peak titers, decreased RNA synthesis, and small plaques compared to wild-type controls. No p28 or p65 was detected in cells infected with predicted noncleaving CS1 mutants or the CS1 deletion mutant; however, a new protein of 93 kDa was detected. All introduced mutations and the deletion were retained during repeated virus passages in culture, and no phenotypic reversion was observed. The results of this study demonstrate that cleavage between p28 and p65 at CS1 is not required for MHV replication. However, proteolytic separation of p28 from p65 is necessary for optimal RNA synthesis and virus growth, suggesting important roles for these proteins in the formation or function of viral replication complexes.","output":"Cleavage between replicase proteins p28 and p65 of mouse hepatitis virus is not required for virus replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasing informal urbanism in Africa exposes its residents to multiple shocks, including urban public health pandemics. South Africa is not an exception due to the squalid living conditions, lack of essential services and amenities, and overcrowding characterizing informal settlements. We argue that such conditions compromise the liveability of the informal settlements and the wellbeing of the communities. The urban health inequality concept is used to analyse the risks and vulnerability of informal settlements to public health problems. This study uses the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) to investigate the exposure of the urban poor in South Africas informal settlements to public health crises. This study is ethnographic and uses the case of Dinaweng informal settlement, Bloemfontein. Data was collected from secondary data sources triangulated with 60 in-depth interviews with household heads to enhance the validity of the findings. The study found that the poor in Dinaweng are disproportionately affected by disease pandemics that are exacerbated by the challenges in their daily lives characterized by their informal livelihoods. We conclude that informal settlements are complex spaces that require carefully considered strategies and responses for addressing pandemics such as COVID-19;otherwise, the residents in these settlements remain marginalized.

METHODS In May 2020, attendees of the virtual Research in Education and Practice Symposium (REPS) were invited to participate in two 1-hour networking sessions. During these sessions, participants completed individual and group reflection exercises where they were asked questions about their experiences during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants who volunteered submitted their responses through an electronic survey application. Anonymous responses were coded using thematic analysis to address the research questions. RESULTS Sixty-eight and 38 participants, respectively, attended the 2 networking discussions. Participant-identified professional impacts of the COVID-19 crisis included unexpected learning experiences, greater adaptability, workflow and learning interruptions, and decreased productivity. Personal impacts included a greater focus on well-being, physical and social isolation, and changes in travel plans. Participants noted positive and negative emotions including acceptance, encouragement, anxiety, stress, and frustration. The main lessons learned focused on adaptability, gratitude, and empathy. Participants shared that they wished they would have known the anticipated duration of the pandemic, associated workflow changes, and reliance on technology prior to the start of the pandemic. In addition, they predicted that pharmacy practice will require changes to workflow flexibility, training expectations, the pharmacist's role, and organizational structure.

METHODS Reductions in age- and sex-specific mortality seen in each BRICS country between 1990 and 2011 were measured. These results were compared with those of the best-performing countries in the world and the best-performing countries with similar income levels. We estimated each country's progress in reducing mortality and compared changes in that country's mortality rates against other countries with similar mean incomes to examine changes in avoidable mortality. FINDINGS The relative health performance of the five study countries differed markedly over the study period. Brazil demonstrated fairly even improvement in relative health performance across the different age and sex subgroups that we assessed. India's improvement was more modest and more varied across the subgroups. South Africa and the Russian Federation exhibited large declines in health performance as well as large sex-specific inequalities in health. Although China's levels of avoidable mortality decreased in absolute terms, the level of improvement appeared low in the context of China's economic growth. CONCLUSION When evaluating a country's health performance in terms of avoidable mortality, it is useful to compare that performance against the performance of other countries.

Pandemic proportion brings into the foreground the number of people with severe forms of the disease, putting aside the fact that a large portion of the population is an asymptomatic, making them silent carriers of the virus. Additional confusion is made by inconsistent data about the presence of the virus in the nasopharyngeal region and the manifestation of the disease symptoms. Different tissue distribution of virus in the body starting from guts, liver, muscles, kidney etc. without any signs of tissue destruction, opens up the possibility that individuals with negative results of PCR test in the nasopharyngeal swab may also be latent carriers of the infection. Overall clinical presentation of the disease is influenced by the initial protection gained through the accumulated \\"experience\\" collected from previous encountering of corona family and noncorona viruses, resulting in overlapping of the humoral and cellular immunity. Apart from this, unjustifiably neglected but very significant form of host defense against infection is disease tolerance based on cohabitation with pathogen. It is important to note that consequences of the disease tolerance in terms of pathological and epidemiological aspects are quite different then classical antiviral immune response. This work will elaborate the impact of virome on the course of infection at all stages taking into account both immune resistance, as an ability of the host immune system to eliminate pathogen, and disease tolerance, as a form of host defense with neutral to positive impact to pathogen load.

Video consultation is one form that enables early detection of deteriorating patients and promotion of self-efficacy in patients who are well but anxious. Abdominal pain is a common symptom presented by patients in emergency departments. These patients could benefit from video consultation, as it enables remote follow-up of patients who do not require admission and facilitates early discharge of patients from overcrowded hospitals. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of digital telereview in patients presenting with undifferentiated acute abdominal pain. METHODS: The SAVED study was a prospective randomized controlled trial in which follow-up using existing telephone-based telereview (control) was compared with digital telereview (intervention). Patients with undifferentiated acute abdominal pain discharged from the emergency department observation ward were studied based on intention-to-treat. The control arm received routine, provider-scheduled telereview with missed reviews actively coordinated and rescheduled by emergency department staff. The intervention arm received access to a platform for digital telereview (asynchronous and synchronous format) that enabled patient-led appointment rescheduling. Patients were followed-up for 2 weeks for outcomes of service utilization, efficacy (compliance with their disposition plan), and safety (re-presentation for the same condition). RESULTS: A total of 70 patients participated, with patients randomly assigned to each arm (1:1 ratio). Patients were a mean age of 40.0 (SD 13.8; range 22-71) years, predominantly female (47/70, 67%), and predominantly of Chinese ethnicity (39/70, 56%). The telereview service was used by 32 patients in the control arm (32/35, 91%) and 18 patients in the intervention arm (18/35, 51%). Most patients in control (33/35, 94%; 95% CI 79.5%-99.0%) and intervention (34/35, 97%; 95% CI 83.4%-99.9%) arms were compliant with their final disposition. There was a low rate of re-presentation at 72 hours and 2 weeks for both control (72 hours: 2/35, 6%; 95% CI 1.0%-20.5%; 2 weeks: 2/35, 6%, 95% CI 1.0%-20.5%) and intervention (72 hours: 2/35, 6%; 95% CI 1.0%-20.5%; 2 weeks: 3/35, 9%, 95% CI 2.2%-24.2%) arms. There were no significant differences in safety (P>.99) and efficacy (P>.99) between the two groups.

The % change in state-level stroke mortality in 2020 (Figure 1B) was not correlated with prevalence of COVID-19 infection (rho=0.05, p=0.74), mortality (rho=0.10, p=0.49), or the % of ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 patients (rho=0.24, p=0.09). There was a correlation with % of hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients (rho=0.35, p=0.01) (Figure 2) Conclusion: Overall stroke mortality increased in 2020, particularly in Q2/3, the early-to-mid phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the state level, the average % of all hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients in 2020 was the only COVID-19 metric associated with change in stroke mortality.

Wide-necked aneurysm can be defined with a dome-to-neck ratio or aspect ratio; however, clinical definitions of wide-necked aneurysms vary. This study aimed to determine the most useful definition of wide-necked aneurysm to predict the need for an adjunctive device. Methods Among 552 cases of aneurysms, 343 (62.1%) and 209 (37.9%) cases of unruptured and ruptured aneurysms, respectively, were treated in a single institution. For each aneurysm, the (1) dome-to-neck ratio, (2) aspect ratio, and (3) K-ratio (defined as [dome height+maximum dome width]/[2maximum neck width]) were measured. We statistically analyzed patient data to determine which of the three ratios was most predictive of the need for adjunctive devices. Results Among 552 cases of aneurysms, 277 (50.2%) and 275 (49.8%) cases were treated with and without adjunctive techniques, respectively. The mean dome-to-neck ratio, aspect ratio, and K-ratio were 1.170.39, 1.580.61, and 1.370.47, respectively. The K-ratio was the strongest predictor of the use of adjunctive devices (P<0.001), and 1.3 was the most appropriate K-ratio cut-off value (sensitivity, 72.9%; specificity, 63.6%). Conclusions K-ratio was the most useful predictor of the need for adjunctive devices in the treatment of endovascular aneurysms.

This study aimed to compare the surgical outcomes of the SILA with those of three laparoscopic appendectomies (TLA) procedures using the existing equipment, the 10-mm laparoscope, and the surgical-glove port method. Methodology Between February 2021 and February 2022, this single-center retrospective study examined 68 patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy by a single surgeon. The study excluded patients with severe appendicitis, grade IV-V, following the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma classification. Clinical outcomes were analyzed, including operation time, hospital stay, postoperative pain, and postoperative morbidity. Results There were no statistically significant differences between SILA and TLA patients, respectively, in operation time (37.5 minutes vs. 35 minutes, p = 0.261) and the median duration of hospitalization (three days vs. three days, p = 0.929). There was no difference in the mean visual analog scale score between the two groups on the first day (p = 0.852), second day (p = 0.540), and the day of discharge from the hospital (p = 0.686), as well as return to diet (two days vs. two days, p = 0.053). Two (10%) cases of short-term complications in the SILA group and one (2.1%) case in the TLA group were noted.

This began with the use of telephone\\\\based cognitive screening in the 1980s and televideoconference\\\\based assessments in the 2000s. The COVID19 pandemic brought telehealth suddenly to the forefront of healthcare, particularly for aging and at\\\\risk populations, as well as for clinical providers and researchers. While clinicians have been challenged to continue to provide patient care in a safe manner, researchers have been faced with the challenge of maintaining study protocols and continuing to advance the science of dementia. Fortunately, a growing body of research has demonstrated the feasibility, reliability, validity, and consumer acceptability of telehealth\\\\based assessment procedures, including teleneuropsychological (teleNP) techniques. METHOD: We first reported results from a study of 202 adults age 50\\\\85 using a brief battery of common neuropsychological tests administered via teleNP vs in\\\\person in counterbalanced fashion which showed generally strong intraclass correlations (Cullum et al., 2014). Additional studies have since examined the validity and consumer acceptability of teleNP assessment in older adults, including recent reviews and findings from surveys and observations using teleNP during the COVID19 pandemic. RESULT: Our initial investigation revealed essentially equivalent results across teleNP vs traditional in\\\\person test conditions, with intraclass correlations around .80 and high levels of satisfaction with the procedures. Additional findings revealed validity by the discrimination of impaired and non\\\\impaired older adults with and without cognitive impairment similar to traditional in\\\\person assessment. Subsequent studies and reviews have added to this growing body of literature supporting the use of teleNP in older adults. CONCLUSION: In this presentation, the literature supporting the evidence for telehealth applications in the assessment and diagnosis of dementia will be reviewed, along with commonly used assessment instruments. A critical review of the strengths and limitations of remote clinical/cognitive evaluations as applied to aging individuals with and without cognitive impairment will be provided, along with practical recommendations for application of these procedures, including in\\\\home and computerized evaluations.

We sought to understand the effects of CDK4/6 inhibition (CDK4/6i) and radiation (RT) in multiple preclinical breast cancer models. METHODS Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were used to identify significantly altered pathways after CDK4/6i. Clonogenic assays were used to quantify the RT enhancement ratio (rER). DNA damage was quantified using H2AX staining and the neutral comet assay. DNA repair was assessed using RAD51 foci formation and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) reporter assays. Orthotopic xenografts were used to assess the efficacy of combination therapy. RESULTS Palbociclib significantly radiosensitized multiple ER+ cell lines at low nanomolar, sub IC50 concentrations (rER: 1.21 - 1.52) and led to a decrease in the surviving fraction of cells at 2 Gy (p < 0.001). Similar results were observed in ribociclib- (rER: 1.08 - 1.68) and abemaciclib-treated (rER: 1.19 - 2.05) cells. Combination treatment decreased RAD51 foci formation (p < 0.001), leading to a suppression of HR activity, but did not affect NHEJ efficiency (p > 0.05). Immortalized breast epithelial cells and cells with acquired resistance to CDK4/6i did not demonstrate radiosensitization (rER: 0.94 - 1.11) or changes in RAD51 foci. In xenograft models, concurrent palbociclib and RT led to a significant decrease in tumor growth.

Survival is inversely associated with duration of resuscitation as external chest compressions do not provide sufficient blood flow to prevent irreversible organ damage during a prolonged resuscitation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) instituted during cardiac arrest can provide normal physiological blood flows and is termed Extracorporeal Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR). ECPR may improve survival when used with in-hospital cardiac arrests. This possible survival benefit has not been replicated in trials of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, possibly because of the additional time it takes to transport the patient to hospital and initiate ECPR. Pre-hospital ECPR may shorten the time between cardiac arrest and physiological blood flows, potentially improving survival. It may also mitigate some of the neurological injury that many survivors suffer. Methods Sub30 is a prospective six patient feasibility study. The primary aim is to test whether it is possible to institute ECPR within 30 ?min of collapse in adult patients with refractory out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The secondary aims are to gather preliminary data on clinical outcomes, resource utilisation, and health economics associated with rapid ECPR delivery in order to plan any subsequent clinical investigation or clinical service. On study days a dedicated fast-response vehicle with ECPR capability will be tasked to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in an area of London served by Barts Heart Centre.

The increase in renewable energy sources may result in savings and the increasing cost of maintaining carbon-based energy. Worldwide involvement is required. The fulfillment of conditions by individual states does not solve the problem. The COVID-19 pandemic has slowed economic growth. It turns out that economic growth is not always associated with increased investments in RES (existing or emerging new clean energy points). We have a new epidemiological threatDeltawhich could become large. This will not improve the situation. Germany is an exemplary country for benchmarking in the field of renewable energy. The worrying fact is that Poland, despite economic growth, does not achieve an even growth in RES. Each of us is required to be involved, to be open to innovation and to act in accordance with the energy policy of the European Union. Basic management functions (planning, organizing, motivating and controlling) are also essential. Failure to meet the demands of the energy policy should be thoroughly verified and consequences should be drawn in order to involve the whole world. The authors thoroughly analyzed many factors that have a significant impact on the success in stopping climate change and increasing RES.

Pandemic-related restrictions and reorganization of healthcare services may affect thyroid disease management. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To analyze and discuss the relationship between COVID-19 and thyroid diseases from several perspectives. PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus, ClinicalTrial.gov were searched for this purpose by using free text words and medical subject headings as follows: \\"sars cov 2\\", \\"covid 19\\", \\"subacute thyroiditis\\", \\"atypical thyroiditis\\", \\"chronic thyroiditis\\", \\"hashimoto's thyroiditis\\", \\"graves' disease\\", \\"thyroid nodule\\", \\"differentiated thyroid cancer\\", \\"medullary thyroid cancer\\", \\"methimazole\\", \\"levothyroxine\\", \\"multikinase inhibitor\\", \\"remdesivir\\", \\"tocilizumab\\". Data were collected, analyzed, and discussed to answer the following clinical questions: \\"What evidence suggests that COVID-19 may induce detrimental consequences on thyroid function?\\"; \\"Could previous or concomitant thyroid diseases deteriorate the prognosis of COVID-19 once the infection has occurred?\\"; \\"Could medical management of thyroid diseases influence the clinical course of COVID-19?\\"; \\"Does medical management of COVID-19 interfere with thyroid function?\\"; \\"Are there defined strategies to better manage endocrine diseases despite restrictive measures and in-hospital and ambulatory activities reorganizations?\\". RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 may induce thyroid dysfunction that is usually reversible, including subclinical and atypical thyroiditis. Patients with baseline thyroid diseases are not at higher risk of contracting or transmitting SARS-CoV-2, and baseline thyroid dysfunction does not foster a worse progression of COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether low levels of free triiodothyronine, observed in seriously ill patients with COVID-19, may worsen the disease's clinical progression and, consequently, if triiodothyronine supplementation could be a tool for reducing this burden. Glucocorticoids and heparin may affect thyroid hormone secretion and measurement, respectively, leading to possible misdiagnosis of thyroid dysfunction in severe cases of COVID-19. High-risk thyroid nodules require a fine-needle aspiration without relevant delay, whereas other non-urgent diagnostic procedures and therapeutic interventions should be postponed. DISCUSSION: Currently, we know that SARS-CoV-2 could lead to short-term and reversible thyroid dysfunction, but thyroid diseases seem not to affect the progression of COVID-19. Adequate management of patients with thyroid diseases remains essential during the pandemic, but it could be compromised because of healthcare service restrictions. Endocrine care centers should continuously recognize and classify priority cases for in-person visits and therapeutic procedures.

METHODS: All publications concerning ONFH published from 2001 to 2020 were identified from Web of Science Core Collection. Key bibliometric indicators were calculated and evaluated using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and the online bibliometric analysis platform. RESULTS: A total of 2594 publications were included. Our analysis revealed a significant exponential growth trend in the annual number of publications over the past 20 years (R(2) = 0.9663). China, the USA, and Japan were the major contributors both from the quality and quantity points of view. Correlation analysis indicated that there was a high positive correlation between the number of publications and gross domestic product (r = 0.774), and a moderate positive correlation between publications and demographic factor (r = 0.673). All keywords were categorized into four clusters including Cluster 1 (etiology and risk factors study); Cluster 2 (basic research and stem cell therapy); cluster 3 (hip-preserving study); and Cluster 4 (hip replacement study). Stem cell therapy-related research has been recognized as an important research hotspot in this field. Several topics including exosomes, autophagy, biomarkers, osteogenic differentiation, microRNAs, steroid-induced osteonecrosis, mesenchymal stem cells, double-blind, early-stage osteonecrosis, and asymptomatic osteonecrosis were considered as research focuses in the near future. CONCLUSION: Over the past two decades, increasing attention has been paid to global ONFH-related research. Our bibliometric findings provide valuable information for researchers to understand the basic knowledge structure, identify the current research hotspots, potential collaborators, and future research frontiers in this field.","output":"Knowledge structure and emerging trends on osteonecrosis of the femoral head: a bibliometric and visualized study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate blood and biochemical laboratory findings in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) and analyze the potential predictors of poor outcome in patients with COVID\\\\19. METHODS: The clinical, laboratory, and outcome data of 87 patients with COVID\\\\19 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Only data collected at the time of admission were used in the analysis for predictors of poor outcome. These patients were divided into two groups: the adverse prognosis group (36 patients) and the non\\\\adverse prognosis group (51 patients). The adverse prognosis of COVID\\\\19 patients was defined as admission to the intensive care unit or death. RESULTS: On the univariate analysis, age, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil counts, lymphocytes count, neutrophils\\\\to\\\\lymphocytes ratio (NLR), interleukin\\\\6, albumin\\\\to\\\\globulin ratio (AGR), albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, glutamyl transpeptidase, and blood glucose were found to be the significant predictors. On the multivariate analysis, the predictors of poor outcome of patients with COVID\\\\19 were NLR (OR = 2.741, [95% CI = 1.02 ~ 7.35], P = .045) and IL\\\\6 (OR = 1.405, [95% CI = 1.04 ~ 1.89, P = .025]).

Out of necessity, virtual care became a preferred and default modality of extending primary care services to health care consumers. Although telemedicine is not a new concept and had been used in many organizations and health systems, the COVID-19 pandemic scaled up its use in a variety of health care settings. Telehealth's use in primary care was particularly important because of the need to maintain continuity of care for successful coordination of chronic disease management. This article examines the benefits of telehealth, including continuity of care, convenience of access to care, screening and triaging, and social distancing and disease prevention. The utilization of telehealth and financial implications are discussed, including reimbursement and cost-effectiveness. Barriers and challenges are addressed, including methods for successful implementation of nurse practitioner (NP) in primary care practices as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The leadership role of the NP in telehealth is discussed and implementation guidance is provided.","output":"Expansion of telehealth in primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic: benefits and barriers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) each cause substantial morbidity and mortality. In contrast to other lung diseases, the entire course of disease in these syndromes is measured in days to weeks rather than months to years, which raises unique challenges in achieving precision medicine. We review advances in sepsis and ARDS resulting from omics studies, including those involving genome-wide association, gene expression, targeted proteomics, and metabolomics approaches. We focus on promising evidence of biological subtypes in both sepsis and ARDS that consistently display high risk for death. In sepsis, a gene expression signature with dysregulated adaptive immune signaling has evidence for a differential response to systemic steroid therapy, whereas in ARDS, a hyperinflammatory pattern identified in plasma using targeted proteomics responded more favorably to randomized interventions including high positive end-expiratory pressure, volume conservative fluid therapy, and simvastatin therapy. These early examples suggest heterogeneous biology that may be challenging to detect by clinical factors alone and speak to the promise of a precision approach that targets the right treatment at the right time to the right patient.","output":"Precision Medicine in Critical Illness: Sepsis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has left a lasting mark on medicine globally.

Whereas most studies suggest that children who present for elective procedures with an upper respiratory tract infection are at increased risk of perioperative adverse events, these events are typically easy to recognize and treat. This review will discuss the current literature regarding outcome in children who present for elective surgery with an upper respiratory tract infection and suggests approaches to optimize their perioperative management. RECENT FINDINGS Although the literature regarding this important topic has been slow to evolve, recent large-scale outcome studies have identified a number of factors that increase the risk of perioperative adverse events among children with upper respiratory tract infections. The significance of these findings will be discussed.

DENV replicates at ER-derived cytoplasmic structures that include substructures called convoluted membranes (CMs); however, the purpose of these membrane alterations remains unclear. We determine that DENV nonstructural protein (NS)4B, a promising drug target with unknown function, associates with mitochondrial proteins and alters mitochondria morphology to promote infection. During infection, NS4B induces elongation of mitochondria, which physically contact CMs. This restructuring compromises the integrity of mitochondria-associated membranes, sites of ER-mitochondria interface critical for innate immune signaling. The spatio-temporal parameters of CM biogenesis and mitochondria elongation are linked to loss of activation of the fission factor Dynamin-Related Protein-1. Mitochondria elongation promotes DENV replication and alleviates RIG-I-dependent activation of interferon responses. As Zika virus infection induces similar mitochondria elongation, this perturbation may protect DENV and related viruses from innate immunity and create a favorable replicative environment.","output":"Dengue Virus Perturbs Mitochondrial Morphodynamics to Dampen Innate Immune Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liver injury is common in patients with COVID-19, but little is known about its clinical presentation and severity in the context of liver transplant.

To date, there is no FDA-approved licensed vaccine against arenaviruses and treatments have been limited to supportive therapy. Hence, the study was employed to design a highly immunogenic cross-reactive vaccine against Arenaviridae family using reverse vaccinology approach. The whole proteome of Lassa virus (LASV), Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Lujo virus and Guanarito virus were retrieved and assessed to determine the most antigenic viral proteins. Both T-cell and B-cell epitopes were predicted and screened based on transmembrane topology, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity and molecular docking analysis. The final constructs were designed using different adjuvants, top epitopes, PADRE sequence and respective linkers and were assessed for the efficacy, safety, stability and molecular cloning purposes. The proposed epitopes were highly conserved (84%C100%) and showed greater cumulative population coverage. Moreover, T cell epitope GWPYIGSRS was conserved in Junin virus (Argentine mammarenavirus) and Sabia virus (Brazilian mammarenavirus), while B cell epitope NLLYKICLSG was conserved in Machupo virus (Bolivian mammarenavirus) and Sabia virus, indicating the possibility of final vaccine construct to confer a broad range immunity in the host. Docking analysis of the refined vaccine with different MHC molecules and human immune receptors were biologically significant. The vaccine-receptor (V1-TLR3) complex showed minimal deformability at molecular level and was compatible for cloning into pET28a(+) vector of E. coli strain K12. The study could be helpful in developing vaccine to combat arenaviral infections in the future.

RNA interference against these pathogens has been accomplished by introduction of virus-specific synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or DNA constructs encoding short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Their use as therapeutic antiviral against HIV-1 is limited, because of the emergence of viral escape mutants. In order to solve this durability problem, we tested DNA constructs encoding virus-specific long-hairpin RNAs (lhRNAs) for their ability to inhibit HIV-1 production. Expression of lhRNAs in mammalian cells may result in the synthesis of many siRNAs targeting different viral sequences, thus providing more potent inhibition and reducing the chance of viral escape. The lhRNA constructs were compared with in vitro diced double-stranded RNA and a DNA construct encoding an effective nef-specific shRNA for their ability to inhibit HIV-1 production in cells. Our results show that DNA constructs encoding virus-specific lhRNAs are capable of inhibiting HIV-1 production in a sequence-specific manner, without inducing the class I interferon genes.

Early detection of patients that are at high risk of clinical deterioration and require intensive monitoring, is key in ED evaluation and disposition. A rapid and easy risk-stratification tool could aid clinicians in early decision making. The Shock Index (SI: heart rate/systolic blood pressure) proved useful in detecting hemodynamic instability in sepsis and myocardial infarction patients. In this study we aim to determine whether SI is discriminative for ICU admission and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Retrospective, observational, single-center study. All patients &#8805;18 years old who were hospitalized with COVID-19 (defined as: positive result on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test) between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 were included for analysis. Data were collected from electronic medical patient records and stored in a protected database. ED shock index was calculated and analyzed for its discriminative value on in-hospital mortality and ICU admission by a ROC curve analysis. RESULTS: In total, 411 patients were included. Of all patients 249 (61%) were male. ICU admission was observed in 92 patients (22%). Of these, 37 patients (40%) died in the ICU. Total in-hospital mortality was 28% (114 patients). For in-hospital mortality the optimal cut-off SI &#8805; 0.86 was not discriminative (AUC 0.49 (95% CI: 0.43-0.56)), with a sensitivity of 12.3% and specificity of 93.6%.

We analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical activity in a Pediatric Urology division, as well as surgical complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of epidemiological, clinical and surgical data was carried out, including complications and readmissions of all patients operated on in the division of Pediatric Urology within the duration of the state of alarm. Five time periods have been created according to the de-escalation phases. RESULTS: Forty-nine surgical procedures were carried out on 45 patients (8 prior to the implementation of the de-escalation phases). High priority pathologies were the most frequent in the first phases, being the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction the most prevalent. Four complications were recorded (8.8%), none of them were respiratory. CONCLUSIONS: The EAU recommendations for the resumption of surgical activity have allowed a correct, safe and gradual transition to the routine surgical activity in Pediatric Urology. The Clavien-Dindo classification is useful and valid for application in this division.

Coronaviruses employ between twenty and thirty proteins to carry out their viral replication cycle including infection, immune evasion, and replication. Among these, nonstructural protein 16 (Nsp16), a 2-O-methyltransferase, plays an essential role in immune evasion. Nsp16 achieves this by mimicking its human homolog, CMTr1, which methylates mRNA to enhance translation efficiency and distinguish self from other. Unlike human CMTr1, Nsp16 requires a binding partner, Nsp10, to activate its enzymatic activity. The requirement of this binding partner presents two questions that we investigate in this manuscript. First, how does Nsp10 activate Nsp16? While experimentally-derived structures of the active Nsp16/Nsp10 complex exist, structures of inactive, monomeric Nsp16 have yet to be solved. Therefore, it is unclear how Nsp10 activates Nsp16. Using over one millisecond of molecular dynamics simulations of both Nsp16 and its complex with Nsp10, we investigate how the presence of Nsp10 shifts Nsp16s conformational ensemble in order to activate it. Second, guided by this activation mechanism and Markov state models (MSMs), we investigate if Nsp16 adopts inactive structures with cryptic pockets that, if targeted with a small molecule, could inhibit Nsp16 by stabilizing its inactive state. After identifying such a pocket in SARS-CoV-2 Nsp16, we show that this cryptic pocket also opens in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, but not in human CMTr1. Therefore, it may be possible to develop pan-coronavirus antivirals that target this cryptic pocket.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Nsp16 activation mechanism and a cryptic pocket with pan-coronavirus antiviral potential"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2014C2015, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the effect of an advertising campaign for influenza vaccination using posters and pamphlets in general practitioner (GP) waiting rooms.

In 2019, we deepened the investigations explaining the increased uptake conducting a registry-based 4/2/1 cluster RCT designed by Zelen with two extra years of follow-up of the study cohort.

The binding process is initiated when the receptor binding domain (RBD) of at least one protomer switches from a down (closed) to an up (open) state. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and two-dimensional replica exchange umbrella sampling calculations to investigate the transition between the two S-protein conformations with and without glycosylation. We show that the glycosylated spike has a higher barrier to opening than the non-glycosylated one with comparable populations of the down and up states. In contrast, we observed that the up conformation is favored without glycans. Analysis of the S-protein opening pathway reveals that glycans at N165 and N122 interfere with hydrogen bonds between the RBD and the N-terminal domain in the up state. We also identify roles for glycans at N165 and N343 in stabilizing the down and up states. Finally we estimate how epitope exposure for several known antibodies changes along the opening path. We find that the epitope of the BD-368-2 antibody remains exposed irrespective of the S-protein conformation, explaining the high efficacy of this antibody.

Correspondingly, MAO inhibitors are used for the treatment of severe neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression. A commonly prescribed drug against refractory depression is tranylcypromine, however, the side effects are poorly understood. In order to decipher putative off-targets, we synthesized two tranylcypromine probes equipped with either an alkyne moiety or an alkyne-diazirine minimal photocrosslinker for in situ proteome profiling. Surprisingly, LCCMS/MS analysis revealed low enrichment of MAOA and relatively promiscuous labeling of proteins.

A secondary aim was to deductively explore the applicability of the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behaviour model to participants' narratives related to self-regulated online learning. Online interviews with six demographically diverse participants were conducted and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The overarching theme was 'the balancing act of online learners', which consisted of three major themes (and respective subthemes): (1) 'identity as an online learner' ('in today's world, we're all very busy'), (2) 'access to resources' ('importance of location' and 'comparing online to on-campus teaching and learning'), and (3) 'changing nature of social interactions' ('tutors as a crutch' and 'peer-to-peer interactions').

Here, we show that histones trigger coagulation activation in vivo as evidenced by coagulation parameters and fibrin deposition in tissues. However, histone-induced coagulopathy was neither dependent on caspase 1/11 and gasdermin D (GSDMD), nor on TLR2 and TLR4, as deficiency of these genes in mice did not protect against histone-induced coagulopathy.

A small but significant proportion of patients develop severe COVID-19 resulting in respiratory failure. Many of these patients also develop multi-organ dysfunction as a byproduct of their critical illness. Although heart failure can be a part of this, there also appears to be a subset of patients who have primary cardiac collapse from COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Conduct a systematic review of COVID-19-associated myocarditis, including clinical presentation, risk factors, and prognosis. DISCUSSION: Our review demonstrates two distinct etiologies of primary acute heart failure in surprisingly equal incidence in patients with COVID-19: viral myocarditis and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. COVID myocarditis, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and severe COVID-19 can be clinically indistinguishable. All can present with dyspnea and evidence of cardiac injury, although in myocarditis and Takotsubo this is due to primary cardiac dysfunction as compared to respiratory failure in severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-associated myocarditis differs from COVID-19 respiratory failure by an early shock state. However, not all heart failure from COVID-19 is from direct viral infection; some patient's develop takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Regardless of etiology, steroids may be a beneficial treatment, similar to other critically ill COVID-19 patients. Evidence of cardiac injury in the form of ECG changes or elevated troponin in patients with COVID-19 should prompt providers to consider concurrent myocarditis.","output":"COVID-19 associated myocarditis: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Public behaviour change is necessary to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Based on the reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) framework, this study presents an examination of individual differences in some relevant psychological factors. Design Cross-sectional psychometric. Methods UK respondents (N = 202) completed a personality questionnaire (RST-PQ), measures of illness attitudes, concerns about the impact of coronavirus on health services and socio-economic infrastructures, personal safety, and likelihood of voluntary self-isolation. Results Respondents most concerned were older, had negative illness attitudes, and scored higher on reward reactivity (RR), indicating the motivation to take positive approach action despite prevailing worry/anxiety. Personal safety concerns were highest in those with negative illness attitudes and higher fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance) scores. Results suggest people are experiencing psychological conflict: between the urge to stay safe (FFFF-related) and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable (RR-related) life. Ways of ameliorating conflict may include maladaptive behaviours (panic buying), reflecting reward-related displacement activity. Intended self-isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores. Older people reported themselves less likely to self-isolate. Conclusions Interventions need to consider individual differences in psychological factors in behaviour change, and we discuss relevant literature to inform policy makers and communicators. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) personality systems can influence perception of persuasive health messages. However, there is limited evidence for their direct effects on health concerns and behaviours, and none relating to specific infectious diseases. What does this study add? Reward reactivity (RR) is associated with concern about impact of coronavirus on the NHS and other social infrastructures, indicating the motivation to take positive-approach action despite worry/anxiety. Personal safety concerns are related to fight-flight-freeze system traits (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance). Intended self-isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores. Older people reported themselves less likely to self-isolate. Results suggest psychological conflict: between the urge to stay safe (FFFF-related) and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable life (RR-related).

One possible explanation is that given previous exposure to angina and ischemia/reperfusion injury these patients, may be already 'naturally preconditioned'. The role of RIPC in a context of isolated valve intervention, both surgical and particularly transcatheter is less clear and remains under investigated, with few high-quality studies. METHODS: A systematic literature review identified 8 candidate studies that met the meta-analysis criteria. We analyzed outcomes of 610 subjects (312 RIPC and 298 SHAM) with random effects modeling. Each study was assessed for heterogeneity. The primary outcome was the extent of periprocedural myocardial injury, as reflected by the area under the curve for serum troponin concentration. Secondary endpoints included relevant intra- and post-operative outcomes; sensitivity and high-quality subgroup analysis was also carried out. RESULTS: Six and two studies reported the effect of RIPC in surgical and transcatheter valve intervention. There was a significant difference between-group in terms of periprocedural Troponin release (standardized mean difference (SMD: 0.74 [95% CI: 0.52; 0.95], pa?=a?0.02) with no heterogeneity (&#967;2 2.40, I2 0%, pa?=a?0.88).

We evaluated the psychometric properties and feasibility of using a computerized version of the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) in an epidemiological study in rural Kenya. Methods: We surveyed 1496 participants aged 13-24 years in Kilifi County, on the Kenyan coast. The MDI was administered using a computer-assisted system, available in three languages. Internal consistency was evaluated using both Cronbach's alpha and the Omega Coefficient. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to evaluate the factorial structure of the MDI. Results: Internal consistency using both Cronbach's Alpha (= 0.83) and the Omega Coefficient (0.82; 95% confidence interval 0.81- 0.83) was above acceptable thresholds. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good fit of the data to a unidimensional model of MDI ( 2 (33, N = 1409) = 178.52 p < 0.001, TLI = 0.947, CFI = 0.961, and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation, RMSEA = .056), and this was confirmed using Item Response Models (Loevinger's H coefficient 0.38) that proved the MDI was a unidimensional scale.

The efficiency of molecules was computed by the summation of the docking score against each target defined as Lig(E Score) and compared against Hydroxycholoquine as a standard. Based on the docking score, the majority of the annomontine derivatives were found to have increased binding affinity with targets as compared to hydroxycholoquine. SIGNIFICANCE: Due to the lack of efficiency, effectiveness, and failure of already repurposed drugs against the COVID-19, the exploration of the novel scaffold that can act as effective treatment is much needed. The current study hence emphasizes the potential of Annomontine based - - Carboline derivatives as a potential drug candidate against COVID-19.","output":"Design and identification of novel annomontine analogues against SARS-CoV-2: An in-silico approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article illustrates the recent developments in Plastic Surgery, which faces new challenges in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is related to the high rate of interhuman transmission of the virus, variability of clinical presentation, and the absence of specific therapeutic methods. COVID-19 can manifest with non-specific symptoms and signs, especially among the elderly. In some cases, the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia may be the first to appear. The pathophysiological mechanisms of hyponatremia among patients with COVID-19 are diverse, including syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), digestive loss of sodium ions, reduced sodium ion intake or use of diuretic therapy. Hyponatremia may also be considered a negative prognostic factor in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

To serve to this purpose, the well-documented infection model of SIR is examined in the current research to propose an analytical approach for providing an explicit formula associated with a straightforward computation of peak time of outbreak. Initially, the time scale from the relevant autonomous SIR epidemic model is formulated analytically via an integral based on the fractions of susceptible and infected compartments. Afterwards, through a series expansion of the logarithmic term of the resultant integrand, the peak time is shown to rely upon the fraction of susceptible, the infectious ratio as well as the initial fractions of ill and susceptible individuals. The approximate expression is shown to rigorously capable of capturing the time threshold of illness for an epidemic from the semi-time SIR epidemiology. Otherwise, it is also successful to predict the peak time from a past history of a disease when all-time epidemic model is adopted. Accuracy of the derived expressions are initially confirmed by direct comparisons with recently reported approximate formulas in the literature. Several other epidemic disease samples including the COVID-19 often studied in the recent literature are eventually attacked with favourable performance of the presented formulae for assessing the peak time occurrence of an epidemic. A quick evaluation of the peak time of a disease certainly enables the governments to take early effective epidemic precautions.","output":"Explicit formulae for the peak time of an epidemic from the SIR model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To report mode of delivery and immediate neonatal outcome in women infected with COVID\\\\19.

The main contribution of this paper is proposing different geospatial guidelines that could provide reliable and useful protocols for COVID-19 outbreak control to minimize causalities, restrict incidence, establish effective urban communication, provide new approaches for business in lockdown situations, telehealth treatment, patient monitoring, adaptive decision making, and visualize trend analysis.","output":"Ten GIS-Based Solutions for Managing and Controlling COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The identification of SARS-CoV-2 antigen or RNA in respiratory specimens 14 days after administration of all recommended doses of authorized COVID-19 vaccines is defined as ?breakthrough infection. In the present investigation m-RNA and vector based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were analysed with respect to postvaccination infections in vaccinated hospital employees. METHODS: 8 553 staff members were vaccinated with BNT162b2 (47%) or ChAdOx1-S (53%) between January and May 2021. In a retrospective observational cohort study, incidence of SARS-CoV-2 postvaccination infections was analysed in relation to demographic data, viral load, virus variants, vaccine brand and vaccination status at time of positive PCR test (fully vaccinated (14 days since second dose), partially vaccinated (>21 days since first, but < 14 days after second dose), insufficiently vaccinated (<22 days since first dose)). RESULTS: Within the follow-up period, ending on July 31(st), 2021, person-time at risk adjusted monthly rates for SARS-CoV-2 postvaccination infections were 018% (BNT162b2) and 057% (ChAdOx1-S) for insufficiently, 034% (BNT162b2) and 032% (ChAdOx1-S) for partially and 006% (BNT162b2) and 004% (ChAdOx1-S) for fully vaccinated participants. The two vaccine types did not differ with respect to hazard ratios for none of the respective postvaccination infection types. No cases of COVID-19 related hospitalizations or deaths were reported.

So, we adopt the water displacement method to occupy W1 or W2 sites by triggering HCQ or its analogs to inactivate the enzyme. Virtual screening is employed to find out best analogs of HCQ, molecular docking is used for water displacement from catalytic region of Mpro, and finally, MD simulations are conducted for validation of these findings. The docking study reveals that W1 and W2 are occupied by respective atoms of ZINC28706440 whereas W2 by HCQ and indacaterol.

However, the role of this inflammatory marker in SARA-CoV-2 infection is yet to be elucidated. Here, we explored the potential use of SAA in serum as a biomarker for monitoring the clinical course of COVID-19 patients. Methods: The subjects included 95 COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital with acute and / or convalescent phases data, among them 69 patients had paired data. Mann-Whitney U statistics and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to compare SAA level in the acute and convalescent phases. A subgroup of COVID-19 patients (n=9) participated in a follow-up examination with repeated blood collection reach five times during the hospitalization. The correlations of SAA levels with laboratory testing were then analyzed using the Spearman test. Results: The results of the data analysis show that the media SAA levels at acute phases were significantly higher (P < 0.05) compared to that at baseline. Furthermore, ascensional range of SAA were associated with the degree of COVID-19 severity. Media SAA levels at convalescent phases were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) compared to that at acute phases.

This burdens the COVID-19 treatment gap, thereby requiring accelerated discovery of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. This study explored the potential of anti-HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) phytochemicals as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins (nsps) by targeting in silico key sites in the structures of SARS-CoV-2 nsps. One hundred four anti-HIV phytochemicals were subjected to molecular docking with nsp3, 5, 10, 12, 13, 15, and 16. Top compounds in complex with the nsps were investigated further through molecular dynamics. The drug-likeness and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) properties of the top compounds were also predicted using SwissADME. Their toxicity was likewise determined using OSIRIS Property Explorer. RESULTS: Among the top-scoring compounds, the polyphenolic functionalized natural products comprised of biflavones 1, 4, 11, 13, 14, 15; ellagitannin 9; and bisisoquinoline alkaloid 19 were multi-targeting and exhibited strongest binding affinities to at least two nsps (binding energy = ? 7.7 to ? 10.8 kcal/mol). The top ligands were stable in complex with their target nsps as determined by molecular dynamics. Several top-binding compounds were computationally druggable, showed good gastrointestinal absorptive property, and were also predicted to be non-toxic.

METHODS: This research was a mixed methods survey undertaken at an Australian regional university. A total of 82 nursing students completed the survey, which contained open and closed questions addressing various domains of course experience. The questions were mostly categorical (respondents selected from predetermined ordinal options), with opportunities to elaborate on some questions. FINDINGS: The survey responses showed that flexibility in subject requirements, the helpfulness of academic/teaching staff (lecturers and tutors), and clarity of teacher communications correlated strongly with satisfaction in those respective areas. Expectation-experience discrepancy correlated strongly with satisfaction in these areas: support to navigate university systems, the timing of subject availability, the helpfulness of academic staff, and timetable suitability. The strongest predictor of students overall satisfaction with their course was the extent to which they felt supported to navigate university systems.

While the link between socioeconomic status and infectious disease is well-documented, the psychological relationship among economic considerations, such as financial constraint and economic anxiety, and health considerations, such as perceptions of disease spread and preventative actions, is not well understood. Despite past research illustrating the strong link between financial fragility and a wide range of behaviors, surprisingly little research is examining the psychological relationship between the economic crisis and beliefs and behaviors related to the co-occurring health crisis. We show that financial constraint predicts peoples beliefs about both their personal risk of infection and the national spread of the virus as well as their social distancing behavior. In addition, we compare the predictive utility of financial constraint to two other commonly studied factors: political partisanship and local disease severity. The strength of the effect of financial constraint equals or eclipses the influence of partisanship on beliefs and is much larger than that of local disease severity. We also show that negative affect partially mediates the relationship between financial constraint and COVID-19 beliefs and social distancing behaviors. These results suggest the economic crisis created by COVID-19 is spilling over into peoples beliefs about the health crisis and their behaviors.

Different LUS protocols are currently used at the emergency department (ED) and there is a need to know their diagnostic accuracy. DESIGN: A multicentre, prospective, observational study, to compare the diagnostic accuracy of three commonly used LUS protocols in identifying COVID-19 pneumonia at the ED. SETTING/PATIENTS: Adult patients with suspected COVID-19 at the ED, in whom we prospectively performed 12-zone LUS and SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription PCR. MEASUREMENTS: We assessed diagnostic accuracy for three different ultrasound protocols using both PCR and final diagnosis as a reference standard. RESULTS: Between 19 March 2020 and 4 May 2020, 202 patients were included. Sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value compared with PCR for 12-zone LUS were 91.4% (95% CI 84.4 to 96.0), 83.5% (95% CI 74.6 to 90.3) and 90.0% (95% CI 82.7 to 94.4). For 8-zone and 6-zone protocols, these results were 79.7 (95% CI 69.9 to 87.6), 69.0% (95% CI 59.6 to 77.4) and 81.3% (95% CI 73.8 to 87.0) versus 89.9% (95% CI 81.7 to 95.3), 57.5% (95% CI 47.9 to 66.8) and 87.8% (95% CI 79.2 to 93.2). Negative likelihood ratios for 12, 8 and 6 zones were 0.1, 0.3 and 0.2, respectively. Compared with the final diagnosis specificity increased to 83.5% (95% CI 74.6 to 90.3), 78.4% (95% CI 68.8 to 86.1) and 65.0% (95% CI 54.6 to 74.4), respectively, while the negative likelihood ratios were 0.1, 0.2 and 0.16.

The model is validated by matching the model with the data on cases of COVID-19 resurgence in April of 2020 from Heilongjiang province in China, which indicates that the predictive values from the mathematical model fit the real data very well. Based upon the computations from the model and analytical formulae, we reveal how the indirect transmission from environmental pathogens contribute to the disease outbreak and how the input of asymptomatic individuals affect the disease spread.

A special nursing group of transdisciplinary nurses (TNs) who had not worked in respiratory medicine, infection departments, or emergency and intensive medicine but who accounted for a large proportion of all nurses also drew our attention. Few studies have examined this special group of TNs. Therefore, this study collected the experiences and views of TNs at the forefront of the COVID-19 outbreak to investigate their potential problems. RESULTS: Twenty-five TNs and 19 nurses with experience in infectious diseases (non-TNs) were enrolled in the study. Compared with non-TNs, TNs showed higher levels of perceived stress and relatively less perceived social support. For TNs, the ambiguous roles, transition of operating mode, unfamiliar work content, and reversal of their daily schedule were the most common vocational problems. Additionally, most TNs had psychological problems such as anxiety, pain and insomnia. The incomprehension of parents, concern for family members and long-term isolation were the most common causes of psychological stress. CONCLUSION: This survey is the first to focus on the group of TNs at the forefront of the COVID-19 outbreak and to investigate their experiences, vocational issues and psychological stresses qualitatively and quantificationally. We found that TNs had more perceived stress and less perceived social support than non-TNs. The vocational and psychological issues of TNs should be highlighted. These findings identify important issues and offer insights into the underlying issues to help TNs ultimately win the battle against novel coronavirus epidemics. METHODS: Semi-structured and face-to-face individual interviews and quantitative assessments were conducted. The Braun Clarke Thematic Analysis method and the strategy outlined by Miles and Huberman were used in the data analysis process of the qualitative study. The perceived stress scale and perceived social support scale were utilized to quantificationally evaluate the perceived stress level and the amount of perceived social support. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were adopted to assess the vocational and psychological perceptions and issues.","output":"A qualitative study of the vocational and psychological perceptions and issues of transdisciplinary nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Different economic studies have been concentrated on specific and/or isolated factors to explain public debt evolution In this article we have developed an integrated viewpoint based on financial, social and governance or institutional factors Under our dynamic econometric assessment for the last two decades (i e , since the Euro currency inception), economic growth, interest rate, life expectancy at birth, unemployment, government effectiveness and the last sovereign debt crisis have resulted as being the major determinants of its evolution Public debt sustainability must be assessed continuously with the aim to discuss technical recommendations to maintain it at an even rate, to allow sustainable economic growth and better life standards, in the context of life expectancy increasing and stable governance and institutional conditions Undoubtedly, the Covid-19 pandemic leads more damaged Eurozone countries with negative real economic growth and high unemployment rates to increase dramatically their current public debts, to such an extent that they could fall into unsustainable paths Therefore, substantial reforms in European pension and unemployment insurance systems are necessary conditions to ensure public debt sustainability amid Covid-19 pandemic","output":"Determinants of the Public Debt in the Eurozone and its Sustainability Amid the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite recent advancements in the development of vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies for Ebola virus disease, treatment options remain limited. Moreover, management and containment of Ebola virus outbreaks is often hindered by the remote nature of the locations in which the outbreaks originate. Small-molecule compounds offer the advantage of being relatively cheap and easy to produce, transport and store, making them an interesting modality for the development of novel therapeutics against Ebola virus disease. Furthermore, the repurposing of small-molecule compounds, previously developed for alternative applications, can aid in reducing the time needed to bring potential therapeutics from bench to bedside. For this purpose, the Medicines for Malaria Venture provides collections of previously developed small-molecule compounds for screening against other infectious diseases. In this study, we used biologically contained Ebola virus to screen over 4,200 small-molecule drugs and drug-like compounds provided by the Medicines for Malaria Venture (i.e., the Pandemic Response Box and the COVID Box) and the Centre for Drug Design and Discovery (CD3, KU Leuven, Belgium). In addition to confirming known Ebola virus inhibitors, illustrating the validity of our screening assays, we identified eight novel selective Ebola virus inhibitors. Although the inhibitory potential of these compounds remains to be validated in vivo, they represent interesting compounds for the study of potential interventions against Ebola virus disease and might serve as a basis for the development of new therapeutics.","output":"Identification of novel Ebola virus inhibitors using biologically contained virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1529) variant was designated as a variant of concern (VOC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) on November 26, 2021.

In this paper, we explore the extent to which a political economy perspective can help explain the characteristics of sector-specific state aid in the Netherlands, a traditionally corporatist country. While KLM, the biggest player in the Dutch aviation sector, was promised loans worth &#8364;3.4 billion, the horeca (hospitality) sector was denied a similar deal. Limited cross-case analysis eliminates purely economic accounts. We employed process-tracing and analyzed hundreds of national media articles to understand the influence of elected leaders, interest groups, and experts. We find that, against the backdrop of economic concerns, vote-seeking behavior by elected leaders as well as the strength and organization of interest groups influenced how much each sector could expect. Meanwhile, policy-seeking behavior helps explain the form that aid took. Our findings highlight the need to consider fiscal support in political economy terms, even during crises, and to explore the composition of state aid, not just its presence or amount.","output":"Politics, pandemics, and support: the role of political actors in Dutch state aid during COVID-19/ Polticas, pandemias e auxlio do estado: o papel dos atores polticos no auxlio governamental oferecido pelos Pases Baixos durante a pandemia da COVID-19/ Polticas, pandemias y apoyo del estado: el papel de los actores polticos en la ayuda gubernamental ofrecida por los Pases Bajos durante la pandemia de COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As we know that Internet, a rebellion innovation has transformed everything, Internet of Things has made a hope for excellent future of Internet with Machine-Machine (M2M) type of communication This review paper has also shown that it is possible and affordable to construct these smart systems based on Internet of Things (IoT) IoT delivers exceptional advancement in the healthcare domain This paper explores the roles of IoT that revolutionize the healthcare domain by providing enormous healthcare benefits to the mankind by offering affordable and practical healthcare solutions The main focus of this paper is to discuss the role of IoT in smart hospitals and its significance to deal with pandemics is also highlighted For serving the community-specific needs during spread of pandemic, various smart devices can be utilized that can provide varied functionalities including proper monitoring of high-risk patients, tracking their bio-metric measurements and capturing real-time data We have also studied various blueprints which can sense unforeseen happenings using numerous sensors and reveal the facts accumulated on LED display Observational outcomes have shown good agreement with the hypothetical statements ? 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing All rights reserved","output":"Application of IoT in Current Pandemic of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious disease represents a major threat to the productivity and welfare of cattle herds throughout the world.

There are also ACE2 alleles in humans with mutations in the RBD binding site. Here we perform a detailed affinity and kinetics analysis of the effect of five common RBD mutations (K417N, K417T, N501Y, E484K and S477N) and two common ACE2 mutations (S19P and K26R) on the RBD/ACE2 interaction. We analysed the effects of individual RBD mutations, and combinations found in new SARS-CoV-2 variants first identified in the UK (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P1). Most of these mutations increased the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction. The exceptions were mutations K417N/T, which decreased the affinity.

Design: Systematic review and network meta-analysis Data Sources: PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, medRxiv, SSRN, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to June 9th, 2020. Study Selection: Published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and baseline-adjusted observational studies which met our predefined eligibility criteria. Main Outcome Measures: The outcomes of interest were mortality, progression to severe disease (severe pneumonia or admission to intensive care unit (ICU)), time to viral clearance, QT prolongation, fatal cardiac complications, and non-cardiac serious adverse events. The level of evidence behind each outcome was also measured using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Results: 49 studies with a total of 20212 confounder-adjusted patients were included for analysis. The risk of progression to severe pneumonia or ICU admission was significantly reduced with tocilizumab (GRADE low), anakinra (GRADE very low), and remdesivir (GRADE high) compared to standard care. Tocilizumab was shown to reduce mortality rate for both moderate-severe patients in the non-ICU setting at admission (Odds ratio (OR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.54, GRADE low) and critically ill patients in the ICU setting (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.91, GRADE low). High dose IVIG reduced death rate (GRADE low) while corticosteroids increased mortality for critically ill patients (GRADE moderate). Convalescent plasma and hydroxychloroquine were shown to promote viral clearance (OR 11.39, 95% CI 3.91 to 33.18, GRADE low and OR 6.08, 95% CI 2.74 to 13.48, GRADE moderate, respectively) while not altering mortality or progression to the severe courses. The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was shown to be associated with increased QT prolongation incidence (OR 1,85, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.26, GRADE low) and fatal cardiac complications in cardiac-impaired populations (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.05, GRADE low). High-dose (>600mg/day) hydroxychloroquine monotherapy was significantly associated with increased non-cardiac serious adverse events (GRADE moderate). Conclusion: Anti-inflammatory agents (tocilizumab, anakinra, and IVIG) and remdesivir may safely and effectively improve outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Widely used hydroxychloroquine provides marginal clinical benefit in improving viral clearance rates whilst posing both cardiac and non-cardiac safety risks, especially in the vulnerable population.

To date, only a few studies have drawn attention to the psychological impact of lockdown on Italian children's mental health. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological distress (anxiety and mood symptoms) and perceived changes in routine among Italian primary and middle school students during the COVID-19 quarantine. METHODS: This interview study was performed between the 18th of May and 7th of June 2020: it involved a sample of 82 children and adolescents living in Milan (Italy), attending primary and middle school (aged 6 to 14 years), and their parents. RESULTS: Almost 30 % of the subjects reported having struggled to adjust to home learning. 36 responders completely changed their dietary habits during the lockdown: they were not eating the same amount of food and were consuming more junk food. Sleep habits were also affected by the lockdown measures: 28 % of the sample had difficulties sleeping and wished to sleep in their parents' bed. Concerning psychological distress, 64 (78 %) children and adolescents had anxiety symptoms; 43.9 % of the students reported significant mood symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Children are not indifferent to the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 epidemic: our data confirm their difficulties in adapting to the quarantine measures.

Following the GCS treatment, neutrophilia increased (=0.0001) with persisting lymphopenia, and the neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio, a marker of chronic inflammation, increased 2.5 times (=0.006). The changes in the N/L ratio and D-dimer were found to correlate in the GCS pulse therapy group (r =0.49, p=0.04), which underlined the relationship of chronic autoimmune inflammation with thrombus formation in COVID-19. No significant changes were observed in the control group. In result, four patients developed venous thromboembolic complications (two of them had pulmonary artery thromboembolism) after the GCS pulse therapy despite the concomitant antiplatelet treatment at therapeutic doses. Recovery was slower in the hormone treatment group (median stay in the hospital was 26 days vs 18 days in the control group, =0.001).Conclusion Pulse therapy with high doses of GCS exerted a rapid anti-inflammatory effect but at the same time, increased the N/L ratio and the D-dimer level, which increased the risk of thromboembolism.","output":"[Steroid pulse -therapy in patients With coronAvirus Pneumonia (COVID-19), sYstemic inFlammation And Risk of vEnous thRombosis and thromboembolism (WAYFARER Study)]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 3C\\\\like protease of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus has a C\\\\terminal extra domain in addition to the chymotrypsin\\\\fold adopted by piconavirus 3C proteases hosting the complete catalytic machinery. Previously we identified the extra domain to be involved in enzyme dimerization which has been considered essential for the catalytic activity. In an initial attempt to map out the extra\\\\domain residues critical for dimerization, we have systematically generated 15 point mutations, five deletions and one triple mutation and subsequently characterized them by enzymatic assay, dynamic light scattering, CD and NMR spectroscopy. The results led to identification of four regions critical for enzyme dimerization. Interestingly, Asn214Ala mutant with a significant tendency to form a monomer still retained  30% activity, indicating that the relationship between the activity and dimerization might be very complex. Very surprisingly, two regions (one over Ser284CThr285CIle286 and another around Phe291) were discovered on which Ala\\\\mutations significantly increased the enzymatic activities. Based on this, a super\\\\active triple\\\\mutant STI/A with a 3.7\\\\fold activity enhancement was thus engineered by mutating residues Ser284, Thr285 and Ile286 to Ala. The dynamic light scattering, CD and NMR characterizations indicate that the wild\\\\type (WT) and STI/A mutant share similar structural and dimerization properties, thus implying that in addition to dimerization, the extra domain might have other mechanisms to regulate the catalytic machinery. We rationalized these results based on the enzyme structure and consequently observed an interesting picture: the majority of the dimerization\\\\critical residues plus Ser284CThr285CIle286 and Phe291 are clustered together to form a nano\\\\scale channel passing through the central region of the enzyme. We therefore speculate that this channel might play a role in relaying regulatory effects from the extra domain to the catalytic machinery.","output":"The catalysis of the SARS 3C\\\\like protease is under extensive regulation by its extra domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The primary objective of this systematic review was to update our previous review on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise in cancers other than breast or prostate, evaluating: 1) the application of principles of exercise training within the exercise prescription; 2) reporting of the exercise prescription components (i.e., frequency, intensity, time, and type (FITT)); and 3) reporting of participant adherence to FITT. A secondary objective was to examine whether reporting of these interventions had improved over time. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus databases were searched from 2012 to 2020. Eligible studies were RCTs of at least 4 weeks of aerobic and/or resistance exercise that reported on physiological outcomes relating to exercise (e.g., aerobic capacity, muscular strength) in people with cancer other than breast or prostate. RESULTS Eighty-six new studies were identified in the updated search, for a total of 107 studies included in this review. The principle of specificity was applied by 91%, progression by 32%, overload by 46%, initial values by 72%, reversibility by 7% and diminishing returns by 5%. A significant increase in the percentage of studies that appropriately reported initial values (46 to 80%, p < 0.001) and progression (15 to 37%, p = 0.039) was found for studies published after 2011 compared to older studies. All four FITT prescription components were fully reported in the methods in 58% of all studies, which was higher than the proportion that fully reported adherence to the FITT prescription components in the results (7% of studies). Reporting of the FITT exercise prescription components and FITT adherence did not improve in studies published after 2011 compared to older studies. CONCLUSION Full reporting of exercise prescription and adherence still needs improvement within exercise oncology RCTs. Some aspects of exercise intervention reporting have improved since 2011, including the reporting of the principles of progression and initial values. Enhancing the reporting of exercise prescriptions, particularly FITT adherence, may provide better context for interpreting study results and improve research to practice translation.","output":"Attention to principles of exercise training: an updated systematic review of randomized controlled trials in cancers other than breast and prostate."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors aimed to give a quick reference guide for humanity about the new threat even after the COVID-19 health battle i.e., the Black fungus also baptized as Mucormycosis infection.

Participants: Patients admitted between August 2020 and February 2021 with symptoms at least one month after the onset of COVID-19. Main outcome measures: PACS and related disorders such as hospitalization one month or later after disease onset, biochemical dysregulation and reduced quality of life (EQ-5D-5L questionnaire). Results: Among 683 individuals assisted at CPC in this period, 602 were recruited. Patients had average of 52 ({+/-}14.6) years, 355 (59%) were female, 528 (88%) black/brown. Individuals were classified as mild (39.9%), moderate (27.9%) or severe (32.2%) during acute illness if outpatient, hospitalized non-UCI or UCI, respectively. Most patients reported a polysymptomatic profile, in median eight (IQR=6-9) acute symptoms. The most frequent residual symptoms were dyspnea (66%), fatigue (62%) and chest pain (43%). Women were more affected regardless disease severity at acute stage: presented more residual symptoms [4 (2-6) vs 3 (2-4)] and a higher impact in quality of life. Altered HbA1c [(184/275 (66.9%)], high CRP levels [195/484 (40.3%)] and anemia [143/545 (26.2%)] were the most common abnormalities in laboratory exams. 76 patients presented HbA1c above 6.4% although only 42 referred previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.

We describe a significantly lower level of expression of CD73 on cytotoxic lymphocyte populations, including CD8(+) T, natural killer T (NKT), and natural killer (NK) cells, during COVID-19. Interestingly, the decrease of CD73 on CD8(+) T cells and NKT cells correlated with serum ferritin levels. Furthermore, we observed distinct functional differences between the CD73(+) and CD73(-) subsets of CD8(+) T cells and NKT cells with regard to cytokine/toxin secretion. In COVID-19 patients, the majority of the CD73(-)CD8(+) T cells were capable of secreting granzyme B, perforin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) or interferon-gamma (IFN-). To conclude, in this first study of CD39 and CD73 expression of lymphocytes in COVID-19, we show that CD8(+) T cells and NKT cells lacking CD73 possess a significantly higher cytotoxic effector functionality compared to their CD73(+) counterparts.

International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) was also searched to collect ongoing trials. We included published researches or ongoing clinical trials related to the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine in children or adolescents (aged []18 years). Meta-analysis was performed if the consistency of the included studies was high. If not, descriptive analyses were performed. Results Eight published studies with 2851 children or adolescents and 28 ongoing clinical trials were included. Among eight published studies, two (25.0%) were RCTs, two (25.0%) case series, and four (50.0%) case reports. The results showed selected COVID-19 vaccines had a good safety profile in children and adolescents. Injection site pain, fatigue, headache, and chest pain were the most common adverse events. Some studies reported a few cases of myocarditis and pericarditis. Two RCTs showed that the immune response to BNT162b2 in adolescents aged 12-15 years was non-inferior to that in young people aged 16-25 years, while a stronger immune response was detected with 3g CoronaVac injection. Only one single RCT showed the efficacy of BNT162b2 was 100% (95% CI: 75.3 to 100). Of the 28 ongoing clinical trials, twenty-three are interventional studies. Fifteen countries are conducting interventional clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents. Among them, China (10, 43.5%) and United Stated (9, 39.1%) were the top two countries with the most trials. BNT162b2 was the most common vaccine, which is under testing.

In this study, a user-friendly technique of reverse transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was designed and validated to suggest a potential RT-qPCR alternate for rapid testing of COVID-19 suspected individuals. A total of 12 COVID-19 negative and 72 COVID-19 suspected individuals were analyzed. Both RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP assays were performed for all the individuals using open reading frame (ORF 1ab), nucleoprotein (N) and Spike (S) genes. All 12 specimens which were negative using RT-qPCR were also found negative using RT-LAMP assay. Overall 62 out of 72 positive samples (detected using RT-qPCR) were found COVID-19 positive using RT-LAMP assay. Interestingly all samples (45) having Ct values less than 30 showed 100% sensitivity. However, samples with weaker Ct values (i.e., => 35) showed 54% concordance, suggesting potential false negatives or false positives in RT-LAMP or RT-qPCR results, respectively. Overall comparative assessment showed that RT-LAMP assay showed strong sensitivity and specificity and can be used as an alternative strategy for rapid COVID-19 testing.

It first appeared in late 2019, and many deaths are increasing day by day until now. Therefore, the early diagnosis of COVID-19 has become a salient issue. Additionally, the current diagnosis methods have several demerits, and a new investigation is required to enhance the diagnosis performance. In this paper, a set of phases are performed, such as collecting data, filtering and augmenting images, extracting features, and classifying ECG images. The data were obtained from two publicly available ECG image datasets, and one of them contained COVID ECG reports. A set of preprocessing methods are applied to the ECG images, and data augmentation is performed to balance the ECG images based on the classes. A deep learning approach based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is performed for feature extraction. Four different pre-trained models are applied, such as Vgg16, Vgg19, ResNet-101, and Xception. Moreover, an ensemble of Xception and the temporary convolutional network (TCN), which is named ECGConvnet, is proposed. Finally, the results obtained from the former models are fed to four main classifiers. These classifiers are softmax, random forest (RF), multilayer perception (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM). The former classifiers are used to evaluate the diagnosis ability of the proposed methods. The classification scenario is based on fivefold cross-validation. Seven experiments are presented to evaluate the performance of the ECGConvnet. Three of them are multi-class, and the remaining are binary class diagnosing. Six out of seven experiments diagnose COVID-19 patients. The aforementioned experimental results indicated that ECGConvnet has the highest performance over other pre-trained models, and the SVM classifier showed higher accuracy in comparison with the other classifiers. The resulting accuracies from ECGConvnet based on SVM are (99.74%, 98.6%, 99.1% on the multi-class diagnosis tasks) and (99.8% on one of the binary-class diagnoses, while the remaining achieved 100%).

A novel example of such advancement can be found in laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery. Performing surgery through a single site of access holds the promise of decreased morbidity, lower blood loss, shorter convalescence, and improved cosmesis. Given the nonextirpative nature of the pyeloplasty procedure, this patient cohort has proven to be the ideal candidates for LESS surgery. The driving force behind adaptation of this newer technique can be attributed to innovations in access sites and devices, instrumentation, optics, and robotic-based assistance. There are now several studies in the published literature demonstrating the feasibility and efficacy of LESS pyeloplasty in both children and adults. Although comparative studies have failed to demonstrate any objective advantage of the LESS pyeloplasty operation, it is important to realize that LESS surgery is still a fairly new technique.

RESULTS: Sixteen articles were included, of which 14 focused on health disparities during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Studies showed that disparities during the H1N1 pandemic were more related to differential exposure to the virus than to susceptibility or access to care. Overall, pandemic-related disparities emanate primarily from inequalities in social conditions that place racial and ethnic minorities and low socioeconomic status populations at greater risk of exposure and infection, rather than individual-level factors such as health behaviors and comorbidities.

In this review, we analyzed the mechanisms of inhibition of cysteine proteases on the basis of structural information and compiled kinetic data. The gathered structural data indicate that the protein fold is not a major obstacle for the evolution of a protease inhibitor. It appears that nature can convert almost any starting fold into an inhibitor of a protease. In addition, there appears to be no general rule governing the inhibitory mechanism. The structural data make it clear that the \\"lock and key\\" mechanism is a historical concept with limited validity. However, the analysis suggests that the shape of the active site cleft of proteases imposes some restraints. When the S1 binding site is shaped as a pocket buried in the structure of protease, inhibitors can apply substrate-like binding mechanisms. In contrast, when the S1 binding site is in part exposed to solvent, the substrate-like inhibition cannot be employed. It appears that all proteases, with the exception of papain-like proteases, belong to the first group of proteases.

Active surveillance SARS-CoV-2 testing on admission was initiated in July 2020 and active surveillance testing for admitted patients every 7 days was initiated in December. Incident cases of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), extended-spectrum--lactamase-producing organisms (ESBL), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and CRE were determined for hospitalized patients between March 1, 2020 and February 28, 2021, excluding patients with infection on admission. Rates of hospitalized patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 per 100 patient days were compared to rates of patients testing positive for VRE, ESBL, MRSA, and CRE per 100 patient days respectively. The same rate comparisons were completed for the MICU. Using the F-Test Two-Sample to determine variance, the Two-Sample T-test assuming unequal variances was applied to each comparison.

Five monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were isolated from COVID-19 convalescent individuals and found to cross-react with multiple -coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins by targeting the stem helix. One of these mAbs, S2P6, cross-reacts with more than twenty human and animal -coronavirus S glycoproteins and broadly neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped viruses from the sarbecovirus, merbecovirus and embecovirus subgenera. Structural and functional studies delineate the molecular basis of S2P6 cross-reactivity and broad neutralization and indicate that this mAb blocks viral entry by inhibiting membrane fusion. S2P6 protects hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 (including the B.1.351 variant of concern) through direct viral neutralization and Fc-mediated effector functions. Serological and B cell repertoire analyses indicate that antibodies targeting the stem helix are found in some convalescent donors and vaccinees but are predominantly of narrow specificity. Germline reversion of the identified cross-reactive mAbs revealed that their unmutated ancestors are specific for the endemic OC43 or HKU1 viruses and acquired enhanced affinity and breadth through somatic mutations. These data demonstrate that conserved epitopes in the coronavirus fusion machinery can be targeted by protective antibodies and provide a framework for structure-guided design of pan--coronavirus vaccines eliciting broad protection.","output":"A human antibody that broadly neutralizes betacoronaviruses protects against SARS-CoV-2 by blocking the fusion machinery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Advancements in supporting personalized health care and well-being using virtual reality (VR) have created opportunities to use immersive games to support a healthy lifestyle for persons living with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Collaboratively designing exercise video games (exergames) as a multistakeholder team is fundamental to creating games that are attractive, effective, and accessible. OBJECTIVE: This research extensively explores the use of human-centered design methods that involve persons living with dementia in long-term care facilitates, exercise professionals, content developers, game designers, and researchers in the creation of VR exergames targeting physical activity promotion for persons living with dementia/MCI. METHODS: Conceptualization, collaborative design, and playtesting activities were carried out to design VR exergames to engage persons living with dementia in exercises to promote upper limb flexibility, strength, and aerobic endurance. We involved a total of 7 persons living with dementia/MCI, 5 exercise professionals, 5 community-dwelling older adults, a VR company for content creation, and a multidisciplinary research team with game designers, engineers, and kinesiology experts. RESULTS: An immersive VR exergame called Seas the Day was jointly designed and developed and it is freely available to be played in state-of-the-art VR headsets (Oculus Quest 1, 2). A model for the triadic interaction (health care institution, industry partner, academia) is also presented to illustrate how different stakeholders contribute to the design of VR exergames that consider/complement complex needs, preferences, and motivators of an underrepresented group of end users. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that a collaborative multistakeholder design results in more tailored and context-aware VR games for persons living with dementia. The insights and lessons learned from this research can be used by others to co-design games, including remote engagement techniques that were used during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Immersive Virtual Reality Exergames for Persons Living With Dementia: User-Centered Design Study as a Multistakeholder Team During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Both the cortisol awakening response (CAR; corresponding to the state measurement) and hair cortisol concentration (HCC; corresponding to the trait measurement) are considered reliable markers of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. Because cortisol has long been associated with adiposity, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarize and compare the literature around CAR and HCC and their association with obesity or fat distribution indices. METHODS The PubMed, Web of Science (Web of Science Core Collection and Medline), EBSCO Information Services, Embase, and PsycNET databases were searched, and full-text articles investigating the association between CAR or HCC and markers of adiposity in humans were included. Meta-analyses were then performed to compare studies associating CAR or HCC with BMI (a marker of general adiposity) and waist circumference (a marker of fat distribution). RESULTS The results of this review highlight inconsistencies in cortisol sampling and CAR computation, which makes comparisons between studies difficult. It was found that adiposity indices are not associated with CAR but that they correlate significantly and positively with HCC. The subgroup analysis hinted to possible age differences in the magnitude of the association between HCC and BMI.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic people is an urgent priority for the prevention and containment of disease outbreaks in communities. However, few data are available in asymptomatic persons regarding the accuracy of PCR testing. Additionally, although self-collected saliva has significant logistical advantages in mass screening, its utility as an alternative specimen in asymptomatic persons is yet to be determined. METHODS: We conducted a mass-screening study to compare the utility of nucleic acid amplification, such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, using nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples from each individual in two cohorts of asymptomatic persons: the contact tracing cohort and the airport quarantine cohort. RESULTS: In this mass-screening study including 1,924 individuals, the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification testing with nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were 86% (90%CI:77-93%) and 92% (90%CI:83-97%), respectively, with specificities greater than 99.9%. The true concordance probability between the nasopharyngeal and saliva tests was estimated at 0.998 (90%CI:0.996-0.999) on the estimated airport prevalence at 0.3%. In positive individuals, viral load was highly correlated between NPS and saliva. CONCLUSION: Both nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens had high sensitivity and specificity.

To understand the impact of contemplative practices on emotional and mental health during COVID-19, the Stanford WELL for Life Study (US component), incorporated a series of additional surveys into its ongoing study. A total of 1,097 participants residing in California who responded to at least one of three COVID-19 surveys were included in this analysis. Linear and generalized mixed-effects regression models were used to investigate relationships between individual contemplative practice behaviors (CPB) (embodied observing meditation, non-reactive mindfulness meditation, self-compassion cultivation, cultivation of compassion for others) and four psychosocial outcomes measured in the original WELL questionnaire (resilience, dealing with stress, positive emotions, and negative emotions). In addition, the associations between CPB and depression, distress, and compliance with local Shelter-In-Place orders were also investigated. Participants who engaged in any contemplative practice reported significantly more resilience and positive emotions, dealing better with stress, lower distress, and were less likely to report an experience with depression in the last week. Similar findings held when CPB was modeled as a continuous variable. Significant interactions between the duration of the SIP and CPB were also observed for resilience and SIP compliance outcomes, indicating that steeper declines were observed among participants with little or no CPB across the study period.

While digital health interventions (DHIs) for postoperative monitoring are promising, a coordinated, standardized and evidence-based approach regarding their implementation and evaluation is currently lacking. This study aimed to identify DHIs implemented and evaluated in postoperative care to highlight research gaps and assess the readiness for routine implementation. METHODS: A systematic review will be conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to identify studies describing the implementation and evaluation of DHIs for postoperative monitoring published since 2000 (PROSPERO ID: CRD42021264289). This will encompass the Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov databases, and manual search of bibliographies for relevant studies and gray literature. Methodological reporting quality will be evaluated using the Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment and Long-term Follow-up (IDEAL) reporting guideline relevant to the IDEAL stage of the study, and risk of bias will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework.

Focus groups were conducted with African American mothers and fathers (n = 18) in person. Several themes emerged regarding HPV vaccine acceptability including the desire to be informed, the unfamiliarity of vaccination, and mistrust toward government, pharmaceutical companies, and healthcare providers. Parental review of existing campaign messages highlighted the importance of clarifying risks and benefits of vaccination, including cancer prevention, and the preference for straightforward language. When brainstorming strategies to craft effective messages, parents highlighted need for the inclusion of diverse groups across race, gender, and age. Additionally, parents recommended clear language on side effects, eligibility, and additional resources for further information. Our findings highlight concerns and potential strategies to promote HPV vaccination tailored to African American parents and their children. Targeted interventions to increase vaccination need to consider the importance of building trust and representation in health promotional materials.

We have investigated what factors related to the pandemic influenced hospital presentations following self-harm during lockdown in England. METHOD: Mental health clinicians assessing individuals aged 18 years and over presenting to hospitals in Oxford and Derby following self-harm during the period March 23rd to May 17, 2020 recorded whether the self-harm was related to the impact of COVID-19 and, if so, what specific factors were relevant. These factors were organized into a classification scheme. Information was also collected on patients' demographic characteristics, method of self-harm and suicide intent. RESULTS: Of 228 patients assessed, in 46.9% (N = 107) COVID-19 and lockdown restrictions were identified as influencing self-harm. This applied more to females than males (53.5%, N = 68/127 v 38.6%, N = 39/101, &#967;2 = 5.03, p = 0.025), but there were no differences in age, methods of self-harm or suicide intent between the two groups. The most frequent COVID-related factors were mental health issues, including new and worsening disorders, and cessation or reduction of services (including absence of face-to-face support), isolation and loneliness, reduced contact with key individuals, disruption to normal routine, and entrapment. Multiple, often inter-connected COVID-related factors were identified in many patients. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-related factors were identified as influences in nearly half of individuals presenting to hospitals following self-harm in the period following introduction of lockdown restrictions. Females were particularly affected. The fact that mental health problems, including issues with delivery of care, predominated has implications for organisation of services during such periods. The contribution of isolation, loneliness and sense of entrapment highlight the need for relatives, friends and neighbours to be encouraged to reach out to others, especially those living alone.

Digital contact tracing (DCT) uses tools such as cell-phone applications to improve tracing speed and reach. We model the impact of DCT on the spread of the virus for a large epidemiological parameter space consistent with current literature on SARS-CoV-2. We also model DCT in combination with random testing (RT) and social distancing (SD). Modelling is done with two independently developed individual-based (stochastic) models that use the Monte Carlo technique, benchmarked against each other and against two types of deterministic models. For current best estimates of the number of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers (approximately 40%), their contagiousness (similar to that of symptomatic carriers), the reproductive number before interventions ([Formula: see text] at least 3) we find that DCT must be combined with other interventions such as SD and/or RT to push the reproductive number below one. At least 60% of the population would have to use the DCT system for its effect to become significant. On its own, DCT cannot bring the reproductive number below 1 unless nearly the entire population uses the DCT system and follows quarantining and testing protocols strictly. For lower uptake of the DCT system, DCT still reduces the number of people that become infected. When DCT is deployed in a population with an ongoing outbreak where [Formula: see text] (0.1%) of the population have already been infected, the gains of the DCT intervention come at the cost of requiring up to 15% of the population to be quarantined (in response to being traced) on average each day for the duration of the epidemic, even when there is sufficient testing capability to test every traced person.","output":"The impact of digital contact tracing on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemica comprehensive modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to healthcare delivery worldwide including in the delivery of surgical services. The introduction of mRNA COVID vaccines and the significant reactogenicity seen with vaccination has caused an unanticipated impact on the operating room workforce via unanticipated paid time off after employee vaccination. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional survey was made available to approximately 33,000 front-line healthcare workers, students and volunteers who were offered voluntary vaccination in a state-wide healthcare system during phase one of the state's vaccine roll-out. The primary study aim was to determine the frequency of unanticipated paid time off, and the secondary study aim was to identify any demographic determinants influencing the need for unanticipated time off work secondary to adverse effects. RESULTS: 4009 responses were received, a 12.15% response rate. When looking specifically at individuals who did not proactively schedule themselves for time off after vaccination, we determined that unanticipated paid administrative leave was required for 4.9% and 19.79% of individuals after the first and second doses of vaccine, respectively. The average lengths of absence were 1.66 days and 1.39 days for the first and second doses, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences found in the need for unanticipated leave when compared by vaccine manufacturer, gender, age, ethnicity, or job description. However, individuals with a bachelor's degree demonstrated a significantly higher unanticipated leave requirement than respondents who reported other educational backgrounds.

However, the global built environment landscape is undergoing rapid changes. These changes are steeped in three fundamental imperatives, which have serious implications for the developing world. These imperatives are population growth and rising urbanisation;environmental challenges, particularly climate change and the quest to embrace sustainability as a panacea;and advances in technological development. This paper discusses these three imperatives with the view to teasing out their implications for urban development and management in the developing world. Consistent with the literature, the paper establishes that most of the population growth and rising urbanisation are occurring in the developing world, particularly Africa and Asia, and although these phenomena have the tendency to increase economic density and promote both private and public investment in urban development, especially construction/housing and related infrastructure activities, there are and will be several problems with them. These include land tenure insecurity, lack of access to decent affordable housing and the threat of destruction to heritage sites. Furthermore, environmental challenges such as poor waste management, and climate change are and will remain pressing issues requiring the adoption of sustainability credentials because of legislative requirements, moral suasion, and value addition. Despite the potential disruptive nature of technology with respect to some aspects of the built environment, it is recognised that advances in technology are essential to the achievement of optimal urban development and management outcomes in the developing world. The paper, therefore, recommends better understanding of the socio-economic, cultural, and political forces underlying urban growth in the developing world, factoring in technology and sustainability in urban development and management, and collaboration among relevant actors, particularly government and the private sector, for optimal outcomes.","output":"Urban Land and Development Management in a Challenged Developing World: An Overview of New Reflections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of novel coronavirus that started in 2019 has seriously affected daily lives and placed everyone in a panic condition. Widespread coronavirus led to the adoption of social distancing and people avoiding unnecessary physical contact with each other. The present situation advocates the requirement of a contactless biometric system that could be used in future authentication systems which makes fingerprint-based person identification ineffective. Periocular biometric is the solution because it does not require physical contact and is able to identify people wearing face masks. However, the periocular biometric region is a small area, and extraction of the required feature is the point of concern. This paper has proposed adopted multiple features and emphasis on the periocular region. In the proposed approach, combination of local binary pattern (LBP), color histogram and features in frequency domain have been used with deep learning algorithms for classification. Hence, we extract three types of features for the classification of periocular regions for biometric. The LBP represents the textual features of the iris while the color histogram represents the frequencies of pixel values in the RGB channel. In order to extract the frequency domain features, the wavelet transformation is obtained. By learning from these features, a convolutional neural network (CNN) becomes able to discriminate the features and can provide better recognition results. The proposed approach achieved the highest accuracy rates with the lowest false person identification. ? 2022 CRL Publishing.

OGG1 excises 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxo-dG) lesion on DNA that is often induced by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and has been linked to mutations, cancer development, and tissue damage. Most, if not all, environmental toxic agents and mammalian cellular metabolites elicit the generation of ROS, either directly, indirectly, or both, which is among the first cellular responses. ROS in combination with other oxidative molecules/moieties are recognized as a major factor for killing invading pathogens but meanwhile can cause tissue damage. ROS potentially modify proteins, lipids, and DNA due to the strong molecular reactivity. While oxidative stress causes increased levels of all types of oxidatively modified DNA bases, accumulation of 8-oxo-dG in the DNA has been singled out to be a main culprit linking to various inflammatory disease processes. Oxidatively damaged DNA bases such as 8-oxo-dG are primarily repaired by the base excision repair (BER) mechanism, in which OGG1, as the lesion recognition enzyme, plays a fundamental role in fixing this DNA damage.

We developed a multifaceted approach using multiple iterative tests of change, with the primary strategy being increased visibility of URM trainees and faculty to residency applicants. Strategies included applicant interviews with URM faculty, interview dinners with URM residents, visibility at academic conferences for URM trainees, development of targeted marketing materials, and a visiting student program supported by networking with URM residents. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of matched residents in the categorical pediatrics, child neurology, and medical genetics training programs who identified as URM. The percentage of URM residents increased to 16% (6 of 37) in 2018, 26% (11 of 43) in 2019, 19% (8 of 43) in 2020, and 21% (9 of 43) in 2021 (a four-year average of 22% URM residents; P = .0002).

DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING The study was conducted in Shahjadpur, a rural subdistrict of Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS Children (<18 years) with CP and epilepsy identified using the Bangladesh CP Register (BCPR) in the study site. METHODS Assessments were conducted in three focused epilepsy clinics overseen by a paediatric neurologist between December 2016 and January 2018, with intervening phone and video-conference follow-ups. Details of event type, frequency and medication compliance were collected. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were prescribed based on seizure type, family income, comorbidity and medication availability. RESULTS 23.4% (170/726) of the BCPR cohort had a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy of whom 166 were assessed. Following the focused epilepsy clinics, 62.0% (103/166) children were clinically determined to have ongoing epileptic seizures. 62.1% (64/103) had generalised onset tonic clonic seizures, 27.2% (28/103) had focal onset seizures with impaired awareness and 10.7% (11/103) had other seizure types. None of the children with prolonged seizures (31/103) had an emergency seizure management plan. Non-epileptic events were being pharmacologically treated as seizures in 18.1% (30/166) children. Financial constraints were the main reason for non-compliance on follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Gaps in optimum epilepsy management in rural Bangladesh are amenable to improvement anchored with local healthcare workers.

This study is aimed at describing the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. METHODS: 199 COVID-19 patients were admitted to Wuhan Red Cross Hospital in China from January 24th to March 15th. The cases were divided into diabetic and nondiabetic groups according to the history of taking antidiabetic drugs or by plasma fasting blood glucose level at admission, and the difference between groups were compared. RESULTS: Among 199 COVID-19 patients, 76 were diabetic and 123 were nondiabetic. Compared with nondiabetics, patients with diabetes had an older age, high levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), D-dimer, white blood cell, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and total bilirubin (TBIL), lower levels of lymphocyte, albumin and oxygen saturation (SaO(2)), and higher mortality (P < 0.05). The two groups showed no difference in clinical symptoms. Diabetes, higher level of D-dimer at admission, and lymphocyte count less than 0.6  10(9)/L at admission were associated with increasing odds of death. Antidiabetic drugs were associated with decreasing odds of death. Treatment with low molecular weight heparin was not related to odds of death. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with diabetes was significantly higher than those without diabetes.

It is essential to develop mitigation strategies of infection disease transmission (e.g., increase of ventilation rate) in different scenarios to reduce the infection risk. For classrooms in schools, natural ventilation is generally used to provide outdoor air into rooms. However, the supply air volume depends strongly on the local conditions, e.g., window opening size and outdoor wind speed. In this study, the optimal design of classroom window openings is investigated, based on which low-cost window-integrated fans are then employed to enhance the efficiency of natural ventilation and infection disease control. Taking infected students as pollutant sources, numerical simulations are carried out to predict the pollutant concentration under various scenarios of pollutant sources and window opening modes (with/without fans), and to calculate the infection risk. It is found that by redesigning window openings, the airflow distribution performance index (ADPI) can be increased by 17% with corresponding infection likelihood decreased by 27%. The window-integrated fan has a significant effect on improving ventilation performance and prevention of infection disease transmission, leading to an ADPI of 99% and minimum infection probability of 11% for students sitting near the windows.

We discuss our findings in a model that distinguishes between catalysts and buffers of reactance arousal on an individual level and hypothesises how these may lead to compliant or resistant behaviour as acts of resilience in the public sphere. In an online survey (N = 766, May 2020, Germany), we found that reactance arousal towards the restrictions to contain the coronavirus depended on the individual assessment of the limitations of freedom. Data suggest that health related fear buffers reactance arousal, whereas surprisingly, sorrow and cognitive dissonance amplify it. Anger and a critical political attitude towards the government correlate positively with the mobilising power of reactance. We argue that these are essential elements that push individual reactance arousal over the threshold into the public sphere, where it serves to shove resilience towards resistance. Our study expands this essential social-psychological theory to be a driver not only in the individual but also in public behaviour, opening a new perspective on the tipping point between resilience and resistance in the public sphere during this crisis and beyond.

Methods: We extracted publicly available data from various official websites between January 1 and December 31, 2020, summarized the strategies implemented in China, South Korea, Singapore, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, and assessed the effectiveness of the prevention and control measures adopted by these countries with the daily new cases and mortality rate per 100,000 population. Results: China, South Korea, and Singapore adopted containment strategies, which maintained a proactive approach by identifying and managing cases, tracking and isolating close contacts. China and Singapore had a similar epidemic curve and the new daily cases. As of December 31, 2020, the new daily cases of China and Singapore were below 100 with the mortality rates per 100,000 population of 0.3 and 0.5, respectively. But the new daily case of South Korea was as high as 1,029, with a mortality rate per 100,000 population of 1.8. In contrast, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France responded with mitigation strategies that focus on treating severe cases and those with underlying conditions. They had similar epidemic curves and mortality rates per 100,000 population. The United States had up to 234,133 new confirmed cases per day, and the mortality rate per 100,000 population was 107, while the United Kingdom had 56,029 new confirmed cases per day and the mortality rate per 100,000 population was 108, and France had 20,042 new cases per day, with a mortality rate per 100,000 population of 99. Conclusions: China, Korea, and Singapore, which implemented strict containment measures, had significant outbreak control. Meanwhile, the successful practices in China, Singapore, and South Korea show that the containment strategies were practices that work especially at the individual level identifying and managing the infected patients and their close contacts. In the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, which implemented the mitigation policies, the effect of epidemic prevention and control was not significant that the epidemic continued or even increased epidemic relatively quickly.","output":"Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Comparison of Strategies in Six Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and its target G protein-coupled receptor (FSHR) are essential for reproduction. Recent studies have established that the hypo-glycosylated pituitary FSH glycoform (FSH21/18), is more bioactive in vitro and in vivo than the fully-glycosylated variant (FSH24). FSH21/18 predominates in women of reproductive prime and FSH24 in peri-post-menopausal women, suggesting distinct functional roles of these FSH glycoforms. The aim of this study was to determine if differential FSH glycosylation modulated FSHR oligomerization and resulting impact on cAMP signaling. Using a modified super-resolution imaging technique (PD-PALM) to assess FSHR complexes in HEK293 cells expressing FSHR, we observed time and concentration-dependent modulation of FSHR oligomerization by FSH glycoforms. High eFSH and FSH21/18 concentrations rapidly dissociated FSHR oligomers into monomers, whereas FSH24 displayed slower kinetics. The FSHR -arrestin biased agonist, truncated eLH (121-149) combined with asparagine56-deglycosylated eLH (dg-eLHt), increased FSHR homomerization. In contrast, low FSH21/18 and FSH24 concentrations promoted FSHR association into oligomers. Dissociation of FSHR oligomers correlated with time points where higher cAMP production was observed. Taken together, these data suggest that FSH glycosylation may modulate the kinetics and amplitude of cAMP production, in part, by forming distinct FSHR complexes, highlighting potential avenues for novel therapeutic targeting of the FSHR to improve IVF outcomes.","output":"Differential FSH Glycosylation Modulates FSHR Oligomerization and Subsequent cAMP Signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: COVID-19 is a new disease, knowledge on the mode of transmission and clinical features are still evolving, new tests are being developed with inherent challenges regarding interpretation of tests results.

Results: Of the 146 records reviewed, 54% were male; mean age of patients was 41.9  17.5 years, nearly half were asymptomatic, with 9% being severely ill. The commonest presenting symptoms were cough (22.6%), headache (13%) and sore throat (11%) while the commonest co-morbidities were hypertension (25.3%), diabetes mellitus (14%) and heart disease (3.4%). Conclusion: COVID-19 affected more males than females; nearly half of those infected were asymptomatic. Cough, headache and sore throat were the commonest symptoms and mean duration from case confirmation to full recovery was 19 days. Further research is required as pandemic evolves.

Transcription produces precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) and the active gene provides an environment in which the pre-mRNAs are processed, folded, and assembled into RNACprotein (RNP) complexes. The dynamic pre-mRNPs incorporate the growing transcript, proteins, and the processing machineries, as well as the specific protein marks left after processing that are essential for export and the cytoplasmic fate of the mRNPs. After release from the gene, the mRNPs move by diffusion within the interchromatin compartment, making up pools of mRNPs. Here, splicing and polyadenylation can be completed and the mRNPs recruit the major export receptor NXF1. Export competent mRNPs interact with the nuclear pore complex, leading to export, concomitant with compositional and conformational changes of the mRNPs. We summarize the integrated nuclear processes involved in the formation and export of mRNPs.","output":"Integration of mRNP formation and export"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In keeping with federal policy, our state's laws do not permit medical abortion via telemedicine, not even during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, a decision that endangers the lives of women, clinical staff, nurses, and doctors.

Following World Health Organization (WHO) and health care authorities around the World recommendations, all elective surgeries from benign diagnose procedures must be postponed and imperatively continue working on emergent and oncological urgent pathologies. Surgical elective treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is not considered as a priority. During BPH endoscopic surgeries, urine and blood are mixed with the irrigation liquid implying a risk of viral presence. Furthermore, a steam and smoke bubble is being accumulated inside the bladder implying the risk of splashing and aerosols. The risks of other viral infections have been identified during endourological procedures and they are related to splashing events. Several studies observed 33-100% of splashing on goggles. All BPH endoscopic procedures must be postponed. In case of complete urinary obstruction, this event can be adequately treated by urethral or suprapubic catheter under local anesthesia. As soon as local COVID-19 prevalence decreases, endourological procedures could be restarted. As protocols are being validating around the World to redeem elective surgeries, a symptomatic obstructed patient could be operated knowing his COVID-19 status with a molecular PCR, a cleaned epidemiological interview with a normal preoperative protocol. If patient is COVID-19+, surgery must be delayed until complete recovery, because mortality could increase as Lei from Wuhan describes. Informed consent must include risks of complications related to COVID-19 disease. Surgery must be performed by an experienced surgeon in order to avoid increase of operating time and risks of complications.

We investigate the UK prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, identify which population subgroups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant, and report stated reasons for hesitancy.MethodsNationally representative survey data from 12,035 participants were collected from 24th November to 1st December 2020 for wave 6 of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (Understanding Society) COVID-19 web survey. Participants self-reported ethnicity, highest educational attainment, gender, age, how likely they would be to have a vaccine if offered and their main reason for hesitancy. Weighted cross-sectional analysis assessed the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy and logistic regression models estimated independent associations.ResultsOverall vaccine hesitancy was low (18% unlikely/very unlikely). Vaccine hesitancy was higher in women (21.0% vs 14.7% in men), in younger age groups (26.5% in 16C24 year olds vs 4.5% in 75+) and in those with lower education levels (18.6% no qualifications vs 13.2% degree qualified). Vaccine hesitancy was high in Black (71.8%) and Pakistani/Bangladeshi (42.3%) ethnic groups. Odds ratios for vaccine hesitancy after adjustment for age and gender were 13.42 (95% CI:6.86, 26.24) in Black, 2.54 (95% CI:1.19, 5.44) in Pakistani/Bangladeshi groups, and 1.76 (95% CI:1.10, 2.82) for Other White (including Eastern European) ethnic groups (compared to White British/Irish). Vaccine hesitancy was not higher in all minority ethnic groups;for example, ORs were 1.11 (95% CI:0.64, 1.95) for Indian ethnicity and 0.67 (95% CI:0.24, 1.87) for Other Asian (including Chinese) ethnicity. Lower education was also related to vaccine hesitancy (no qualifications versus degree OR 3.54;95% CI:2.06, 6.09) but ethnic differences largely remained when education was included in the model. For those who were vaccine hesitant the most common stated reason for hesitancy was concerns over unknown future effects (42.7%). However, when compared to the White British/Irish group, Black participants were more likely to state they Dont trust vaccines (29.2% vs 5.7%) and the Pakistani/Bangladeshi ethnic group more frequently cited worries about side-effects (35.4% vs 8.6%).ConclusionVaccine hesitancy is strongly associated with education and ethnicity, with marked ethnic heterogeneity. Black and Pakistani/Bangladeshi participants reported considerably greater vaccine hesitancy than White British/Irish ethnicity, but some minority ethnic groups did not. Educational inequalities did not account for ethnic differences. Vaccine programmes need to understand reasons for vaccine hesitancy within specific population sub-groups and take urgent action to improve uptake.","output":"Ethnic and educational inequalities in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy: cross-sectional analysis of the UK household longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia, a leading cause of childhood mortality, is associated with household air pollution (HAP) exposure. Mechanisms between HAP and pneumonia are poorly understood, but studies suggest that HAP may increase the likelihood of bacterial, instead of viral, pneumonia. We assessed the relationship between HAP and infant microbial nasal carriage among 260 infants participating in the Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study (GRAPHS). METHODS: Data are from GRAPHS, a cluster-randomized controlled trial of cookstove interventions (improved biomass or LPG) versus the 3-stone (baseline) cookstove. Infants were surveyed for pneumonia during the first year of life and had routine personal exposure assessments. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from pneumonia cases (n = 130) and healthy controls (n = 130) were analyzed for presence of 22 common respiratory microbes by MassTag polymerase chain reaction. Data analyses included intention-to-treat (ITT) comparisons of microbial species presence by study arm, and exposure-response relationships. RESULTS: In ITT analyses, 3-stone arm participants had a higher mean number of microbial species than the LPG (LPG: 2.71, 3-stone: 3.34, p < 0.0001, n = 260). This difference was driven by increased bacterial (p < 0.0001) rather than viral species presence (non-significant). Results were pronounced in pneumonia cases and attenuated in healthy controls. Higher prevalence bacterial species were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Exposure-response relationships did not yield significant associations between measured CO and nasal microbial carriage. CONCLUSIONS: Our intention-to-treat findings are consistent with a link between HAP and bacterial nasal carriage. No relationships were found for viral carriage. Given the null results in exposure-response analysis, it is likely that a pollutant besides CO is driving these differences.","output":"Examining the relationship between household air pollution and infant microbial nasal carriage in a Ghanaian cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efforts to best protect the world from SARS-CoV-2 as variants emerge and despite limited vaccine supply are ongoing.

Abstract Objective: The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since December 2019, along a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and depressive disorders in the general population. Psychological trauma can partly explain these troubles. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the hosts immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric pathologies. So, this article aims to identify the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to think about possible actions of screening and care that could ensue. Method : Drawing on data from previous pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the authors performed a narrative review on the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on the one hand, on the children and adults directly infected, and the subsequent risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand. Results: As in previous pandemics, the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or the infection during pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. Conclusion: In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for possible neurodevelopmental disorders.","output":"Immuno-psychiatrie et pandmie de SARS-CoV-2: liens et possibles consquences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Variations in the ACE2 activity in saliva could explain the striking differences of susceptibility to infection and risk of severe disease. METHODS: We analyze the activity of ACE2 in saliva in different population groups across a wide age range and disease status during April to June 2020, and we establish differences between infected people and participants considered resistant (highly exposed healthcare workers and children who cohabited with parents with COVID-19 without isolation and remain IgG negative). RESULTS: We included 74 adults, of which 47 (64%) were susceptible and 27 (36%) were resistant, and 79 children, of which 41 (52%) were susceptible and 38 (48%) were resistant. Resistant adults have significantly lower ACE2 activity in saliva than susceptible adults and non-significant higher values than susceptible and resistant children. ACE2 activity is similar in the susceptible and resistant pediatric population (p=0.527). In contrast, we observe an increase in activity as the disease's severity increases among the adult population (mild disease vs. severe disease, 39 vs. 105 FU, p=0.039; severe disease vs. resistant, 105 vs. 31 FU, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: using an enzymatic test, we show that ACE2 activity in saliva correlates with the susceptibility to SARS-Cov-2 infection and disease severity. Children and adults with low-susceptibility to SARS-Cov-2 infection showed the lowest ACE2 activity. These findings could inform future strategies to identify at-risk individuals.","output":"Differences in saliva ACE2 activity among infected and non-infected adult and pediatric population exposed to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent epidemiological data show an increase of depression and anxiety that cause a loss of about 3C4% of the gross domestic product in Europe, as a consequence of a reduced productivity and a premature death of people. Gender differences in both psychopathologies were found from mid-to-late adolescence until 55 years, and data indicate an increase of depression in women. Considering these data, new interventions focused on promoting psychological well-being were designed. A predictive factor of psychological disorders is Emotional Intelligence (EI), the ability to understand and regulate our own emotions, as well as those of others. EI is associated with psychological well-being, as well as with the treatment of mental illness, but gender differences in the association among EI, anxiety and depression remains unclear. The present study aims at analyzing the nomological associations among EI, anxiety and depression. Furthermore, the possible moderating role of gender in the relation between EI, depression and anxiety is investigated in a sample of 1725 healthy participants. Our results show that the ability to recognize and to control emotions in the social context helps us to reduce the risk to be affected by depression and anxiety. Moreover, our study shows that the association of EI with anxiety and depression wasnt gender moderated. In conclusion, the findings highlight that EI can help people to manage emotions linked to negative events and to successfully understand emotions in others.

This has led to shortage of donor corneas worldwide. Glycerol preservation of tissue remains a viable option in this scenario. The objective is to compare fresh corneal tissue (FCT) with glycerol-preserved cornea (GPC) in emergency corneal transplantation. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary care centre of Uttarakhand. Medical records of the patients who underwent therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (TPK) were reviewed. FCT group included patients who underwent TPK with fresh corneal tissue and GPC group included patients who underwent TPK with glycerol preserved cornea. The indications and outcomes of TPK in the terms of therapeutic success were analysed and compared between both the groups. Results: A total of 94 eyes of 91 patients underwent TPK from October 2011 to August 2017. FCT group included 60 eyes of 57 patients and GPC group included 34 eyes of 34 patients. The primary indication of TPK was infectious keratitis in both the groups (FCT-81.6%; GPC - 91.2%) There was no significant difference in the therapeutic success in both the groups (P = 0.741, Odds ratio- 1.59 with 95% CI- 0.39-6.44).

However, it remains unclear whether early responses of inflammatory cytokines would lead to high or low titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled a cohort of 272 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Laboratory assessments of serum cytokines (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-), anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies, and peripheral blood biomarkers were conducted during hospitalization. RESULTS: At hospital admission, 36.4% patients were severely ill, 51.5% patients were  65 years, and 60.3% patients had comorbidities. Higher levels of IL-2R and IL-6 were observed in older patients (65 years). Significant differences of IL-2R (week 2 to week 5 from symptom onset), IL-6 (week 1 to week 5), IL-8 (week 2 to week 5), and IL-10 (week 1 to week 3) were observed between moderately-ill and severely ill patients. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers were significantly higher in severely ill patients than in moderately ill patients, but such difference was not observed for IgM. High titers of early-stage IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- (2 weeks after symptom onset) were positively correlated with high titers of late-stage IgG (5 weeks after symptom onset). Deaths were mostly observed in severely ill older patients (45.9%). Survival analyses revealed risk factors of patient age, baseline COVID-19 severity, and baseline IL-6 that affected survival time, especially in severely ill older patients. CONCLUSION: Early responses of elevated cytokines such as IL-6 reflect the active immune responses, leading to high titers of IgG antibodies against COVID-19.

This paper proposes an inductive RGCN for learning informative relation embeddings even in the few-shot learning regime. The proposed inductive model significantly outperforms the RGCN and state-of-the-art KGE models in few-shot learning tasks. Furthermore, we apply our method on the drug-repurposing knowledge graph (DRKG) for discovering drugs for Covid-19.

METHODS: Parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial was performed with hospitalized patients aged &#8805; 18 years with clinical, epidemiological and/or radiological suspected COVID-19, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazil. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to receive either intravenous MP (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline solution), twice daily, for 5 days. A modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis was conducted. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. ClinicalTrials Identifier NCT04343729. FINDINGS: From April 18 to June 16, 2020, 647 patients were screened, 416 randomized, and 393 analyzed as mITT, MP in 194 and placebo in 199 individuals. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR in 81.3%. Mortality at day 28 was not different between groups. A subgroup analysis showed that patients over 60 years in the MP group had a lower mortality rate at day 28. Patients in the MP arm tended to need more insulin therapy, and no difference was seen in virus clearance in respiratory secretion until day 7. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that a short course of MP in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 did not reduce mortality in the overall population.","output":"Methylprednisolone as Adjunctive Therapy for Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 (Metcovid): A Randomised, Double-Blind, Phase IIb, Placebo-Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacterial keratitis (BK), a painful and fulminant bacterial infection of the cornea, is the most common type of vision-threatening infectious keratitis (IK). A rapid clinical diagnosis by an ophthalmologist may often help prevent BK patients from progression to corneal melting or even perforation, but many rural areas cannot afford an ophthalmologist. Thanks to the rapid development of deep learning (DL) algorithms, artificial intelligence via image could provide an immediate screening and recommendation for patients with red and painful eyes. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the potentials of different DL algorithms for diagnosing BK via external eye photos. External eye photos of clinically suspected IK were consecutively collected from five referral centers. The candidate DL frameworks, including ResNet50, ResNeXt50, DenseNet121, SE-ResNet50, EfficientNets B0, B1, B2, and B3, were trained to recognize BK from the photo toward the target with the greatest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Via five-cross validation, EfficientNet B3 showed the most excellent average AUROC, in which the average percentage of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value was 74, 64, 77, and 61. There was no statistical difference in diagnostic accuracy and AUROC between any two of these DL frameworks. The diagnostic accuracy of these models (ranged from 69 to 72%) is comparable to that of the ophthalmologist (66% to 74%). Therefore, all these models are promising tools for diagnosing BK in first-line medical care units without ophthalmologists.","output":"Comparisons of deep learning algorithms for diagnosing bacterial keratitis via external eye photographs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global health crisis. The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 (in particular the receptor binding domain, RBD) to its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the antibodies is of great importance in understanding the infectivity of COVID-19 and evaluating the candidate therapeutic for COVID-19. In this work, we propose a new method based on molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) to accurately calculate the free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 and antibodies. The calculated binding free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 is -13.3 kcal/mol, and that of SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2 is -11.4 kcal/mol, which agrees well with experimental result (-11.3 kcal/mol and -10.1 kcal/mol, respectively). Moreover, we take two recently reported antibodies as the example, and calculate the free energy of antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, which is also consistent with the experimental findings. Further, within the framework of the modified MM/PBSA, we determine the key residues and the main driving forces for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/CB6 interaction by the computational alanine scanning method.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused psychological distress, both in infected and uninfected individuals. The present study evaluated the validity and factor structure of the COVID-19-Related Psychological Distress Scale (CORPDS) among the general public of the Persian-speaking population. The original version of the CORPDS was translated and back-translated into Persian, followed by a pilot study. A total sample (n = 623) completed an online survey including the CORPDS, Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). The Persian CORPDS had very good internal consistency and moderate test-retest reliability after 4 weeks. Maximum likelihood confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test construct validity (&#967;2/df = 2.39, CFI = 0.95, SRMR = 0.046, PCLOSE = 0.67 > 0.05, RMSEA = 0.047, 90% CI [0.038, 0.056]). Measurement invariance was performed across gender, including configural invariance, metric invariance, scalar invariance, and error variance invariance, and yielded further support for the two-factor structure of the CORPDS. The CORPDS correlated with the score on the K10 (r = 0.46, p < 0.01, 95% CI [0.43, 0.48]), CAS (r = 0.43, p < 0.01, 95% CI [0.37, 0.45]), FCV-19S (r = 0.29, p < 0.01, 95% CI [0.27, 0.32]), LOT-R (r = - 0.19, p < 0.01, 95% CI [- 0.15, - 0.24]) and BRS (r = - 0.56, p < 0.01, 95% CI [- 0.50, - 0.61]).

Methods: Sample collection was conducted based on the standard operating procedure. Tianlong automatic magnetic bead nucleic acid extraction reagent was used for RNA extraction. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using four approved COVID-19 nucleic acid detection kits. Related epidemiological data of the cases were collected. One-way analysis of variance and non-parametric test for inter-group differences analysis were conducted using SPSS25.0 software. Results: A total of 162 PCR tests were completed for novel coronavirus nucleic acid detection in 123 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Eleven PCR results were positive for a single target gene and 10 of which were positive for nucleocapsid protein (N) gene. Nineteen cases were tested with two kinds of nucleic acid detection kits and the results of different detection kits were different. Different types of samples were collected form 13 cases for nucleic acid detection and the results showed that the Ct value of sputum sample was lower than that of throat swab sample. No significant difference in Ct values of throat swab samples was observed among patients with different clinical symptoms (P Ct-N=0.797, P Ct-ORF1a/b=0.551). The 123 cases were divided into different groups according to the time interval between the onset date and the date of the first positive detection of viral nucleic acid. No significant difference in Ct values of throat swab samples was observed among different time interval groups (P Ct-N=0.373, P Ct-ORF1a/b=0.058). Conclusions: Sputum samples were better than upper respiratory tract samples for viral nucleic acid detection. The sensitivity of N gene detection was higher, but re-sampling was needed when the result was positive for the single target N gene. Appropriate detection kits should be selected according to the actual needs, and samples should be collected at multiple time points, in multiple types and form multiple sites for detection.","output":"Laboratory test results of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Tianjin and related influencing factors/ ͹״ȷﲡԭѧӰط"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: One-hundred and forty patients at Croydon University Hospital received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on a specialist respiratory ward, as a bridge to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or as a ceiling of care for COVID-19.

In case of recurrence, treatment options include second surgery, pituitary radiation, targeted medical therapy to control hypercortisolism, and bilateral adrenalectomy. Success rates of all these treatment options vary between 25 (some of the medical therapy) and 100% (bilateral adrenalectomy).

RECENT FINDINGS In the past 5 years, multiple studies brought a fresh insight into the pathogenesis of myositis by introducing new factors or further characterizing the role of the well established mediators in myositis. Among the mediators reviewed in this article, special attention was paid to interferons, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, interleukin-18 and the IL23/Th17 axis. Some of the recent work has also focused on the nontraditional cytokines, such as adipokines, myokines, S100 proteins, High Mobility Group Box 1 or B-cell activating factor and on several anti-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, microRNAs and their potential to reflect the disease activity or to regulate the inflammatory processes in myositis have recently been subject of intensive investigation. Some of the above-mentioned mediators have been proposed as promising clinical biomarkers or therapeutic targets for myositis.

We used multiple logistic regression and propensity score-matching to compare the outcomes of patients who did or did not receive regdanvimab. The primary outcome was in-hospital progression to severe or critical status, or death. RESULTS: Of 586 patients eligible for regdanvimab, 256 patients who received regdanvimab and 251 untreated patients were included. The median age was 66 years and 47.5% were men.

As this pandemic persists the second, third and fourth quarters had shown variation in COVID-19 cases. In the first quarter of the year 2021 again there seems to be a rise in cases of COVID- 19. So, a comparative analysis from March 2020 - April 2021 of COVID-19 cases has been studied. Methodology: An exponential statistical model was used to calculate the predicted value of COVID-19 using doubling time for a short duration. The cases of COVID-19 were predicted from 10th April 2021 to 10th June 2021 using doubling time and exponential regression method. Results: The distribution of cases showed a curve-linear trend over the last one year. We explored various models like exponential, logarithmic (lo-linear), linear, quadratic, and generalized linear model (GLM) to fit into the observed distribution of cases. Since the distribution of cases was perfectly following a linear trend in each of the four segments, we applied a linear regression model to observed distribution and then predicted the anticipated no. of cases by extending this linear trend to a future period (120 day). With the help of the exponential statistical model, doubling time/rate based on prior 9 days, the predictions of up to 2.61 lakhs cases have been done by the end of June 2021.

The spike protein is the largest structural component of the virus and mediates interactions essential for infection, including with the primary ACE2 receptor. We performed two independent cell-based systematic screens to determine whether there are additional proteins by which the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can interact with human cells. We discovered that in addition to ACE2, expression of LRRC15 also causes spike protein binding. This interaction is distinct from other known spike attachment mechanisms such as heparan sulfates or lectin receptors. Measurements of orthologous coronavirus spike proteins implied the interaction was restricted to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting LRRC15 represents a novel class of spike binding interaction. We localized the interaction to the C-terminus of the S1 domain, and showed that LRRC15 shares recognition of the ACE2 receptor binding domain. From analyzing proteomics and single-cell transcriptomics, we identify LRRC15 expression as being common in human lung vasculature cells and fibroblasts. Although infection assays demonstrated that LRRC15 alone is not sufficient to permit viral entry, we present evidence it can modulate infection of human cells. This unexpected interaction merits further investigation to determine how SARS-CoV-2 exploits host LRRC15 and whether it could account for any of the distinctive features of COVID-19. In briefWe present evidence from genome-wide screening that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with human cells expressing LRRC15. The interaction is distinct from previously known classes of spike attachment factors, and appears to have emerged recently within the coronavirus family. Although not sufficient for cell invasion, this interaction can modulate viral infection. Our data point to an unappreciated host factor for SARS-CoV-2, with potential relevance to COVID-19.

Delays in the supply chain can bring consequences such as the lack of food products by retailers, transporters and manufacturers. Thus, this study aims to examine the supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic in small- and medium-sized food companies in the central region of Portugal, identifying potential problems and pointing out the respective solutions. For this purpose, the study uses a qualitative methodology through semi-structured interviews. It was found that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) do not have a codified supply chain and that generally, these companies have a minimal budget, which requires a constant search for new suppliers that represent a reduction in costs. Moreover, most of the companies surveyed faced unexpected challenges, such as a lack of alternative suppliers. The present paper is original because it studies the supply chain in SMEs in the food sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it allows the ascertainment of practical suggestions for these companies to improve, as well as contributing to the clarification of the literature on the supply chain in times of crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Disorders, Vulnerabilities and Resilience in the Supply Chain in Pandemic Times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we describe the synthesis of mono- and bis-1H-1,2,3-triazole-tethered -lactamCisatin conjugates using copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction between mono- and di-propargylated azetidin-2-ones and N-alkylazido isatins. The synthesized conjugates were evaluated for their preliminary in vitro analysis against Trichomonas vaginalis at 50 M. The efficacy of synthesized hybrids was observed to depend on the substituent at N-1 position of -lactam ring, as well as the presence of single/double 1H-1,2,3-triazole linker. Among the synthesized conjugates, the presence of a p-tolyl substituent at N-1 of -lactam ring was preferred for good activity profiles while the increase in spacer length did not influence the efficacy of the compounds. Compounds with high levels of potency were further analysed to determine their IC(50) values, as well as cytotoxicity profiles against mammalian cells. The most active compound in the synthesized conjugates displayed an IC(50) value of 10.49 M against cultured G3 strain of T. vaginalis and was non-toxic to cultured mammalian HeLa cells at the same concentration.

PoM is indicative of a calm and stable emotional state marked by self-control and spiritual cultivation and is believed to align with the perceptions of subjective well-being in Chinese or eastern cultures. A three-wave cross-lag study using an online questionnaire survey was conducted on 107 employees in Chinese enterprises during the pandemic.

This has led to the development of multiplex respiratory assays that include SARS-CoV-2 as a target. One such assay is the BioFire respiratory panel 2.1 (RP2.1), which is an expansion of the original BioFire FilmArray respiratory panel 2 (RP2) to include SARS-CoV-2. In this multicenter evaluation, we assessed the performance characteristics of the BioFire RP2.1 for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. One or more targets on the panel were detected in 19.3% (101/524) of specimens tested, with SARS-CoV-2 detected in 12.6% (66/524) of specimens. Human rhinovirus/enterovirus was also detected in 32.7% (33/101) and adenovirus in 3.0% (3/101) of positive specimens, with one dual positive for both SARS-CoV-2 and adenovirus being detected. A further breakdown of pathogens by age revealed a 4-fold predominance of human rhinovirus/enterovirus in subjects 0 to 18 years of age, whereas in all other age groups, SARS-CoV-2 was clearly the predominant pathogen. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 results obtained from the BioFire RP2.1 were highly concordant with the composite result, exhibiting 98.4% (61/62) positive percent agreement (95% confidence interval [CI], 91.4 to 99.7%) and 98.9% (457/462) negative percent agreement (95% CI, 97.5 to 99.5%) with further analysis of discordant results suggesting that the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in the specimens was near the limit of detection (LoD) for both the BioFire RP2.1 and the comparator assays.

Consequently, it is likely that these have been adversely impacted by COVID-19 outbreak due to disruptions to the schedules of children with ASD. AIM This study investigated the stress and emotional well-being of parents of children with ASD in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD The study obtained quantitative data from 150 parents of children with ASD from different regions in Saudi Arabia using an online survey. The data collected included demographic data of the parents, ASD status of the family, ASD support during COVID-19 pandemic, severity of ASD behaviours in comparison to the pre- COVID-19 status eating behaviour of the child with ASD, Parental Stress, and emotional well-being. The PSI-short form (PSI-SF) (Abidin, 1995) scale was utilised to obtain data related to parental stress and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) (Goldberg, 1992) scale was utilised to obtain data related to parents' emotional well-being. RESULTS The study found that family ASD status (in particular, age and gender of child with ASD, and severity of his/her symptoms) had a significant impact on parental stress and emotional well-being. Moreover, parental stress and emotional well-being were negatively impacted by the frequency and usefulness of ASD support received during COVID-19 pandemic. These were also adversely impacted by the change in severity of ASD behaviours of the children with ASD. Finally, parental stress was found to have a negative impact on the emotional well-being of parents. Overall, the study found that the parental stress and emotional well-being of parents of children with ASD in Saudi Arabia had been unfavourably impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the study found that the parental stress and emotional well-being of parents with ASD in Saudi Arabia had been unfavourably impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. This study recommends the involvement of the Saudi Ministry of Health to establish and extend support services to support parents of children with ASD. Moreover, the provision of training programs to help parents deal with the characteristic behaviour of their children with ASD such as, the ability to maintain routines, aggressive or repetitive behaviour, is also recommended.","output":"Stress and emotional wellbeing of parents due to change in routine for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) at home during COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although COVID-19 has been primarily associated with pneumonia, recent data show that its causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, can infect many vital organs beyond the lungs, including the heart, kidneys and the brain. The literature agrees that COVID-19 is likely to have long-term mental health effects on infected individuals, which signifies a need to understand the role of the virus in the pathophysiology of brain disorders that is currently unknown and widely debated. Our docking and molecular dynamic simulations show that the affinity of the spike protein from the wild type (WT) and the South African B.1.351 (SA) variant towards MAO enzymes is comparable to that for its ACE2 receptor. This allows for the WT/SAMAO complex formation, which changes MAO affinities for their neurotransmitter substrates, thereby impacting their metabolic conversion and misbalancing their levels. Knowing that this fine regulation is strongly linked with the etiology of various brain pathologies, these results are the first to highlight the possibility that the interference with the brain MAO catalytic activity is responsible for the increased neurodegenerative illnesses following a COVID-19 infection, thus placing a neurobiological link between these two conditions in the spotlight. Since the obtained insight suggests that a more contagious SA variant causes even larger disturbances, and with new and more problematic strains likely emerging in the near future, we firmly advise that the presented prospect of the SARS-CoV-2 induced neurological complications should not be ignored, but rather requires further clinical investigations to achieve an early diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions.","output":"COVID-19 infection and neurodegeneration: Computational evidence for interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and monoamine oxidase enzymes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The capability of the International Monitoring System (IMS) to detect xenon from underground nuclear explosions is dependent on the radioactive xenon background.

The amount of xenon released from these facilities may be equivalent to or exceed that released from an underground nuclear explosion. Thus the release of gaseous fission products within days of irradiation makes it difficult to distinguish MIP emissions from a nuclear explosion. In addition, recent shortages in molybdenum-99 have created interest and investment opportunities to design and build new MIP facilities in the United States and throughout the world.

Vaccine transportation and administration lead times are also incorporated within the models. We also develop robust optimization versions of the single vaccine model to account for the impact of uncertainty in model parameters on the optimal vaccine distribution solution. We use the case of the Indian state of Bihar and COVID-19 vaccines to illustrate the implementation of the framework. We present computational experiments to demonstrate: (a) the organization of the model outputs; (b) how the models can be used to assess the impact of cold chain point storage capacities, transportation vehicle capacities, and manufacturer capacities on the optimal vaccine distribution pattern; and (c) the impact of vaccine efficacies and associated costs such as ordering and transportation costs on the vaccine selection decision informed by the model. We then consider the computational expense of the framework for realistic problem instances, and suggest multiple preprocessing techniques to reduce their computational burden.

Unfortunately, patient adherence to guidelines for routine testing can be poor and there are significant gender-based disparities in DM management and outcomes. Recent evidence suggests that menstrual blood may be comparable to systemic blood for monitoring of common biomarkers. The objective of the present study was to assess the concordance of HbA1c levels between menstrual and systemic blood in healthy women and women with diabetes of reproductive age. METHODS: In this prospective, observational cohort study, we enrolled healthy and diabetic (type 1 and type 2 DM) reproductive-age women (aged 18 and 45 years). Menstrual blood and venous systemic blood specimens were simultaneously obtained at time of menstruation, and analysed for HbA1c levels. Participants self-collected menstrual blood using a QPad, a novel, modified menstrual pad with an embedded dried blood spot strip. RESULTS: Among 172 participants, 57.6% were healthy and 42.4% had a diagnosis of either type 1 or type 2 DM. There were no significant differences in mean HbA1c values in menstrual and systemic blood across the overall cohort or within the diabetic subgroup. Furthermore, HbA1c levels between blood sources were robustly correlated and demonstrated a significant linear relationship. CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong concordance in HbA1c levels between menstrual and systemic blood. Empowered by self-collection technologies, these findings suggest that menstrual blood may serve as a reliable, non-invasive and potentially cost-effective alternative to serum for HbA1c monitoring among reproductive-age women with DM.","output":"Novel use of menstrual blood for monitoring glycaemic control in patients with diabetes: a proof-of-concept study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, 2019 outbreak of coronavirus (Covid-19) spread all over the world as well as in Turkey.

The median age of the patients was 10 years, boys and girls ratio was 1.5 (18/12). Of the patients, 80.7% had family contact and 11.5% had comorbidity. The most common symptom was fever (84.6%), and cough was the second frequency (57.7%). All patients except 1 patient had a mild course, 5 were asymptomatic. One patient needed intensive care who had underlying chronic disease. Neutropenia was the most common laboratory anomaly (36.6%). Increased D-dimer levels were observed in 9 patients (30%), decreased leukocyte was in 7 patients (23.3%) and increasedlactate dehydrogenaz level was in 8 patients (26.6%). Chest computed tomography was taken 14 patients who had an abnormal chest X-rays, and ground-glass opacities were seen in 6 patients (20%).

The survey found that care was rated highly, including among people of Black Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) background. However, sleep-quality and communication about medications and discharge-planning were identified as areas for improvement. Methods: To improve care for people with COVID-19 admitted to our centre, we designed an educational package for healthcare professionals working on COVID-19 wards. The package, implemented in August 2020, included healthcare worker training sessions on providing holistic care and placement of \\"Practice Pointers\\" posters. Patient satisfaction was re-evaluated during the second/third COVID-19 waves in Liverpool (September 2020 - February 2021). Results: Across waves, most (95%) respondents reported that they would recommend our hospital to friends and/or family and rated overall care highly. Comparison of the responses of second/third-wave respondents (n=101) with first-wave respondents (n=94) suggested improved patient satisfaction across most care domains but especially those related to having worries and fears addressed and being consulted about medications and their side-effects. Conclusions: People admitted with COVID-19 to our centre in Liverpool, including those from BAME background, rated the care they received highly.

This study addresses these gaps in the prior literature by examining the relative influence of six dimensions of financial attitude, namely, financial anxiety, optimism, financial security, deliberative thinking, interest in financial issues, and needs for precautionary savings, on the trading activity of retail investors during the pandemic. Data were collected from 404 respondents and analyzed using the artificial neural network (ANN) method. The results revealed that all six dimensions had a positive influence on trading activity, with interest in financial issues exerting the strongest influence, followed by deliberative thinking. The study thus contributes important inferences for researchers and managers.","output":"Has financial attitude impacted the trading activity of retail investors during the COVID-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Motor neuron disease (MND) is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. The Motor Neuron Disease Systematic Multi-Arm Randomised Adaptive Trial (MND-SMART) is a multisite UK trial seeking to address the paucity in effective disease-modifying drugs for people with MND (pwMND). Historically, neurological trials have been plagued by suboptimal recruitment and high rates of attrition. Failure to recruit and/or retain participants can cause insufficiently representative samples, terminated trials or invalid conclusions. This study investigates patient-specific factors affecting recruitment and retention of pwMND to MND-SMART. Improved understanding of these factors may improve trial protocol design, optimise recruitment and retention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PwMND on the Scottish MND Register, Clinical Audit Research and Evaluation of MND (CARE-MND), will be invited to participate in a prospective observational cohort study that investigates factors affecting trial participation and attrition. We hypothesise that patient-specific factors will significantly affect trial recruitment and retention. Participants will complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form Y to evaluate neuropsychiatric symptoms, the ALS-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief Form and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention-Health-Related Quality of Life for quality of life and a novel study-specific questionnaire on Attitudes towards Clinical Trial Participation (ACT-Q). Clinical data on phenotype, cognition (Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen) and physical functioning (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised) will also be collated. Caregivers will complete the Brief Dimensional Apathy Scale. After 12 months, a data request to MND-SMART will evaluate recruitment and retention. Descriptive statistics will summarise and compare assessments and participants reaching impairment thresholds. Variable groupings: attitudes, quality of life, cognition, behaviour, physical functioning, neuropsychiatric and phenotype. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression will explore association with participation/withdrawal in MND-SMART; presented as ORs and 95% CIs.

To make this possible, however, it is necessary that all groups of people are considered. Contexts of informal settlements and populations such as the homeless and migrants are often forgotten by vaccination campaigns. In this study, carried out as a result of a collaboration with MEDU, a non-profit association aimed at bringing healthcare to vulnerable populations, we provide important data related to the vaccination campaign carried out in the informal settlements of Rome. The objectives of this work are to (1) evaluate vaccination coverage in these contexts, (2) assess the gap with the vaccination coverage of the Italian population and try to hypothesize the causes, and (3) provide recommendations for how humanitarian associations can respond to reduce this gap. We observed important differences in vaccination coverage depending on the type of settlement. The percentage of vaccinated people in these contexts at the beginning of October range between 14.4% and 55.5%, underlining an important gap with the vaccination rate of Italys population, which is close to 80%. The data also show that particular attention must be paid to the transiting and irregular people as they are more at risk for a lack of access to vaccination. With this study, in which we provide recommendations that integrate MEDUs fieldwork experience with the advice of the Framework report, we hope we can help those who work in similar contexts, to carry out a fair and effective vaccination campaign.","output":"Access to COVID-19 Vaccination during the Pandemic in the Informal Settlements of Rome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The treatment for rectal cancer and benign rectal lesions continues to progress in the arena of minimally invasive surgery.

The present study was conducted to better understand the effects of GB on immune responses in a mouse model, and to demonstrate the clearance effects of this mineral against Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in experimentally infected pigs as an initial step towards the development of a feed supplement that would promote immune activity and help prevent diseases. In the mouse model, dietary supplementation with GB enhanced concanavalin A (ConA)-induced lymphocyte proliferation and increased the percentage of CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes. In pigs experimentally infected with PRRSV, viral titers in lungs and lymphoid tissues from the GB-fed group were significantly decreased compared to those of the control group 12 days post-infection. Corresponding histopathological analyses demonstrated that GB-fed pigs displayed less severe pathological changes associated with PRRSV infection compared to the control group, indicating that GB promotes PRRSV clearance. These antiviral effects in pigs may be related to the ability of GB to increase CD3+CD8+ T lymphocyte production observed in the mice.

Using country-level data on 40 SSA countries from 1996 to 2014 and rainfall deviations as an instrument for agricultural official development assistance (ODA) in fixed-effect estimation settings, this paper examines the instantaneous impact of agricultural ODA on agricultural fixed capital formation in SSA. The question here is whether aid to agriculture does translate instantaneously to building fixed capital urgently needed to address the effect of any potential crisis on food insecurity. Measuring agricultural fixed capital as fixed investments in farm machinery, dams, industrial buildings for agricultural and agro-processing, fences, ditches, drains, etc., we find that capital formation in SSA agriculture improves instantaneously with agricultural ODA inflows. Second, we find that even though rainfall deviations are associated with agricultural ODA inflows to SSA, institutions particularly those designed to control corruption and strengthen rule of law, do matter for agricultural aid inflows to SSA. These results suggest that agricultural ODA is necessary to accelerate agricultural investments and achieve food security.

Here we discuss emerging evidence suggesting a tissue-specific and vessel type-specific immunomodulatory role for distinct subtypes of ECs, here collectively referred to as immunomodulatory ECs (IMECs).

METHODS We reviewed the medical records and clinical photographs of 26 patients seen at 5 centers in Turkey and Belgium between March 16, 2006, and July 6, 2010. Observation procedures included clinical examination, anterior segment color photography, gonioscopy, laser flare photometry, and pupillometry. RESULTS All 26 patients (20 women and 6 men; mean [SD] age, 43.2 [10.5] years) had bilateral involvement. Twenty-three patients (88%) had acute-onset disease with severe photophobia and red eyes. Nineteen patients (73%) had a preceding flulike illness and used systemic antibiotics, including moxifloxacin. Diagnostic laboratory workup was unremarkable. There was pigment discharge into the anterior chamber, and flare was elevated in the absence of inflammatory cells. Most patients had severe diffuse transillumination of the iris and mydriatic distorted pupils. Pupillometry revealed a compromised reaction to light. The most serious complication was an intractable early rise in intraocular pressure. Gonioscopy revealed heavy pigment deposition in the trabecular meshwork. Although symptoms were relieved promptly by application of topical corticosteroid, the median duration of pigment dispersion was 5.25 months. CONCLUSIONS Bilateral acute iris transillumination with pigment dispersion and persistent mydriasis is a new clinical entity that is not an ocular adverse effect of oral moxifloxacin treatment, as previously suggested.

The existing polishing methods have several limitations such as bluntness of tool due to loading, metallurgical changes on the polished surface due to frictional heat generated at the interface, etc. These limitations have prompted the researchers to develop self-sharpening polishing tools. One such method is Ice Bonded Abrasive Polishing (IBAP) which uses frozen slurry for polishing, where ice serves as a matrix to hold the abrasives. Frictional heat produced at tool work interface causes the tool to melt and thus exposes fresh abrasives present in different layers. This paper attempts to interpret the mechanisms responsible for the ultrafine surface generation and then to develop an analytical model for estimating material removal. During polishing, the asperities on work surface experience variable force due to the changing condition of the tool with time. Initially, the first layer of rigid ice with fixed abrasives interacts with the work surface, making it as a solid-solid interaction. Molten state of ice behaves as semisolid and leads to slurry formation afterward. Therefore, the work surface will experience two-body and three-body interactions simultaneously. The proposed model implements the concepts of contact mechanics for predicting material removal from the work surface and finally, the effectiveness of the model has been validated with experimental results.","output":"A mechanistic approach to predict the material removal rate in Ice Bonded Abrasive Polishing (IBAP)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Prescribing a drug for a child is not an easy task and requires using the best available evidence as a guide, especially when a drug is used off-label. The practice of prescribing a drug for off-label use is fairly widespread worldwide. The FDA does not regulate prescribing patterns or practices of individual practitioners and, therefore, allows off-label use. The main objective of this study is to evaluate off-label prescribing among the pediatric population in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Method This is a retrospective, simple random selection observational study of children (15 years) who visited pediatric clinics and had at least 1 drug prescribed over a 12-month period (January to December 2018). Results A total of 865 drugs (mean 1 and SD 0.24) were prescribed to 326 children. Off-label was identified in 39.4% of the drugs with a frequency of 512 (as 1 drug may belong to more than 1 off-label category). The most common reason for off-label prescribing was related to doses that were \\"higher or lower than the recommended use\\" (48.6%), and the most frequently identified drug class prescribed for off-label use was anti-infective drugs for systemic use (39.9%). The percentage of off-label drug use was found to be higher in girls and in the age group of 1 month to 2 years (P = .001) for both variables. In addition, a significant association was found between off label drug use and the total number of drugs prescribed, P < .001. Conclusion The findings of this study showed a high incidence of off-label prescribing mainly related to dosing and indication. The results of this observational study support the need to establish a unified national pediatric dosing formulary guide to ensure safe drug use in pediatrics.","output":"Off-Label Drug Use in Pediatric Out-Patient Care: A Multi-Center Observational Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 and its social responses threaten the health of people living with HIV. We conducted a rapid-response interview to assess COVID-19 protective behaviors of people living with HIV and the impact of their responses on HIV-related health care. METHOD: Men and women living with HIV (N = 162) aged 20C37 years participating in a longitudinal study of HIV treatment and care completed routine study measures and an assessment of COVID-19Crelated experiences. RESULTS: At baseline, most participants demonstrated HIV viremia, markers indicative of renal disorders, and biologically confirmed substance use. At follow-up, in the first month of responding to COVID-19, engaging in more social distancing behaviors was related to difficulty accessing food and medications and increased cancelation of health care appointments, both by self and providers. We observed antiretroviral therapy adherence had improved during the initial month of COVID-19 response. CONCLUSIONS: Factors that may pose added risk for COVID-19 severity were prevalent among people living with HIV, and those with greater risk factors did not practice more COVID-19 protective behaviors. Social distancing and other practices intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 interfered with HIV care, and impeded access to food and medications, although an immediate adverse impact on medication adherence was not evident.

Discussion: We report a case of 28 years old female patient with carcinoma rectum. The patient had near total intestinal obstruction. She was operated on utilizing laparoscopic anterior resection. The air seal (CONMED, Utica, NY) and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter was utilized for safe gas evacuation. There is no evidence against laparoscopic surgery, which suggest viral transmission. One should take utmost precautions using N95 masks and personal protective equipment (PPE). Air filtration products like aerosol, HEPA filters will be of great aid in safe evacuation of gases. Conclusion: At present, there is no solid evidence to suggest viral transmission through surgical smoke. We believe due to effective smoke containment, less blood loss, and less postoperative stay, laparoscopy will be a non-inferior option than open surgical procedure.

A micro-electrode dot array (MEDA) biochip, which is one kind of the miniaturized systems for biochemical protocols such as dispensing, dilutions, mixing, and so on, has become widespread due to enabling dynamical control of the droplets in microfluidic manipulations. In MEDA biochips, the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) technique stands out since it can actuate droplets with nano/picoliter volumes. Microelectrode cells on MEDA actuate multiple droplets simultaneously to route locations for the purpose of the biochemical operations. Taking advantage of the feature, droplets are often routed in parallel to achieve high-throughput outcomes. Regarding parallel manipulation of multiple droplets, however, the droplets are known to be initially placed at a distant position to avoid undesirable mixing. The droplets thus result in traveling a long way for a manipulation, and the required biochip size for routing is also enlarged. This paper proposes a routing method for droplets to reduce the biochip size on a MEDA biochip with the allowance of splitting during routing operations. We mathematically derive the routing problem, and the experiments demonstrate that our proposal can significantly reduce the biochip size by 70.8% on average, compared to the state-of-the-art method.","output":"Minimization of MEDA Biochip-Size in Droplet Routing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article compares the ability of nurses and physicians to connect with patients in ethnoculturally nonconcordant clinical encounters with 41 randomly selected political-asylum seekers (PAS) residing at five Finnish reception centers in summer 2002.

We have analyzed public domain immunoglobulin sequencing data from PBMCs of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals to gain a better understanding of B cell repertoire in patients. Public clonotypes showed increased usage of IGHV3, IGHV4, IGKV1, IGKV3, IGLV3 and IGLV2 family genes during the acute phase infection. Identical CDR3 sequences were identified for heavy (H), kappa (K) and lambda (L) chains across individuals, indicating the convergence of B cell selection during SARS-CoV-2 infection. While the immune repertoire dynamically changed over the course of convalescence, there were persistent clones across early and late timepoints. The diversity of antibody repertoire, measured by Shannon-Weiner diversity index for H and K chains, reduced during the acute phase of infection. In addition, the repertoire diversity was low in severe patients compared to patients with mild or moderate symptoms. Increased usage of IGHV4-59 gene was observed in COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms requiring ventilator support at 2 weeks and 3 weeks post symptom onset. IGHV4-59 is reported to have rheumatoid factor (RF) activity with high affinity for IgG and the elevated level of IGHV4-59 provides a potential mechanism for the increased autoimmune responses in severe patients.

Serological tests are an important method to assist in the diagnosis of COVID-19, used for epidemiological investigations. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of different types of vacuum collection tubes on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies, using the colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay (GICA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 112 patients with COVID-19 and 200 healthy control subjects with no infection were enrolled in this study. Their serum and plasma were collected into four different types of vacuum blood collection tubes. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG specific antibodies in the plasma and serum were then detected by GICA and chemiluminescence assay (CA), respectively. In addition, the particle sizes of different colloidal gold solutions in the presence of different anticoagulants and coagulants were evaluated by both laser diffraction (Malvern) and confocal laser microscope, respectively. RESULTS: Our results revealed that anticoagulated plasma with EDTA-K(2) improved the positive detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies. Furthermore, our results shown that the detection results by GICA and CA were highly consistent, especially, the results of EDTA-K(2) anticoagulated plasma detected by GICA was more consistent with CA results. We confirmed that EDTA-K(2) could improve the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by chelating excessive colloidal gold compared with sodium citrate or lithium heparin, these methodologies did not appear to cause false positives. Colloidal gold particles could be chelated and aggregated by EDTA-K(2), but not by sodium citrate, lithium heparin and coagulants. CONCLUSION: GICA is widely used to detect antibodies for the advantages of convenient, fast, low cost, suitable for screening large sample and require minimal equipment. In this study, we found that EDTA-K(2) amplified the positive antibody signal by chelating colloidal gold and improved the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies when using the GICA.

The overlap of symptoms and multitude of EDS variations makes it difficult for patients to achieve a diagnosis early in the course of their disease. The most common form, hypermobile type EDS (hEDS) and its variant, hypermobile spectrum disorder (HSD), are correlated with rheumatologic and inflammatory conditions. Evidence is still needed to determine the pathophysiology of hEDS; however, the association among these conditions and their prevalence in hEDS/HSD may be explained through consideration of persistent chronic inflammation contributing to a disruption of the connective tissue. Aberrant mast cell activation has been shown to play a role in disruption of connective tissue integrity through activity of its mediators including histamine and tryptase which affects multiple organ systems resulting in mast cell activation disorders (MCAD). The overlap of findings associated with MCAD and the immune-mediated and rheumatologic conditions in patients with hEDS/HSD may provide an explanation for the relationship among these conditions and the presence of chronic inflammatory processes in these patients. It is clear that a multidisciplinary approach is required for the treatment of patients with EDS. However, it is also important for clinicians to consider the summarized symptoms and MCAD-associated characteristics in patients with multiple complaints as possible manifestations of connective tissue disorders, in order to potentially aid in establishing an early diagnosis of EDS.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of individuals undergoing surveillance colonoscopy for personal or family history of colorectal neoplasia was being provided with FIT between colonoscopies. Colonoscopy  6 months after the guideline-recommended interval was considered \\"delayed.\\" Individuals were stratified based on prime colonoscopy findings to nonneoplastic findings, non-advanced adenoma, and advanced adenoma. The relative risk (RR) for developing advanced neoplasia was determined using a robust multivariable modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: Of 2548 surveillance colonoscopies, 1457 (57.18%) were delayed. Prior advanced adenoma, older age (> 60 years) and nonparticipation in interval FIT were associated with increased risk for advanced neoplasia (P < 0.05). There was a trend to increased risk in those with prior advanced adenoma with an increasing colonoscopy delay (P trend = 0.01). In participants who did not complete interval FIT and having advanced adenoma in the prime colonoscopy, risk of advanced neoplasia was 2.48 times higher (RR = 2.48, 95% confidence interval: 1.20-5.13) in participants who had beyond 2 years of delayed colonoscopy compared with those with on-time colonoscopy. Colonoscopy delay did not increase the risk of advanced neoplasia in participants with negative interval FIT results.

We hypothesized that the association and intense utilization of the ER during viral replication would induce the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), a signal transduction cascade that acts to modulate translation, membrane biosynthesis, and the levels of ER chaperones. Here, we report that infection by the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) triggers the proximal UPR transducers, as revealed by monitoring the IRE1-mediated splicing of XBP-1 mRNA and the cleavage of ATF6alpha. However, we detected minimal downstream induction of UPR target genes, including ERdj4, ER degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like protein, and p58(IPK), or expression of UPR reporter constructs. Translation initiation factor eIF2alpha is highly phosphorylated during MHV infection, and translation of cellular mRNAs is attenuated. Furthermore, we found that the critical homeostasis regulator GADD34, which recruits protein phosphatase 1 to dephosphorylate eIF2alpha during the recovery phase of the UPR, is not expressed during MHV infection. These results suggest that MHV modifies the UPR by impeding the induction of UPR-responsive genes, thereby favoring a sustained shutdown of the synthesis of host cell proteins while the translation of viral proteins escalates.

The 5' two-thirds of the genome encodes non-structural proteins that are required for virus replication and synthesis of subgenomic (SG) mRNA for structural proteins. SG-mRNA is generated by internal initiation at the SG-promoter that is located at the complementary minus-strand template. Different types of expression systems including replication-competent vectors, which represent alphavirus genomes with inserted expression units, have been developed. The replication-competent vectors represent useful tools for studying alphaviruses and have potential therapeutic applications. In both cases, the properties of the vector, such as its genetic stability and expression level of the protein of interest, are important. RESULTS: We analysed 14 candidates of replication-competent vectors based on the genome of an SFV4 isolate that contained a duplicated SG promoter or an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-element controlled marker gene. It was found that the IRES elements and the minimal -21 to +5 SG promoter were non-functional in the context of these vectors. The efficient SG promoters contained at least 26 residues upstream of the start site of SG mRNA. The insertion site of the SG promoter and its length affected the genetic stability of the vectors, which was always higher when the SG promoter was inserted downstream of the coding region for structural proteins. The stability also depended on the conditions used for vector propagation. A procedure based on the in vitro transcription of ligation products was used for generation of replication-competent vector-based expression libraries that contained hundreds of thousands of different genomes, and maintained genetic diversity and the ability to express inserted genes over five passages in cell culture. CONCLUSION: The properties of replication-competent vectors of alphaviruses depend on the details of their construction. In the case of SFV4, such vectors should contain the SG promoter with structural characteristics for this isolate.

AIM To determine the risk and determinants of Covid-19 diagnosis in shielded vs. non-shielded groups adjusted for key comorbidities not explained by shielding. DESIGN & SETTING Retrospective cohort study of adults with COVID-19 infection between 1/2/20-15/5/20 in West London. METHOD Individuals diagnosed with Covid-19 were identified in SystmOne records using clinical codes. Infection risks were adjusted for socio-demographic factors, nursing home status and comorbidities. RESULTS Of 57,713 adults, 573 (1%) individuals were identified as shielded and 1,074 adults had documented Covid-19 infections (1.9%). Covid-19 infection rate in the shielded group individuals compared with non-shielded adult individuals was 6.5% (37/573) vs 1.8% (1,037/57, 140), P<0.0001. A multivariable fully adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression identified that Covid-19 infection was increased with aHR (95% CI): shielding status 1.52 (1.00-2.30), P=0.048.

METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were searched from inception to the 14th of October 2020. Records were included if they reported scientific, empirical research (qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods) on the effects of restricting or promoting family integrated care practices for parents of hospitalised neonates during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Two authors independently screened abstracts, appraised study quality and extracted study and outcome data. RESULTS: We retrieved 803 publications and assessed 75 full-text articles. Seven studies were included, reporting data on 854 healthcare professionals, 442 parents, 364 neonates and 26 other family members, within 286 neonatal units globally. The pandemic response resulted in significant changes in neonatal unit policies and restricting parents' access and participation in neonatal care. Breastfeeding, parental bonding, participation in caregiving, parental mental health and staff stress were negatively impacted. CONCLUSION: This review highlights that SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related hospital restrictions had adverse effects on care delivery and outcomes for neonates, families and staff.

Methods Between July 2017 and July 2019, 18 patients with partial ACL injury were admitted. There were 10 males and 8 females, with an average age of 40.5 years (range, 22-57 years). There were 5 cases on the left knee and 13 cases on the right knee. Forteen cases had a clear history of trauma or sports injury, and 4 cases had no obvious cause. The time from injury to operation was 1-6 months (median, 3 months). Partial ligament was sutured using WALANT technique under arthroscopy. The operation time, total hospital stay, and postoperative hospital stay were recorded. Lachman test and anterior drawer test were performed to evaluate the knee joint stability after treatment, and Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores were used to evaluate the knee function. Five-point Likert scaling were used to evaluate postoperative patient satisfaction. Results The operation time was 30-100 minutes (mean, 64.2 minutes). The total hospital stay was 2-12 days (mean, 4.5 days). Postoperative hospital stay was 1-4 days (mean, 1.8 days). All incisions healed by first intention after operation, and no surgery-related complications occurred. All patients were followed up 12-36 months (mean, 19.1 months). Lachman test and anterior drawer test were negative after operation. Lysholm score and IKDC score at 6 and 12 months after operation were significantly higher than those before operation, and at 12 months after operation were higher than those at 6 months after operation, the differences were significant ( P<0.05). At last follow-up, according to five-point Likert scaling of patient satisfaction, 7 cases were very satisfied, 10 cases were relatively satisfied, and 1 case was general. The total patient satisfaction rate was 94.4% (17/18). MRI scan showed the good ligament tension.

Previous studies have shown a correlation between low renal tissue oxygenation (RrSO2) in the first 24 hours of age and the later development of AKI. In this prospective clinical trial, NIRS monitoring was used to identify changes in RrSO2 in comparison to traditional AKI markers, serum creatinine (SCr), and urine output (UOP). METHODS We enrolled 35 preterm neonates born less than 32 weeks' gestation and applied neonatal NIRS sensors at less than 48 hours of age. Neonates underwent 7 days of continuous monitoring. Renal and demographic information were collected for the first 7 days of age. AKI was determined by the modified neonatal Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition including UOP. RESULTS Three patients experienced AKI, all based on both SCr and UOP criteria. Each neonate with AKI had decreases in RrSO2 over 48 hours prior to changes in SCr and UOP. Patients with AKI had lower median RrSO2 values compared to patients without AKI over the first week of age, (32.4% vs. 60%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION RrSO2 monitoring identified preterm neonates at risk for AKI. NIRS detected a decline in RrSO2 prior to changes in SCr and UOP and was significantly lower in patients with AKI compared to those without AKI. Further studies are needed to evaluate the ability of RrSO2 monitoring to detect signs of kidney stress prior to the diagnosis of AKI.

Mass vaccination, until herd immunity is achieved, is one of the most effective ways of combating the deadly infectious virus. The disposition of health workers towards the AstraZeneca vaccine will most likely determine if other members of the community will be willing to get vaccinated or not. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the attitudes of healthcare workers to the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as determine the various side effects experienced by those who have already been vaccinated. Method: Frequency tables were created, and Chi-square was used to determine the relationship between respondents' socio-demographic characteristics, as well as their acceptance or rejection of the COVID-19 vaccine and attitude towards it. Using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 22.0, multinominal logistic regression was used to determine the key factors which influenced respondents decision to have the vaccine. Result: There was a statistically significant relationship between the cadre of health care workers, their tribe, and their involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients and their attitude towards the vaccine. Conclusion: Previous involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients is one of the most important determinants of health care workers' acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. Most respondents were positive about the vaccine;however, the fear of side effects was the primary reason why those who were yet to be vaccinated, do not plan to do so. The most common side effect reported by those who had already been vaccinated, was pain at the injection site.

The samples of surface water, groundwater, and sediment were collected from Zaohe-Weihe Rivers of Xi'an City, which is a representative city with characteristics of the northwest region of China. Of 271 ARGs associated with 9 antibiotics, 228 ARGs were detected, with a total detection rate of 84%. Sulfonamide and aminoglycoside ARGs were the dominant types of ARGs. The top 6 ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in terms of abundance were tnpA-04, cepA, sul1, aadA2-03, sul2 and intI1. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the distribution characteristics of ARGs were not associated with the sampling sites but with the environmental medias. Similarity in the water phases and significant differences in the water and sediment phases were found. The redundancy analysis (RDA) identified the key factors controlling ARG pollution, including dissolved oxygen (DO) in surface water, total nitrogen (TN) in groundwater, and total organic carbon (TOC) in sediment. In terms of the speciation of heavy metals, we further revealed the promotion effect between ARGs and heavy metals, especially the residual fraction of Ni. In terms of horizontal transfer mechanism, ARGs were significantly correlated with tnpA-03 in water phase and tnpA-04 in sediment. In the three media, intI1 and ARGs all show a significant correlation.

Data of 282 cows from 9 dairy herds in Qubec, Canada, with bulk tank SCC < 250,000 cells/mL were used. Estimated median herd-prevalence of infections that should be treated was 16.2 % (95 % credibility interval (CI): 11.0-22.7).

Anastomotic leakage, normally due to failed healing, is the most feared complication in digestive surgery because it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Despite technical and technological advances and focused research, its rates have remained almost unchanged the last decades. In the last two decades, stem cells (SCs) have been shown to enhance healing in animal and human studies; hence, SCs have emerged since 2008 as an alternative to improve anastomoses outcomes. AIM To summarise the published knowledge of SC utilisation as a preventative tool for hollow digestive viscera anastomotic or suture leaks. METHODS PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Cochrane searches were performed using the key words \\"anastomosis\\", \\"colorectal/colonic anastomoses\\", \\"anastomotic leak\\", \\"stem cells\\", \\"progenitor cells\\", \\"cellular therapy\\" and \\"cell therapy\\" in order to identify relevant articles published in English and Spanish during the years of 2000 to 2021. Studies employing SCs, performing digestive anastomoses in hollow viscera or digestive perforation sutures and monitoring healing were finally included. Reference lists from the selected articles were reviewed to identify additional pertinent articles.Given the great variability in the study designs, anastomotic models, interventions (SCs, doses and vehicles) and outcome measures, performing a reliable meta-analysis was considered impossible, so we present the studies, their results and limitations. RESULTS Eighteen preclinical studies and three review papers were identified; no clinical studies have been published and there are no registered clinical trials. Experimental studies, mainly in rat and porcine models and occasionally in very adverse conditions such as ischaemia or colitis, have been demonstrated SCs as safe and have shown some encouraging morphological, functional and even clinical results. Mesenchymal SCs are mostly employed, and delivery routes are mainly local injections and cell sheets followed by biosutures (sutures coated by SCs) or purely topical. As potential weaknesses, animal models need to be improved to make them more comparable and equivalent to clinical practice, and the SC isolation processes need to be standardised. There is notable heterogeneity in the studies, making them difficult to compare. Further investigations are needed to establish the indications, the administration system, potential adjuvants, the final efficacy and to confirm safety and exclude definitively oncological concerns.

A consequence of bringing together, for the first time, a unified view of MCT(?) mode-of-action from multiple experiments and adjuvant systems will help facilitate future rational design of vaccines while shaping their success.","output":"Shaping Modern Vaccines: Adjuvant Systems Using MicroCrystalline Tyrosine (MCT(?))"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a severe and potentially life-threatening disease manifestation In addition to autoimmune diseases such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis and anti-glomerular basement membrane syndrome, pulmonary viral infections are known to be culprits of DAH Health-care providers worldwide in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic have been confronted with an unprecedented number of viral lung infections, with great variance in symptoms and severity Hemoptysis, the key symptom of DAH, is a rare complication We present two cases of immunocompromised patients with rapidly developing hypoxemic respiratory failure and evidence of DAH in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of CHEST is the property of American College of Chest Physicians and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Two Immunocompromised Patients With Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage as a Complication of Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the first epidemic of the 21st century, has an outbreak history of more than 2 years till today and caused tremendous damage to the human society. Accordingly, many studies on modeling the SARS epidemic have been reported, whereas deficiencies were still lying in those models because of their separate space/time methodology. In this paper, we propose novel comprehensive stochastic spatio-temporal models from both of the macro aspect and individual aspect for characterizing transmission and control of the SARS disease. Based on a new SARS spread process in consideration of \\"suspicious\\" population, we firstly establish the stochastic temporal models from two different aspects: the macro model is described with birth-death process and the individual Markov model is described with probability transition matrix (PTM). And then, we amalgamate the deterministic/stochastic population-flow model with the stochastic temporal models together to set up the comprehensive stochastic spatio-temporal models. Simulations on computer have evaluated the effect of various realistic parameters and control policies, and also have testified the accuracy and efficacy of the new models. Additionally, particular studies on the cases of Tsinghua University and Beijing City are presented. The comprehensive stochastic spatio-temporal models have considerably reduced the complexity plus errors as compared with previous works and will be able to characterize other various epidemics, e.g. Avian Flu.","output":"Characterizing Transmission and Control of the SARS Epidemic: Novel Stochastic Spatio-Temporal Models."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Personalized Therapeutic Concepts in Chronic Coronary Syndromes Abstract.

According to the definition, Huber loss function performs as quadratic for small errors and linear for others and shows better performance in comparison to Gaussian loss hence it restrains easily for a different type of noises and outliers. Recently, TSVR with Huber loss (HN-TSVR) has been suggested to handle the noise and outliers. Like TSVR, it is also having the singularity problem which degrades the performance of the model. In this paper, regularized version of HN-TSVR is proposed as regularization based twin support vector regression (RHN-TSVR) to avoid the singularity problem of HN-TSVR by applying the structured risk minimization principle that leads to our model convex and well-posed. This proposed RHN-TSVR model is well capable to handle the noise as well as outliers and avoids the singularity issue. To show the validity and applicability of proposed RHN-TSVR, various experiments perform on several artificial generated datasets having uniform, Gaussian and Laplacian noise as well as on benchmark different real-world datasets and compare with support vector regression, TSVR, [Formula: see text] -asymmetric Huber SVR, [Formula: see text] -support vector quantile regression and HN-TSVR. Here, all benchmark real-world datasets are embedded with a different significant level of noise 0%, 5% and 10% on different reported algorithms with the proposed approach.

Despite their shared receptor, different Type I Interferons have different functions during immune response to infection. In particular, they differ in the potency of their induced anti-viral and anti-proliferative responses in target cells. It remains not fully understood how these functional differences can arise in a ligand-specific manner both at the level of STAT phosphorylation and the downstream function. We use a minimal computational model of Type I Interferon signaling, focusing on Interferon- and Interferon-. We validate the model with quantitative experimental data to identify the key determinants of specificity and functional plasticity in Type I Interferon signaling. We investigate different mechanisms of signal discrimination, and how multiple system components such as binding affinity, receptor expression levels and their variability, receptor internalization, short-term negative feedback by SOCS1 protein, and differential receptor expression play together to ensure ligand specificity on the level of STAT phosphorylation. Based on these results, we propose phenomenological functional mappings from STAT activation to downstream anti-viral and anti-proliferative activity to investigate differential signal processing steps downstream of STAT phosphorylation. We find that the negative feedback by the protein USP18, which enhances differences in signaling between Interferons via ligand-dependent refractoriness, can give rise to functional plasticity in Interferon- and Interferon- signaling, and explore other factors that control functional plasticity. Beyond Type I Interferon signaling, our results have a broad applicability to questions of signaling specificity and functional plasticity in signaling systems with multiple ligands acting through a bottleneck of a small number of shared receptors.","output":"Determinants of Ligand Specificity and Functional Plasticity in Type I Interferon Signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Pregnant women are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 but have been excluded from the phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trials. Data on vaccine safety and immunogenicity in these populations are therefore limited. Objective: To evaluate the immunogenicity of COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines in pregnant and lactating women, including against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Design, Setting, and Participants: An exploratory, descriptive, prospective cohort study enrolled 103 women who received a COVID-19 vaccine from December 2020 through March 2021 and 28 women who had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from April 2020 through March 2021 (the last follow-up date was March 26, 2021). This study enrolled 30 pregnant, 16 lactating, and 57 neither pregnant nor lactating women who received either the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccines and 22 pregnant and 6 nonpregnant unvaccinated women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain binding, neutralizing, and functional nonneutralizing antibody responses from pregnant, lactating, and nonpregnant women were assessed following vaccination. Spike-specific T-cell responses were evaluated using IFN-?3 enzyme-linked immunospot and multiparameter intracellular cytokine-staining assays. Humoral and cellular immune responses were determined against the original SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain as well as against the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. Results: This study enrolled 103 women aged 18 to 45 years (66% non-Hispanic White) who received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. After the second vaccine dose, fever was reported in 4 pregnant women (14%; SD, 6%), 7 lactating women (44%; SD, 12%), and 27 nonpregnant women (52%; SD, 7%). Binding, neutralizing, and functional nonneutralizing antibody responses as well as CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses were present in pregnant, lactating, and nonpregnant women following vaccination. Binding and neutralizing antibodies were also observed in infant cord blood and breast milk. Binding and neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern were reduced, but T-cell responses were preserved against viral variants. Conclusion and Relevance: In this exploratory analysis of a convenience sample, receipt of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was immunogenic in pregnant women, and vaccine-elicited antibodies were transported to infant cord blood and breast milk. Pregnant and nonpregnant women who were vaccinated developed cross-reactive antibody responses and T-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.","output":"Immunogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines in Pregnant and Lactating Women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A highly neurovirulent mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) JHMV strain (wt) with receptor (MHVR)-independent infection activity and its low-virulent mutant srr7 without such activity were found to attach to MHVR-negative, non-permissive BHK cells.

The present study indicates that HS interacts with both wt JHMV and srr7 but it does not function as an entry receptor as it apparently does for MHV-rec1. Furthermore, HS failed to serve as an entry receptor in the MHVR-independent infection of wt JHMV, indicating that HS is not a host factor that wt JHMV utilizes in an MHVR-independent infection.","output":"Heparan sulfate is a binding molecule but not a receptor for CEACAM1-independent infection of murine coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The mechanical properties of the cornea are complex and regionally variable. This paper uses an original method to investigate the biomechanics of the cornea in response to hydrostatic loading over the typical physiological range of intra-ocular pressure (IOP) fluctuations thereby increasing understanding of clinically relevant corneal biomechanical properties and their contributions to the refractive properties of the cornea. Methods: Displacement speckle pattern interferometry (DSPI) was used to measure the total surface displacement of 40 porcine and 6 human corneal-scleral specimens in response to pressure variations up to 1 mmHg from a baseline of 16.5 mmHg. All specimens were mounted in a modified artificial anterior chamber (AAC) and loaded hydrostatically. Areas of high strain in response to loading were identified by comparing the displacements across different regions. Results: The nature of the response of the corneal surface to loading demonstrated high regional topographic variation. Mechanical properties were shown to be asymmetrical, and deformation of the limbal and pre-limbal regions dominated these responses respectively with over 90% (N-T) and 60% (S-I) of the total maximum displacement occurring in these regions indicating high-strain. In contrast, the curvature of the central cornea remained relatively unchanged merely translating in position. Conclusions: The limbal and pre-limbal regions of the cornea appear to be fundamental to the absorption of small pressure fluctuations facilitating the curvature of the central cornea to remain relatively unchanged. The differential mechanical properties of this region could have important implications for the application of corneal surgery and corneal crosslinking, warranting further investigation.","output":"An interferometric ex vivo study of corneal biomechanics under physiologically representative loading, highlighting the role of the limbus in pressure compensation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alternatives to conventional meat are considered an increasingly important tool in the drive to reduce consumption of animal products for environmental, public health and ethical reasons. We present two waves of a cross-sectional survey from a nationally representative sample in Belgium in 2019 (n=1,001) and 2020 (n=1,000). Participants answered questions online about their diets, attitudes towards existing plant-based meat alternatives, and attitudes towards cultured meat (grown from animal cells). We find that the proportion of Belgian consumers who said existing plant-based meat alternatives met their needs increased significantly from 44% in 2019 to 51% in 2020. We also find a significant increase in concern for issues related to animal agriculture, in particular the environment. We found no significant change in attitudes towards cultured meat between the two waves; in both 2019 and 2020, 39.3% of Belgian consumers said they would buy cultured meat. Regression analyses revealed that plant-based alternatives were more appealing to women and those with vegetarian diets, whilst cultured meat was more appealing to men. Overall, just 11.2% of consumers are both unsatisfied with existing meat alternatives and unwilling to buy cultured meat, while 43.2% of respondents were positive towards either plant-based or cultured meat, but not both, highlighting the need for a variety of alternative proteins in the market. Both cultured meat and plant-based meat were more appealing to younger consumers and those in the northern, predominantly Dutch-speaking region of Flanders.

Even among medical students, there is a lack of eHealth literacy (eHL) skills to solve medical problems. The Italian Medical Doctors Federation (FNOMCeO) promoted a Web source as a first-aid communication kit for basic notions in health hot-topics named dottoremaeveroche (DMVEC). This study aims to evaluate its effectiveness in improving eHL. METHODS: Between April and November 2019, medical students from the University of Firenze (Italy) joined a cross-sectional web-based survey before and after accessing the DMVEC Web source. The 8-item self-assessment tool (IT-eHEALS) was used to examine subject's eHL, in addition to questions on source's features and its quality. All responses were rated on a 5-points Likert scale. Changing of abilities' perception was assessed using Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: A total of 329 joined the survey, 42% male, mean age of 20.62.1. Participants felt moderately confident in eHL, in fact the initial eHEALS overall mean score was 3.6 0.7. Students had a good perception on how to find helpful health resources (mean score 3.90.8) and how to use the Internet to answer health questions (mean score 3.80.9), but their ability in using this information to make health decisions was low (mean score 2.91.1). All items improved after the use of DMVEC, with overall mean score of IT-eHEALS increasing to 4.30.6 (p < 0.0001). Regarding source's quality, mean score related to transparency of sources, an aspect underestimated at first, increased from 3.51.2 to 4.70.7 (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of eHL can damage public health efforts, as seen during COVID19 pandemic. DMVEC effectiveness in medical students demonstrated that the scaling up to the general population of online educational interventions, with further implementation, could help in tackling infodemic and fake news spreading. KEY MESSAGES: Moderate levels of eHL among medical students could reflect lower levels in general population, highlighting this as critical issue in public health.

However, to the best of our knowledge, the role of RUT in acute lung injury (ALI) and the specific molecular mechanism remain unknown. In the present study, an in vitro model of ALI was established in BEAS-2B cells by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. Cell viability following RUT treatment with or without LPS stimulation was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The inflammatory response and oxidative stress were detected using ELISA kits and commercially available kits, respectively. TUNEL assay and western blotting were performed to assess cell apoptosis. The expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related proteins and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) signaling pathway-related proteins were measured by western blotting. The results revealed that RUT markedly improved cell viability after LPS treatment in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, RUT inhibited the LPS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress in BEAS-2B cells, and suppressed the LPS-induced apoptosis of BEAS-2B cells. Mechanistically, RUT alleviated ER stress by inhibiting the production of CHOP, glucose-regulated protein-78, caspase-12 and activating transcription factor 6. Additionally, western blotting demonstrated that RUT activated the phosphorylation of AMPK and SIRT1, which indicated the involvement of the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway in the protective effect of RUT against LPS-induced lung injury. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that RUT mitigated LPS-induced lung cell injury by inhibiting ER stress via the activation of the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway.","output":"Rutaecarpine ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced BEAS-2B cell injury through inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress via activation of the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a respiratory disorder with a poor prognosis. Our objective is to assess the comparative effectiveness of 22 approved or studied IPF drug treatments. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to 2 April 2021. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for adult patients with IPF receiving one or more of 22 drug treatments. Pairs of reviewers independently identified randomised trials that compared one or more of the target medical treatments in patients with IPF. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for network meta-analysis. We calculated pooled relative risk (RR) ratios and presented direct or network estimates with 95% credibility intervals (95% CI), within the GRADE framework. RESULTS We identified 48 (10 326 patients) eligible studies for analysis. Nintedanib [RR 0.69 (0.44 to 1.1), pirfenidone [RR 0.63 (0.37 to 1.09); direct estimate), and sildenafil [RR (0.44 (0.16 to 1.09)] probably reduce mortality (all moderate certainty). Nintedanib (2.92% (1.51 to 4.14)), nintedanib+sildenafil (157 mL (-88.35 to 411.12)), pirfenidone (2.47% (-0.1 to 5)), pamrevlumab (4.3% (0.5 to 8.1)) and pentraxin (2.74% (1 to 4.83)) probably reduce decline of overall forced vital capacity (all moderate certainty). Only sildenafil probably reduces acute exacerbation and hospitalisations (moderate certainty). Corticosteroids+azathioprine+N-acetylcysteine increased risk of serious adverse events versus placebo (high certainty). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Future guidelines should consider sildenafil for IPF and further research needs to be done on promising IPF treatments such as pamrevlumab and pentraxin as phase 3 trials are completed.","output":"Medical treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Arterial hypertension has a direct association with endothelial dysfunction and major cardiovascular events. There is evidence showing the benefits of aerobic exercise on flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in hypertensive individuals but little is known about the effect of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activation on FMD of the brachial artery in response to different types of exercise in this specific population. This study aims to examine the effects of ANS activation on FMD of the brachial artery in response to exercise in hypertensive individuals following a session of different types of exercise including aerobic exercise (AE), resistance exercise (RE), or combined exercise (CE). METHODS: Thirty-nine hypertensive volunteers aged 35 to 55 years will be randomly assigned to two exercise sessions: AE (40 min on a cycle ergometer at 60% of HR reserve), RE (4 lower limb sets with 12 repetitions at 60% 1-RM for 40 min), or CE (RE for 20 min + AE for 20 min). Each exercise group will be randomized to receive either an 1-adrenergic blocker (doxazosin 0.05 mg/kg(?1)) or placebo. Ultrasound measurement of FMD is performed 10 min before and 10, 40, and 70 min after exercise. ANS activation is monitored using a Finometer and measurements are taken during 10 min before each FMD assessment. Arterial stiffness is assessed by pulse wave velocity (PWV) analysis using a Complior device. DISCUSSION: We expect to demonstrate the effect of ANS activation on FMD of the brachial artery in hypertensive individuals in response to different types of exercise. This study may give some insight on how to improve exercise prescription for hypertension management. TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov and ID \\"NCT04371757\\".

Cross-neutralizing activity against major variants of concern (B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.351) has been observed following vaccination, albeit at a reduced potency, but whether vaccines based on the Spike glycoprotein of these viral variants will produce a superior cross-neutralizing antibody response has not been fully investigated. Here, we used sera from individuals infected in wave 1 in the UK to study the long-term cross-neutralization up to 10 months post onset of symptoms (POS), as well as sera from individuals infected with the B.1.1.7 variant to compare cross-neutralizing activity profiles. We show that neutralizing antibodies with cross-neutralizing activity can be detected from wave 1 up to 10 months POS. Although neutralization of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 is lower, the difference in neutralization potency decreases at later timepoints suggesting continued antibody maturation and improved tolerance to Spike mutations. Interestingly, we found that B.1.1.7 infection also generates a cross-neutralizing antibody response, which, although still less potent against B.1.351, can neutralize parental wave 1 virus to a similar degree as B.1.1.7.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to (1) investigate how COVID-19 restrictions influence daily activities, (2) track the psychosocial effects of these restrictions over time, and (3) identify strategies to mitigate the potential negative effects of these restrictions. METHODS: This is a longitudinal, concurrent, mixed methods study being conducted in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Data collection occurred at four time points, between April 2020 and February 2021. The first three data collection time points occurred within phases 1 to 3 of the Province of BCs Restart Plan. The final data collection coincided with the initial distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines. At each time point, data regarding participants sociodemographics, depressive and anxiety symptoms, resilience, boredom, social support, instrumental activities of daily living, and social media and technology use were collected in an online survey. These data supplemented qualitative videoconference interviews exploring participants COVID-19Crelated experiences. Participants were also asked to upload photos representing their experience during the restriction period, which facilitated discussion during the final interview. Five groups of participants were recruited: (1) families with children under the age of 18 years, (2) adults with an SCI, (3) adults who experienced a stroke, (4) adults with other types of disabilities, and (5) older adults (>64 years of age) with no self-reported disability.

This process is orchestrated by valosin-containing protein (VCP), an AAA+ ATPase that extracts polyubiquinated chromatin proteins and facilitates their turnover. However, because of the essential and pleiotropic effects of VCP in global proteostasis, it remains challenging practically to understand and target its DDR-specific functions. We describe a DNA-damage-induced phosphorylation event (Ser784), which selectively enhances chromatin-associated protein degradation mediated by VCP and is required for DNA repair, signaling, and cell survival. These functional effects of Ser784 phosphorylation on DDR correlate with a decrease in VCP association with chromatin, cofactors NPL4/UFD1, and polyubiquitinated substrates. Clinically, high phospho-Ser784-VCP levels are significantly associated with poor outcome among chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients. Thus, Ser784 phosphorylation is a DDR-specific enhancer of VCP function and a potential predictive biomarker for chemotherapy treatments.","output":"Phospho-Ser784-VCP Is Required for DNA Damage Response and Is Associated with Poor Prognosis of Chemotherapy-Treated Breast Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multiorgan injury has been implicated in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Baseline data at the Atlanta VA hepatology clinics demonstrated 75% of veterans with cirrhosis were immune to HAV and 44% to HBV. One fourth of visits failed to address hepatitis vaccines, and 60% of missed opportunities were from providers not discussing it. Our aim was to reduce missed opportunities to initiate HAV and HBV vaccination to <and to confirm immunity with serologies to < over 6 months in the Atlanta VA hepatology clinics. Methods: A process map identifying steps to obtain a vaccine and Pareto charts quantifying rates of commonly identified barriers were used to implement Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. Approximately every 10th chart was sampled, and P charts were created to assess the average missed opportunity rate before and after our QI initiatives. Results: PDSA 1 focused on educating providers on the importance of vaccination, sharing the baseline data, and instructing how to order vaccines. For PDSA 2, the liver pharmacist monitored the vaccine queue daily to ensure that orders remained active. PDSA 3 involved a quality inspection by the attending hepatologist, who alerted the provider if vaccination was not addressed but was warranted. The last PDSA included creating a Liver Passport for the veteran that had personalized vaccination, hepatocellular screening, and esophageal variceal screening recommendations. The overall average missed opportunities for HAV & HBV vaccination and serologic confirmation testing decreased from 41% to 29% after four PDSA cycles. Separately, mean missed opportunities for initiating HAV & HBV vaccination decreased from 25% to 19% and assessing immunity with HAV & HBV serologies declined from 16% to 10%.Conclusion: Lack of in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic was a significant study limitation early on.

People were bombarded with a wide set of public health visualizations ranging from simple graphs to complex interactive dashboards. In a pandemic setting, where large amounts of the world population are socially distancing themselves, it becomes an urgent need to refine existing user experience evaluation methods for remote settings to understand how people make sense out of COVID-19 related visualizations. When evaluating visualizations aimed towards the general public with vastly different socio-demographic backgrounds and varying levels of technical savviness and data literacy, it is important to understand user feedback beyond aspects such as speed, task accuracy, or usability problems. As a part of this wider evaluation perspective, micro-phenomenology has been used to evaluate static and narrative visualizations to reveal the lived experience in a detailed way. Building upon these studies, we conducted a user study to understand how to employ Elicitation (aka Micro-phenomenological) interviews in remote settings. In a case study, we investigated what experiences the participants had with map-based interactive visualizations. Our findings reveal positive and negative aspects of conducting Elicitation interviews remotely. Our results can inform the process of planning and executing remote Elicitation interviews to evaluate interactive visualizations. In addition, we share recommendations regarding visualization techniques and interaction design about public health data.","output":"Understanding User Experience of COVID-19 Maps through Remote Elicitation Interviews"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and purpose Griffith University's accelerated two-year pre-medicine bachelor's degree that articulates into the four-year graduate Doctor of Medicine (MD) program, enrols 75 - 100 high-school students who rank &gt; 99.5%. Their outstanding academic credentials notwithstanding, a quarter of this cohort has historically struggled to adapt to the PBL-focused MD curriculum with a deficiency of contextual learning, over reliance on superficial learning strategies, inexperience in problem-solving and lack of teamwork skills identified as contributing factors. This underpinned the rationale for the design and development of a capstone course Integrative Medical Sciences in 2016, to address these concerns and facilitate pre-medicine students? transition to open-enquiry PBL in medical school. This study evaluated the impact of the capstone experience, including when it was delivered online due to Covid-19, in facilitating this transition. Methods Utilizing case-based learning (CBL), this capstone employs clinical cases focused on pharmacology as the ?linking discipline? to integrate and apply knowledge acquired through courses in anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and pathophysiology to understand the concepts of fundamental sciences that underpin disease. After four iterations of the capstone having been taught in small-group face-to-face settings, Covid-19 forced the abrupt transition to online delivery of live lectures, small-group CBL sessions, case-wrap sessions and assessments. Student evaluations of the course (SEC) were conducted at the end of the capstone, and longitudinal surveys of first- and second-year medical students assessed the impact of the capstone experience on their transition from pre-medicine to the MD program. Results SEC data for the past five years (50%-66% response rate) showed that the pharmacology-focussed capstone was extraordinarily effective;with a mean overall satisfaction score of 4.80/5.00  0.09. The overall effectiveness of the transition to online delivery in 2020 was scored by students as outstanding (74.4%), good (19.2%) or satisfactory (6.4%) (n = 78;100% response rate), with individual ratings being outstanding or good for online lectures (98.8%), CBL (93.6%), Case-wrap sessions (96.2%) and assessments (98.7%) (Figure 1). Most students (82%) encountered no problems with online learning, while 10% encountered some technical difficulties. Students perceptions of the effectiveness of the capstone delivered online or face-to-face (in 2018 and 2019) revealed both approaches to be equally effective (Figure 2). Additionally, first-year medical students rated the overall impact of the pre-medicine capstone on their transition to PBL in the MD program as significantly positive (96%) or somewhat positive (4%) (n = 51;64% response rate);whereas second-year medical students rated this as significantly positive (96%), somewhat positive (2%) or negligible (2%)(n = 43;63% response rate). Conclusions A pharmacology-focussed capstone course delivered utilizing small-group CBL in the pre-medicine degree was perceived by students to be very helpful in transitioning to open-enquiry PBL in graduate medical school.

This study investigated attrition in a prospective cohort comprised of medical graduates in China. We described status of attrition, identified participants with higher possibility of attrition, and examined if attrition affect the estimation of the key outcome measures. METHODS: The cohort study recruited 3,620 new medical graduates from four medical universities in central and western China between 2015 and 2019. Online follow-up surveys were conducted on an annual basis. Follow-up status was defined as complete (meaning that the participant completed all the follow-up surveys) and incomplete, while incomplete follow-up was further divided into always-out, rejoin and other. Multivariable logistic and linear regressions were used to examine factors predicting attrition and the influence on the outcome measures of career development. RESULTS: 2364 (65.3%) participants completed all follow-up surveys. For those with incomplete follow-up, 520 (14.4%) were always-out, 276 (7.6%) rejoined in the 2020 survey. Willingness to participate in residency training (OR=0.80, 95%CI[0.66 - 0.98]) and willingness to provide sensitive information in the baseline survey predicted a lower rate of attrition (providing scores for university entrance exam OR=0.82, 95%CI[0.69 - 0.97]]; providing contact information (OR=0.46, 95%CI[0.32 - 0.66]); providing household income (OR=0.60, 95%CI[0.43 - 0.84]). Participants with compulsory rural service (OR=1.52, 95%CI[1.05 - 2.19]) and those providing university entrance scores (OR=1.64, 95%CI[1.15-2.33)) were more likely to rejoin in the follow-up survey. These factors associated with follow-up status did not have significant impact on key outcome measures of career development. CONCLUSIONS: Graduates who were unwilling to participate in residency training or not providing sensitive information should be targeted early in the cohort study to reduce attrition. More information about the study should be provided to those graduates early to facilitate their understanding of the meaning in participation. On the contrary, medical graduates with compulsory rural service and those who provided university entrance scores were more likely to rejoin in the cohort. The research team should invest more effort in contacting those graduates and returned them to the cohort.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether physician prescribing and orders differ between telemedicine and office visits, whether physicians conducting telemedicine visits are more likely to require in-person follow-up, and whether telemedicine visits are associated with more health events. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included all patients who scheduled primary care appointments through the patient portal of a large integrated health care delivery system newly implementing patient-scheduled video telemedicine visits from January 2016 to May 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adjusted rates of any medication prescribed or laboratory tests or imaging ordered and rates of follow-up health care utilization (in-person visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations) within 7 days after the index visit, stratified by index primary care visit type, were generated using multivariable adjustment for patient, access, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: This study included 1 131 722 patients (611 821 [54%] female; mean [SD] age, 43 [22] years) with 2 178 440 total appointments (307 888 [14%] telemedicine), of which 13.5% were for patients younger than 18 years, 22.2% were for patients 65 years or older, and 54.9% were for female patients. After adjustment, 38.6% (95% CI, 38.0%-39.3%) of video visits, 34.7% (95% CI, 34.5%-34.9%) of telephone visits, and 51.9% (95% CI, 51.8%-52.0%) of office visits had any medication prescribed; laboratory tests or imaging were ordered for 29.2% (95% CI, 28.5%-29.8%) of video visits, 27.3% (95% CI, 27.1%-27.5%) of telephone visits, and 59.3% (95% CI, 59.3%-59.4%) of clinic visits. After adjustment, follow-up visits within 7 days occurred after 25.4% (95% CI, 24.7%-26.0%) of video visits, 26.0% (95% CI, 25.9%-26.2%) of telephone visits, and 24.5% (95% CI, 24.5%-24.6%) of office visits.

However, literature reported trends of COVID-19 differ, depending on the presence of clinical features upon presentation. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to assess differences in risk factors, management, complications, and pregnancy and perinatal outcomes in symptomatic vs. asymptomatic pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A search was run on electronic databases to identify studies reporting COVID-19 in pregnancy. Meta-analysis was performed and odds ratios and mean difference with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Review Manager 5.4. Review Prospero registration number CRD42020204662. RESULTS: We included ten articles reporting data from 3158 pregnancies; with 1900 symptomatic and 1258 asymptomatic pregnant women. There was no significant difference in the mean age, gestational age, and body mass index between the two groups. The meta-analysis suggested that pregnant women who were obese (OR:1.37;95%CI:1.15 to 1.62), hypertensive (OR:2.07;95%CI:1.38 to 3.10) or had a respiratory disorder (OR:1.64;95%CI:1.25 to 2.16), were more likely to be symptomatic when infected with SARS-CoV-2. Pregnant women with Black (OR:1.48;95%CI:1.19 to 1.85) or Asian (OR:1.64;95%CI:1.23 to 2.18) ethnicity were more likely to be symptomatic while those with White ethnicity (OR:0.63;95%CI:0.52 to 0.76) were more likely to be asymptomatic. Cesarean-section delivery (OR:1.40;95%CI:1.17 to 1.67) was more likely amongst symptomatic pregnant women. The mean birthweight(g) (MD:240.51;95%CI:188.42 to 293.51), was significantly lower, while the odds of low birthweight (OR:1.85;95%CI:1.06 to 3.24) and preterm birth (< 37 weeks) (OR:2.10;95%CI:1.04 to 4.23) was higher amongst symptomatic pregnant women. Symptomatic pregnant women had a greater requirement for maternal ICU admission (OR:13.25;95%CI:5.60 to 31.34) and mechanical ventilation (OR:15.56;95%CI:2.96 to 81.70) while their neonates had a higher likelihood for Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission (OR:1.96;95%CI:1.59 to 2.43). The management strategies in the included studies were poorly discussed, hence could not be analyzed. CONCLUSION: The evidence suggests that the presence of risk factors (co-morbidities and ethnicity) increased the likelihood of pregnant women being symptomatic. Higher odds of complications were also observed amongst symptomatic pregnant women.

Our study builds a mediation model for tourism-based economic resilience of rural destinations in relation to the accessibility towards urban areas. The results suggest that the accessibility towards the larger cities does not have a measurable effect upon the tourism-induced resilience. However, when the accessibility index took into consideration the medium cities and towns, a clear, distinguishable, effect was observed but only for time-distances up to 76 min. Therefore, we were able to map all rural areas that could benefit in a recovery period from their proximity from a city. The study increases our understanding of cone-like relationship model in tourism studies and completed previous approaches which established a relation between tourism growth and economic growth.

METHODS One hundred thirty-three cases of SARS admitted from May to June 2003 in our hospital were included in the study. Maximal dose, average daily dose, treatment course and fasting plasma glucose level (FPG) were recorded. Corticosteroid-induced diabetes was diagnosed if FPG was equal to or higher than 7 mmol/L twice or more after the administration of glucocorticoids. RESULTS Ninety five patients (71.9%) were prescribed with glucocorticoid among the 132 patients. Thirty-three patients (36.3%) were diagnosed as corticosteroid-induced diabetes according to the FPG. Significant differences were found in daily maximal dosage, duration of treatment and average dosage of methylprednisolone between the patients with and without corticosteroid-induced diabetes (275 mg/d vs 136 mg/d, 24 d vs 16 d, 139 mg/d vs 91 mg/d, P < 0.01). As compared with the lowest tertile, the frequency of diabetes in SARS patients treated with highest tertile of maximal daily dosage, treatment duration, average dosage or total dosage were significantly higher (64.7% vs 13.0, 61.9% vs 17.4%, 62.5% vs 21.7%, and 59.2% vs 13.6%, P < 0.05 for all comparisons). If the patients were treated with an average dose less than 90 mg/d and treatment duration shorter than 15 days, the diabetes incidence was 10.5%. After adjusting age and sex, the daily maximal dosage of methylprednisolone was the only factor that might predict the occurrence of diabetes.

CONCLUSION The measurement developed by Reel et al. has both its intra- and inter-rater reliability established to be high. However, the findings of this review were unable to inform a recommendation of one specific technique based on reliability data due to a small body of research at this time. Furthermore, there is a lack of data on the reliability of footprint measurement and comparison techniques in real-world scenarios. Overall, the findings regarding reliability of the techniques covered in this systematic review are to be interpreted with caution due to the methodological quality of reliability testing conducted within the included studies.","output":"The identification and reliability of static and dynamic barefoot impression measurements: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese children and adolescents have been greatly affected by the strict social isolation policies, which will undoubtedly cause psychological problems.

In the CARMEN platform, nanolitre droplets containing CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection reagents7 self-organize in a microwell array8 to pair with droplets of amplified samples, testing each sample against each CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in replicate. The combination of CARMEN and Cas13 detection (CARMEN-Cas13) enables robust testing of more than 4,500 crRNA-target pairs on a single array. Using CARMEN-Cas13, we developed a multiplexed assay that simultaneously differentiates all 169 human-associated viruses with at least 10 published genome sequences and rapidly incorporated an additional crRNA to detect the causative agent of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. CARMEN-Cas13 further enables comprehensive subtyping of influenza A strains and multiplexed identification of dozens of HIV drug-resistance mutations. The intrinsic multiplexing and throughput capabilities of CARMEN make it practical to scale, as miniaturization decreases reagent cost per test by more than 300-fold.

This study describes their self-perceived accessibility of and demand for COVID-19 immunization. Methods A multi-centric cross-sectional survey was conducted in 4 health facilities providing care to undocumented immigrants in the USA, Switzerland, Italy, and France in February-April 2021. A convenience sample of minimum 100 patients per study site was recruited. Data was collected using an anonymous structured questionnaire including demographic variables, health status, and drivers/barriers for COVID-19 immunization. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the primary and secondary outcomes: self-perceived accessibility of and demand for COVID-19 immunization. Results 812 migrants completed the survey (54.3% Geneva, 17.5% Baltimore, 15.5% Milan, and 12.7% Paris). 60.9% were women, the median age was 40 years old (range 17-76), and 19 nationalities were represented: 55.9% Latin America, 12.7% Africa, 11.2% Western Pacific, 7.9% Eastern Mediterranean, 7.6% Europe, 4.7% Asia. Among participants, 14.1% and 26.2% reported prior COVID-19 infection and fear of developing severe COVID-19, respectively. Underlying co-morbidities were common (29.5%). Self-perceived accessibility of COVID-19 immunization was high (86.4%), yet demand was low (41.1%) correlating with age, co-morbidity, and views on immunization which were better for immunization in general (77.3%) than immunization against COVID-19 (56.5%).

This study examines the extent of SD and other mental health predictors and their effect on quality of life. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of sexually active adults was conducted in an Indian metro-city. Along with sociodemographic data, sexual dysfunction, depression, anxiety, stress, and quality of life were assessed by Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), and WHOQOL-BREF, respectively. Structural equations modeling was used to understand their relationship. RESULTS: Out of the total 1,376 respondents, 80.52% were male, 65.98% were married, and 48.54% were graduates. The mean age of the participants was 34.42 (9.34) years. Of the participants, 27.18% had sexual dysfunction. Majority of the respondents did not have depression (59.30%), anxiety (52.33%), or stress (44.48%). Mild and moderate levels were the commonest findings among those who had depression, anxiety, or stress. Among the respondents, 27.18% had sexual dysfunction as per the ASEX instrument. Increase in age and female gender were associated with sexual dysfunction overall and also all its components. Presence of depression adversely affected ease of achieving orgasm and satisfaction from orgasm and was associated with sexual dysfunction overall. The respondents had a mean score of 73.57 (13.50) as per the WHO-QOL. Depression and stress emerged as statistically significant factors for poor quality of life, while sexual dysfunction was not associated statistically. CONCLUSION: More than one-fourth of the study population reported sexual dysfunction during the first wave of the pandemic in India.

Using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), children and parents were separately questioned about QOL of patients. RESULTS: The mean patients' age was 8.6  3.2 years (SD), with range of 5-16 years. The children responded that all PedsQL scores were significantly improved by surgery, and the highest improvement was observed in the school subscale score. When the parents rated the children's QOL, significant improvements were limited to 3 out of 7 subscales, including the emotional, psychosocial health summary, and total scores. The improvements in the PedsQL score were not correlated with age, size of deviation changes following surgery, nor the improvement in binocular vision.

SETTING California Patient Discharge Database, 2016-2018. PATIENTS Adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Using the California Patient Discharge Database 2016-2018, we identified all mechanically ventilated patients and those who received tracheostomy. We determine the association between tracheostomy and the distance between each hospital and the nearest long-term acute care hospital and the number of long-term acute care hospital beds within 20 miles of each hospital. Among 281,502 hospitalizations where a patient received mechanical ventilation, 22,899 (8.1%) received a tracheostomy. Patients admitted to a hospital closer to a long-term acute care hospital compared with those furthest from a long-term acute care hospital had 38.9% (95% CI, 33.3-44.6%) higher odds of tracheostomy (closest hospitals 8.7% vs furthest hospitals 6.3%, adjusted odds ratio = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.40-1.95). Patients had a 32.4% (95% CI, 27.6-37.3%) higher risk of tracheostomy when admitted to a hospital with more long-term acute care hospital beds in the immediate vicinity (most long-term acute care hospital beds within 20 miles 8.9% vs fewest long-term acute care hospital beds 6.7%, adjusted odds ratio = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.31-1.80).

Further, COVID-19 pandemic-associated ARDS is now a major cause of mortality worldwide. The pathogenesis of ALI is explained by injury to both the vascular endothelium and the alveolar epithelium. The disruption of the lung endothelial and epithelial barriers occurs in response to both systemic and local production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Studies that evaluate the association of genetic polymorphisms with disease risk did not yield many potential therapeutic targets to treat and revert lung injury. This failure is probably due in part to the phenotypic complexity of ALI/ARDS, and genetic predisposition may be obscured by the multiple environmental and behavioral risk factors. In the last decade, new research has uncovered novel epigenetic mechanisms that control ALI/ARDS pathogenesis, including histone modifications and DNA methylation. Enzyme inhibitors such as DNMTi and HDACi may offer new alternative strategies to prevent or reverse the vascular damage that occurs during lung injury.

Bradykinin is a potent part of the vasopressor system that induces hypotension and vasodilation and is degraded by ACE and enhanced by the angiotensin(1-9) produced by ACE2. Here, we perform a new analysis on gene expression data from cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients that were used to sequence the virus. Comparison with BALF from controls identifies a critical imbalance in RAS represented by decreased expression of ACE in combination with increases in ACE2, renin, angiotensin, key RAS receptors, kinogen and many kallikrein enzymes that activate it, and both bradykinin receptors. This very atypical pattern of the RAS is predicted to elevate bradykinin levels in multiple tissues and systems that will likely cause increases in vascular dilation, vascular permeability and hypotension.

Productive SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on viral entry into cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Indeed, viral entry into cells is mostly mediated by the early interaction between the viral spike protein S and its ACE2 receptor. The S/ACE2 complex is, thus, the first contact point between the incoming virus and its cellular target; consequently, it has been considered an attractive therapeutic target. To further characterize this interaction and the cellular processes engaged in the entry step of the virus, we set up various in silico, in vitro and in cellulo approaches that allowed us to specifically monitor the S/ACE2 association. We report here a novel computational model of the SARS-CoV-2 S/ACE2 complex as well as its biochemical and biophysical monitoring using pulldown, AlphaLISA and biolayer interferometry (BLI) binding assays. This led us to determine the kinetic parameters of the S/ACE2 association and dissociation steps. In parallel to these in vitro approaches, we developed in cellulo transduction assays using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and HEK293T-ACE2 cell lines generated in-house. This allowed us to recapitulate the early replication stage of the infection mediated by the S/ACE2 interaction and to detect cell fusion induced by the interaction. Finally, a cell imaging system was set up to directly monitor the S/ACE2 interaction in a cellular context, and a flow cytometry assay was developed to quantify this association at the cell surface. Together, these different approaches are available for both basic and clinical research aiming to characterize the entry step of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and its variants as well as to investigate the possible chemical modulation of this interaction. All these models will help in identifying new antiviral agents and new chemical tools for dissecting the virus entry step.","output":"In silico, in vitro and in cellulo models for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 spike/human ACE2 complex, viral entry and cell fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Between April 2019 and September 2020, 23,001 people aged 15 or over responded to questions about their health and living conditions for the German Health Update (GEDA 2019/2020-EHIS).

This study aimed to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of computed tomography (CT) imaging in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of fifty patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Twenty-seven patients survived, while 23 passed away. CT imaging was performed in all of the patients on the day of admission. Imaging findings were interpreted based on current guidelines by two expert radiologists. Imaging findings were compared between surviving and deceased patients. Lung scores were assigned to patients based on CT chest findings. Then, the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine cutoff values for lung scores. RESULTS: The common radiologic findings were ground-glass opacities (82%) and airspace consolidation (42%), respectively. Air bronchogram was more commonly seen in deceased patients (p = 0.04). Bilateral and multilobar involvement was more frequently found in deceased patients (p = 0.049 and 0.014, respectively). The mean number of involved lobes was 3.46  1.80 lobes in surviving patients and 4.57  0.60 lobes in the deceased patients (p = 0.009). The difference was statistically significant. The area under the curve for a lung score cutoff of 12 was 0.790. CONCLUSION: Air bronchogram and bilateral and multilobar involvement were more frequently seen in deceased patients and may suggest a poor outcome for COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Predictors of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pneumonitis outcome based on computed tomography (CT) imaging obtained prior to hospitalization: a retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Unrest in Myanmar in August 2017 resulted in the movement of over 700,000 Rohingya refugees to overcrowded camps in Coxs Bazar, Bangladesh. A large outbreak of diphtheria subsequently began in this population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data were collected during mass vaccination campaigns (MVCs), contact tracing activities, and from 9 Diphtheria Treatment Centers (DTCs) operated by national and international organizations. These data were used to describe the epidemiological and clinical features and the control measures to prevent transmission, during the first 2 years of the outbreak. Between November 10, 2017 and November 9, 2019, 7,064 cases were reported: 285 (4.0%) laboratory-confirmed, 3,610 (51.1%) probable, and 3,169 (44.9%) suspected cases. The crude attack rate was 51.5 cases per 10,000 person-years, and epidemic doubling time was 4.4 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2C4.7) during the exponential growth phase. The median age was 10 years (range 0C85), and 3,126 (44.3%) were male. The typical symptoms were sore throat (93.5%), fever (86.0%), pseudomembrane (34.7%), and gross cervical lymphadenopathy (GCL; 30.6%). Diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) was administered to 1,062 (89.0%) out of 1,193 eligible patients, with adverse reactions following among 229 (21.6%). There were 45 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR] 0.6%). Household contacts for 5,702 (80.7%) of 7,064 cases were successfully traced. A total of 41,452 contacts were identified, of whom 40,364 (97.4%) consented to begin chemoprophylaxis; adherence was 55.0% (N = 22,218) at 3-day follow-up. Unvaccinated household contacts were vaccinated with 3 doses (with 4-week interval), while a booster dose was administered if the primary vaccination schedule had been completed. The proportion of contacts vaccinated was 64.7% overall. Three MVC rounds were conducted, with administrative coverage varying between 88.5% and 110.4%. Pentavalent vaccine was administered to those aged 6 weeks to 6 years, while tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine was administered to those aged 7 years and older. Lack of adequate diagnostic capacity to confirm cases was the main limitation, with a majority of cases unconfirmed and the proportion of true diphtheria cases unknown. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest reported diphtheria outbreak in refugee settings. We observed that high population density, poor living conditions, and fast growth rate were associated with explosive expansion of the outbreak during the initial exponential growth phase. Three rounds of mass vaccinations targeting those aged 6 weeks to 14 years were associated with only modestly reduced transmission, and additional public health measures were necessary to end the outbreak. This outbreak has a long-lasting tail, with Rt oscillating at around 1 for an extended period. An adequate global DAT stockpile needs to be maintained. All populations must have access to health services and routine vaccination, and this access must be maintained during humanitarian crises.","output":"Epidemiological, clinical, and public health response characteristics of a large outbreak of diphtheria among the Rohingya population in Coxs Bazar, Bangladesh, 2017 to 2019: A retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Low-energy X-rays have a predominant role in medical diagnostic applications, grown tremendously during recent Covid-19 pandemic times.

Hence, the restoration and protection of catalase is a promising therapeutic strategy in disease management. In the present study, for the first time we have demonstrated the protective role of well-known anti-malarial drug Artemisinin (ART) on the time and temperature-induced degradation of bovine liver catalase (BLC) activity. The findings at different time intervals and at higher temperature showed the protective role of ART on BLC activity. Molecular docking studies suggested specific binding of ART on BLC through heme group interface which was further supported by cyclic voltammetry and dynamic light scattering study. The stabilization of BLC in presence of ART was mediated through forming a BLC-ART complex with reduced and shifted electrochemical peak and increased hydrodynamic diameter. ART substantially prevents the temperature-induced reduction in &#945;-helical content with simultaneous increment in other secondary structures like antiparallel, parallel, ?-turn and random coils. Nevertheless, the protective role of ART was accepted from the enhanced thermal stability and increased Tm value of BLC in presence of ART at higher temperatures. Our results uncover the mechanism of interaction between ART with BLC and suggest the protective role of ART towards spatiotemporal alteration of BLC by preventing the structural and molecular change in BLC.

We aimed to evaluate renal complications of COVID-19 and their incidence using a systematic meta-analysis. DESIGN: Observational studies reporting renal complications in COVID-19 patients were sought from MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library from 2019 to June 2020. The nine-star Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate methodological quality. Incidence with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. RESULTS: We included 22 observational cohort studies comprising of 17,391 COVID-19 patients. Quality scores of studies ranged from 4 to 6. The pooled prevalence of pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease was 5.2% (2.8-8.1) and 2.3% (1.8-2.8), respectively. The pooled incidence over follow-up of 2-28 days was 12.5% (10.1-15.0) for electrolyte disturbance (e.g. hyperkalaemia), 11.0% (7.4-15.1) for acute kidney injury (AKI) and 6.8% (1.0-17.0) for renal replacement therapy (RRT). In subgroup analyses, there was a higher incidence of AKI in US populations and groups with higher prevalence of pre-existing CKD.

Our main aim was to describe the HAEL Study recruitment methods and yield rates. The secondary objectives were to explore the reasons for exclusion and to describe the characteristics of the enrolled participants. METHODS: This is a descriptive study within a trial. The HAEL Study was a Brazilian randomized two-center, parallel trial with an estimated sample of 184 participants. The recruitment strategy was based on four methods: electronic health records, word of mouth, print and electronic flyer, and press media. The yield rate was the ratio of the number of participants who underwent randomization to the total number of volunteers screened, calculated for overall, per recruitment method, by study center and by age group and sex. Additionally, we described the reasons for exclusion in the screening phase, as well as the demographic characteristics of those enrolled. The data are presented in absolute/relative frequencies and mean  standard deviation. RESULTS: A total of 717 individuals were screened, and 168 were randomized over 32 months. The yield rate was higher for word of mouth (30.1%) in the overall sample. However, press media contributed the most (39.9%) to the absolute number of participants randomized in the trial. The coordinating center and participating center differed in methods with the highest yield ratios and absolute numbers of randomized participants. The main reason for exclusion in the screening phase was due to the physically active status in those intending to participate in the study (61.5%).

Effective treatments of COVID-19 are urgently needed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This is the first edition of a living systematic review of randomized clinical trials comparing the effects of all treatment interventions for participants in all age groups with COVID-19. We planned to conduct aggregate data meta-analyses, trial sequential analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Our systematic review is based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines, and our 8-step procedure for better validation of clinical significance of meta-analysis results. We performed both fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and nonserious adverse events. We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the certainty of evidence. We searched relevant databases and websites for published and unpublished trials until August 7, 2020. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial methodology. We included 33 randomized clinical trials enrolling a total of 13,312 participants. All trials were at overall high risk of bias. We identified one trial randomizing 6,425 participants to dexamethasone versus standard care. This trial showed evidence of a beneficial effect of dexamethasone on all-cause mortality (rate ratio 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75-0.93; p < 0.001; low certainty) and on mechanical ventilation (risk ratio [RR] 0.77; 95% CI 0.62-0.95; p = 0.021; low certainty). It was possible to perform meta-analysis of 10 comparisons. Meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between remdesivir versus placebo on all-cause mortality (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.40-1.37; p = 0.34, I2 = 58%; 2 trials; very low certainty) or nonserious adverse events (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.80-1.11; p = 0.48, I2 = 29%; 2 trials; low certainty). Meta-analysis showed evidence of a beneficial effect of remdesivir versus placebo on serious adverse events (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.63-0.94; p = 0.009, I2 = 0%; 2 trials; very low certainty) mainly driven by respiratory failure in one trial. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses showed that we could exclude the possibility that hydroxychloroquine versus standard care reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.97-1.19; p = 0.17; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; low certainty) and serious adverse events (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.96-1.18; p = 0.21; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; low certainty) by 20% or more, and meta-analysis showed evidence of a harmful effect on nonserious adverse events (RR 2.40; 95% CI 2.01-2.87; p < 0.00001; I2 = 90%; 6 trials; very low certainty). Meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between lopinavir-ritonavir versus standard care on serious adverse events (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.39-1.04; p = 0.07, I2 = 0%; 2 trials; very low certainty) or nonserious adverse events (RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.85-1.53; p = 0.38, I2 = 75%; 2 trials; very low certainty). Meta-analysis showed no evidence of a difference between convalescent plasma versus standard care on all-cause mortality (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.33-1.10; p = 0.10, I2 = 0%; 2 trials; very low certainty). Five single trials showed statistically significant results but were underpowered to confirm or reject realistic intervention effects. None of the remaining trials showed evidence of a difference on our predefined outcomes. Because of the lack of relevant data, it was not possible to perform other meta-analyses, network meta-analysis, or individual patient data meta-analyses. The main limitation of this living review is the paucity of data currently available. Furthermore, the included trials were all at risks of systematic errors and random errors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that dexamethasone and remdesivir might be beneficial for COVID-19 patients, but the certainty of the evidence was low to very low, so more trials are needed. We can exclude the possibility of hydroxychloroquine versus standard care reducing the risk of death and serious adverse events by 20% or more. Otherwise, no evidence-based treatment for COVID-19 currently exists.

Most of the Omicron cases were asymptomatic (n=50,61%) and did not require any hospitalizations. A total of 72 (87.8%) cases were fully vaccinated. 39.1% (n=32) had a history of travel and/or contacts while 60.9 (n=50) showed a community transmission. A steep increase in the daily progression of Omicron cases with its preponderance in the community was observed from 1.8% to 54%. Interpretation: This study is among the first from India to provide evidence of community transmission of Omicron with significantly increased breakthrough infections, decreased hospitalization rates, and a lower rate of symptomatic infections among individuals with high seropositivity against SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"Evidence of early community transmission of Omicron (B1.1.529) in Delhi- A city with very high seropositivity and past exposure!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Inappropriate use of antimicrobials is a key factor increasing antimicrobial resistance, a major global public health problem including in South Africa. Key drivers include antibiotics being dispensed without a prescription. OBJECTIVES: To determine the accessibility of antibiotics without a prescription in community pharmacies in urban areas in South Africa and determine whether counselling was provided when antibiotics were dispensed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective, observational study, employing simulated patients (SPs), presenting with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and urinary tract infections (UTIs), undertaken to establish whether antibiotics can be obtained without a valid prescription in South Africa. This pilot study was conducted in privately owned (n = 20) and corporate (franchised, n = 14) community pharmacies in three regions in Gauteng Province. RESULTS: Antibiotics were sold in privately owned pharmacies without a prescription in 80% (16/20) of cases while no antibiotics were dispensed in corporate (franchised) pharmacies. Of the 16 pharmacies selling antibiotics without a prescription, pharmacist assistants were involved in 37.5% (n = 6) and counselling was not provided to 19% of SPs. Ciprofloxacin (42.9%) and metronidazole (28.6%) were the most common antibiotics dispensed. No antibiotics were dispensed for URTIs, only UTIs. CONCLUSIONS: Dispensing antibiotics without prescriptions can be common among privately owned pharmacies in urban areas in South Africa. Corporate pharmacies, which probably have a greater income, appear to follow current legislation banning such activities. To limit selling with no prescription, community pharmacists and assistants especially in urban areas should be educated on appropriate patient care and legal requirements, with dispensing electronically monitored.","output":"Using mystery shoppers to determine practices pertaining to antibiotic dispensing without a prescription among community pharmacies in South Africaa pilot survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate identification of effective epidemic threshold is essential for understanding epidemic dynamics on complex networks. In this paper, we systematically study how the recovery rate affects the susceptible-infected-removed spreading dynamics on complex networks, where synchronous and asynchronous updating processes are taken into account. We derive the theoretical effective epidemic threshold and final outbreak size based on the edge-based compartmental theory. To validate the proposed theoretical predictions, extensive numerical experiments are implemented by using asynchronous and synchronous updating methods. When asynchronous updating method is used in simulations, recovery rate does not affect the final state of spreading dynamics. But with synchronous updating, we find that the effective epidemic threshold decreases with recovery rate, and final outbreak size increases with recovery rate. A good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the numerical results are observed on both synthetic and real-world networks. Our results extend the existing theoretical studies and help us to understand the phase transition with arbitrary recovery rate.","output":"Recovery rate affects the effective epidemic threshold with synchronous updating"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Our research summarized policy disparities in response to the first wave of COVID-19 between China and Germany. We look forward to providing policy experience for other countries still in severe epidemics. METHODS: We analyzed data provided by National Health Commission of the Peoples Republic of China and Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center for the period 10 January 2020 to 25 May 252,020. We used generalized linear model to evaluate the associations between the main control policies and the number of confirmed cases and the policy disparities in response to the first wave of COVID-19 between China and Germany. RESULTS: The generalized linear models show that the following factors influence the cumulative number of confirmed cases in China: the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism; locking down the worst-hit areas; the highest level response to public health emergencies; the expansion of medical insurance coverage to suspected patients; makeshift hospitals; residential closed management; counterpart assistance. The following factors influence the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Germany: the Novel Coronavirus Crisis Command; large gathering cancelled; real-time COVID-19 risk assessment; the medical emergency plan; schools closure; restrictions on the import of overseas epidemics; the no-contact protocol. CONCLUSIONS: There are two differences between China and Germany in non-pharmaceutical interventions: China adopted the blocking strategy, and Germany adopted the first mitigation and then blocking strategy; Chinas goal is to eliminate the virus, and Germanys goal is to protect high-risk groups to reduce losses. At the same time, the policies implemented by the two countries have similarities: strict blockade is a key measure to control the source of infection, and improving medical response capabilities is an important way to reduce mortality.","output":"Policy disparities in response to the first wave of COVID-19 between China and Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the end of my fellowship in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry draws near, my days are occupied by shoring up my expertise in child and adolescent mental health.

METHODS: 234 symptomatic patients with COVID-19, diagnosed according to the World Health Organization guidelines, were included in the study. The severity of the disease was classified as moderate, severe and critical. Doppler ultrasound (DUS) was performed in all patients. DUS findings, clinical, laboratorys and therapeutic variables were investigated by contingency tables, Pearson chi square test and by Student t test and Fisher's exact test. ROC curve analysis was applied to study significant continuous variables. RESULTS: Overall incidence of DVT was 10.7% (25/234): 1.6% (1/60) among moderate cases, 13.8% (24/174) in severely and critically ill patients. Prolonged bedrest and intensive care unit admission were significantly associated with the presence of DVT (19.7%). Fraction of inspired oxygen, P/F ratio, respiratory rate, heparin administration, D-dimer, IL-6, ferritin and CRP showed correlation with DVT. CONCLUSION: DUS may be considered a useful and valid tool for early identification of DVT. In less severely affected patients, DUS as screening of DVT might be unnecessary. High rate of DVT found in severe patients and its correlation with respiratory parameters and some significant laboratory findings suggests that these can be used as a screening tool for patients who should be getting DUS.","output":"Early detection of deep vein thrombosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: who to screen and who not to with Doppler ultrasound?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThis paper aims to provide insights into the internationalization strategic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by higher education institutions (HEIs) in Latin America.Design/methodology/approachThis study is based on information from eight leading Latin American private universities.

Understanding differences in the way patients interact with these communication platforms can inform their use and design for hypertension management. OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim was to explore the unique phenotypes of patient interactions with an automated text messaging platform for BP monitoring. Our secondary aim was to estimate associations between interaction phenotypes and BP control. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial for adults with poorly controlled hypertension. A total of 201 patients with established primary care were assigned to the automated texting platform; messages exchanged throughout the 4-month program were analyzed. We used the k-means clustering algorithm to characterize two different interaction phenotypes: program conformity and engagement style. First, we identified unique clusters signifying differences in program conformity based on the frequency over time of error alerts, which were generated to patients when they deviated from the requested text message format (eg, ###/## for BP). Second, we explored overall engagement styles, defined by error alerts and responsiveness to text prompts, unprompted messages, and word count averages. Finally, we applied the chi-square test to identify associations between each interaction phenotype and achieving the target BP. RESULTS: We observed 3 categories of program conformity based on their frequency of error alerts: those who immediately and consistently submitted texts without system errors (perfect users, 51/201), those who did so after an initial learning period (adaptive users, 66/201), and those who consistently submitted messages generating errors to the platform (nonadaptive users, 38/201). Next, we observed 3 categories of engagement style: the enthusiast, who tended to submit unprompted messages with high word counts (17/155); the student, who inconsistently engaged (35/155); and the minimalist, who engaged only when prompted (103/155). Of all 6 phenotypes, we observed a statistically significant association between patients demonstrating the minimalist communication style (high adherence, few unprompted messages, limited information sharing) and achieving target BP (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: We identified unique interaction phenotypes among patients engaging with an automated text message platform for remote BP monitoring. Only the minimalist communication style was associated with achieving target BP. Identifying and understanding interaction phenotypes may be useful for tailoring future automated texting interactions and designing future interventions to achieve better BP control.","output":"Patient Interaction Phenotypes With an Automated Remote Hypertension Monitoring Program and Their Association With Blood Pressure Control: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytokines, and specifically interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8), have been associated with the pathogenesis of endometriosis.

We carried out a case-control study including 19 patients with OE alone (OE group), 14 patients with DIE alone (DIE group) and 24 healthy patients without endometriosis (C group). Serum concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were measured in the three groups of patients. Serum levels of both IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly higher in the OE group. A high positive correlation was found between serum IL-6 and IL-8 levels in the OE group but not in the DIE and C groups. Serum IL-8 alone achieved the highest predictive value of the presence of OE (adjusted OR: 1.44; sensitivity: 78.2%; specificity: 76.2%). The combination of IL-6 and IL-8 levels did not significantly improve the discrimination between subjects with OE and those with DIE over that of IL-8.

Many doctors are physically and emotionally exhausted, neglecting families, self-care, patient empathy and innovative thinking about complex health issues. Exposure to clinical work hours demonstrated a dose effect with burnout, suggesting cause and effect, affecting up to 80% of doctors. To retain good doctors, their complex needs must be recognised and allowances made for flexible work options. TAKING A RISK: George Hospital, a large regional training hospital in a rural district, converted some full-time medical officer posts to part-time posts. This was in response to doctors requests for more flexible work options, often after returning from maternity leave or in response to burnout. Perceived risks revolved around institutional resource security and that part-time post vacancies would be difficult to fill. REAPING THE BENEFITS: Employing doctors in part-time posts has created stability and continuity in the health team. The hospital had generated a cohort of young professionals who care with empathy and have emotional resilience to train others and plough their skills back into the healthcare service. CONCLUSION: Reducing working hours and creating flexible options were concrete ways of promoting resilience and retaining competent doctors. We recommend that training and work of doctors be structured towards more favourable options to encourage retention, which may lead to better patient care.","output":"Retaining doctors and reducing burnout through a flexible work initiative in a rural South African training hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction:Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components and destruction of the pulmonary parenchyma. Studies have shown severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to PF with residual lung function abnormalities and fibrotic remodeling. As of today, there is no consensus on treatment for PF caused by COVID-19. We are reporting a case series of three post-COVID-19 PF patients treated with tapering prednisone. Case Series:Patient 1 is 52-year-old male presented to the clinic after a 3-month hospital course of COVID-19 requiring hyperbaric hood. He was discharged with 2L of home oxygen. The patient saturated at 95% at rest but desaturated to 70% on exertion. Chest X-ray (CXR) and CT thorax showed diffuse ground glass opacity with pulmonary fibrosis and scarring. Tapering prednisone from 40mg over 1 month was initiated. Follow-up visit after one month confirmed reduce home oxygen requirement. CXR also revealed mild improvement in interstitial infiltrates. Patient 2 is a 56-year-old male hospitalized 2 months ago for COVID-19 where he required non-rebreather mask for oxygen supply. In the office, he complained of shortness of breath on exertion. CXR showed diffuse bilateral airspace opacities and thickened interstitial lung markings. Pulmonary function test (PFT) revealed moderate restrictive pattern with reduced lung volumes. He was sent home with a course of tapering prednisone over 1 month and weekly office follow up. His symptoms improved. Repeat CXR showed improving bilateral diffuse reticular markings. Repeat PFT improved to mild restrictive lung pattern. Patient 3 is a 70-year-old male hospitalized for 1 moth for COVID-19 requiring face mask with recent discharge on 4L home oxygen. After 2 weeks of hospital discharge, the patient still required 2L of oxygen at home. CXR showed streaky lung opacities predominantly in the left lower lung field. The patient was started on tapering prednisone. At 2-month follow-up, he admitted clinical improvement of symptoms and was able to titrate off home oxygen at rest. Repeat CXR also showed improvement of streaky opacity in the left mid/lower lung. Discussion:No evidence-based treatment is available for post-COVID-19 PF. Corticosteroid is used for treatment of acute exacerbation of other forms of PF by decreasing inflammation in the lungs, and therefore may improve symptoms of post-COVID-19 PF. Our patients received 1-month course of tapering prednisone treatment showed mild clinical improvement with no major adverse effect.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 74 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the First Peoples Hospital of Yueyang from 1 January to 30 March 2020 was carried out. According to the coagulation function, 27 cases entered the coagulopathy group and 47 cases entered the control group. A case control study was conducted to analyse the correlation between the occurrence of coagulation dysfunction and liver damage in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), markers of liver damage, were positively correlated with coagulopathy (p = 0.039, OR 2.960, 95% CI 1.055C8.304; and p = 0.028, OR 3.352, 95% CI 1.137C9.187). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), -glutamyl transpeptidase (-GT), and total bilirubin (TBIL) were not statistically correlated with coagulopathy. According to the diagnosis and treatment plan, the included cases were classified into mild, moderate, severe, and critical. The results showed that the occurrence of coagulation dysfunction had no statistical correlation with the severity of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Coagulation dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 is closely related to liver damage. A longer course of the disease may cause a vicious circle of coagulopathy and liver damage.

These patients do not need treatment in hospital and can be isolated at home. To date, most studies have been conducted among inpatients with severe COVID-19. In this study, the authors surveyed patients with mild COVID-19 who remained in home isolation, and analyzed the sources and occupational risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out on April 17-18, 2020, among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who remained in home isolation in Poland. Data were acquired through a structured interview that included questions about the isolation course, symptoms, comorbidities, infection source, household characteristics, occupation, and workplace. Data were presented with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of the 4878 patients in home isolation, the authors were able to contact 3313. Of them, 1191 patients declined their invitation, and 2122 agreed to take part. The median age of the patients included in the study was 50 years; 59% were female. Most patients (92%) had not been abroad before the infection. More than half (55%) knew how they became infected; of them, 75% became infected at work.

In particular, student assessment posed some of the most urging questions. How do we evaluate practical skills when our universities are on lockdown and our hospitals are working on a shortage of personnel? Is it possible to evaluate these skills via online means, mitigating the effects in students' career development? This paper presents an online evaluation experience implemented at Instituto Oncolgico Henry Moore-Universidad Del Salvador, Buenos Aires in the postgraduate program of Clinical Oncology. The Virtual Observational Standard Clinical Examination (VOSCE) is a technology-based adaptation of the Observational Standard Clinical Examination (OSCE) (JCO 34 (15), Abstract e18150, 2017) implemented in previous years. Methods: The VOSCE took place in November 14, 2020 and consisted on a half-day evaluation during which students rotated through 8 stations (Table). The exam ran on three platforms: Blackboard Collaborate for the interactive elements of all stations;University online campus (Moodle platform) for student questionnaires, and Google Forms for the evaluators' assessment of each student. Students and evaluators participated in various training sessions, and were given a month to practice before the exam. All interactions were recorded and an anonymous survey on students' experience and opinions was conducted after the exam. Results: A total of 25 postgraduate Oncology students participated in the V-OSCE. 24 students (96%) completed all stations on time with minimum or no network connection issues. Student opinions: 24 students completed the exam experience anonymous survey;23 found the exam tech-friendly and valued the practice time provided.

Following rapid distribution and administration of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) under an Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (2), observational studies among nursing home residents demonstrated vaccine effectiveness (VE) ranging from 53% to 92% against SARS-CoV-2 infection (3-6). However, concerns about the potential for waning vaccine-induced immunity and the recent emergence of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant? highlight the need to continue to monitor VE (7). Weekly data reported by the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare (CMS)-certified skilled nursing facilities or nursing homes to CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) were analyzed to evaluate effectiveness of full vaccination (2 doses received 14 days earlier) with any of the two currently authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines during the period soon after vaccine introduction and before the Delta variant was circulating (pre-Delta [March 1-May 9, 2021]), and when the Delta variant predominated? (Delta [June 21-August 1, 2021]). Using 17,407 weekly reports from 3,862 facilities from the pre-Delta period, adjusted effectiveness against infection for any mRNA vaccine was 74.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 70.0%-78.8%). Analysis using 33,160 weekly reports from 11,581 facilities during an intermediate period (May 10-June 20) found that the adjusted effectiveness was 67.5% (95% CI = 60.1%-73.5%). Analysis using 85,593 weekly reports from 14,917 facilities during the Delta period found that the adjusted effectiveness was 53.1% (95% CI = 49.1%-56.7%). Effectiveness estimates were similar for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. These findings indicate that mRNA vaccines provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection among nursing home residents; however, VE was lower after the Delta variant became the predominant circulating strain in the United States. This analysis assessed VE against any infection, without being able to distinguish between asymptomatic and symptomatic presentations. Additional evaluations are needed to understand protection against severe disease in nursing home residents over time. Because nursing home residents might remain at some risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection despite vaccination, multiple COVID-19 prevention strategies, including infection control, testing, and vaccination of nursing home staff members, residents, and visitors, are critical. An additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine might be considered for nursing home and long-term care facility residents to optimize a protective immune response.","output":"Effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Vaccines in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Nursing Home Residents Before and During Widespread Circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant  National Healthcare Safety Network, March 1CAugust 1, 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemics in the history of world health organization have always left memorable hallmarks, on the health care systems and on the economy of highly effected areas.

The authors set up an experimental group to participate in mobile business simulation games, with a total of 105 students, and set up a control group of 100 students. At the beginning and end of the experiment, data on entrepreneurial attitude, self-efficacy, entrepreneurial intention and other related variables were collected. Paired sample T-test and regression analysis were used to analyze the results. Findings The authors found that mobile business simulation games can improve entrepreneurial attitudes and self-efficacy, but cannot change entrepreneurial intentions. The paired sample T-test in the experimental group showed that the entrepreneurial attitude and entrepreneurial self-efficacy of the participants were significantly improved, but the entrepreneurial intention did not change significantly. The above three variables did not change significantly in the control group. The research results also show that flow experience is very important in mobile business simulation games, which can improve entrepreneurial attitude and entrepreneurial self-efficacy. Originality/value The authors' findings confirm the positive effects of mobile business simulation games in entrepreneurship education, which can improve entrepreneurial attitudes and entrepreneurial self-efficacy.

From previously published evidence, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, are both pivotal entry molecules that enable cellular infection by SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or a cytokine storm, is associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome that is often observed in critically ill patients. Methods We investigated the expression pattern of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in major organs in the human body, especially under specific disease conditions. Multiple sequence alignment of ACE2 in different species was used to explain animal susceptibility. Moreover, the cell-specific expression patterns of ACE2 and cytokine receptors in the urinary tract were assessed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Additional biological relevance was determined through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using an ACE2 specific signature. Results Our results revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly expressed in genitourinary organs. ACE2 was highly and significantly expressed in the kidney among individuals with chronic kidney diseases or diabetic nephropathy. In single cells, ACE2 was primarily enriched in gametocytes in the testis, and renal proximal tubules. The receptors for pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL6ST, were remarkably concentrated in endothelial cells, macrophages, and spermatogonial stem cells in the testis, and renal endothelial cells, which suggested the occurrence of alternative damaging mechanisms via autoimmune attacks. Conclusions This study provided new insights into the pathogenicity mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 that underlie the clinical manifestations observed in the human testis and kidney.

Pharmacological treatment of cachexia consists mainly of progestagens and glucocorticosteroids. Still, the assessment of new options limiting the harmful impact of cachexia could be beneficial. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are old antimalarial agents endowed with immunomodulatory properties. Being potent autophagy inhibitors, they could lead to some kind of intracellular starvation in both immunocompetent effector cells and cancer cells, thus limiting the harmful impact of CC. CQ/HCQ are also efficient in particular connective tissue disorders. They have gained special attention since the World Health Organization announced the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. According to initial reports, people with a severe inflammatory reaction achieved significant benefits. Possibly they could not be attributed to the antiviral activity alone. It is worth noting that the cytokine storm in COVID-19, connective tissue disorders, and cancer cachexia share some similarities.

This progenitor genome differs from genomes of the first coronaviruses sampled in China by three variants, implying that none of the earliest patients represent the index case or gave rise to all the human infections. However, multiple coronavirus infections in China and the USA harbored the progenitor genetic fingerprint in January 2020 and later, suggesting that the progenitor was spreading worldwide months before and after the first reported cases of COVID-19 in China. Mutations of the progenitor and its offshoots have produced many dominant coronavirus strains, which have spread episodically over time. Fingerprinting based on common mutations reveals that the same coronavirus lineage has dominated North America for most of the pandemic in 2020. There have been multiple replacements of predominant coronavirus strains in Europe and Asia and the continued presence of multiple high-frequency strains in Asia and North America. We have developed a continually updating dashboard of global evolution and spatiotemporal trends of SARS-CoV-2 spread (http://sars2evo.datamonkey.org/).","output":"An evolutionary portrait of the progenitor SARS-CoV-2 and its dominant offshoots in COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endophytic microorganisms are to be found in virtually every plant on earth.

We investigated the safety of urgently initiated maternal telemedicine in preventing the spread of the coronavirus infection. METHODS: This retrospective, single-institution study examined maternal telemedicine at the department of obstetrics of the Hokkaido University Hospital from March 4 to April 2, 2020. The physicians remotely examined the pregnant women from their homes using a visual communication system which kept communication confidential, performed prenatal checkup and administered medical care according to their various blood pressures, weights and cardiotocograms. RESULTS: Forty-four pregnant women received a total of 67 telemedicine interventions. Thirty-two pregnant women (73%) had complications, and 22 were primiparas (50%). Telemedicine interventions were provided 19 times at less than 26 weeks of gestation, 43 times between 26 and 36 weeks of gestation and 5 times after 37 weeks of gestation. There was one case with an abnormality diagnosed during the remote prenatal checkups, and the patient was hospitalized on the same day. However, there were no abnormal findings observed in mothers and children during the other 66 remote prenatal checkups and medical care. CONCLUSION: Maternal telemedicine can be safely conducted in pregnant women who are at risk of having an underlying disorder or fetal abnormality 1 month following the start of the attempt. It should be considered as a form of maternal medical care to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Feasibility and safety of urgently initiated maternal telemedicine in response to the spread of COVID-19: A 1-month report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Along with the spread of open-design environments and various types of digital fabrication tools (e.g., computer numerical control machines, laser cutting devices, and 3D printers), the \\"maker movement\\" or \\"personal fabrication\\" has been spreading worldwide over the past decade.

Sarcoidosis patients are at high risk to COVID-19 severity for having lung injuries as well as treating with immunosuppressive agents. So, physicians are in dilemma whether they should use immunosuppressive agents or not for the patients with sarcoidosis history and COVID-19 infection. Therefore, common factors should be identified to provide effective treatment. For determining the common genes between COVID-19 and sarcoidosis, GSE164805 and GSE18781 were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Common upregulated genes were identified by using R language to investigate their involved pathways and gene ontologies (GO). With the aid of the STRING Cytoscape plugin tool, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) network was constructed. From the PPIs network, Hub genes and essential modules were detected by using Cytohubba, and MCODE respectively. For hub genes, TFs, TFs-miRNA, and drug, interaction networks were built through the NetworkAnalyst web platform. A total of 34 common upregulated genes were identified and among them, five hub genes, including TET2, MUC5AC, VDR, NFE2L2, and BCL6 were determined. In addition, a cluster having VDR and NFE2L2 was detected from the PPIs network. Moreover, 32 transcription factors and 9 miRNA were recognized for hub genes. Furthermore, vitamin D and some of its analogous compounds were obtained from the drug interaction network. In conclusion, hub genes identified in this study might have potential roles in modulating COVID-19 infection and sarcoidosis.

In this paper we analyzed a large medical claims database of US based individuals to identify common long-term effects as well as their associations with various social and medical risk factors. Methods: : The medical claims database was obtained from a prominent US based claims data processing company, namely Change Healthcare. In addition to the claims data, the dataset also consisted of various social determinants of health such as race, income, education level and veteran status of the individuals. A self-controlled cohort design (SCCD) observational study was performed to identify ICD-10 codes whose proportion was significantly increased in the outcome period compared to the control period to identify significant long-term effects. A logistic regression-based association analysis was then performed between identified long-term effects and social determinants of health. Results: : Among the over 1.37 million COVID patients in our datasets we found 36 out of 1,724 3-digit ICD-10 codes to be statistically significantly increased in the post-COVID period (p-value <0.05). We also found one combination of ICD-10 codes, corresponding to other anemias and hypertension, that was statistically significantly increased in the post-COVID period (p-value <0.05). Our logistic regression-based association analysis with social determinants of health variables, after adjusting for comorbidities and prior conditions, showed that age and gender were significantly associated with the multiple long-term effects. Race was only associated with other sepsis, income was only associated with Alopecia areata, while education level was only associated with Maternal infectious and parasitic diseases (p-value <0.05). Conclusion: We identified several long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 through a self-controlled study on a cohort of over one million patients. Furthermore, we found that while age and gender are commonly associated with the long-term effects, other social determinants of health such as race, income and education levels have rare or no significant associations.","output":"Identifying Long-Term Effects of SARS-CoV-2 and Their Association with Social Determinants of Health in a Cohort of Over One Million COVID-19 Survivors (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humans are exposed to the variety of emerging environmental pollutant in everyday life. The special concern is paid to endocrine disrupting chemicals especially to triclosan which could interfere with normal hormonal functions. Triclosan could be found in numerous commercial products such as mouthwashes, toothpastes and disinfectants due to its antibacterial and antifungal effects. Considering the excessive use and disposal, wastewaters are recognized as the main source of triclosan in the aquatic environment. As a result of the incomplete removal, triclosan residues reach surface water and even groundwater. Triclosan has potential to accumulate in sediment and aquatic organisms. Therefore, the detectable concentrations of triclosan in various environmental and biological matrices emerged concerns about the potential toxicity. Triclosan impairs thyroid homeostasis and could be associated with neurodevelopment impairment, metabolic disorders, cardiotoxicity and the increased cancer risk. The growing resistance of the vast groups of bacteria, the evidenced toxicity on different aquatic organisms, its adverse health effects observed in vitro, in vivo as well as the available epidemiological studies suggest that further efforts to monitor triclosan toxicity at environmental levels are necessary. The safety precaution measures and full commitment to proper legislation in compliance with the environmental protection are needed in order to obtain triclosan good ecological status.

Evidence on the willingness and uptake of the COVID-19 testing is scarce, and the willingness and uptake of vaccination may change as the pandemic evolves. This study aims to examine willingness and uptake of COVID-19 testing and vaccination during a low-risk period of the COVID-19 pandemic in urban China. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 2244 adults in urban China. Descriptive analyses were performed to compare the respondents willingness and uptake of COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Multivariate logistic regressions were fitted to investigate factors associated with the willingness and uptake of the two measures. RESULTS: In early 2021, about half (52.45%) of the respondents had received or scheduled a COVID-19 test at least once, and a majority (95.63%) of the respondents were willing to receive testing. About two-thirds (63.28%) of the respondents had received/scheduled or were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Willingness and uptake of COVID-19 testing were not associated with socio-demographic characteristics, except for occupation. Being of older age, migrants, having higher educational attainment and secure employment were associated with a higher uptake of COVID-19 vaccination among the surveyed respondents, while willingness to vaccinate was consistent across socio-demographic characteristics among those who had not been vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: By early 2021, Chinese adults expressed almost universal willingness of COVID-19 testing and over half of adults have been tested, while the willingness and uptake of COVID-19 vaccination were relatively low at the low-risk period of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A dynamic space-time diffusion model in a GIS environment was developed and succesfully tested in Rome, Italy. METHODS: Information on cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by molecular diagnostics from Feb 25 to Sep 26 2020 (collected by a large Local Health Unit of Rome, Italy) was used to test a GIS simulator model able to monitor the spatial diffusion and temporal evolution of the spread of the disease. Data included information on: sex, date and place of birth, healthcare facility of hospitalization, date of notification, start date and end date of isolation, date of recovery (both clinical and laboratory confirmed), residence address. RESULTS: Globally, 3,056 cases were geocoded and analysed. The spatio-temporal analysis of the first 45 days since 25 Feb 2020 shows that the spread of COVID-19 was very fast (1,230 cases recorded on 11 Apr) and spatially widespread. Number of cases was highest in the city centre with clusters, thickets and axes in different sub-municipal areas. A slowdown occurred the following month, confirming the positive effect of the lockdown. This effect continued until 11 Jun with a small increase in the number of cases (+10.9%). The period up to 26 Sep is paradigmatic of the second wave, with a continuous increase in cases that spread from the city centre to the suburbs. CONCLUSIONS: Using geocoding process and a detailed GIS mapping it is possible to identify streets, buildings and census sections where the number of cases is high and tends to increase rapidly and, at the same time, it is possible to distinguish clusters and axes that should be kept immediately under special observation as potential pools of super-diffusion. Development of its use in near-real time could bring significant advantages in controlling the spread of COVID-19. KEY MESSAGES: The use of GIS technology is fundamental for mapping the spread of COVID-19.

METHODS: This retrospective and multicentric study was conducted in the six main centers of the French Greater East region, an area heavily impacted by the pandemic. All patients requiring EMS dispatch and who were admitted straight to the intensive care unit (ICU) were included. Clinical data from their pre-hospital and hospital management were retrieved. RESULTS: We included a total of 103 patients (78.6% male, median age 68). In the initial stage, patients were in a critical condition (median oxygen saturation was 72% (60-80%)). In the field, 77.7% (CI 95%: 71.8-88.3%) were intubated. Almost half of our population (45.6%, CI 95%: 37.1-56.9%) had clinical Phenotype 1 (silent hypoxemia), while the remaining half presented Phenotype 2 (acute respiratory failure). In the ICU, a great number had ARDS (77.7%, CI 95% 71.8-88.3% with a PaO2/FiO2 < 200). In-hospital mortality was 33% (CI 95%: 24.6-43.3%). The two phenotypes showed clinical and radiological differences (respiratory rate, OR = 0.98, p = 0.02; CT scan lesion extension >50%, OR = 0.76, p < 0.03). However, no difference was found in terms of overall in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.07, p = 0.74). CONCLUSION: The clinical phenotypes appear to be very distinguishable in the pre-hospital field, yet no difference was found in terms of mortality.

However, not all drugs prolonging QT interval are proar-rhythmic. This study aimed to characterize cellular and tissue mechanisms under which QT-interval prolonging drugs and their combination are proarrhythmic, examining arrhythmia susceptibility due to action potential (AP) triangulation and spatial dispersion of action potential duration (APD). Additionally, we aimed to elucidate that Tor-sades de Pointe (TdP) associated with long-QT are not necessarily caused by early-after-depolarization (EADs) but are related to the presence of AP alternans in both time and space. Isolated Guinea Pig hearts were Langendorff perfused, and optical mapping was done with a voltage dye-sensitive dye. Two commonly used drugs at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Azithromycin (AZM), were added to study the effects of QT interval prolongation.

Whereas zinc might affect SARS-COV-2 replication and cell entry, the link between zinc deficiency and COVID-19 severity could also be attributed to the effects of COVID-19 on the body metabolism and immune response. Zinc deficiency is more prevalent in the elderly and patients with underlying chronic diseases, with established deleterious consequences such as the increased risk of respiratory infection. We reviewed the expected effects of zinc deficiency on COVID-19-related pathophysiological mechanisms focusing on both the renin-angiotensin and kinin-kallikrein systems. Mechanisms and effects were extrapolated from the available scientific literature. Zinc deficiency alters angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) function, leading to the accumulation of angiotensin II, des-Arg9-bradykinin and Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin, which results in an exaggerated pro-inflammatory response, vasoconstriction and pro-thrombotic effects. Additionally, zinc deficiency blocks the activation of the plasma contact system, a protease cascade initiated by factor VII activation. Suggested mechanisms include the inhibition of Factor XII activation and limitation of high-molecular-weight kininogen, prekallikrein and Factor XII to bind to endothelial cells. The subsequent accumulation of Factor XII and deficiency in bradykinin are responsible for increased production of inflammatory mediators and marked hypercoagulability, as typically observed in COVID-19 patients. To conclude, zinc deficiency may affect both the renin-angiotensin and kinin-kallikrein systems, leading to the exaggerated inflammatory manifestations characteristic of severe COVID-19.","output":"A comprehensive insight into the role of zinc deficiency in the renin-angiotensin and kinin-kallikrein system dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prolonged stress is associated with poor physical and mental health outcomes. Understanding the mediators between personality and stress is critical for developing effective stress management interventions during a pandemic. Our study explored whether perceptions of threat from COVID-19 and efficacy to follow government recommendations for preventing COVID-19 would mediate the relationships between personality traits (e.g., neuroticism, conscientiousness-goal-striving, extroversion-activity and sociability) and perceived stress. In an online survey of a representative sample of Canadian adults (n = 1055), we found that higher neuroticism and extroversion were associated with higher levels of stress during the pandemic and a greater increase in stress levels compared to levels before the pandemic. Perceived threat and efficacy significantly mediated the relationship between neuroticism and stress, which suggested that individuals with higher neuroticism experienced higher levels of stress due to higher levels of perceived threat and lower levels of efficacy. Perceived threat did not mediate the relationship between extroverts and stress, which suggested that the source of stress may stem from elsewhere (e.g., inability to socialize). Our findings highlighted that personality traits could be an important factor in identifying stress-prone individuals during a pandemic and that stress management interventions need to be personality specific.","output":"Personality and perceived stress during COVID-19 pandemic: Testing the mediating role of perceived threat and efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is causing declines in childhood immunization rates. We examined potential COVID-19-related changes in pediatric 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) use, subsequent impact on childhood and adult pneumococcal disease rates, and how those changes might affect the favorability of PCV13 use in non-immunocompromised adults aged &#8805;65 years. METHODS: A Markov model estimated pediatric disease resulting from decreased PCV13 use in children aged <5 years; absolute decreases from 10 to 50% for 1-2 years duration were examined, assuming no catch-up vaccination and that decreased vaccination led to proportionate increases in PCV13 serotype pneumococcal disease in children and seniors. Integrating pediatric model output into a second Markov model examining 65-year-olds, we estimated the cost effectiveness of older adult pneumococcal vaccination strategies while accounting for potential epidemiologic changes from decreased pediatric vaccination. RESULTS: One year of 10-50% absolute decreases in PCV13 use in <5-year-olds increased pneumococcal disease by an estimated 4-19% in seniors; 2 years of decreased use increased senior rates by 8-38%. In seniors, a >53% increase in pneumococcal disease was required to favor PCV13 use in non-immunocompromised seniors at a $200,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained threshold, which corresponded to absolute decreases in pediatric PCV13 vaccination of >50% over a 2-year period. In sensitivity analyses, senior PCV13 vaccination was unfavorable if absolute decreases in pediatric PCV13 receipt were within plausible ranges, despite model assumptions favoring PCV13 use in seniors. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related decreases in pediatric PCV13 use would need to be both substantial and prolonged to make heightened PCV13 use in non-immunocompromised seniors economically favorable.","output":"Should older adult pneumococcal vaccination recommendations change due to decreased vaccination in children during the pandemic?

Patients with a severe phenotype of disease and those who died from the disease have shown hyperinflammation and were more likely to develop neurological manifestations, linking the clinical disease with neuroimmunological features.

Studies have suggested differently probable mechanisms for the development of anosmia in COVID-19, including olfactory cleft syndrome, postviral anosmia syndrome, cytokine storm, direct damage of olfactory sensory neurons, and impairment of the olfactory perception center in the brain. Thus, the observation of anosmia would direct us to find the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in the central nervous system, and this is consistent with numerous neurological manifestations related to COVID-19. Like other neurotropic viruses, SARS-CoV-2 might be able to enter the central nervous system via the olfactory epithelium and induce innate immune responses at the site of entry.

While these epidemiological results remain inconclusive, we sought to investigate the potential role of adaptive immunity via cross-reactivity between vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) with SARS-CoV-2. We implemented a comprehensive exploration of immune homology (including sequence homology, immune epitopes, and glycosylation patterns) between SARS-CoV-2 and all pathogens with FDA-approved vaccines. Sequence homology did not reveal significant alignments of protein sequences between SARS-CoV-2 with any VPD pathogens, including BCG-related strains. We also could not identify any shared T or B cell epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 and VPD pathogens among either experimentally validated epitopes or predicted immune epitopes. For N-glycosylation (N-glyc), while sites with the same tripeptides could be found between SARS-CoV-2 and certain VPD pathogens, their glycosylation potentials and positions were different. In summary, lack of immune homology between SARS-CoV-2 and VPD pathogens suggests that childhood immunization history (i.e., BCG vaccination or others) does not provide protection from SARS-CoV-2 through adaptive cross-immunity.","output":"Lack of immune homology with vaccine preventable pathogens suggests childhood immunizations do not protect against SARS-CoV-2 through adaptive cross-immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to scientifically evaluate the allocation efficiency of science and technology innovation system and build a good science and technology financial environment, this paper constructs an evaluation index system based on the panel data of 11 cities in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area from 2010 to 2019.

However, since the introduction of immunomodulatory therapy, the value of these biomarkers is unclear. We investigated PCT and CRP kinetics in critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with dexamethasone with or without tocilizumab, and assessed the value of these biomarkers to detect secondary bacterial infections. METHODS: In this prospective study, 190 critically ill COVID-19 patients were divided into three treatment groups: no dexamethasone, no tocilizumab (D?T?), dexamethasone, no tocilizumab (D+T?), and dexamethasone and tocilizumab (D+T+). Serial data of PCT and CRP were aligned on the last day of dexamethasone treatment, and kinetics of these biomarkers were analyzed between 6 days prior to cessation of dexamethasone and 10 days afterwards. Furthermore, the D+T? and D+T+ groups were subdivided into secondary infection and no-secondary infection groups to analyze differences in PCT and CRP kinetics and calculate detection accuracy of these biomarkers for the occurrence of a secondary infection. RESULTS: Following cessation of dexamethasone, there was a rebound in PCT and CRP levels, most pronounced in the D+T? group. Upon occurrence of a secondary infection, no significant increase in PCT and CRP levels was observed in the D+T? group (p = 0.052 and p = 0.08, respectively). Although PCT levels increased significantly in patients of the D+T+ group who developed a secondary infection (p = 0.0003), this rise was only apparent from day 2 post-infection onwards. CRP levels remained suppressed in the D+T+ group. Receiver operating curve analysis of PCT and CRP levels yielded area under the curves of 0.52 and 0.55, respectively, which are both markedly lower than those found in the group of COVID-19 patients not treated with immunomodulatory drugs (0.80 and 0.76, respectively, with p values for differences between groups of 0.001 and 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Cessation of dexamethasone in critically ill COVID-19 patients results in a rebound increase in PCT and CRP levels unrelated to the occurrence of secondary bacterial infections. Furthermore, immunomodulatory treatment with dexamethasone and tocilizumab considerably reduces the value of PCT and CRP for detection of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients.

Methods & Materials The study population consisted of a subset of participants (N=4,723 adults) enrolled in Flu Near You (FNY), a web-based longitudinal syndromic surveillance platform. Weekly self-reports of respiratory syndromes were used to assess the onset of COVID-like illness (CLI) symptoms from January to June 2020. An annual retrospective questionnaire submitted by this subset of FNY participants assessed precautionary behaviors (masking, distancing, etc.) and demographic information. We used a previously validated exposure variable (self-reported likelihood to wear masks while visiting family and friends and while grocery shopping) to measure mask wearing. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the effect of mask wearing on CLI while controlling for age, gender, precautionary behavior (social distancing contacts, adoption date), county population density and time-varying county COVID-19 burden. Results There were 1,293 reports of respiratory symptoms over the study period. Individuals characterized as most likely to wear masks were 45% [24%-61%] less likely to report symptoms of COVID-like illness compared to individuals characterized as least likely to wear masks. Mask-wearing also demonstrated a protective effect for those characterized as somewhat likely to wear masks (HR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.42-0.84, p=0.003) and those who were likely to wear masks in only one of the two circumstances (HR. 0.59, 95% CI: 0.42-0.83, p=0.002), compared to respondents least likely to wear masks. Sensitivity analyses with alternative broad and narrow CLI definitions produced a similar magnitude and protective effect.

METHODS Between August 2000 and October 2012, transperitoneal dismembered laparoscopic pyeloplasty was carried out in 13 patients with a surgical history of failed prior surgical interventions. Perioperative outcomes as well as long-term results were assessed. These outcomes were compared with those of the same procedure carried out for primary ureteropelvic junction obstruction by a single surgeon during the same study period. RESULTS Laparoscopic transperitoneal pyeloplasty was completed successfully in all cases without converting to open surgery or requiring blood transfusion. The preoperative symptoms in 12 of 13 patients all disappeared soon after the operation. Asymptomatic severe hydronephrosis found in a 2-year-old boy reduced in size postoperatively. When comparing the primary with the secondary laparoscopic pyeloplasty carried out by the same surgeon, the mean operative time was longer (183 vs 241 min, P = 0.002), estimated blood loss was larger (33 vs 66 mL, P = 0.03) and the complication rate was higher (8.8% vs 22.2%, P = 0.01) in the secondary group. Success rates were 97.9% and 100% (P = 0.41) at a mean follow up of 25.9 and 40.0 months (P = 0.14) for the primary and secondary groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic pyeloplasty is an excellent option for patients who failed previous surgical management.

Although recent advances in cell-type resolved approaches hold great promise for studying complex diseases, their implementation relies on local access to fresh tissue, as traditional tissue storage methods do not allow viable cell isolation. To overcome these hurdles, we developed a versatile workflow that allows storage of lung tissue with high viability, permits thorough sample quality check before cell isolation, and befits sequencing-based profiling. We demonstrate that cryopreservation enables isolation of multiple cell types from both healthy and diseased lungs. Basal cells from cryopreserved airways retain their differentiation ability, indicating that cellular identity is not altered by cryopreservation. Importantly, using RNA sequencing and EPIC Array, we show that gene expression and DNA methylation signatures are preserved upon cryopreservation, emphasizing the suitability of our workflow for -omics profiling of lung cells. Moreover, we obtained high-quality single-cell RNA sequencing data of cells from cryopreserved human lung, demonstrating that cryopreservation empowers single-cell approaches. Overall, thanks to its simplicity, our workflow is well-suited for prospective tissue collection by academic collaborators and biobanks, opening worldwide access to viable human tissue.","output":"Versatile workflow for cell-type resolved transcriptional and epigenetic profiles from cryopreserved human lung."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper deals with the hot, evergreen topic of the relationship between privacy and technology.

We found both short- and long-term observational relationships with a range of regulated pollutants, although only two studies considered both cases (i.e., infections) and deaths within a common analytical framework. Most of these studies were limited to a few months of the pandemic period. Statistically significant relationships were found more often for PM2.5 and NO2 than for other regulated pollutants, but no rationale was suggested for such short-term relationships;latency was seldom considered for long-term relationships. It was also unclear whether confounding had been adequately controlled in either type of study. Studies of air quality improvement following lockdowns found more robust relationships with local (CO, NO2) rather than regional (PM2.5, O3) pollutants, but meteorological confounding was seldom considered. Only one of seven studies of airborne virus transmission reported actual measurements. Overall, we found the existing body of literature to be more suggestive than definitive. Due to these various deficiencies, we assembled a new state-level database of cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths through March 2021 with a range of potential predictor variables and performed linear regression analyses on various combinations. As single predictors, we found significant (p &lt;0.05) relationships between cumulative cases and household crowding (+), education (?), face-mask usage (?), or voting Republican (+). For cumulative deaths, we found significant relationships with education (?), black race (+), or previous levels of PM2.5 (+). NOx (+), and elemental carbon (EC, +). We found no relationships between long-term air quality and cumulative COVID-19 cases. Our associations linking air pollution with COVID-19 mortality were not statistically different from those for all-cause mortality in previous studies. In multiple mortality regressions combining air pollution, race, and education, NOx and EC remained significant but PM2.5 did not. We concluded that the current worldwide emphasis on PM2.5 is misplaced. We predicted air pollutant effects of a few percentage points, but individual differences between races, political identification, and post-graduate education were of the order of factors of 2 to 4. In general, the factors predicting infection were personal and related to COVID-19 exposure, while those predicting subsequent mortality tended to be more situational and related to geography.

Central nervous system (CNS) opportunistic infections in patients with HIV/AIDS are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in people living with HIV/AIDS. There are currently limited data on the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in people living with HIV/AIDS with its associated opportunistic CNS infections as well as those without antiretroviral treatment. CASE REPORT Two young men with previously unknown HIV status and its related opportunistic infections received their first doses of COVID-19 vaccine (Vero Cell), inactivated. Both patients had the risk factor of having sex with men (men who have sex with men). Fever and first neurological symptoms occurred within the first few days after vaccination. Both patients were hospitalized and were tested positive for HIV for the first time. Both were further diagnosed from brain imaging as having CNS opportunistic infections. A presumptive diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis was established as the working diagnosis according to the laboratory and epidemiological factors. Despite the treatment, neurological and clinical deficits worsened and eventually led to death in both patients. CONCLUSIONS The causality analyses showed that both adverse events had a possible inconsistent causal relationship to COVID-19 vaccination. Our cases may reflect the need for further studies on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in people with HIV/AIDS-associated CNS opportunistic infection as well as people with HIV/AIDS who never receive antiretroviral treatment (ART).","output":"Progressive Worsening of Neurological Manifestations in HIV-Associated Opportunistic Central Nervous System (CNS) Infection Patients After COVID-19 Vaccinations: A Possible Co-Incidence Causality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) being declared a global public health emergency has become a significant challenge for all healthcare workers, including dentistry, recognised as a high-risk profession during these times.

This field remains an emerging research area with some evidence of its effectiveness; however, there is a scarcity of literature describing economic evaluations of mHealth interventions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the economic viability of using an mHealth approach as an alternative to standard multidisciplinary care by evaluating the direct costs incurred within treatment arms during a noninferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: A digitally delivered (via a smartphone app) maintenance phase of a pediatric weight management program was developed iteratively with patients and families using evidence-based approaches. We undertook a microcosting exercise and budget impact analysis to assess the costs of delivery from the perspective of the publicly funded health care system. Resource use was analyzed alongside the RCT, and we estimated the costs associated with the staff time and resources for service delivery per participant. RESULTS: In total, 109 adolescents participated in the trial, and 84 participants completed the trial (25 withdrew from the trial). We estimated the mean direct cost per adolescent attending usual care at 142 (SD 23.7), whereas the cost per adolescent in the mHealth group was 722 (SD 221.1), with variations depending on the number of weeks of treatment completion. The conversion rate for the reference year 2013 was $1=0.7525. The costs incurred for those who withdrew from the study ranged from 35 to 681, depending on the point of dropout and study arm. The main driver of the costs in the mHealth arm was the need for health professional monitoring and support for patients on a weekly basis. The budget impact for offering the mHealth intervention to all newly referred patients in a 1-year period was estimated at 59,046 using the assessed approach. CONCLUSIONS: This mHealth approach was substantially more expensive than usual care, although modifications to the intervention may offer opportunities to reduce the mHealth costs. The need for monitoring and support from health care professionals (HCPs) was not eliminated using this delivery model. Further research is needed to explore the cost-effectiveness and economic impact on families and from a wider societal perspective.

Recent studies found that real-time adaptive sequencing of DNA molecules was achieved using a nanopore sequencing machine, which enabled effective enrichment of microbial sequences. However, few studies have compared the enzyme-based host depletion and nanopore adaptive sequencing for microbial enrichment efficiency. RESULTS: To compare the host depletion and microbial enrichment efficiency of enzyme-based and adaptive sequencing methods, the present study collected clinical samples from eight children with respiratory tract infections. The same respiratory samples were subjected to standard methods, adaptive sequencing methods, enzyme-based host depletion methods, and the combination of adaptive sequencing and enzyme-based host depletion methods. We compared the host depletion efficiency, microbial enrichment efficiency, and pathogenic microorganisms detected between the four methods. We found that adaptive sequencing, enzyme-based host depletion and the combined methods significantly enriched the microbial sequences and significantly increased the diversity of microorganisms (p value < 0.001 for each method compared to standard). The highest microbial enrichment efficiency was achieved using the combined method. Compared to the standard method, the combined method increased the microbial reads by a median of 113.41-fold (interquartile range 23.32C327.72, maximum 1812), and the number of genera by a median of 70-fold (interquartile range 56.75C86.75, maximum 164).

One reason for this is the rapidly increasing number of new infections. On the other hand, the high sickness rates of doctors and nurses, particularly in ENT medicine, are aggravating the situation. Telemedicine can be a useful tool to reduce the number of physician-patient contacts. This could break infection chains and minimize the risk of infection for physicians. METHODS: To prepare the review, a selective literature search was conducted at www.pubmed.com using the relevant English technical terms for telemedicine and ENT. In addition, research was conducted at www.news.google.com on current developments of the COVID-19 pandemic with the search terms \\"telemedicine\\" and \\"COVID-19.\\" RESULTS: Telemedicine can be helpful in direct contact with patients as well as in the conciliar support of general practitioners. The available studies show that, on average, more than 50% of medical consultations could be carried out telemedically. Both physicians and patients rate the use of telemedicine positively. Neither image quality nor the handling of the technology are relevant obstacles to a reliable diagnosis. Patients indicated that the telemedical consultation did not last longer than a traditional consultation. Patients also highlighted the faster and better availability of medical care through telemedicine.

To develop strategies for reducing anxiety and increasing adherence with health guidelines, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to anxiety and health compliance in the context of COVID-19. Earlier research has shown that greater perceived risk of negative events and their costs are associated with increased anxiety and compliance with health behaviors, but it is unclear what role they play in a novel pandemic surrounded by uncertainty. In the present study we measured (1) perceived risk as the self-reported probability of being infected and experiencing serious symptoms due to COVID-19 and (2) perceived cost as financial, real-world, physical, social, and emotional consequences of being infected with COVID-19. Worry was assessed using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PWSQ) and health compliance was measured as endorsement of the World Health Organization (WHO) health directives for COVID-19. Our results showed that greater perceived risk and costs of contracting the COVID-19 virus were associated with greater worry and while only costs were associated with greater compliance with health behaviors. Neither self-reported worry nor its interaction with cost estimates was associated with increased engagement in health behaviors. Our results provide important insight into decision making mechanisms involved in both increased anxiety and health compliance in COVID-19 and have implications for developing psychoeducational and psychotherapeutic strategies to target both domains.","output":"Online Survey of the Impact of COVID-19 Risk and Cost Estimates on Worry and Health Behavior Compliance in Young Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ride-hailing and other on-demand mobility services are often proposed as a solution for improving the accessibility of public transport by offering first/last mile connectivity.

We compare the preferences for on-demand services with the bicycle, car and public transport for accessing two alternative train stations at different access distances. We estimate a joint access mode and train station choice model. By estimating a latent class choice model, we uncover five distinct segments in the population. We describe the classes based on their stated preferences, travel behaviour, attitudes towards new mobility and their socio-demographic characteristics. The two largest classes, accounting for over half of the sample, are the most likely to adopt on-demand services. Having an average willingness-to-pay, they would choose these services for longer access distances, competing mainly with the car and local public transport. Applying the model estimates, we observe that while on-demand services mainly compete with public transportation (obtaining most of its travellers from it), they are not able to fully substitute a public transport service for train station access, as many users would switch to cycling or driving a car, rather than opting for the on-demand service.","output":"What is the market potential for on-demand services as a train station access mode?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 or novel coronavirus disease, which has already been declared as a worldwide pandemic, at first had an outbreak in a small town of China, named Wuhan.

RESULTS: The mean COVID-19 knowledge index was 24.5 over 38 with only 15% achieving high knowledge level. The mean prevention measures index was 11.4 over 16 with only 35% achieving high prevention level. Higher knowledge index was associated with younger age, being employed, and considering dentist's role significant in teaching others about COVID-19. General dental practitioners, dentists living with family members and concerned about their family members to get infected because of their occupational exposure were more likely to report higher level of adopted prevention measures. Higher knowledge was associated with high level of prevention measures. CONCLUSIONS: Given the rapid evolution of information related to COVID-19 pandemic, dentists should be regularly educated through trainings, workshops, and updates of national guidelines for dental healthcare.","output":"Determinants of knowledge and prevention measures towards COVID-19 pandemic among Lebanese dentists: a cross sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research has shown that cryptography concepts are hard to understand for developers, and secure use of cryptography APIs is challenging for mainstream developers.

Although COVID-19 is generally considered as self-limiting, some of cases develop in to fatal respiratory restress, multiple organ failure and even sudden death. According to the data released by the provincial health commissions, there are obvious regional differences in COVID-19 mortality. To explore possible factors of COVID-19 related severity and mortality in laboratory-confirmed cases from Henan and Zhejiang. Methods: We collected the public data released by the government. We analyzed and compared the possible factors, including initial symptoms, gender, age, place of residence, time interval from onset to diagnosis, epidemiological history and the grade of hospital for patients treatment in laboratory-confirmed cases. Students t-test, Chi-square (?2) test, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and Mann-Whitney U rank sum test were used complied with the applicable conditions. Statistical test was performed with a level of significance =0.05. Results: Death cases in Henan were mainly from male, elderly infected persons and those who had a history of contact with patients and underlying basic diseases. Henan had the higher proportion of cases with fever and the lower proportion of asymptomatic infection, and had higher proportions of imported male cases with a contact history, and elderly cases living in rural areas, relative to Zhejiang. The time interval of confirmed cases in rural areas of Henan was 0.8 day longer than that in Zhejiang. Hospitals grade for patients treatment in Henan was lower than Zhejiang. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that initial symptoms, age, place of residence, gender, the time interval from onset to diagnosis and the grade of designated hospital for patients treatment are possible factors behind COVID-19 related severity or mortality. This study will provide useful information for public health authorities to develop disease prevention strategies.","output":"Factors related to COVID-19 severity and mortality based on comparison between Henan and Zhejiang: an observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represent promising candidates for clinical intervention against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We isolated a large number of nAbs from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals capable of disrupting proper interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) protein and the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). However, the structural basis for their potent neutralizing activity remains unclear. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the ten most potent nAbs in their native full-length IgG-form or in both IgG-form and Fab-form bound to the trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The bivalent binding of the full-length IgG is found to associate with more RBDs in the up conformation than the monovalent binding of Fab, perhaps contributing to the enhanced neutralizing activity of IgG and triggering more shedding of the S1 subunit from the S protein. Comparison of a large number of nAbs identified common and unique structural features associated with their potent neutralizing activities. This work provides a structural basis for further understanding the mechanism of nAbs, especially through revealing the bivalent binding and its correlation with more potent neutralization and the shedding of S1 subunit.","output":"Structural basis for bivalent binding and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by human potent neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic continues to spread rapidly around the world and nearly 20 millions people are infected.

Effective PrEP requires daily PrEP adherence, but little is known about maternal PrEP continuation and risk factors that influence optimal PrEP use. Methods: The PrEP in pregnancy and postpartum (PrEP-PP) study is an ongoing cohort study that enrolled consenting pregnant, HIV-uninfected women at first antenatal care (ANC) visit, followed through 12-months postpartum. HIV-uninfected women and girls >16-years who were eligible for the study received HIV prevention counseling and were offered PrEP. Interviewers collected socio-demographic, behavioral data from participants at each visit. We analyzed the proportion of women who initiated PrEP and the proportion who continued on PrEP after 3-months with associated correlates, including side effects whilst on PrEP, by estimating the prevalence ratio (95% CI) adjusting for a priori confounders. Results: Between August 2019 and February 2021, we enrolled 891 pregnant women (median gestation=21wks; age=26yrs). Following PrEP counseling, 90% of women initiated PrEP at their first ANC visit (n=801); 60% were married or cohabiting. Three-quarters of women on PrEP returned for a repeat prescription at 1-month; 62% returned at 3-months. One-third of women on PrEP reported a side effect, mostly nausea/vomiting, dizziness, and headache. Women on PrEP in the 1st or 2nd trimester had higher odds of reporting side effects (aOR=2.61; 95%CI=1.17-5.84) vs. postpartum women. Women who reported side effects continued with PrEP less than those who did not report side effects (aPR=0.88; 95% CI=0.78-0.99) adjusting for covariates. Women who had >1 previous pregnancy (aPR=0.76;95%CI=0.59-1.00) or were postpartum (aPR=0.86;95%CI=0.75-0.99) continued less than women who were primigravid or pregnant. Women who reported having an HIV+ partner (aPR= 1.70;95% CI=1.55-1.86) or unknown partner serostatus (aPR=1.14;95%CI=1.01-1.29) were more likely to continue on PrEP than those who had HIV-negative partners. Conclusion: PrEP initiation and early continuation were high in ANC in this setting. Being postpartum and experiencing side effects were associated with lower PrEP continuation, presenting an opportunity for improved clinical management and counseling during pregnancy of nausea/vomiting to address early, transient side effects. Interventions for postpartum women on PrEP are urgently needed.","output":"Early pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) discontinuation among pregnant and postpartum women: Implications for maternal PrEP roll out in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Older adults constitute the most vulnerable population group to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Stenotic lesions caused by neointimal hyperplasia commonly occur resulting in patients requiring a fistuloplasty. This is effective but there is a high recurrence rate. We sought to investigate the effects of a fistuloplasty on monocyte populations. Blood samples were taken from patients before and after their fistuloplasty procedure. Samples were analysed using flow cytometry, ELISA and Luminex assays. Univariate cox regression was carried out to investigate associations with post fistuloplasty patency. At 1C2 days post fistuloplasty, the proportion of classical (CD14++CD16?) monocytes decreased (p < 0.001), whilst intermediate (CD14++CD16+) and non-classical (CD14+CD16+) monocytes increased (both p < 0.01) in a cohort of 20 patients. A time course study carried out in 5 patients showed that this was due to an increase in absolute numbers of non-classical and intermediate monocytes. Higher levels of non-classical monocytes pre-fistuloplasty were associated with an increased risk for patency loss (p < 0.05). We measured 41 soluble factors in plasma samples taken before a fistuloplasty in 54 patients, with paired post-fistuloplasty samples (1C2 days) available in 30 patients.

METHODS: We analyzed patient satisfaction data from a metropolitan tertiary hospitals IBD outpatient clinic. Three questions were compared between in-person and virtual visits: Did this provider listen carefully to you?, Did this provider seem to know the important information about your medical history?, and Using any number from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst provider possible and 10 is the best provider possible, what number would you rate this provider? We performed Fishers exact tests to analyze differences in top-box satisfaction scores between in-person and virtual visits. A qualitative analysis of open-ended questions was performed to identify key satisfaction themes. RESULTS: We collected satisfaction data from 309 in-person medical visits and 202 telehealth visits. Top-box satisfaction scores for provider listening and provider medical history decreased overall from in-person to virtual visits, while overall provider ratings remained the same (Figure 1). Decreases were larger among males than among females for both provider listening and provider knowledge (Table 1). After excluding patients who reported problems with the video connection or video quality, no statistically significant changes in top-box scores were found between in-person and telehealth visits (Figure 1).

Most current and past molecular surveillance studies of animal diseases investigated spatio-temporal and evolutionary dynamics of the viruses in a disjointed analytical framework, ignoring many uncertainties and made joint conclusions from both analytical approaches. Phylodynamic methods offer a uniquely integrated platform capable of inferring complex epidemiological and evolutionary processes from the phylogeny of viruses in populations using a single Bayesian statistical framework. In this study, we reviewed and outlined basic concepts and aspects of phylodynamic methods and attempted to summarize essential components of the methodology in one analytical pipeline to facilitate the proper use of the methods by animal health researchers. Also, we challenged the robustness of the posterior evolutionary parameters, inferred by the commonly used phylodynamic models, using hemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase basic 2 (PB2) segments of the currently circulating human-like H3 swine influenza (SI) viruses isolated in the United States and multiple priors.

Targeting of systemically administered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) coformulated with mRNA has largely been confined to the liver and spleen. Using a library screening approach, we identified that N-series LNPs (containing an amide bond in the tail) are capable of selectively delivering mRNA to the mouse lung, in contrast to our previous discovery that O-series LNPs (containing an ester bond in the tail) that tend to deliver mRNA to the liver. We analyzed the protein corona on the liver- and lung-targeted LNPs using liquid chromatographyCmass spectrometry and identified a group of unique plasma proteins specifically absorbed onto the surface that may contribute to the targetability of these LNPs. Different pulmonary cell types can also be targeted by simply tuning the headgroup structure of N-series LNPs.

These findings, consistent with the presence of mature cells capable of IL-4 and IFN synthesis in the T cell repertoire of naive mice, are supported by the observation that stimulation of spleen cells from naive mice with anti-CD3 mAb in vitro for 12 h also results in strong IL-4 and IFN mRNA and protein synthesis.

The propeller perforator flap (PPF) offers a good alternative when the patient or the limb or both are not fit for FF-based reconstruction. Also, in contexts of restricted healthcare resources, armed conflict scenarios, or during pandemics like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, PPF is considered a valuable alternative to free-flap-based reconstruction. Additionally, PPFs are less sacrificing in terms of major limb vessels and distal limb vascularity. Yet, the distal lower limb vascular impact for PPF-based reconstruction has not been studied before. METHODS: In total, 23 patients with distal lower limb defects were reconstructed with PPFs. By using U/S arterial duplex, the peak arterial velocity (PA velocity) was measured pre and postoperatively in 15 (65.2%) out of the 23 patients. This measurement was done to the vessel segment distal to the used perforator. RESULTS: An estimated 21 out of 23 flaps succeeded to reconstruct the patients defects safely and to give all patients stable coverage without further surgeries. Only two patients had flap failure, which was managed successfully through additional reconstruction sessions. The difference between pre- and postoperative PA velocity was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: PPFs are a safe cost-effective reconstruction modality for distal lower limb defects. This advantage is very valuable in cases of restricted healthcare resources, wars, and during pandemics. In terms of distal limb vascularity, PPFs have no significant impact and can be used safely.","output":"Safety and Vascular Impact of Perforator Propeller Flaps during Distal Lower Limb Reconstruction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considering that parents are one of the key figures in their child's participation in physical activity, it is extremely important to examine parents' perceptions and experiences of physical activity in order to protect children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) from the inactive life during the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and to include them in physical activities in the home environment. Although it is still a new subject, there is no research that addresses parents' physical activity knowledge, needs and recommendations for the physical activity experiences of children with ASD during the COVID-19 outbreak, and offers solutions accordingly. Considering this gap in the literature, the aim of this qualitative study is to explore parents' perceptions on physical activity for their children with ASD. Participants of the study were 10 parents with children with ASD, who participated in one-to-one semi-structured phone calls. Interview data were analyzed thematically. The analysis of the data revealed three main themes: 1) Possible benefits of physical activity during the COVID-19 outbreak, 2) Physical activity barriers during the COVID-19 outbreak, and 3) Recommendations for physical activity during the COVID-19 outbreak. The results revealed that parents thought that physical activities had a positive effect on the development areas of their children with ASD.

METHOD: The Royal College of Surgeons Good Surgical Practice guidance highlights 19 key-variables to record within operation-notes. 300 consecutive operations were identified between May and August 2020 and details of electronic operation-notes collected. Throughout this study period, educational emails and posters were introduced at both sites secondary to ongoing audit. RESULTS: 228/300 (76%) operations took place at our main hospital. The remainder were commissioned to the other. Operating surgeons and anaesthetists were similar at both sites. Quality of documentation was poorer for many key variables at the cold site when compared with the main site (operating-surgeons (22% vs 91%), urgency of operation (62% vs 99%), antibiotic prophylaxis (72% vs 99%) and DVT prophylaxis (21% vs 98%)).

Concerns arise as to whether glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient subjects (G6PD(-)), ~5% of the population in the Mediterranean area, should be accepted as routine donors in the light of the increased oxidative stress their RBCs suffer from. To address this question, we first performed morphology (scanning electron microscopy), physiology and omics (proteomics and metabolomics) analyses on stored RBCs from healthy or G6PD(-) donors. We then used an in vitro model of transfusion to simulate transfusion outcomes involving G6PD(-) donors or recipients, by reconstituting G6PD(-) stored or fresh blood with fresh or stored blood from healthy volunteers, respectively, at body temperature. We found that G6PD(-) cells store well in relation to energy, calcium and morphology related parameters, though at the expenses of a compromised anti-oxidant system. Additional stimuli, mimicking post-transfusion conditions (37C, reconstitution with fresh healthy blood, incubation with oxidants) promoted hemolysis and oxidative lesions in stored G6PD(-) cells in comparison to controls. On the other hand, stored healthy RBC units showed better oxidative parameters and lower removal signaling when reconstituted with G6PD(-) fresh blood compared to control. Although the measured parameters of stored RBCs from the G6PD deficient donors appeared to be acceptable, the results from the in vitro model of transfusion suggest that G6PD(-) RBCs could be more susceptible to hemolysis and oxidative stresses post-transfusion. On the other hand, their chronic exposure to oxidative stress might make them good recipients, as they better tolerate exposure to oxidatively damaged long stored healthy RBCs.","output":"Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient subjects may be better \\"storers\\" than donors of red blood cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herb-induced liver injuries (HILI) by traditional herbal medicines are particular challenges in Asian countries, with issues over the best approach to establish causality.

Objectives To investigate the methodological quality of systematic reviews of AMD intervention studies, and to evaluate their use for guiding evidence-based care. Evidence Review This systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. All studies that self-identified as a systematic review in their title or abstract or were categorized as a systematic review from a medical subject heading and investigated the safety, efficacy and/or effectiveness of an AMD intervention were included. Comprehensive electronic searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to March 2017. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts, then full-texts for eligibility. Quality was assessed using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool. Study characteristics (publication year, type of intervention, journal, citation rate, and funding source) were extracted. Findings Of 983 citations retrieved, 71 studies (7.6%) were deemed eligible. The first systematic review relating to an AMD intervention was published in 2003. More than half were published since 2014. Methodological quality was highly variable. The mean (SD) AMSTAR score was 5.8 (3.2) of 11.0, with no significant improvement over time (r = -0.03; 95% CI, -0.26 to 0.21; P = .83). Cochrane systematic reviews were overall of higher quality than reviews in other journals (mean [SD] AMSTAR score, 9.9 [1.2], n = 15 vs 4.7 [2.2], n = 56; P < .001). Overall, there was poor adherence to referring to an a priori design (22 articles [31%]) and reporting conflicts of interest in both the review and included studies (16 articles [23%]). Reviews funded by government grants and/or institutions were generally of higher quality than industry-sponsored reviews or where the funding source was not reported. Conclusions and Relevance There are gaps in the conduct of systematic reviews in the field of AMD. Enhanced endorsement of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement by refereed journals may improve review quality and improve the dissemination of reliable evidence relating to AMD interventions to clinicians.","output":"Appraising the Quality of Systematic Reviews for Age-Related Macular Degeneration Interventions: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has not stopped the academic world Since mid-March of 2020, lecturers at Universitas Indonesia have facilitated the learning process by providing teaching resources as well as guidance through teleconferencing platforms This study shows the importance of self-tracking in academia, especially for lecturers Our findings suggest approaches to measure lecturers' performance levels through a quiz and questions raised to understand students' behaviors","output":"Understanding heutagogy during a pandemic: A case of Universitas Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endoscopic bariatric and metabolic therapies (EBMT) are a new addition to the treatment arsenal for obesity.

The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown but there are several evidences that associate the genetic basis of the disease with environmental causes. An important association between viral infection and development of MS is clearly demonstrated. Viruses have a strong impact on innate immune cells. In particular, myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), are able to respond to viruses and to activate the adaptive immune response. Methods: In this study we mimic viral infection using synthetic single-strand RNA, Resiquimod, and we compared the response of both DC subsets derived from healthy donors and MS patients by characterizing the expression of costimulatory molecules on the DC surface. Results: We found that pDCs from MS patients express higher levels of OX40-L, HLA-DR, and CD86 than healthy donors. Moreover, we found that blood cells from MS patients and healthy donors upon Resiquimod-stimulation are enriched in a subpopulation of pDCs, characterized by a high amount of costimulatory molecules. Conclusion: Overall, these results indicate that activation of pDCs is enhanced in MS, likely due to a latent viral infection, and that costimulatory molecules expressed on pDCs could mediate a protective response against the viral trigger of autoimmunity.","output":"Resiquimod-Mediated Activation of Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Is Amplified in Multiple Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To identify the conflicts between a career as a surgeon and pregnancy and childbirth for women in Japan.

We reported previously the presence of autoantibodies (autoAb) to liver and kidney fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) in sera from mice infected with MHV-A59. Long-term MHV-infected mice represented a good model of non-pathogenic autoimmune response since the animals were apparently healthy in spite of the presence of autoAb. The aim of this work was to see whether a severe liver injury, which releases endogenous adjuvants, i.e. danger signals, could elicit a broader spectrum of autoAb and perhaps signs of autoimmune hepatitis. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) was injected into mice 30 days after MHV infection, and serum was assayed for autoAb and total IgG 20 days later. The association of MHV infection with the toxic effects of CCl(4) resulted in hypergammaglobulinaemia and the production of autoAb to various liver and kidney proteins. Histological examination of liver samples showed tissue damages but without significant differences between the animals submitted to MHV + CCl(4) and controls, which were either infected by MHV without CCl(4), or poisoned by CCl(4) in the absence of MHV infection. Those results show that liver injury after viral infection may lead to the spreading of the immune response and to an increase of serum IgG, suggesting that the procedure used herein could simulate the onset of autoimmune hepatitis.","output":"The autoimmune response induced by mouse hepatitis virus A59 is expanded by a hepatotoxic agent"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemic of COVID-19 infection has affected most academic conferences.

The study assessed the status of HPSR domestic funding and advocacy strategies for improving HPSR funding in Nigeria. It equally explored the knowledge and perception of the domestic funding status of HPSR and the effect of capacity building on the knowledge of domestic funding for HPSR in Nigeria. METHODS: This was a sub-national study involving policymakers and researchers from Enugu and Ebonyi States in Southeast Nigeria who participated in the sub-national Health Systems Global convening for the African region. A before-after study design (workshop) was utilized. Data collection employed semi-structured questionnaires, group and panel discussions. The workshop facilitated knowledge of HPSR, funding processes, and advocacy strategies for increased domestic funding for HPSR. Pre and immediate post-workshop knowledge assessments were done. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25 and thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-six participants were involved in the study. Half were females (50.0%) and 46.2% were aged 35C44 years. Policymakers constituted 23.1% of the participants. Domestic funding for HPSR in Nigeria was adjudged to be grossly inadequate. Identified barriers to domestic funding of HPSR included bureaucratic bottlenecks, political and policy transitions, and corruption. Potential opportunities centered on existing policy documents and emerging private sector willingness to fund health research. Multi-stakeholder advocacy coalitions, continuous advocacy and researcher skill-building on advocacy with active private sector involvement were the strategies proffered by the participants. Pre-workshop, understanding of the meaning of HPSR had the highest mean ratings while knowledge of budgeting processes and use of legal action to enable opportunities for budget advocacy for HPSR funding had the lowest mean ratings. Following the capacity-building workshop, all knowledge and understanding parameters markedly improved (percentage increase of 12.5%C71.0%). CONCLUSION: This study found that there was paucity of domestic funding for HPSR in Nigeria alongside poor knowledge of budgeting and advocacy strategies among both policymakers and researchers. We recommend the deployment of these identified strategies and wider national and regional stakeholder engagement towards prioritizing and improving domestic funding for HPSR.","output":"Identifying advocacy strategies, challenges and opportunities for increasing domestic health policy and health systems research funding in Nigeria: Perspectives of researchers and policymakers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to study the antioxidant activity of Porphyra haitanensis polysaccharides and the effect of their structure on the antioxidant activity, the Porphyra haitanensis polysaccharide (PHP), prepared by hot water extraction and alcohol precipitation, was separated and purified by Cellulose DEAE-52 ion exchange and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography.

In this work, we argue that the assumptions traditionally made are not always based on solid arguments and sometimes they can be hardly justified. In light of this, we propose a modification of the Dixon and Coles (1997) model by relaxing the assumption of Poisson-distributed marginal variables and by introducing an innovative dependence structure. Specifically, we define the joint distribution of the number of goals scored during a match by means of thoroughly chosen marginal (Mar-) and conditional distributions (-Co). The resulting Mar-Co model is able to balance flexibility and conceptual simplicity. A real data application involving five European leagues suggests that the introduction of the novel dependence structure allows to capture and interpret fundamental league-specific dynamics. In terms of betting performance, the newly introduced Mar-Co model does not perform worse than the Dixon and Coles one in a traditional framework (i.e. 1-X-2 bet) and it outperforms the competing model when a more comprehensive dependence structure is needed (i.e. Under/Over 2.5 bet).","output":"Mar-Co: a new dependence structure to model match outcomes in football"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnosing melanocytic lesions is one of the most challenging areas of pathology with extensive intra- and inter-observer variability. The gold standard for a diagnosis of invasive melanoma is the examination of histopathological whole slide skin biopsy images by an experienced dermatopathologist. Digitized whole slide images offer novel opportunities for computer programs to improve the diagnostic performance of pathologists. In order to automatically classify such images, representations that reflect the content and context of the input images are needed. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-attention-based network to learn representations from digital whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions at multiple scales. Our model softly weighs representations from multiple scales, allowing it to discriminate between diagnosis-relevant and -irrelevant information automatically. Our experiments show that our method outperforms five other state-of-the-art whole slide image classification methods by a significant margin.

At our site, a Nurse Practitioner (NP) has been historically responsible for seeing patients post discharge in the Heart Failure Access Clinic (HFAC). Whether the addition of a clinical pharmacy specialist (CPS) to co-manage patients at the HFAC clinic leads to improved outcomes is not known. Therefore, we conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility and potential benefits of this integrated approach. Objective We evaluated 30-day heart failure readmission, emergency department (ED) visits, and all-cause mortality in post-discharge patients who were seen in our integrated CPS and NP pilot HFAC clinic. The clinic process and CPS interventions were also assessed. Methods Patients who were discharged from the hospital for ADHF were eligible for the pilot study if they had at least mild LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF 50%). In the integrated HFAC clinic, the NP determined patients volume and perfusion status, implemented a flexible diuretic plan, and set parameters for patients contacting the HF team. Responsibility for medication reconciliation, neurohormonal medication education, and dose optimization was shifted to the CPS. Descriptive statistics were used as appropriate. Results Between 11/18/2019 and 3/10/2020, 24 visits were conducted in the integrated clinic. Our patients were predominantly Caucasian (88%), male (96%), and elderly (mean age: 70  12 years). Most patients (75%) had LVEF 40%. The 30-day post-discharge readmission rate was 2/24 (8%), while both ED visits and all-cause mortality rates were 0%. Historically, veterans at our NP led HFAC clinic have had a 30-day readmission rate of 15.8% (data from 2019). The average time to appointment was 12  8 days post-discharge with 25% patients seen within 7 days. The mean duration of the CPS visit was 36 minutes; the NP visit was 41 minutes (n=12). The CPS noted medication discrepancies in 14/24 (58%), alerted other providers for medication issue follow-up in 10/24 (42%), and identified HF inappropriate medications in 3/24 (13%). HF medications were titrated by the CPS in 13/24 (54%), and 16/24 (67%) patients were scheduled with CPS for ongoing medication dose titration. One patient (4%) was referred for tobacco treatment. Conclusions Early analysis indicates that the integrated HFAC leads to high-quality patient care as evidenced by a very low 30-day hospital readmission rate without ED visits or fatality. These outcomes compare favorably to our institution's 30-day readmission rate observed prior to implementation of this pilot project. Potential benefits of adding a CPS as a provider to our HFAC include medication reconciliation and education, identification of harmful drugs, and timely medication titration. Further analysis is warranted to compare the impact of the integrated HFAC versus standard of care over a longer time frame.","output":"Integrated Nurse Practitioner and Pharmacist Post-discharge Heart Failure Clinic: Impact on Patient Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regulatory B cells restrict immune and inflammatory responses across a number of contexts This capacity is mediated primarily through the production of IL-10 Here we demonstrate that the induction of a regulatory program in human B cells is dependent on a metabolic priming event driven by cholesterol metabolism Synthesis of the metabolic intermediate geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) is required to specifically drive IL-10 production, and to attenuate Th1 responses Furthermore, GGPP-dependent protein modifications control signaling through PI3K?-AKT-GSK3, which in turn promote BLIMP1-dependent IL-10 production Inherited gene mutations in cholesterol metabolism result in a severe autoinflammatory syndrome termed mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) Consistent with our findings, B cells from MKD patients induce poor IL-10 responses and are functionally impaired Moreover, metabolic supplementation with GGPP is able to reverse this defect Collectively, our data define cholesterol metabolism as an integral metabolic pathway for the optimal functioning of human IL-10 producing regulatory B cells","output":"Cholesterol metabolism drives regulatory B cell IL-10 through provision of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Autopsy is an important tool for understanding the pathogenesis of diseases, including COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: On 15 April 2020, together with the German Society of Pathology and the Federal Association of German Pathologists, the German Registry of COVID-19 Autopsies (DeRegCOVID) was launched (www.DeRegCOVID.ukaachen.de). Building on this, the German Network for Autopsies in Pandemics (DEFEAT PANDEMIcs) was established on 1 September 2020. RESULTS: The main goal of DeRegCOVID is to collect and distribute de facto anonymized data on potentially all autopsies of people who have died from COVID-19 in Germany in order to meet the need for centralized, coordinated, and structured data collection and reporting during the pandemic. The success of the registry strongly depends on the willingness of the respective centers to report the data, which has developed very positively so far and requires special thanks to all participating centers. The rights to own data and biomaterials (stored decentrally) remain with each respective center. The DEFEAT PANDEMIcs network expands on this and aims to strengthen harmonization and standardization as well as nationwide implementation and cooperation in the field of pandemic autopsies.

OBJECTIVE: We present the analysis of a COVID-19 outbreak in a hemodialysis center in Belgium and report the incidence, clinical course, and outcome of the disease. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional cohort study. SETTING: A hemodialysis center during the COVID-19 outbreak. PATIENTS: A total of 62 patients on maintenance hemodialysis at a tertiary care center in Belgium attended by 26 health care workers. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline patients characteristics were retrieved. The incidence, clinical course, and outcome were reported. The differences between COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors were assessed along with the differences between COVID-19-hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. The incidence of the disease and outcome of health care workers were also reported. METHODS: Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact test and (2). The Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used to compare continuous variables. Univariate analysis and a binomial logistic regression were used to explore variables as predictors of death. RESULTS: Between March 6 and April 14, 2020, 40 of 62 (65%) patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome beta coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) along with 18 of 26 (69%) health care professionals. Twenty-five (63%) of the infected patients were hospitalized with a median time for hospitalization-to-discharge of 8 (interquartile range [IQR] = 4-12) days. Eleven (28%) COVID-19-related deaths were recorded with a median time for onset of symptoms-to-death of 9 (IQR = 5-14) days. Lymphocytopenia was prevalent among the cohort and was found in 9 of 11 (82%) reported deaths (P = .4). There was no influence of the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers on COVID-19-related deaths (P = .3).

For decades hypertension has disproportionately affected African Americans, who also have a higher burden of associated comorbidities including diabetes and heart failure. METHODS: Current literature including guideline reports and newer studies on hypertension in African Americans in PubMed were reviewed. We also reviewed newer publications on the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease. FINDINGS: While APOL1 has been theorized in the epidemiology of hypertension, the increased prevalence and associated risks are primarily due to environmental and lifestyle factors. These factors include poor diet, adverse lifestyle, and social determinants. Hypertension control can be achieved by lifestyle modifications such as low sodium diet, weight loss, and adequate physical activity. When lifestyle modifications alone do not adequately control hypertension, a common occurrence among African Americans who suffer with greater prevalence of resistant hypertension, pharmacological intervention is indicated. The efficacy of renal denervation, and the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 and aminopeptidase A inhibitors, have been studied for treatment of resistant hypertension.

However, it is not suitable as a monitoring tool for pregnant women because of the risk of ionizing radiation damage to the fetus as well as the possible infection of others. In this study, we explored the value of bedside lung ultrasound (LUS) as an alternative to CT for the detection and monitoring of lung involvement in pregnant women with COVID-19. METHODS: Clinical and LUS data of 39 pregnant women with COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed. All LUS and CT images were analyzed to summarize the findings and calculate LUS scores and CT scores for each patient. LUS findings were compared with CT, and correlation between LUS scores and CT scores was evaluated. RESULTS: Among the 39 pregnant women, there were 6 mild-type cases, 29 common-type cases, 4 severe-type cases, and no critical-type cases. The most common LUS findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were various grades of multiple B-lines (84.6%), thickened and irregular pleural lines (71.8%), pleural effusion (61.5%) and small multifocal consolidation limited to the subpleural space (35.9%). The mean LUS score at admission was 0 points in mild-type cases, 10.6 points in common-type cases and 15.3 points in severe-type cases (P < 0.01). The correlation between LUS scores and CT was 0.793. All patients were clinically cured and each underwent an average of three LUS follow-ups during hospitalization. The mean LUS score at discharge was 5.6 points lower than that at admission. The consistency of LUS and chest CT during follow-up was 0.652.

We assessed the association between chronic use of RAAS blockers and mortality among inpatients with COVID-19 and explored reasons for discrepancies in the literature. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included adult hypertensive patients from a prospective nationwide cohort of 3512 inpatients with COVID-19 up to June 30, 2020. Cox proportional hazard models with various adjustment or propensity weighting methods were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) of 30-day mortality for chronic users versus non-users of RAAS blockers. We analyzed data of 1160 hypertensive patients: 719 (62%) were male and 777 (67%) were older than 65 years. The main comorbidities were diabetes (n = 416, 36%), chronic cardiac disease (n = 401, 35%), and obesity (n = 340, 29%); 705 (61%) received oxygen therapy. We recorded 135 (11.6%) deaths within 30 days of diagnosis.

Taken over the entire year, an estimated 1,401,900 (95% credible interval 1,259,700-1,572,500) more people died in these 40 countries than would have been expected had the pandemic not taken place.

In Iceland, Australia and New Zealand, mortality was lower over this period than what would be expected if the pandemic had not occurred, while South Korea and Norway experienced no detectable change in mortality. In contrast, the populations of the USA, Czechia, Slovakia and Poland experienced at least 20% higher mortality. There was substantial heterogeneity across countries in the dynamics of excess mortality.

Results: The analysis revealed that older adults' level of intergenerational contact remained stable or even increased - rather than decreased - during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the overall positive outcome, some subgroups (i.e., older men, residents of nursing homes, less educated older adults and older adults living in countries with less stringent COVID19 measures) were more likely to report reduced intergenerational contact.

Here, we investigated the protective effect and mechanism of hypoxia-induced renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs)-derived exosomes on acute tubular injury. We found that in vitro hypoxia-induced tubular exosomes (Hy-EXOs) were protective in acute tubular injury by promoting TECs proliferation and improving mitochondrial functions. By using exosome miRNA sequencing, we identified miR-20a-5p was abundant and was a key mechanism for the protective effect of Hy-EXOs on tubular injury as up-regulation of miR-20a-5p enhanced but down regulation of miR-20a-5p inhibited the protective effect of Hy-EXOs on tubular injury under hypoxia conditions. Further study in a mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion induced acute kidney injury (IRI-AKI) also confirmed this notion as pre-treating mice with the miR-20a-5p agomir 48 hours prior to AKI induction was capable of inhibiting IRI-AKI by lowering serum levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen, and attenuating the severity of tubular necrosis, F4/80(+) macrophages infiltration and vascular rarefaction. Mechanistically, the protective effect of miR-20a-5p on AKI was associated with inhibition of TECs mitochondrial injury and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.

Many hospital laboratories in constrained resource settings such as Cambodia struggle to cope with the training needs of laboratory professionals in an environment of competing healthcare development priorities. Resource-limited countries need an adaptable and effective approach to provide laboratory professionals with job-specific quality oversight training to ensure the accuracy, timeliness, and reliability of diagnostic services. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we describe the results of an in-service training and mentoring program conducted with the Cambodia Ministry of Health at 12 tertiary-level hospital laboratories to drive improvements in laboratory quality management systems toward ISO 15189 accreditation, which demonstrated significant progress between baseline and outcome audits in a concurrent study. This case study describes the program, and evaluates how the four primary activities, including actionable gap assessments and planning, centralized and in situ training curriculum, in-person mentoring, and remote tele-mentoring via video communication technologies, contributed towards quality improvement in the participating laboratories. We evaluated participant responses to Likert scale and free response questions from program and training evaluation surveys, and we used thematic analysis to develop a model of best practices within the programs four primary activities to inform future training approaches. Of these activities, participants agreed most highly that in-person visits and planning based on gap assessments contributed to their learning and ability to improve laboratory operations. Tele-mentoring was rated lowest by participants, who were critical of excessive group dialogue and distraction during web-conferencing; however, feedback suggests both in-person and remote mentoring contribute to continuing education, accountability to action, and peer collaboration and problem solving to improve workforce efforts toward improved quality management systems.

In Asia, from the first outbreak in August 2018 until the end of November 2021, ASF has been reported in 16 Asian countries. The ASF virus (ASFV) circulation in domestic pigs is considered the main problem in Asia. On the other hand, there are very few reports of ASF in wild boar in this region. However, considering the high wild boar density within the same area of smallholder domestic pig farms in Asia, the occurrence of ASFV infection in wild boar may be underestimated. The role of the wild boar in other ASF epidemiological scenarios, such as Europe, is a key for the maintenance and transmission of the disease. Hence, we performed a preliminary study estimating the extent of ASFV infection in the Asian wild boar population. The potential risk area of ASF-infected wild boar was calculated based on the habitat suitability for wild boar, the kernel density of ASF notification in smallholder farms and wild boar, and the ASFV transmission rate of wild boar. As a result of the analysis, high-, medium-, and low-risk areas were identified throughout Southeast and East Asia. The highest risk area was detected in China, followed by Myanmar, Far East Russia, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and the Philippines.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted during 1 AprilC 30 May 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak in Vietnam. Data was collected via an online survey using Google survey tool. A convenient sampling approach was employed, with participants being sorted into three groups: people who were in government quarantine facilities; people who were under self-isolation at their own place; and the general population who did not need enforced quarantine. The Vietnamese EQ-5D-5L instrument was used to measure HRQOL. Differences in HRQOL among people of isolation groups and their socio-demographic characteristics were statistically tested. RESULTS: A final sample was made of 406 people, including 10 persons from government quarantine facilities, 57 persons under self-isolation at private places, and the rest were the general population. The mean EQ-VAS was reported the highest at 90.5 (SD: 7.98) among people in government quarantine facilities, followed by 88.54 (SD: 12.24) among general population and 86.54 (SD 13.69) among people in self-isolation group. The EQ-5D-5L value was reported the highest among general population at 0.95 (SD: 0.07), followed by 0.94 (SD: 0.12) among people in government quarantine facilities, and 0.93 (SD: 0.13) among people who did self-isolation. Overall, most people, at any level, reported having problems with anxiety and/or depression in all groups. CONCLUSION: While there have been some worries and debates on implementing strict quarantine measures can hinder peoples quality of life, Vietnam showed an opposite tendency in peoples HRQOL even under the highest level of enforcement in the prevention and control of COVID-19.","output":"Health-related quality of life of the Vietnamese during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus behavior and possible risk factors implicated in poor outcome has become an urgent need.

Risk of bias of the included studies ranged from moderate to critical. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity among them precluded meta-analyses. Most of the included studies showed some degree of association to: (a) higher BMI and worse clinical presentation and (b) obesity and need of hospitalization. The results were inconsistent about the impact of obesity on mortality. Based on limited methodological quality studies, obesity seems to predict poor clinical evolution in patients with COVID-19. Further studies with appropriate prospective design are needed to reduce the uncertainty on this evidence.","output":"Body Mass Index and Prognosis of COVID-19 Infection.

Furthermore, immunized chickens showed no clinical symptoms or histopathological changes in the FAdV-4-targeted liver, and the viral load in the tissues of immunized chickens was significantly lower than that of chickens in the challenge control group.

This study builds on our prior study based on the scientific premise that YouTube is one of the most effective ways to communicate and mobilize the public in community mitigation to reduce exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). OBJECTIVE: Because of the rapidly changing nature of YouTube in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a follow-up study to document how coverage of preventive behaviors for effective community mitigation has changed. METHODS: A successive sampling design was used to compare coverage of behaviors to mitigate community transmission of COVID-19 in the 100 most widely viewed YouTube videos in January 2020 and March 2020. RESULTS: Videos in the January and March samples were viewed >125 million times and >355 million times, respectively. Fewer than half of the videos in either sample covered any of the prevention behaviors recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but many covered key prevention behaviors and were very widely viewed. There were no videos uploaded by entertainment television in the January sample, but this source comprised the majority of videos and garnered the majority of cumulative views in the March sample. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the incredible reach of YouTube and the potential value of partnership with the entertainment industry for communicating and mobilizing the public about community mitigation to reduce mortality from the COVID-19 viral pandemic.","output":"The Role of YouTube and the Entertainment Industry in Saving Lives by Educating and Mobilizing the Public to Adopt Behaviors for Community Mitigation of COVID-19: Successive Sampling Design Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O Informe Dirio de Evidncias  uma produo do Ministrio da Sade que tem como objetivo acompanhar diariamente as publicaes cientficas sobre tratamento farmacolgico e vacinas para a COVID-19 Dessa forma, s?o realizadas buscas estruturadas em bases de dados biomdicas, referente ao dia anterior desse informe N?o s?o includos estudos pr-clnicos (in vitro, in vivo, in silico) A frequncia dos estudos  demonstrada de acordo com a sua classificao metodolgica (revis?es sistemticas, ensaios clnicos randomizados, coortes, entre outros) Para cada estudo  apresentado um resumo com avaliao da qualidade metodolgica Essa avaliao tem por finalidade identificar o grau de certeza/confian?a ou o risco de vis de cada estudo Para tal, s?o utilizadas ferramentas j validadas e consagradas na literatura cientfica, na rea de sade baseada em evidncias Cabe ressaltar que o documento tem carter informativo e n?o representa uma recomendao oficial do Ministrio da Sade sobre a temtica Foram encontrados 17 artigos","output":"Informe dirio de evidncias COVID-19: busca realizada em 7 de julho de 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose or Objective Since the beginning of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), there is a compelling reason for the use of hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) schedules in cancer management to safeguard the patients and the treating physicians. However, conflicting data shows that young breast cancer (BC) patients have a higher locoregional relapse after breast-conservative surgery (BCS). Given this, we aim to compare the locoregional control between conventional radiotherapy (CRT) and HFRT after BCS in a cohort of young BC patients. Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed stage I-III BC patients in two centers diagnosed between 2008 and 2017 who underwent BCS and had follow-up data. Patients were categorized into two groups: CRT (50Gy in 25 fractions) vs. HFRT (40.5 - 42.5 Gy in 15-16 fractions). Boost was added to all patients. Results 247 patients were included in this analysis. Among them, 87 (35%) received CRT, while 160 (65%) were treated by HFRT. The clinicopathological characteristics of CRT vs. HFRT were as follows: The majority of the patients were T1 and T2, 92% in CRT vs. 94% in HFRT. N3 was rare in both groups, 8.3% vs. 5.1% in CRT vs. HFRT, respectively. The CRT had more stage 3 patients than HFRT, 35% vs. 23% respectively, but fewer stage 1 (18.1 vs. 23.5%, respectively). Estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) positive was 79.5% vs. 76.7%, HER2 enriched was 7% vs. 5%, while high Ki-67 was 56.3% vs. 71.4% in CRT vs. HFRT, respectively. Lymphovascular invasion was positive in 52.7% of CRT vs. 64.3% in HFRT, while the extracapsular extension was positive in 31% of CRT vs. 19.4% in HFRT. The distribution of tumor grades was similar across the groups. After a median follow up of 42 months (range: 5-135), 10% of the total 247 patients developed locoregional recurrences:13.8% (n=12) were in CRT group, whereas 8.1% (n=13) in HFRT, p = 0.158;the HFRT group had insignificant lower locoregional recurrences. In univariate and multivariate analysis, only very young age was an independent poor prognostic factor for locoregional failure. Conclusion We found no significant differences in locoregional control between CRT and the HFRT following BCS among young BC patients. In this COVID-19 pandemic, HFRT should also be considered in young BC patients to shorten the treatment time.","output":"Local control in hypofractionated RT after breast-conservative surgery among young Egyptian patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to describe the experience of transforming the Clinical Department of Adult, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of the University Hospital in Krakow (CDACAP) into award designated by the Malopolska Voivod to provide the treatment for mentally ill adults from Malopolska Voivodship and adolescents from the south of Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss sequent stages of transformation, practical solutions and difficulties encountered in the process. 9 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were hospitalized in the CDACAP between 09.04 and 29.05.2020, and 97 were tended to by consulting psychiatrists in the main building of the University Hospital in Krakow between 23.03 and 23.05.2020.

M. abscessus displays high intrinsic resistance to common antibiotics and inducible resistance to macrolides like clarithromycin. As such, M. abscessus is clinically resistant to the entire regimen of front-line M. tuberculosis drugs, and treatment with antibiotics that do inhibit M. abscessus in the lab results in cure rates of 50% or less. Here, we identified epetraborole (EPT) from the MMV pandemic response box as an inhibitor against the essential protein leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) in M. abscessus. EPT protected zebrafish from lethal M. abscessus infection and did not induce self-resistance nor against clarithromycin. Contrary to most antimycobacterials, the whole-cell activity of EPT was greater against M. abscessus than M. tuberculosis, but crystallographic and equilibrium binding data showed that EPT binds LeuRS(Mabs) and LeuRS(Mtb) with similar residues and dissociation constants. Since EPT-resistant M. abscessus mutants lost LeuRS editing activity, these mutants became susceptible to misaminoacylation with leucine mimics like the non-proteinogenic amino acid norvaline. Proteomic analysis revealed that when M. abscessus LeuRS mutants were fed norvaline, leucine residues in proteins were replaced by norvaline, inducing the unfolded protein response with temporal changes in expression of GroEL chaperonins and Clp proteases. This supports our in vitro data that supplementation of media with norvaline reduced the emergence of EPT mutants in both M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis. Furthermore, the combination of EPT and norvaline had improved in vivo efficacy compared to EPT in a murine model of M. abscessus infection. Our results emphasize the effectiveness of EPT against the clinically relevant cystic fibrosis pathogen M. abscessus, and these findings also suggest norvaline adjunct therapy with EPT could be beneficial for M. abscessus and other mycobacterial infections like tuberculosis.","output":"Efficacy of epetraborole against Mycobacterium abscessus is increased with norvaline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION/AIM: This retrospective study aimed to quantify the changes in motor function in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) due to the government\\\\imposed travel restrictions associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic.

Methods: Point seroprevalence study of nursing homes to describe the demography and characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive residents and staff. Results: Clinical information and blood samples were available for 9,332 residents (mean age 86.7  8.1 years, 76.4% women) and 10,614 staff (mean age 45.6  11.5, 86.2% women). Up to 84.4% of residents had frailty, 84.9% co-morbidity and 69.3% cognitive impairment; 65.2% of workers were health-aides. COVID-19 seroprevalence was 55.4% (95% CI, 54.4C56.4) for older adults and 31.5% (30.6C32.4) for staff. In multivariable analysis frailty of residents was related with seropositivity (OR: 1.19, p = 0.02).

Comprehensive data, including clinical and biological parameters, were recorded at admission. Focused TTE was performed during hospitalization, according to clinical indication. Patients were followed for a primary composite outcome of death or transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) during hospitalization. Among 2878 patients, 445 (15%) underwent TTE. Most of these had cardiovascular risk factors, a history of cardiovascular disease, and were on cardiovascular treatments. Dilatation and dysfunction were observed in, respectively, 12% (48/412) and 23% (102/442) of patients for the left ventricle, and in 12% (47/407) and 16% (65/402) for the right ventricle (RV). Primary composite outcome occurred in 44% (n = 196) of patients [9% (n = 42) for death without ICU transfer and 35% (n = 154) for admission to ICU].

Using three-dimensional NMR spectra, molecular dynamics simulations, and alanine mutations, we identified that the interaction network between pT69/pS70 and R106/R109 residues prevents the phosphorylation sites from exposure to phosphatase and subsequent dephosphorylation. A Bcl-2-dephosphorylation probe, S1-6e, was designed by installing a carboxylic acid group to a Bcl-2 inhibitor. The carboxyl group competitively disrupts the interaction network between R106/R109 and pT69/pS70 and subsequently facilitates Bcl-2 dephosphorylation in living cells. As a result, S1-6e manifests a more effective apoptosis induction in pBcl-2-dependent cancer cells than other inhibitors exhibiting a similar binding affinity for Bcl-2. We believe that targeting the allosteric pathways interconnecting the core-functional domain and the phosphorylation site can be a general strategy for a rational design of site-specific dephosphorylating probes, since the allosteric pathway has been discovered in a variety of proteins.","output":"Targeting the Allosteric Pathway That Interconnects the Core-Functional Scaffold and the Distal Phosphorylation Sites for Specific Dephosphorylation of Bcl-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article summarizes the conclusion of a two-days interprofessional online workshop held under the auspices of the Brocher Foundation.

ResultsAmong total participants (mean age, 43.7 years), 51% were women. BG-Ag-RDTs showed high sensitivity (97.8%, [95% CI, 88.4% to 99.6%]) and specificity (100%, [95% CI, 96.3% to 100%) in 45 patients within 6 days of illness and could detect all cases of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants. In 11 asymptomatic early-stage cases, both BG-Ag-RDTs and BG-RT-PCR showed excellent sensitivity and specificity of 100% (95% CI, 74.1% to 100% and 95% CI, 20.7% to 100%, respectively). The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and truncated canavalin, an active ingredient from bean extract (BE) and the ultrastructural features of SARS-CoV-2 particles coated with BE were observed. The detachment of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain from hACE2 increased as the BE concentration increased, allowing the release of the virus from hACE2 for early diagnosis. Conclusions and RelevanceUsing BG-based saliva remarkably enhances the Ag-RDT diagnostic performance as an alternative to NPS and enables rapid and accurate COVID-19 self-testing and mass screening, supporting efficient COVID-19 management.

The National Strategy on Suicide Prevention, coordinated by the public-private Action Alliance, was most recently updated in 2012. In early 2021, the Surgeon General's office released a Call to Action to fully implement the national strategy. Six core types of actions to prevent suicide include adopting a broad public health approach, addressing upstream factors including social determinants of health, reducing access to multiple forms of lethal means, adopting evidence-based care for persons at risk, enhancing crisis care and care transitions, and improving the quality and use of suicide-related data. From 1999 through 2018, suicide rates in the U.S. increased by approximately one-third, and suicide had become the tenth leading cause of death. While most recent national data indicate a small reduction in the suicide rate, decreases were not seen across all demographic groups. Population groups which may require special emphasis or outreach efforts include adolescents, working age adults, military veterans, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives. Increases in social isolation, mental distress, and economic hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic indicate clear needs to address the full spectrum of suicidal behavior.

The EDI has not been independently evaluated, and other proprietary models have been shown to be biased against vulnerable populations. Objectives: To independently evaluate the EDI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 overall and in disproportionately affected subgroups. Methods: We studied adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to units other than the intensive care unit at a large academic medical center from March 9 through May 20, 2020. We used the EDI, calculated at 15-minute intervals, to predict a composite outcome of intensive care unitClevel care, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death. In a subset of patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours, we also evaluated the ability of the EDI to identify patients at low risk of experiencing this composite outcome during their remaining hospitalization. Results: Among 392 COVID-19 hospitalizations meeting inclusion criteria, 103 (26%) met the composite outcome. The median age of the cohort was 64 (interquartile range, 53C75) with 168 (43%) Black patients and 169 (43%) women. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the EDI was 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.74C0.84). EDI predictions did not differ by race or sex. When exploring clinically relevant thresholds of the EDI, we found patients who met or exceeded an EDI of 68.8 made up 14% of the study cohort and had a 74% probability of experiencing the composite outcome during their hospitalization with a sensitivity of 39% and a median lead time of 24 hours from when this threshold was first exceeded. Among the 286 patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours who had not experienced the composite outcome, 14 (13%) never exceeded an EDI of 37.9, with a negative predictive value of 90% and a sensitivity above this threshold of 91%. Conclusions: We found the EDI identifies small subsets of high-risk and low-risk patients with COVID-19 with good discrimination, although its clinical use as an early warning system is limited by low sensitivity. These findings highlight the importance of independent evaluation of proprietary models before widespread operational use among patients with COVID-19.","output":"Evaluating a Widely Implemented Proprietary Deterioration Index Model among Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the marked variation in seasonally-induced cutaneous synthesis, habitually low dietary vitamin D intakes (2C4g/day) and the generally low uptake of supplementation at the population level, identification of alternative food-based strategies are urgently warranted.

Through measuring electrical and thermal transport across point contacts between silver nanowires, we report that L significantly deviates from the Sommerfeld value by up to 5.2 times and exhibits nonmonotonic variation with temperature.

Since 2003 MBDS has pioneered a unique model for local cross-border cooperation. This study examines stakeholders perspectives of these MBDS experiences, based on a survey of local managers and semi-structured interviews with MBDS leaders and the central coordinator. RESULTS: Fifteen managers from 12 of 20 paired cross-border sites completed a written survey. They all monitor most or all of the 17 diseases agreed upon for MBDS surveillance information sharing. Fourteen agreed or strongly agreed with statements about the core MBDS values of cooperation, mutual trust, and transparency, and their own contributions to national and regional disease control (average score of 4.4 of 5.0). Respondents felt they implemented well to very well activities related to surveillance reporting (average scores 3.4 to 3.9 of 4.0), using computers for their work (3.9/4.0), and using surveillance data for action (3.8/4.0). Respondents reported that they did worst in implementing research (2.1/4.0) and somewhat poorly for local laboratory testing (2.9/4.0) and local coordination with cross-border counterparts (2.9/4.0), although all 15 maintain a list with contact information for these counterparts and many know their counterparts. Implementation of specified activities within their collective regional action plan was uneven across the cross-border sites. Most respondents reported positive lessons learned about local cooperation, information sharing and joint problem solving, based on trusting relationships with their cross-border counterparts. They recommend expansion of cross-border sites within MBDS and consideration of the cross-border cooperation model by other sub-regional networks. CONCLUSIONS: MBDS has over a decade of experience with its model of local cross-border cooperation in disease surveillance and control. Frontline managers have documented success with this model, strongly support it and recommend its expansion within and beyond the MBDS network.

At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, optimization of quarantine regimes becomes paramount for public health, societal well-being, and global economy. However, biological factors that determine the duration of the virus incubation period remain poorly understood. RESULTS: We demonstrate a strong positive correlation between the length of the incubation period and disease severity for a wide range of human pathogenic viruses. Using a machine learning approach, we develop a predictive model that accurately estimates, solely from several virus genome features, in particular, the number of protein-coding genes and the GC content, the incubation time ranges for diverse human pathogenic RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2. The predictive approach described here can directly help in establishing the appropriate quarantine durations and thus facilitate controlling future outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: The length of the incubation period in viral diseases strongly correlates with disease severity, emphasizing the biological and epidemiological importance of the incubation period. Perhaps, surprisingly, incubation times of pathogenic RNA viruses can be accurately predicted solely from generic features of virus genomes.

The area under the ROC curve was 0.751, standard error was 0.035, and 95% CI (0.683, 0.819) suggested that USG was of moderate predictive value in the diagnosis of VVS. As cut-off value of USG was 1.0185, the sensitivity and specificity and diagnostic coincidence rate of VVS were 74.39, 66.04 and 69.68%, respectively. CONCLUSION: There are less USG in children and adolescents with VVS, especially lower USG in females. Therefore, USG has predictive value in the diagnosis of VVS in children and adolescents.","output":"The predictive value of urine specific gravity in the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope in children and adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Current studies suggest improved survival in patients with severe functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) treated successfully with the MitraClip (MC) compared to medical treatment alone, in addition to a significant reduction of FMR severity.

However, whether this beneficial effect of CS also translates into a survival benefit comparable to the MC system has not been investigated so far. The aim of the study was to compare the course of FMR grade and mortality after MC or CS in a retrospective, non-randomized, single-center analysis. Material and methods A hundred and fifty-four patients with symptomatic FMR 2+ were included in this study (MC: n = 117, CS: n = 37). Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between groups. Results and conclusions Initially, the degree of FMR was reduced in the MC group from 2.9 0.3 to 1.7 0.7 and from 2.7 0.5 to 2.1 0.7 in the CS group, p within and between groups < 0.01. Within 6 months, FMR remained reduced in the MC group (1.83 0.6) and CS group (2.1 0.7). One-year survival was 34.8% in the MC group and 54.8% in the CS group (p = 0.663).

Reconfiguration of services during the pandemic may negatively affect medical and obstetric care. We aimed to examine the impacts on IBD antenatal care and pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective data were recorded in consecutive patients attending for IBD antenatal care including outpatient appointments, infusion unit visits and advice line encounters. RESULTS: We included 244 pregnant women with IBD, of which 75 (30.7%) were on biologics in whom the treatment was stopped in 29.3% at a median 28 weeks gestation. In addition, 9% of patients were on corticosteroids and 21.5% continued on thiopurines. The care provided during 460 patient encounters was not affected by the pandemic in 94.1% but 68.2% were performed via telephone (compared with 3% prepandemic practice; p<0.0001). One-hundred-ten women delivered 111 alive babies (mean 38.2 weeks gestation, mean birth weight 3324 g) with 12 (11.0%) giving birth before week 37. Birth occurred by vaginal delivery in 72 (56.4%) and by caesarean section in 48 (43.6%) cases. Thirty-three were elective (12 for IBD indications) and 15 emergency caesarean sections. Breast feeding rates were low (38.6%). Among 244 pregnant women with IBD, 1 suspected COVID-19 infection was recorded.

The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter. RESULTS: Of 5 424 688 inpatient encounters among 3 372 839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2 823 748 [52.1%] boys; 3 171 224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213 571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23 798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43 550 [42 110-43 946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4 327 580 511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5 983 142 102 [$5 762 690 022-$6 324 978 456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions.

METHOD: We conducted an anonymous online survey among 728 nursing students. The questionnaire collected data on demographic and academic characteristics, health status, vaccine attitudes, and specific reasons regarding the intention to get or not get the COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 422 nursing students completed the survey. Almost 81% of participants wanted to take the vaccine against coronavirus. The intention to adhere to the vaccination program was associated with male gender, a previous flu vaccine uptake, and high school education. The main reason in favor of taking the vaccine was to protect family and friends. The main reason for opposition was the fear of adverse events.

COVID-19 patients receiving steroids should be considered a putative risk group of invasive aspergillosis. Case report: We are reporting a SARS-CoV-2/Aspergillus section Fumigati coinfection in an elderly intubated patient with a history of pulmonary embolism treated with corticosteroids. The diagnosis was made following the ad hoc definitions described for patients admitted to ICU with severe influenza, including clinical criteria (fever for 3 days refractory to the appropriate antibiotic therapy, dyspnea, pleural friction rub, worsening of respiratory status despite antibiotic therapy and need of ventilator support), a radiological criterion (pulmonary infiltrate) and a mycological criterion (several positive galactomannan tests on serum with ratio 0.5). In addition, Aspergillus section Fumigati DNA was found in serum and blood samples. These tests were positive 4 weeks after the patient was admitted to the ICU. The patient received voriconazole and after two month in ICU his respiratory status improved; he was discharged after 6 weeks of antifungal treatment.

These vulnerabilities are the result of the interaction between individual and structural factors that shape how risk is experienced by disabled people. In Australia, these vulnerabilities are influenced by the way disability services and care for disabled people are delivered through a consumer-directed approach. We analysed the policies and documentation made by the Australian Government and state and territory governments during the pandemic to explore whether these were disability-inclusive. We aimed to unpack how these policies shaped disabled people as vulnerable citizens. METHODS: Guided by documentary research, we used framework analysis to examine the policies of the Australian Government and state and territory governments. We analysed legislation that was given royal assent by the federal, state and territory governments, and documents (reports, fact sheets, guidance documents, etc.) published by the federal government and the state of Victoria (given that this state experienced the brunt of the epidemic in Australia) between February 2020 to August of 2020. RESULTS: We found that most of the resources were not aimed at disabled people, but at carers and workers within disability services. In addition, most policies formulated by the Australian Government were related to the expansion of welfare services and the creation of economic stimulus schemes. However, while the stimulus included unemployed people, the expansion of benefits explicitly excluded disabled people who were not employed. Most of the legislation and documents offered accessibility options, though most of these options were only available in English. Disability oriented agencies offered more extensive accessibility options. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate a large number of documents addressing the needs of disabled people. However, disability-inclusiveness appeared to be inconsistent and not fully considered, leaving disabled people exposed to greater risk of COVID-19. Neoliberal policies in the health and welfare sector in Australia have led to an individualisation of the responsibility to remain healthy and a reliance on people as independent consumers. Governments need to take a clear stance towards the emergence of such a discourse that actively disvalues disabled people.

During New Normal, activities can still run by implementing health protocols by requiring masks to be worn. Currently, the detection of masks is still done manually by security officers because of the fatigue factor, so that human errors often occur.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate adverse outcomes associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnancy and to describe clinical management, disease progression, hospital admission, placental abnormalities, and neonatal outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational cohort study of maternal and neonatal outcomes among delivered women with and without SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy was conducted from March 18 through August 22, 2020, at Parkland Health and Hospital System (Dallas, Texas), a high-volume prenatal clinic system and public maternity hospital with widespread access to SARS-CoV-2 testing in outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient settings. Women were included if they were tested for SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and delivered. For placental analysis, the pathologist was blinded to illness severity. EXPOSURES: SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of preterm birth, preeclampsia with severe features, or cesarean delivery for abnormal fetal heart rate among women delivered after 20 weeks of gestation. Maternal illness severity, neonatal infection, and placental abnormalities were described. RESULTS: From March 18 through August 22, 2020, 3374 pregnant women (mean [SD] age, 27.6 [6] years) tested for SARS-CoV-2 were delivered, including 252 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 3122 who tested negative. The cohort included 2520 Hispanic (75%), 619 Black (18%), and 125 White (4%) women. There were no differences in age, parity, body mass index, or diabetes among women with or without SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was more common among Hispanic women (230 [91%] positive vs 2290 [73%] negative; difference, 17.9%; 95% CI, 12.3%-23.5%; P < .001). There was no difference in the composite primary outcome (52 women [21%] vs 684 women [23%]; relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.73-1.21; P = .64).

Thus, it is critical to investigate and predict the putative mutations of RBD that escape neutralizing immune responses. Here, we employed computational analyses to comprehensively investigate the mutational effects of RBD on binding to neutralizing antibodies and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and demonstrated that the RBD residues K417, L452, L455, F456, E484, G485, F486, F490, Q493, and S494 were consistent with clinically emerging variants or experimental observations of attenuated neutralizations.

This study aims to evaluate whether DN is suitable for cardioplegia in complex and high-risk valve surgery with long-term cardiac ischemia when compared with HTK. METHODS: The perioperative records of adult patients infused with DN/HTK as a cardioplegic solution who underwent complex valve surgery with an expected myocardial ischaemic duration longer than 90 min between Oct 2018 and Oct 2019 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of the 160 patients who received DN/HTK and underwent complex valve surgery, we propensity matched 73 pairs. Both groups achieved satisfactory cardiac arrest effects, and no significant difference was found in their cTnI and CK-MB levels within 12 to 72 h postoperatively. The DN group had a higher rate of return to spontaneous rhythm (0.88 v 0.52, P < 0.001), a lower frequency of postoperative severe arrythmias (12% v 26%, P = 0.036), a higher postoperative stroke volume (65 v 59 ml, P = 0.011) and a higher cardiac output (6.0 v 4.9 L/min, P = 0.007) as evaluated by echocardiography, fewer transfusions and shorter ICU stays (both P < 0.05). The two groups had similar inotrope usage and similar incidences of low cardiac output, morbidities and mortality. Subgroup analysis showed that when the aortic clamping time was greater than 120 min, the advantages of DN were weakened.

Besides, many efforts have been made to find a safe way to prevent and vaccinate people against COVID-19 disease. In severe cases, patients suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome usually associated with an increased level of inflammatory cytokines, called a cytokine storm. It seems that reequilibrating the hyperinflammatory response of the host immune system and regeneration of damaged cells could be the main way to manage the disease. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been recently under investigation in this regard, and the achieved clinical outcomes show promising evidence for stem cell-based therapy of COVID-19. MSCs are known for their potential for immunomodulation, defense against virus infection, and tissue regeneration.

The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 that produced a severe lung disease in afflicted patients in China and other countries was the reason for the incredible attention paid toward this viral infection. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on TMPRSS2 activity for entrance and subsequent infection of the host cells and TMPRSS2 is a host cell molecule that is important for the spread of viruses such as coronaviruses. Different factors can increase the risk of prostate cancer, including older age, a family history of the disease. Androgen receptor (AR) initiates a transcriptional cascade which plays a serious role in both normal and malignant prostate tissues. TMPRSS2 protein is highly expressed in prostate secretory epithelial cells, and its expression is dependent on androgen signals. One of the molecular signs of prostate cancer is TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion. In TMPRSS2-ERG-positive prostate cancers different patterns of changed gene expression can be detected.

A high degree of consensus was found for temporarily suspending nonurgent transplant procedures and living donation programs. Systematic polymerase chain reaction\\\\based testing of donors and recipients was broadly recommended. Additionally, more specific aspects (eg, screening of surgical explant teams and restricted use of marginal donor organs) were included in our analysis.

In an MCDM challenge, a competent supply chain pricing considerations solutions supplier considers multiple possibly competing for qualitative and quantitative criteria. This study presented a new extended decision-making and FBWM method based on type-2 fuzzy sets TOPSIS for ranking the corporate social responsibility criteria based on competitive supply chain pricing factors. The aim of the ranking is to learn how a company and its supply chain may accomplish joint-optimization of economic, environmental, and social performance by transparently and strategically integrating sustainability into business operations. To verify the efficacy of the suggested strategy, it is compared to a benchmarking model. IT2F VIKOR is the subject of this benchmarking model. The significance weights of the competitive supply chain pricing selection criterion are determined from BWM for both techniques. The results show that the most probable dimension of social responsibility in knowledge-based businesses in the oil sector, according to the research, is the environmental dimension in social responsibility, which may produce competitive supply chain pricing mechanisms based on profitability. Other findings revealed that the elements of competitive supply chain pricing factors in oil companies regarding social responsibility are ranked as follows: customer, product, and competitive supply chain pricing procedures. As a result, maintaining customer values is a major price element in establishing contacts, based on the companys strategic connection with the economy and regional and worldwide partners.","output":"Developing a New Interval Type-2 Hesitant Fuzzy TOPSIS-Based Fuzzy Best-Worst Multicriteria Decision-Making Method for Competitive Pricing in Supply Chain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Relatively little is known about the characteristics of people living in the community who have previously self-harmed and may benefit from interventions during and after COVID-19. We therefore aimed to: (a) examine the relationship between reported self-harm and COVID-19-related fear, and (b) describe the characteristics of a community sample of people who reported a lifetime history of self-harm. METHODS: A cross-sectional national online survey of UK adults who reported a lifetime history of self-harm (n = 1029) was conducted. Data were collected May C June 2020. Main outcomes were self-reported COVID-19-related fear (based on the Fear of COVID-19 scale [FCV-19S]), lifetime history of COVID-19, and lifetime history of self-harm. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. Chi-square was used to compare characteristics of our sample with available national data. RESULTS: Overall, 75.1, 40.2 and 74.3% of the total sample reported lifetime suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts and non-suicidal self-harm respectively. When adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, social grade, and exposure to death and suicide, binary logistic regression showed higher levels of perceived symptomatic (or physiological) reactions to COVID-19 were associated with suicidal ideation (OR = 1.22, 95%CI 1.07, 1.39) and suicidal attempts (OR = 3.91, 95%CI 1.18, 12.96) in the past week. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest an urgent need to consider the impact of COVID-19 on people with a lifetime history of self-harm when designing interventions to help support people in reducing suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts. Experiencing symptomatic reactions of fear in particular is associated with self-harm. Helping to support people to develop coping plans in response to threat-related fear is likely to help people at risk of repeat self-harm during public health emergencies.","output":"The association between COVID-19-related fear and reported self-harm in a national survey of people with a lifetime history of self-harm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For a searchable version of these abstracts, please visit www.acrabstracts.org.","output":"ACR Convergence 2020 Abstract Supplement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to evaluate eyecare needs along with ocular findings in patients treated in intensive care units because of Covid\\\\19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 93 patients, 58 men and 35 women, who were under follow\\\\up and treatment in intensive care because of COVID\\\\19 infection from 1 January 2021 to 15 February 2021 were included in the study. Detailed eye examinations of the patients were performed with a portable handheld biomicroscope, direct and indirect ophthalmoscope. Cases requiring treatment for eye diseases were identified and treated. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 68.32  9.97 years; 35 patients were followed up and treated with non\\\\invasive mechanical ventilation and 58 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation support. Mild, moderate, and severe chemosis was observed in 19 patients (20.4%), 10 patients (10.8%) and 4 patients (4.3%), respectively. Conjunctivitis (8.6%) was observed in eight patients. Corneal abrasion was present in seven patients (7.5%). Keratitis secondary to exposure keratopathy was observed in one patient. Eye care and medical treatment were initiated for these patients. We noted eight patients (8.6%) with retinal haemorrhage; however, to the best of our knowledge, these patients may show acute retinal involvement secondary to systemic diseases or have previous retinal findings other than Covid\\\\19 infection or treatments.

They also reviewed the dental literature for representative studies of contamination from various dental procedures and methods of reducing airborne contamination from those procedures. RESULTS: The airborne spread of measles, tuberculosis and SARS is well-documented in the medical literature. The dental literature shows that many dental procedures produce aerosols and droplets that are contaminated with bacteria and blood. These aerosols represent a potential route for disease transmission. The literature also documents that airborne contamination can be minimized easily and inexpensively by layering several infection control steps into the routine precautions used during all dental procedures.

This relationship might differ for the recently emerged B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Here we use data from an outbreak in Sydney, Australia that commenced in winter and time-series analysis to investigate the association between reported cases and temperature and relative humidity. METHODS: Between 16 June and 10 September 2021, the peak of the outbreak, there were 31,662 locally-acquired cases reported in five local health districts of Sydney, Australia. The associations between daily 9:00 am and 3:00 pm temperature (C), relative humidity (%) and their difference, and a time series of reported daily cases were assessed using univariable and multivariable generalized additive models and a 14-day exponential moving average. Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the likelihood ratio statistic were used to compare different models and determine the best fitting model. A sensitivity analysis was performed by modifying the exponential moving average. RESULTS: During the 87-day time-series, relative humidity ranged widely (< 30C98%) and temperatures were mild (approximately 11C17 C). The best-fitting (AIC: 1,119.64) generalized additive model included 14-day exponential moving averages of 9:00 am temperature (P < 0.001) and 9:00 am relative humidity (P < 0.001), and the interaction between these two weather variables (P < 0.001). Humidity was negatively associated with cases no matter whether temperature was high or low. The effect of lower relative humidity on increased cases was more pronounced below relative humidity of about 70%; below this threshold, not only were the effects of humidity pronounced but also the relationship between temperature and cases of the delta variant becomes apparent. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the control of COVID-19 outbreaks, specifically those due to the delta variant, is particularly challenging during periods of the year with lower relative humidity and warmer temperatures. In addition to vaccination, stronger implementation of other interventions such as mask-wearing and social distancing might need to be considered during these higher risk periods.

RESULTS: The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death. Older age, diabetes and other comorbidities are reported as significant predictors of morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation, increased coagulation activity, immune response impairment, and potential direct pancreatic damage by SARS-CoV-2 might be among the underlying mechanisms of the association between diabetes and COVID-19.

We used a time-series modelling approach to simultaneously evaluate the abundance, biomass, and traits of eight fish families over a chronosequence spanning 44 years of protection. We constructed a multivariate functional space based on six traits known to respond to management or disturbance and affect ecosystem processes: size, diet, position in the water column, gregariousness, reef association, and length at maturity. We show that biomass increased with a log-linear trend over the time-series, but abundance only increased after 20 years of closure, and with more variation among reserves. This difference is attributed to recovery rates being dependent on body sizes. Abundance-weighted traits and the associated multivariate space of the community change is driven by increased proportions over time of the trait categories: 7-15 cm body size; planktivorous; species low in the water column; medium-large schools; and species with high levels of reef association.

Based upon 40 questionnaires with SW outdoors and indoors and 50 h of field observation, SW reported that the pandemic has had adverse financial and psychosocial effects on them. During the first year of COVID-19, seventeen SW were victims of at least one work-related offence, the most prevalent of which were theft and fraud. Nevertheless, most SW did not report the incidents to the police. Comparing the non-victims with victims, we found that victims, particularly those of multiple crimes, are younger, more often foreigners from extra-EU countries, in an illegal situation and needed to work face to face during the prostitution ban during the lockdown in Switzerland. However, despite these circumstances, most SW do not use illegal drugs, and only a few of them used more during the pandemic. Our research findings were similar to those reported in former studies, although we could infer that the violent victimisation of our sample is less and none of the SW indicated violence on the part of the police.

Aims and Objective: The study was conducted to correlate the severity of lung involvement as assessed by the HRCT severity, with the Viral Severity index, laboratory parameters, duration of hospital stay, viral clearance and resolution of lung symptoms. Materials and Methods: An observational retrospective study was carried out from the laboratory records of consecutive 208 patients admitted to the tertiary care hospital between March 2020 to May 2020. Results: Out of a total of 208 patients, 200(96%) recovered and 8(4%) expired. The expired patients showed a higher average age (50.79 + /- 17.42;62.25 + /-12.37) years in the recovered & expired patients respectively (p = 0.06). A longer duration of hospital stay was seen in the expired patients (15.05 + /-9.55&18.62 + /-10.22) days in the recovered & expired patients respectively. A low average (Hemoglobin) Hb values (12.17 + /-2.01&10.9 + /- 2.31) g/dl in the recovered and expired patients respectively along with a higher total WBC count was seen in the expired patients (8.62 + /-3.81& 16.86 + /-12.79) k/U in the recovered and expired patients with a highly significant p value of < 0.001). Higher CT severity scores were seen in the expired patients (10.74 + /-5.57&17.12 + /-6.55) in the recovered and expired patients respectively (p = 0.0018). None of the expired patients had a normal D Dimer level. HRCT values and the Rising D Dimer levels tend to show a positive correlation with the disease outcome and progression. The Higher Viral severity and HRCT score was associated with a longer duration of hospital stay reflecting a higher duration of viral clearance. Conclusion: The Chest CT scores along with the laboratory parameters like the total WBC count and the D Dimer levels can together act as important parameters to monitor the Covid 19 disease course.

In this narrative review, we discuss how the pandemic may impact general cardiovascular risk for years to come, and explore the mitigating potential of telehealth interventions. From a health care perspective, the shift away from in-person office visits may have led many to defer routine risk factor management and may have had unforeseen effects on continuity of care and adherence. Fear of COVID-19 has led some patients to forego care for acute cardiovascular events. Curtailment of routine outpatient laboratory testing has likely delayed intensification of risk-factor modifying medical therapy, and drug shortages and mis-information may have negatively impacted adherence to antihypertensive, glucose-lowering, and lipid-lowering agents. From a societal perspective, the unprecedented curtailment of social and economic activities has led to income loss, unemployment, social isolation, decreased physical activity, and increased frequency of depression and anxiety, all of which are known to be associated with worse cardiovascular risk-factor control and outcomes. We must embrace and evaluate measures to mitigate these potential harms to avoid an epidemic of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the coming years that could dwarf the initial health impacts of COVID-19.","output":"Implications of the COVID-19 Pandemic for Cardiovascular Disease and Risk-Factor Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyses quarterly estimates of productivity growth at industry level for three advanced economies, France, the UK and the US, for 2020.

(2) which immunological effector arm most likely protects against rotavirus disease? (3) by what means is virus antigen best presented to the host to elicit a protective immune response? (4) what are the advantages and disadvantages of replicating agents as compared to nonreplicating agents as candidate rotavirus vaccines? Although two proteins (vp4 and vp7) are probably important in inducing protection against challenge, it has not been clearly demonstrated that inclusion of the epidemiologically important human P or G type is important in protection against human disease. No immunological effector arm clearly explains protection against heterotypic challenge. Protection against disease is not predicted by rotavirus-specific neutralizing antibodies in serum. Oral inoculation may not be necessary to induce a protective, virus-specific immune response at the intestinal mucosal surface, but parenteral inoculation of experimental animals with rotavirus induces an immune response at the intestinal mucosal surface that is protective against challenge. Induction of a rotavirus-specific protective immune response is probably associated with the presence of virus-specific T and B cells in intestinal lymphoid tissues and virus-specific sIgA or IgG at the intestinal mucosal surface. There is some experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that neither rotavirus replication nor presentation of rotavirus antigen to the intestinal mucosal surface is necessary to achieve this aim.","output":"Rotaviruses: Immunological Determinants of Protection Against Infection and Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) virus and resulting COVID\\\\19 pandemic present important diagnostic challenges. Several diagnostic strategies are available to identify current infection, rule out infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response. Serology tests to detect the presence of antibodies to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 aim to identify previous SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection, and may help to confirm the presence of current infection. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of antibody tests to determine if a person presenting in the community or in primary or secondary care has SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection, or has previously had SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection, and the accuracy of antibody tests for use in seroprevalence surveys. SEARCH METHODS: We undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID\\\\19 Study Register and the COVID\\\\19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID\\\\19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. We conducted searches for this review iteration up to 27 April 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated antibody tests (including enzyme\\\\linked immunosorbent assays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, and lateral flow assays) in people suspected of current or previous SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection. We also included studies of people either known to have, or not to have SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection. We included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests (RT\\\\PCR) and clinical diagnostic criteria). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed possible bias and applicability of the studies using the QUADAS\\\\2 tool. We extracted 2x2 contingency table data and present sensitivity and specificity for each antibody (or combination of antibodies) using paired forest plots. We pooled data using random\\\\effects logistic regression where appropriate, stratifying by time since post\\\\symptom onset. We tabulated available data by test manufacturer. We have presented uncertainty in estimates of sensitivity and specificity using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS: We included 57 publications reporting on a total of 54 study cohorts with 15,976 samples, of which 8526 were from cases of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection. Studies were conducted in Asia (n = 38), Europe (n = 15), and the USA and China (n = 1). We identified data from 25 commercial tests and numerous in\\\\house assays, a small fraction of the 279 antibody assays listed by the Foundation for Innovative Diagnostics. More than half (n = 28) of the studies included were only available as preprints. We had concerns about risk of bias and applicability. Common issues were use of multi\\\\group designs (n = 29), inclusion of only COVID\\\\19 cases (n = 19), lack of blinding of the index test (n = 49) and reference standard (n = 29), differential verification (n = 22), and the lack of clarity about participant numbers, characteristics and study exclusions (n = 47). Most studies (n = 44) only included people hospitalised due to suspected or confirmed COVID\\\\19 infection. There were no studies exclusively in asymptomatic participants. Two\\\\thirds of the studies (n = 33) defined COVID\\\\19 cases based on RT\\\\PCR results alone, ignoring the potential for false\\\\negative RT\\\\PCR results. We observed evidence of selective publication of study findings through omission of the identity of tests (n = 5). We observed substantial heterogeneity in sensitivities of IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies, or combinations thereof, for results aggregated across different time periods post\\\\symptom onset (range 0% to 100% for all target antibodies). We thus based the main results of the review on the 38 studies that stratified results by time since symptom onset. The numbers of individuals contributing data within each study each week are small and are usually not based on tracking the same groups of patients over time. Pooled results for IgG, IgM, IgA, total antibodies and IgG/IgM all showed low sensitivity during the first week since onset of symptoms (all less than 30.1%), rising in the second week and reaching their highest values in the third week. The combination of IgG/IgM had a sensitivity of 30.1% (95% CI 21.4 to 40.7) for 1 to 7 days, 72.2% (95% CI 63.5 to 79.5) for 8 to 14 days, 91.4% (95% CI 87.0 to 94.4) for 15 to 21 days. Estimates of accuracy beyond three weeks are based on smaller sample sizes and fewer studies. For 21 to 35 days, pooled sensitivities for IgG/IgM were 96.0% (95% CI 90.6 to 98.3). There are insufficient studies to estimate sensitivity of tests beyond 35 days post\\\\symptom onset. Summary specificities (provided in 35 studies) exceeded 98% for all target antibodies with confidence intervals no more than 2 percentage points wide. False\\\\positive results were more common where COVID\\\\19 had been suspected and ruled out, but numbers were small and the difference was within the range expected by chance. Assuming a prevalence of 50%, a value considered possible in healthcare workers who have suffered respiratory symptoms, we would anticipate that 43 (28 to 65) would be missed and 7 (3 to 14) would be falsely positive in 1000 people undergoing IgG/IgM testing at days 15 to 21 post\\\\symptom onset. At a prevalence of 20%, a likely value in surveys in high\\\\risk settings, 17 (11 to 26) would be missed per 1000 people tested and 10 (5 to 22) would be falsely positive. At a lower prevalence of 5%, a likely value in national surveys, 4 (3 to 7) would be missed per 1000 tested, and 12 (6 to 27) would be falsely positive. Analyses showed small differences in sensitivity between assay type, but methodological concerns and sparse data prevent comparisons between test brands. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of antibody tests is too low in the first week since symptom onset to have a primary role for the diagnosis of COVID\\\\19, but they may still have a role complementing other testing in individuals presenting later, when RT\\\\PCR tests are negative, or are not done. Antibody tests are likely to have a useful role for detecting previous SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection if used 15 or more days after the onset of symptoms. However, the duration of antibody rises is currently unknown, and we found very little data beyond 35 days post\\\\symptom onset. We are therefore uncertain about the utility of these tests for seroprevalence surveys for public health management purposes. Concerns about high risk of bias and applicability make it likely that the accuracy of tests when used in clinical care will be lower than reported in the included studies. Sensitivity has mainly been evaluated in hospitalised patients, so it is unclear whether the tests are able to detect lower antibody levels likely seen with milder and asymptomatic COVID\\\\19 disease. The design, execution and reporting of studies of the accuracy of COVID\\\\19 tests requires considerable improvement. Studies must report data on sensitivity disaggregated by time since onset of symptoms. COVID\\\\19\\\\positive cases who are RT\\\\PCR\\\\negative should be included as well as those confirmed RT\\\\PCR, in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) and China National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (CDC) case definitions. We were only able to obtain data from a small proportion of available tests, and action is needed to ensure that all results of test evaluations are available in the public domain to prevent selective reporting. This is a fast\\\\moving field and we plan ongoing updates of this living systematic review.","output":"Antibody tests for identification of current and past infection with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To evaluate the characteristics of images generated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and changes in the mass-like lesion (MLL) during the follow-up of patients who underwent partial nephrectomy (PN) with the intra-operative use of hemostatic agents (HAs). METHODS The records of patients who had undergone PN in our clinic due to renal mass between January 2013 and August 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Our study included 47 patients who were administered one or more HAs during the PN and who received diffusion and dynamic MRI at the post-operative 2nd/4th Queryand 12th month. RESULTS MLL is defined as T2 heterogeneous, intermediate-signal intensity bolster-related mass with a pseudocapsule in the renal parenchymal defect. When we looked at the morphological changes of MLL, the mean largest axial dimensions of masses were 27.3 (range 12.2-44.7) mm in the first follow-up period (2nd/4th months) and 21.2 (range 11-44.7) mm in the 12th month follow-up period. The average change in size of MLL was - 0.66 mm/month. We did not see any significant relationship between observation of MLL in the post-operative follow-up MRI images and the use of HAs such as Surgicel?, Spongostan?, and autologous fatty tissue as well as the amount of the agents used in PN operations (p = 0.405, p = 0.159, respectively).

Since the emergence of COVID-19 infection at the end of 2019, the operations of seaports, especially container ports have been hit hard. This paper aims to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on container ports operations, clarify the potential economic losses of ports and propose coping suggestions for recovery. Five scenarios of port recovery have been set and the revenues of the port under epidemic outbreaks are estimated. The economic loss could be modeled as the difference between original revenue a port should obtained without the impact of COVID-19 and the actual revenue considering the impact of COVID-19. The container port of Shanghai is selected as the case study. Results and sensitivity analysis reveal that slower the recovery develops, much more loss will be borne by the port. However, there is also a possibility that the port achieves increased income with a surging boom of shipping demand. The loss of port due, handling service, facility security fee and berthage charge are major losses. Besides, port handling efficiency and fleet structure are also found crucial for reducing economic losses. Reducing containerships handling time and serving larger ships would also help the port reduce economic losses.","output":"Estimating the economic loss of a seaport due to the impact of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Settings throughout the United States and Canada are contending with high rates of drug-related overdose. This in turn has prompted efforts to more effectively engage people who use drugs (PWUD) in treatment and care. However, while co-morbid mental disorders are prevalent among PWUD and can undermine access to services, the impact of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on service access is not known. Therefore, we sought to assess whether PTSD is associated with difficulties accessing health and social services among PWUD in Vancouver, Canada. METHODS: Survey data was derived from two prospective cohorts of PWUD in Vancouver, Canada for the period of April 2017 to November 2018. PTSD was assessed using the PTSD Checklist for the DSM-V (PCL-5). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to estimate the relationship between PTSD and self-reported inability to access health and social services, after adjustment for confounders. RESULTS: Among 810 participants included in our analysis, 316 (39.0%) participants qualified for a provisional PSTD diagnosis, and 117 (14.4%) reported difficulties accessing services. In a multivariable GEE analysis, a PTSD diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio = 1.69, 95% confidence interval: 1.12C2.55) was independently associated with difficulties accessing services. CONCLUSIONS: We found high rates of PTSD and self-reported difficulties accessing services among PWUD in Vancouver, as well as a positive association between PTSD and difficulties with service access.

Controlling the trajectories of particles in laminar fluid has several potential applications. The fluid drag force, which depends on the fluid and particle velocities and the material properties of particles, acts on the surfaces of the particles, thereby affecting the trajectories of the particles whose deformability can be neglected. By changing the drag or inertia force, particles can be controlled and sorted depending on their properties and initial locations. In several engineering applications, the transient motion of particles can be controlled and optimized by changing the velocity of the fluid. This paper presents topology optimization schemes to determine optimal pseudo rigid domains in fluid to control the motion of particles depending on their properties, locations, and geometric constraints. The transient sensitivity analysis of the positions of particles can be derived with respect to the spatial distributed design variables in topology optimization. The current optimization formulations are evaluated for effectiveness based on different conditions.

This shift will necessitate investments that strengthen the ability to identify at-risk populations and react in ways that help avoid complications and reduce unnecessary costs.Even before the pandemic, it was clear that there were missed opportunities to reduce costs of care. Failures in care coordination contributed to billions of dollars in waste each year. Now, as payers explore innovative risk-based arrangements for addressing the impacts of social determinants of health and delayed care on health outcomes, healthcare providers should seek opportunities to partner with payers in developing shared-risk approaches to patient engagement and chronic condition management. Steps toward designing a model for risk innovation include rewarding physicians and clinicians for managing the total cost of care, involving physicians in discussions around acceptable levels of risk in value-based contracts, ensuring that the organization's cost accounting approach meets its strategic needs, investing in actuaries to study data that can identify rising-risk patients, and exploring innovative partnerships for funding the infrastructure for value.","output":"The Road to Value Demands a Smarter Approach to Risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic impacted researches that depended on making tests on patients and teams that had to be divided to avoid crowding in laboratories.

This may be due in large part to the unclear immunopathological basis for the development of immune dysregulation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severe and critical patients. Specifically, it remains unknown whether the immunological features of the disease that have been identified so far are compartment-specific responses or general features of COVID-19. Additionally, readily detectable biological markers correlated with strata of disease severity that could be used to triage patients and inform treatment options have not yet been identified. Here, we leveraged publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data to elucidate the common and compartment-specific immunological features of clinically severe COVID-19. We identified a number of transcriptional programs that are altered across the spectrum of disease severity, few of which are common between the lung and peripheral immune environments. In the lung, comparing severe and moderate patients revealed severity-specific responses of enhanced interferon, A20/IB, IL-2, and IL-6 pathway signatures along with broad signaling activity of IFNG, SPP1, CCL3, CCL8, and IL18 across cell types. These signatures contrasted with features unique to ARDS observed in the blood compartment, which included depletion of interferon and A20/IB signatures and a lack of IL-6 response. The cell surface marker S1PR1 was strongly upregulated in patients diagnosed with ARDS compared to non-ARDS patients in æ T cells of the blood compartment, and we nominate S1PR1 as a potential marker for immunophenotyping ARDS in COVID-19 patients using flow cytometry. HIGHLIGHTS COVID-19 disease severity is associated with a number of compositional shifts in the cellular makeup of the blood and lung environments. Transcriptional data suggest differentially expressed cell surface proteins as markers for COVID-19 immunophenotyping from BALF and PBMC samples. Severity-specific features COVID-19 manifest at the pathway level, suggesting distinct changes to epithelia and differences between local and systemic immune dynamics.

The results show that air pollution episodes still occurred on polluted days and accounted for 31.6%C60.5% of the total number of outbreak days in mid-eastern China from January 23 to February 29, 2020. However, anthropogenic emissions decreased significantly, indicating that anthropogenic emission reduction cannot completely offset the impact of unfavorable meteorological conditions on air quality.

Methods : Surveys of all individuals requesting an acute same day in-person visit between April 6, 2020 and June 6, 2020 were reviewed, and medical chart review was completed for patients recommended an urgent visit. Demographic data and adherence to visit were examined. Using ArcGIS, address was geocoded and census tract level variables were appended from the U.S. Census American Community Survey between 2014 and 2018. COVID-19 related death data during the study period were also included from the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office. Descriptive statistics, t-tests and binary logistic regression were used to compare variables. A p-value of  0.05 was considered statistically significant.

METHODS: Participants (N=3,500) were recruited through Qualtrics Panels to participate in an online survey examining methods for self-protection. ANCOVAs were utilized to assess suicidal ideation. Multivariate ANCOVAs were used to examine firearm storage practices and storage changes during COVID-19. Data were collected in late June and early July 2020, and analyses were conducted in July 2020. RESULTS: Individuals who purchased a firearm during COVID-19 more frequently reported lifetime, past-year, and past-month suicidal ideation than nonfirearm owners and firearm owners who did not make a purchase during COVID-19. COVID-19 purchasers with lifetime ideation were less likely to hide loaded firearms in a closet than those without lifetime ideation. COVID-19 purchasers with past-year or past-month ideation were more likely to use locking devices than COVID-19 purchasers without past-month ideation. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to firearm owners more generally, COVID-19 firearm purchasers appear far more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation and appear less likely to use certain unsafe firearm storage methods but also report a greater number of storage changes during COVID-19 that made firearms less secure.

However, R(0) cannot reflect the time-varying nature of an epidemic. A time-varying effective reproductive number R(t) can provide more information because it tracks the subsequent evolution of transmission. However, since it neglects individual-level geographical variations in exposure risk, R(t) may smooth out interpersonal heterogeneous transmission potential, obscure high-risk spreaders, and hence hamper the effectiveness of control measures in spatial dimension. Therefore, this study proposes a new method for quantifying spatially adjusted (time-varying) reproductive numbers that reflects spatial heterogeneity in transmission potential among individuals. This new method estimates individual-level effective reproductive numbers (R(j)) and a summarized indicator for population-level time-varying reproductive number (R(t)). Data from the five most severe dengue outbreaks in southern Taiwan from 1998C2015 were used to demonstrate the ability of the method to highlight early spreaders contributing to the geographic expansion of dengue transmission. Our results show spatial heterogeneity in the transmission potential of dengue among individuals and identify the spreaders with the highest R(j) during the epidemic period. The results also reveal that super-spreaders are usually early spreaders that locate at the edges of the epidemic foci, which means that these cases could be the drivers of the expansion of the outbreak. Therefore, our proposed method depicts a more detailed spatial-temporal dengue transmission process and identifies the significant role of the edges of the epidemic foci, which could be weak spots in disease control and prevention.","output":"Spatially Adjusted Time-varying Reproductive Numbers: Understanding the Geographical Expansion of Urban Dengue Outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gambling is occurring in a rapidly changing landscape, with new trends and technologies affecting gambling behaviour and problem gambling across a range of populations. Gambling activity among adolescents and young people has received considerable research attention due to a high prevalence of gambling reported among these groups in recent years. Despite legislation worldwide to constrain gambling among adolescents and young people, modern technology, such as online gaming apps and online gambling venues, has significantly increased their exposure to the risks of problem gambling. It is important, therefore, to have up to date information about what is currently known about gambling and to explore gaps in our knowledge. This gap analysis presents the results of a systematic approach to reviewing the current literature on gambling behaviour, attitudes, and associated risk factors for gambling and problem gambling among adolescents and young adults (aged 10-25 years). The review included studies published between January 2015 and August 2020 and included 85 studies for final synthesis.

For urban areas in arid and semiarid regions receiving short high-intensive rainfall, rainfall characteristics, and soil slope play an important role for mulch functioning. These properties of mulch were studied. For this purpose, rainfall simulation experiments using organic mulching were conducted in Jiufeng National Forestry Park to analyze the influence of organic mulch under different slope and heavy rainfall events. The results showed that soil water content displayed a decreasing tendency with increasing mulch application. Compared to bare soil, a mulch application of 0.25 kg/m2 and 0.50 kg/m2 led to maximum soil water content and maximum runoff decrease occurred for 0.50 kg/m2 mulch. Higher application rate of mulch displayed less soil water content and greater runoff. The runoff amount and runoff generation rate decreased by 28-83% and 21-83%, respectively, as compared to bare soil. With a mulch application of 0.25-1.00 kg/m2, soil drainage accounted for 56-60% of total rainfall. Overall, an efficient mulch application was found to be 0.25-0.50 kg/m2.

It is especially relevant in settings with a high prevalence of HIV or isoniazid resistance. We describe the population pharmacokinetics of ethambutol in children with TB to guide dosing in this population. METHODS: We pooled data from 188 intensively sampled children from the DATiC, DNDi and SHINE studies, who received 15-25a? mg/kg ethambutol daily according to WHO guidelines. The median (range) age and weight of the cohort were 1.9 (0.3-12.6)a? years and 9.6 (3.9-34.5)a? kg, respectively. Children with HIV (HIV+; na=a103) received ART (lopinavir/ritonavir in 92%). RESULTS: Ethambutol pharmacokinetics were best described by a two-compartment model with first-order elimination and absorption transit compartments. Clearance was estimated to reach 50% of its mature value by 2a? months after birth and 99% by 3a? years. Typical steady-state apparent clearance in a 10a? kg child was 15.9a? L/h. In HIV+ children on lopinavir/ritonavir, bioavailability was reduced by 32% [median (IQR) steady-state Cmaxa=a0.882 (0.669-1.28) versus 1.66 (1.21-2.15)a? mg/L). In young children, bioavailability correlated with age. At birth, bioavailability was 73.1% of that in children 3.16a? years or older. CONCLUSIONS: To obtain exposure within the 2-6a? mg/L recommended range for Cmax, the current doses must be doubled (or tripled with HIV+ children on lopinavir/ritonavir) for paediatric patients.

We collected demographic characteristics, exposure history, and course of action of COVID-19 cases. We described the demographic and case characteristics of these cases to show the basic characteristics of COVID-19 cases in both provinces. Combined with the spatial analysis of confirmed cases, the distribution law of the number of confirmed cases in different regions was analyzed. We exhibit the relationship among COVID-19 cases with a transmission network. The transmission characteristics of COVID-19 were analyzed through the transmission network. Mainly cases in Liaoning and Jilin provinces were imported cases from other provinces and the vast majority of these cases were related to Hubei province. The number of confirmed cases in different regions was positively correlated with their GDP and population. The main clinical symptoms of the cases were fever. Judge from the transmission network relationship between the 2 provinces, the transmission chain in Liaoning province contains fewer cases than that in Jilin province. The main transmission routes of the local cases in the 2 provinces were the family members, and the infection of the imported cases were mainly occurred in public places. It was estimated that the unidentified asymptomatic infected cases in the 2 provinces account for approximately 7.3% of the total number of infected cases.

At the time of writing, the National Institutes of Health had responded to the pandemic with significant funding for COVID-19 research. However, because this pandemic is a new phenomenon, few mentors have expertise in the disease and relevant established resources. As a result, many mentors are unable to provide insight on COVID-19 research to early career investigators considering a pivot toward research related to this disease.

Conventional SARS-CoV-2 neutralization test is tedious, time-consuming and requires a biosafety level 3 laboratory. Despite recent reports of neutralizations using different pseudoviruses with a luciferase or green fluorescent protein reporter, the laborious steps, inter-assay variability or high background limit their high-throughput potential.

Several studies have indicated that densely populated urban environments and the heavy dependence on traffic could increase the potential spread of COVID-19. This study investigated the association between changes in traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea. METHODS: This study analyzed the daily national traffic and traffic trend for 3 months from January 1, 2020. Traffic data were measured using 6307 vehicle detection system (VDS). This study analyzed the difference in traffic levels between 2019 and 2020. Non-linear regression was performed to analyze the change in traffic trend in 2020. The relationship between traffic and confirmed COVID-19 cases was analyzed using single linear regression. RESULTS: The mean daily nationwide level of traffic for the first 3 months of 2020 was 143 655 563 vehicles, which was 9.7% lower than the same period in 2019 (159 044 566 vehicles). All regions showed a decreasing trend in traffic in February, which shifted to an increasing trend from March. In Incheon there was a positive, but insignificant, linear relationship between increasing numbers of newly confirmed cases and increasing traffic (? = 43 146; p = 0.056). CONCLUSIONS: Numbers of newly confirmed COVID-19 patients have been decreasing since March, while the traffic has been increasing. The fact that traffic is increasing indicates greater contact between people, which in turn increases the risk of further COVID-19 spread. Therefore, the government will need to devise suitable policies, such as total social distancing.","output":"The relationship between trends in COVID-19 prevalence and traffic levels in South Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus disease was first discovered in Wuhan, China.

The literature review includes publications available in the PubMed bibliographic database, describing symptoms and complaints of mask users (e.g., the feeling of discomfort, fatigue, headaches), different physiological reactions depending on the type of mask (surgical masks, masks with an exhalation valve, with air flow, etc.) as well as the influence of air composition, temperature and humidity in the space under the mask. The impact of using the mask on the ability to exercise (maximal effort, moderate effort) and mental work was outlined. The consequences of wearing masks by people in a different physiological state (pregnancy) were discussed. Proposals for the organization of work were also presented in order to minimize the negative consequences for people wearing masks. The analysis of the presented studies shows that, regardless of the type of masks worn, they can intensify the body's reactions to a varying degree, increasing the physiological cost of work and worsening the ability to make both physical and mental effort. In addition, the mask can contribute, among others, to more frequent headaches, symptoms of fatigue or the subjective feeling of discomfort. However, despite these adverse effects, the use of masks is important to protect people against harmful factors in the work and communal environments, and during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it has become a necessity. The discomfort of wearing a mask can be reduced by taking appropriate breaks.

The threshold for emotional distress was defined to be a total score of 4 on the GHQ-12 and above. RESULTS: A total of 255 members of medical staff participating in this study presented an emotional distress rate of 17%. Members who were male, aged 50C59, married with children, positioned as doctors, and in administration were the population with the highest rate of emotional distress. Furthermore, the severity of emotional distress among those under 30 was significantly lower than those aged 30C39 and 50C59. Doctors and other occupations shared a lower level of satisfaction on routine activities compared with nurses, so did staff in the administration compared with those who were working in screening or logistic departments.

However, internet searches are a complex and dynamic process that can be fraught with subtleties and potential error.

Fifty-six young adults completed two naturalistic eHealth search tasks: fact-finding (eHealth Fact) and symptom-diagnosis (eHealth Search). Participants also completed neurocognitive tests of attention, psychomotor speed, learning/memory, and executive functions. Shorter eHealth symptom-diagnosis search time was related to better executive functions, while better eHealth symptom-diagnosis search accuracy was related to better episodic and prospective memory. In contrast, neither eHealth Fact search time nor its accuracy were related to any of the neurocognitive measures.

Up to 20%-30% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have evidence of cardiac dysfunction. Xuebijing injection is a compound injection containing five traditional Chinese medicine ingredients, which can protect cells from SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death and improve cardiac function. However, the specific protective mechanism of Xuebijing injection on COVID-19-induced cardiac dysfunction remains unclear. METHODS: The therapeutic effect of Xuebijing injection on COVID-19 was validated by the TCM Anti COVID-19 (TCMATCOV) platform. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from GSE150392 was used to find differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) infected with SARS-CoV-2. Data from GSE151879 was used to verify the expression of Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and central hub genes in both human embryonic-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and adult human CMs with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: A total of 97 proteins were identified as the therapeutic targets of Xuebijing injection for COVID-19. There were 22 DEGs in SARS-CoV-2 infected hiPSC-CMs overlapped with the 97 therapeutic targets, which might be the therapeutic targets of Xuebijing injection on COVID-19-induced cardiac dysfunction. Based on the bioinformatics analysis, 7 genes (CCL2, CXCL8, FOS, IFNB1, IL-1A, IL-1B, SERPINE1) were identified as central hub genes and enriched in pathways including cytokines, inflammation, cell senescence and oxidative stress. ACE2, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and the 7 central hub genes were differentially expressed in at least two kinds of SARS-CoV-2 infected CMs. Besides, FOS and quercetin exhibited the tightest binding by molecular docking analysis.

METHODS: We established a real-time RT-PCR-based strategy for the detection of reassortment of pandemic H1N1/2009 virus. Singleplex SYBR green-based RT-PCR assays specific for each gene segment of pandemic H1N1/2009 were developed. These assays were evaluated by influenza viruses with different genetic backgrounds. RESULTS: All human pandemic H1N1 (N=27) and all seasonal human (N=58) isolates were positive and negative, respectively, for all 8 segments.

All 8 viral segments of these 10 samples were confirmed to be of pandemic H1N1 origin, indicating that these were caused by zoonotic transmissions from human to pigs. The 38 swine viruses that are non-pandemic H1N1/2009 had 1 to 6 gene segments positive in the tests. Further characterization of these non-pandemic H1N1/2009 swine viruses indicated that these PCR positive genes are the precursor genes of pandemic H1N1/2009 virus. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that these assays can detect re-introductions of pandemic H1N1/2009 virus in pigs. These assays might be useful screening tools for identifying viral reassortants derived from pandemic H1N1/2009 or its precursors.","output":"Rapid detection of reassortment of pandemic H1N1/2009 influenza virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of the widespread plagiarism in evaluating student performance, many researchers consider that the evaluation of students performance in the Corona era (COVID-19) would not be objective It will be difficult to truly measure student performance Plagiarism has spread in many of the scientific works that students accomplish (exams, scientific research, assignments, quizzes, research projects) in most of the worlds universities The issue of plagiarism causes a lot of anxiety to people working in the educational field (supervisors, professors, administrators) Meetings, conferences and seminars are organized and held to study this topic and search for solutions that could put an end to the problem, especially after most educational institutions (universities, secondary schools, schools) in the world had adopted e-learning (distance learning) during and after the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has halted traditional learning for more than half a year (December 2019) In this context, this paper aims to shed light on some aspects of this problem, and offer some proposals that could contribute to limiting its spread in the various educational institutions Based on the foregoing, the current research seeks to answer the following questions: 1 Is cheating inherent in distance learning? 2 What kind of cheating is used in distance learning? 3 What are the measures taken to tackle this problem?

As the national emergency care capacity is a crucial part of the COVID-19 response, we evaluated the Brazilian Health Care System response preparedness against the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A retrospective and ecological study was performed with data retrieved from the Brazilian Information Technology Department of the Public Health Care System. The numbers of intensive care (ICU) and hospital beds, general or intensivist physicians, nurses, nursing technicians, physiotherapists, and ventilators from each health region were extracted. Beds per health professionals and ventilators per population rates were assessed. A health service accessibility index was created using a two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA). A spatial analysis using Getis-Ord Gi(*) was performed to identify areas lacking access to high-complexity centers (HCC). Results: As of February 2020, Brazil had 35,682 ICU beds, 426,388 hospital beds, and 65,411 ventilators. In addition, 17,240 new ICU beds were created in June 2020. The South and Southeast regions have the highest rates of professionals and infrastructure to attend patients with COVID-19 compared with the northern region. The north region has the lowest accessibility to ICUs. Conclusions: The Brazilian Health Care System is unevenly distributed across the country. The inequitable distribution of health facilities, equipment, and human resources led to inadequate preparedness to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the ineffectiveness of public measures of the municipal and federal administrations aggravated the pandemic in Brazil.","output":"Emergency Care Gap in Brazil: Geographical Accessibility as a Proxy of Response Capacity to Tackle COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: After learning new skills, healthcare professionals do not always apply them in practice, despite being motivated. This may be referred to as an intention-behavior gap. One example is the positioning of immobilized and disabled patients in hospitals, nursing homes, or neurorehabilitation clinics. Positioning is crucial to prevent complications such as pressure sores, pneumonia, and deep vein thrombosis. However, it is often not carried out optimally even when professionals have completed education programs. The LiN-method is a positioning procedure involving a special focus on aligning and stabilizing body parts, which has been shown to have advantages over conventional positioning. We assess which factors may facilitate or hinder the use of LiN in clinical practice after participants complete training. METHODS: A longitudinal survey with 101 LiN-course participants was conducted in Germany. Each participant completed a questionnaire directly after the course and 12 weeks later, including a report of the frequency of use in practice. They also completed a questionnaire which surveyed 23 aspects that might facilitate or hinder use of the new skills, covering the workplace, socio-collegial factors, motivation, self-confidence, and mindset. RESULTS: Most assessed aspects were associated with LiN-use, with the highest correlations found for confidence with the method, perceived ease of application, sufficient time, assessing one's skills as sufficient, remembering the relevant steps, and a work environment open to advanced therapeutic concepts. To reduce data complexity, the questionnaire was subjected to a factor analysis, revealing six factors. A regression analysis showed that four factors predicted use 12 weeks after course completion, in the following order of importance: (1) subjective aspects/confidence, (2) access to materials, (3) work context, and (4) competent support in the workplace. CONCLUSION: Numerous aspects are associated with the use of recently acquired clinical or nursing skills, such as LiN. Many of these can be improved by appropriately setting up the workplace. The aspects most associated with use, however, are confidence with the method and self-perceived competence of healthcare professionals. While causality still needs to be demonstrated, this suggests that education programs should support participants in developing confidence and foster a mindset of continuous learning.","output":"Factors Facilitating and Hindering the Use of Newly Acquired Positioning Skills in Clinical Practice: A Longitudinal Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To mark the 25th anniversary of the journal, each issue in 2020 will include an interview with a health care thought leader.

Cytokine storm syndromes can be genetic or a secondary complication of autoimmune or autoinflammatory disorders, infections, and haematological malignancies. These syndromes represent a key area of interface between rheumatology and general medicine. Rheumatologists often lead in management, in view of their experience using intensive immunosuppressive regimens and managing cytokine storm syndromes in the context of rheumatic disorders or infection (known as secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or macrophage activation syndrome [sHLH/MAS]). Interleukin (IL)-1 is pivotal in hyperinflammation. Anakinra, a recombinant humanised IL-1 receptor antagonist, is licenced at a dose of 100 mg once daily by subcutaneous injection for rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, adult-onset Still's disease, and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes. In cytokine storm syndromes, the subcutaneous route is often problematic, as absorption can be unreliable in patients with critical illness, and multiple injections are needed to achieve the high doses required. As a result, intravenous anakinra is used in clinical practice for sHLH/MAS, despite this being an off-licence indication and route of administration. Among 46 patients admitted to our three international, tertiary centres for sHLH/MAS and treated with anakinra over 12 months, the intravenous route of delivery was used in 18 (39%) patients. In this Viewpoint, we describe current challenges in the management of cytokine storm syndromes and review the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of intravenous anakinra. There is accumulating evidence to support the rationale for, and safety of, intravenous anakinra as a first-line treatment in patients with sHLH/MAS. Intravenous anakinra has important clinical relevance when high doses of drug are required or if patients have subcutaneous oedema, severe thrombocytopenia, or neurological involvement. Cross-speciality management and collaboration, with the generation of international, multi-centre registries and biobanks, are needed to better understand the aetiopathogenesis and improve the poor prognosis of cytokine storm syndromes.","output":"Silencing the cytokine storm: the use of intravenous anakinra in haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or macrophage activation syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The harmful effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can reach the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and endothelial function.

We analysed HERV-W ENV expression in blood cells of COVID-19 patients in correlation with clinical characteristics and have discussed its potential role in the outcome of the disease.Methods: We analysed HERV-W ENV expression in blood samples of Covid-19 patients and healthy donors by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis, and evaluated its correlation with clinical signs, inflammatory markers, cytokine expression, and disease progression.Findings: HERV-W ENV was highly expressed in the leukocytes of COVID-19 patients but not in those of healthy donors. Its expression correlated with the markers of T-cell differentiation and exhaustion and blood cytokine levels. The percentage of HERV-W ENV-positive lymphocytes correlated with inflammatory markers and pneumonia severity in COVID-19 patients.

From a multidisciplinary perspective, this systematic review points out the mobility impact on three elements of the EU Active Ageing Index: health, independence and social connectedness. By scanning four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and TRID), 3727 peer-reviewed papers published in the last decade were found, of which 57 met the inclusion criteria. The screening process was conducted following the PRISMA protocol and registered to the database PROSPERO, while the quality assessment was done using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. More than 80% of the papers showed that an active mobility prevents psycho-physical harms, while only few papers study the relation of mobility with independence and social inclusion, to reduce the need for assistance and the related public expenditures. The findings of this review give important information both to transportation researchers and policymakers and companies, underlining the need for further research as well as investments in targeted age-friendly transport systems.

At this time, though there are guidelines and recommendations for medical management of these patients, there is a lack of guidance on how a plastic surgeon should approach the COVID-19 suspect or infected patient who presents either in an elective or emergency setting. We aim to provide a consensus guideline based on the current recommendations of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the pooled experience of the major centers performing plastic and reconstructive surgery in India. METHODS: The current guidelines and recommendations on the COVID-19 pandemic were studied from both government and nongovernment sources including ICMR. The problems in the specialty of plastic surgery were categorized into four groups and for each group, separate and individual guidelines have been formulated. GUIDELINES: Consensus guidelines have been formulated for the specialty of Plastic and Reconstructive surgery. The patients requiring plastic surgery service have been categorized into four groups of acute, subacute, chronic, and late category. Acute cases are the ones who require intervention within 24-48a?h. Subacute cases are the ones who require intervention in the next 3-10 days, while the chronic are the ones who need plastic surgery preferably within a month. The late category are the ones who need surgery within the next six months. This has been done based on the urgency and priority of surgical intervention titrated against the risks of operating and inadvertently acquiring the exposure of COVID-19-positive patients. CONCLUSION: Currently, in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, there are no clear guidelines specific to the vast majority of patients who come for a plastic surgery intervention. This puts the patients at risk due to the impending plastic surgery problem while at the same time it poses a risk of exposure to COVID-19 for the surgical team. Consensus guidelines are presented, to steer the plastic surgeon in his work, in the wake of COVID-19 crisis. The guidelines are based on firm scientific evidence from the reputed research and regulatory bodies and have been made in consonance with plastic surgery experts around the country, so that these practices best suit the needs of the patients, while being mindful of resource limitations and infection risks.

The frequency of the neurologic manifestations and the risk factors in the development of these symptoms are not clear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the exact frequency of the neurological symptoms in pediatric patients with confirmed COVID-19 and to identify the risk factors for the development of neurological manifestations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included pediatric Covid-19 patients admitted to the Children's Hospital of Ankara City Hospital between March 22 and June 1, 2020. Neurological findings were questioned by interviewing the patients and their families and detailed neurologic examinations were performed within protection measures. RESULTS: A total of 312 pediatric patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Sixty-six participants (21.15%) showed neurologic symptoms during COVID-19. Headache was the most common neurologic symptom and present in 14% (n: 44) of the cases. The other neurologic symptoms were myalgia (n: 30, 9.6%), anosmia/hyposmia (n: 6, 1.9%), ageusia (n: 2, 0.6%), and vertigo (n: 1, 0.3%). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (P = 0.002) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (P = 0.001) were significantly elevated in patients with neurological symptoms when compared to the patients without the symptoms.

presents with serious respiratory symptoms with vascular and other complications, particularly in older adults. The disease can be spread by both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals. Uncertainty remains over key aspects of the virus infectiousness (particularly the newly emerging variants) and the disease has had severe economic impacts globally. For these reasons, COVID-19 is the subject of intense and widespread discussion on social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter. These public forums substantially influence public opinions and in some cases can exacerbate the widespread panic and misinformation spread during the crisis. Thus, this work aimed to design an intelligent clustering-based classification and topic extracting model named TClustVID that analyzes COVID-19-related public tweets to extract significant sentiments with high accuracy. We gathered COVID-19 Twitter datasets from the IEEE Dataport repository and employed a range of data preprocessing methods to clean the raw data, then applied tokenization and produced a word-to-index dictionary. Thereafter, different classifications were employed on these datasets which enabled the exploration of the performance of traditional classification and TClustVID. Our analysis found that TClustVID showed higher performance compared to traditional methodologies that are determined by clustering criteria. Finally, we extracted significant topics from the clusters, split them into positive, neutral and negative sentiments, and identified the most frequent topics using the proposed model. This approach is able to rapidly identify commonly prevailing aspects of public opinions and attitudes related to COVID-19 and infection prevention strategies spreading among different populations.","output":"TClustVID: A novel machine learning classification model to investigate topics and sentiment in COVID-19 tweets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Computed tomography (CT) is a noninvasive imaging approach to assist the early diagnosis of pneumonia. However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shares similar imaging features with other types of pneumonia, which makes differential diagnosis problematic. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been proven successful in the medical imaging field, which has helped disease identification. However, whether AI can be used to identify the severity of COVID-19 is still underdetermined. METHODS Data were extracted from 140 patients with confirmed COVID-19. The severity of COVID-19 patients (severe vs. non-severe) was defined at admission, according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The AI-CT rating system constructed by Hangzhou YITU Healthcare Technology Co., Ltd. was used as the analysis tool to analyze chest CT images. RESULTS A total of 117 diagnosed cases were enrolled, with 40 severe cases and 77 non-severe cases. Severe patients had more dyspnea symptoms on admission (12 vs. 3), higher acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II (9 vs. 4) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) (3 vs. 1) scores, as well as higher CT semiquantitative rating scores (4 vs. 1) and AI-CT rating scores than non-severe patients (P<0.001). The AI-CT score was more predictive of the severity of COVID-19 (AUC=0.929), and ground-glass opacity (GGO) was more predictive of further intubation and mechanical ventilation (AUC=0.836). Furthermore, the CT semiquantitative score was linearly associated with the AI-CT rating system (Adj R 2=75.5%, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS AI technology could be used to evaluate disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Although it could not be considered an independent factor, there was no doubt that GGOs displayed more predictive value for further mechanical ventilation.","output":"Artificial intelligence computed tomography helps evaluate the severity of COVID-19 patients: A retrospective study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The new coronavirus disease (COVID 19) has become a worldwide health emergency with a wide spectrum of clinical presentation, from common cold symptoms to multiorgan failure. A great number of medical centers have reported that patients with COVID-19 have developed acute kidney injury. The kidney is a target organ for SARS - COV2 because of ACE2 receptor, the binding site for this virus, is expressed in kidney tissue. The potential mechanisms for kidney injury are direct kidney injury, inflammation, activation of coagulation and complement cascades. Data from centers worldwide reported a wide range of AKI incidence, from 0,5% in China to 46% in USA. The aim of this study was to analyze incidence, risk factors and outcomes of AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID 19 who were treated from 01.04. to 01.06.2020. at Nephrology Department of University Clinical Center Zvezdara, which was at the time transformed into COVID hospital. METHOD: This retrospective observational study included 51 patients who had normal kidney function before the infection with SARS COV2, and 7 of them developed dialysis non-dependent AKI. Analysis included data collection from the patients history including demographic, clinical and administrative data. Statistical analysis has been performed using SPSS software version 20 (IBM Corporation, New York, USA). RESULTS: Out of 51 patients 7 (13.7%) developed AKI, mean age was 59 + 16 years and 53% were male. Diabetes mellitus was present in 27 of patients with AKI, hypertension in 6/7, obesity in 3/7, coronary artery disease in 1/7 and 1 of 7 patients was smoker. These risk factors except obesity (p= 0.05) didnt vary significantly between two groups (AKI and non AKI patients with COVID-19). Our results showed significant correlation between AKI development and obesity (p= 0.05, OR 4.75), Charlston index score (p=0.01), D dimer score (p=0.01), and CT COVID score (p=0.03). Regarding the outcome, COVID 19 patients with AKI showed 7-fold higher risk for fatal outcome (p= 0.046). CONCLUSION: Obesity, higher D dimer values, worse CT findings and higher Charlston comorbidity score index were associated with acute kidney injury in patients with COVID 19.

The study aims to assess the relations between social impact and mental health among adults living in Spain during COVID-19 lockdown measures, taking a gender-based approach into account. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among adults living in Spain during the lockdown of COVID-19 with an online survey from 8 April to 28 May 2020. The main variable was mental health measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale for anxiety and the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression. Sex-stratified multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to assess the association between social impact variables, anxiety and depression. RESULTS: A total of 7053 people completed this survey. A total of 31.2% of women and 17.7% of men reported anxiety. Depression levels were reported in 28.5% of women and 16.7% of men. A higher proportion of anxiety and depression levels was found in the younger population (18C35 years), especially in women. Poorer mental health was mainly related to fear of COVID-19 infection, with higher anxiety levels especially in women (adjusted ordinal OR (aOR): 4.23, 95% CI 3.68 to 4.87) and worsened economy with higher levels of depression in women (aOR: 1.51, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.84), and perceived inadequate housing to cope with lockdown was especially associated with anxiety in men (aOR: 2.53, 95% CI 1.93 to 3.44).

We show that the COVID-19 epidemic curves not only may present a subexponential early growth but can also exhibit a similar subexponential (power-law) behaviour in the saturation regime. We argue that the power-law exponent of the latter regime, which measures how quickly the curve approaches the plateau, is directly related to control measures, in the sense that the less strict the control, the smaller the exponent and hence the slower the diseases progresses to its end. The power-law saturation uncovered here is an important result, because it signals to health authorities that it is important to keep control measures for as long as possible, so as to avoid a slow, power-law ending of the disease. The slower the approach to the plateau, the longer the virus lingers on in the population, and the greater not only the death toll but also the risk of resurgence.","output":"Complexity signatures in the COVID-19 epidemic: power law behaviour in the saturation regime of fatality curves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of Zika virus infection increased the incidence of GuillainCBarr syndrome (GBS).

Polysaccharide is an important component of Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth. but has not been studied. Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth. is used to treat porcine epidemic diarrhea. But it is not known whether Pogostemon cablin polysaccharides (PCPs) has the antiviral activities against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of present study is to investigate the structural characterization and the anti-PEDV activities of PCPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PCPs were prepared by water extraction and alcohol precipitation method and purified with DEAE-52 cellulose column and Sephadex G-100 column. Then, the structural characterization of the polysaccharides including the infrared spectrum, molecular weight and monosaccharide composition were analyzed. Afterwards, the antiviral effect of PCPs against PEDV on IPEC-J2 cells was studied by MTT method and real-time PCR method. Additionally, the effects of PCPs on PEDV adsorption, penetration and replication were analyzed by real-time PCR method. Furthermore, we also investigate whether the anti-oxidative effects of PCPs were important to the anti-PEDV activities. RESULTS: Four polysaccharides were obtained and named as PCP1.1 (31.3 kDa), PCP1.2 (3.5 kDa), PCP2.1 (9.1 kDa) and PCP2.2 (8.3 kDa). PCP1.1, PCP1.2 and PCP2.1 were composed of fucose, arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid; and PCP2.2 was composed of arabinose, galactose, glucose, galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid. All PCPs showed anti-PEDV activities. PCP1.1 and PCP1.2 inhibited PEDV replication, while PCP2.1 and PCP2.2 inhibited PEDV penetration and replication. All PCPs showed anti-oxidative effects, which were important to the anti-PEDV activities. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment effect of Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth. on porcine epidemic diarrhea might be related to the anti-PEDV effect of PCPs.

In this mechanism, the formation of the nuclei is favoured over the subsequent addition of monomeric units to the aggregate, which finally results in short aggregates. Theoretical calculations show that both the BDT and BODIPY motifs, after forming the initial dimeric nuclei, experience a strong distortion of the central aromatic backbone upon growth, which makes the addition of successive monomeric units unfavourable and impedes the formation of long fibrillar structures. Despite the anti-cooperativity observed in the supramolecular polymerization of 1 and 2, the combination of both self-assembling units results in the formation of small co-assembled aggregates with a similar supramolecular polymerization behaviour to that observed for the separate components.","output":"Supramolecular polymerization of electronically complementary linear motifs: anti-cooperativity by attenuated growth."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeTo understand vaccine attitudes of Latinx parents highly impacted by COVID-19.

METHODS: In phase 1a of this clinical trial, we assessed the safety, side-effect profile, and pharmacokinetics of TY014, a fully human IgG1 anti-yellow fever virus monoclonal antibody. In a double-blind, phase 1b clinical trial, we assessed the efficacy of TY014, as compared with placebo, in abrogating viremia related to the administration of live yellow fever vaccine (YF17D-204; Stamaril). The primary safety outcomes were adverse events reported 1 hour after the infusion and throughout the trial. The primary efficacy outcome was the dose of TY014 at which 100% of the participants tested negative for viremia within 48 hours after infusion. RESULTS: A total of 27 healthy participants were enrolled in phase 1a, and 10 participants in phase 1b. During phase 1a, TY014 dose escalation to a maximum of 20 mg per kilogram of body weight occurred in 22 participants. During phases 1a and 1b, adverse events within 1 hour after infusion occurred in 1 of 27 participants who received TY014 and in none of the 10 participants who received placebo. At least one adverse event occurred during the trial in 22 participants who received TY014 and in 8 who received placebo. The mean half-life of TY014 was approximately 12.8 days. At 48 hours after the infusion, none of the 5 participants who received the starting dose of TY014 of 2 mg per kilogram had detectable YF17D-204 viremia; these participants remained aviremic throughout the trial. Viremia was observed at 48 hours after the infusion in 2 of 5 participants who received placebo and at 72 hours in 2 more placebo recipients. Symptoms associated with yellow fever vaccine were less frequent in the TY014 group than in the placebo group.

We considered psychological distress, quarantine status, social distancing and self-medication in China and the UK. METHODS We conducted online surveys in China (N=1135) and the UK (N=1293), beginning in March 2020. Participants indicated demographics, whether they were in quarantine, relationship status, social distancing, use of vitamins/traditional medicines and completed the K6 scale of psychological distress. RESULTS 19.1% of the respondents in China were at risk of severe mental illness (SMI: 95% CI 16.9% to 21.6%) and 16.6% (95% CI 14.6% to 18.8%) in the UK. Risk of SMI was among those in quarantine (OR 11.18 (95% CI 4.08 to 30.62); p=0.001) and in younger respondents (OR 2.61 (95% CI 1.01 to 6.79); p=0.048) although the latter effect was significant only in the UK. Risk of SMI was positively associated with self-medication (s=0.17, p=0.001) and negatively with social distancing in China (countrySMI =0.51, p=0.001), with further interactions for age and sex (social distancing), age, marital status and quarantine (self-medication).

This study examines associations of changing COVID-19-related employment conditions with physical activity and sedentary behavior. Methods: Data from 2,303 US adults in employment prior to COVID-19 were collected April 3rd?7th, 2020. Participants reported whether their employment remained unchanged, they were working from home (WFH) when they had not been before, or they lost their job due to the pandemic. Validated questionnaires assessed physical activity, sitting time, and screen time. Linear regression quantified associations of COVID-19-related employment changes with physical activity, sitting time, and screen time, controlling for age, sex, race, BMI, smoking status, marital status, chronic conditions, household location, public health restrictions, and recalled physical activity, sitting time, and screen time prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Compared to those whose employment remained unchanged, participants whose employment changed (either WFH or lost their job) due to COVID-19 reported higher sitting time (WFH: g = 0.153, 95% CI = 0.095C0.210; lost job: g = 0.212, 0.113C0.311) and screen time (WFH: g = 0.158, 0.104C0.212; lost job: g = 0.193, 0.102C0.285).

Intrinsic resistance to oncolysis is found in some cell lines and many primary tumors as a consequence of residual innate immunity to VSV. In resistant-tumor models, VSV oncolytic potential can be reversibly stimulated by combination with epigenetic modulators, such as the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat. Based on this reversible effect of vorinostat, we reasoned that critical host genes involved in oncolysis may likewise be reversibly regulated by vorinostat. A transcriptome analysis in prostate cancer PC3 cells identified a subset of NF-B target genes reversibly regulated by vorinostat, as well as a group of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs). Consistent with the induction of NF-B target genes, vorinostat-mediated enhancement of VSV oncolysis increased hyperacetylation of NF-B RELA/p65. Additional bioinformatics analysis revealed that NF-B signaling also increased the expression of several autophagy-related genes. Kinetically, autophagy preceded apoptosis, and apoptosis was observed only when cells were treated with both VSV and vorinostat. VSV replication and cell killing were suppressed when NF-B signaling was inhibited using pharmacological or genetic approaches. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) enhanced expression of ISGs, and either 3-MA treatment or genetic ablation of the autophagic marker Atg5 decreased VSV replication and oncolysis. Together, these data demonstrate that vorinostat stimulates NF-B activity in a reversible manner via modulation of RELA/p65 signaling, leading to induction of autophagy, suppression of the IFN-mediated response, and subsequent enhancement of VSV replication and apoptosis.","output":"Histone deacetylase inhibitors potentiate vesicular stomatitis virus oncolysis in prostate cancer cells by modulating NF-B-dependent autophagy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The pandemic has had an impact on colorectal cancer surgery in hospitals.

RESULTS: Sixty-seven units participated in the study, with 79.1% of units ceasing some type of activity (32.8% total and 46.3% partial cessation) and 20.9% continuing all surgical activity. In addition, 65% of units used or prolonged neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancer patients and 40% of units performed at least five emergency colorectal cancer surgeries. It was estimated that at least one month of intense surgical activity will be required to catch up.

METHODS: This study involved a retrospective case notes review of patients referred to a single specialist paediatric centre with suspected PIMS-TS, with a focus on clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, treatment, and outcome in the context of an MDT framework. RESULTS: Nineteen children of median age 9.1 years fulfilled the definition of PIMS-TS and were managed within an MDT framework: 5/19 were female; 14/19 were of Black, Asian or minority ethnicity; 9/19 also fulfilled diagnostic criteria for complete or incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD).

To action this, a sexual health knowledge translation (KT) pilot was developed. METHODS: The Relationships, Body image, and Intimacy (RBI) pilot was implemented at four regional cancer centres (RCCs) from January 2018 to February 2020 which focused on medical radiation therapists (MRT(T)s) initiating conversations with radiation therapy patients. MRT(T)s were recruited to be RBI champion role models and were trained on RBI topics, trained fellow MRT(T)s, and modelled best practice for sexual health conversations with cancer patients. Pilot interventions were developed to address barriers to RBI conversations. Both qualitative and quantitative data collection activities were implemented to evaluate pilot interventions. RESULTS: Before the RBI pilot, over 80% of MRT(T)s reported they did not initiate RBI conversations with patients. By the end of the pilot, over 52% of MRT(T)s reported initiating RBI conversations with all or almost all patients. Feedback from patients was positive. Barriers to comfort level with RBI topic were successfully addressed with continued education and training throughout the pilot. DISCUSSION: Results show increased RBI conversations during the pilot, and MRT(T)s reported increased comfort speaking with patients about RBI with continued practice. The RBI champions played a pivotal role in the pilot's success and increased MRT(T) comfort with RBI. Initial barriers to RBI conversations were less reported as the pilot progressed and RBI conversations were normalized for patients. CONCLUSIONS: The RBI pilot was a novel KT initiative focused on supporting MRT(T)s to ensure patients were aware of sexual health resources available to them during their radiation therapy. Knowledge gained from this pilot can easily be adapted to assist other health care providers and additional RCCs to confidently initiate RBI conversations with their patients.","output":"Relationships, body image, and intimacy: A pilot to increase sexual health conversations between radiation therapists and cancer patients in Ontario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?Airports would adjust their charges in different ways to a large demand decline ?Competitive airports would not be able to raise charges but monopoly airports and those subject to many kinds of regulation could do so ?Price increases would be inappropriate from the viewpoint of supporting airline and tourism viability and wider economic benefits such as connectivity ?Governments may need to intervene with regulators ?Where the demand decline is due to government policy, financial assistance for airports may be appropriate","output":"Covid -19, the collapse in passenger demand and airport charges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Strategic Human Resources Management is one of the concepts of how HR management should be carried out in the organization.

Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. FINDINGS: Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 597 (SD 133) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. 32 (615%) patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR 3C11) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older (646 years [112] vs 519 years [129]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81%] patients vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (135%) patients. INTERPRETATION: The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1C2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.

Therefore, the objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between servicescape and the loyalty of fitness center consumers, analyzing through the Importance-Performance Matrix Analysis (IPMA) what the aspects to improve according to gender and age are. The sample was 10,368 fitness center customers (5864 women and 4504 men). After the IPMA, it was concluded that the main improvement margins in general in fitness centers were the equipment and the facility condition, and the facility layout.

The standard method used to pick up laboratory mice for general husbandry and experimental procedures is known as tail handling and involves the capture, elevation and restraint of mice via their tails. There is growing evidence that, compared to non-aversive handling methods (i.e. tunnel and cup), tail handling increases behavioural signs of anxiety and induces anhedonia. Hence tail handling has a negative impact on mouse welfare. Here, we investigated whether repeated scruff restraint, intraperitoneal (IP) injections and anaesthesia negated the reduction in anxiety-related behaviour in tunnel compared with tail handled BALB/c mice. We found that mice which experienced repeated restraint spent less time interacting with a handler compared to mice that were handled only. However, after repeated restraint, tunnel handled mice showed increased willingness to interact with a handler, and reduced anxiety in standard behavioural tests compared with tail handled mice. The type of procedure experienced (IP injection or anaesthesia), and the duration after which behaviour was measured after a procedure affected the willingness of mice to interact with a handler. Despite this, compared with tail handling, tunnel handling reduced anxiety in standard behavioural tests and increased willingness to interact with a handler within hours after procedures. This suggests that the welfare benefits of tunnel handling are widely applicable and not diminished by the use of other putatively more invasive procedures that are frequently used in the laboratory. Therefore, the simple refinement of replacing tail with tunnel handling for routine husbandry and procedures will deliver a substantial improvement for mouse welfare and has the potential for improving scientific outcomes.","output":"Benefits of tunnel handling persist after repeated restraint, injection and anaesthesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 emergency involved a reorganisation within the local facilities for fragile people, such as the homeless Both the facilities - which were only designed for overnight use - and the operators found themselves reorganising their activities and accommodating people in a completely innovative way This led to many challenges in daily life, which have been overcome and seen as opportunities for renewal thanks to networking, in which the psychologist volunteers of the \\"listening service\\" - mobilised by the Associazione Psicologi per i Popoli - Trentino ODV in agreement with the Protezione Civile di Trento, within the Servizio Politiche Sociali's project \\"#Resta a casa, passo io\\" - have also been involved This work involved some reflection, which resulted in a vademecum for operators who dealt with the homeless during the lockdown period","output":"The emergency psychologist in support of shelter facilities: A vademecum for workers dealing with the homeless"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At present, the world economy is in recession, especially under the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic, China's economy has also been greatly impacted.

Recurrent severe seizures begin in infancy and co-morbidities follow, including developmental delay, cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. A majority of DS patients have an SCN1A heterozygous gene mutation. This mutation causes a loss-of-function in inhibitory neurons, initiating seizure onset. We have investigated whether the sodium channelopathy may result in structural changes in the DS model independent of seizures. Morphometric analyses of axons within the corpus callosum were completed at P16 and P50 in Scn1a heterozygote KO male mice and their age-matched wild-type littermates. Trainable machine learning algorithms were used to examine electron microscopy images of 400 myelinated axons per animal, per genotype, including myelinated axon cross-section area, frequency distribution and g-ratios. Pilot data for Scn1a heterozygote KO mice demonstrate the average axon caliber was reduced in developing and adult mice. Qualitative analysis also shows micro-features marking altered myelination at P16 in the DS model, with myelin out-folding and myelin debris within phagocytic cells. The data has indicated, in the absence of behavioral seizures, factors that governed a shift toward small calibre axons at P16 have persisted in adult Scn1a heterozygote KO corpus callosum. The pilot study provides a basis for future meta-analysis that will enable robust estimates of the effects of the sodium channelopathy on axon architecture.

Linear regression models were used to estimate the associations between changes in physical activity and leisure screen time and mental health outcomes by socioeconomic status (SES), adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Compared with maintaining high levels of physical activity or increasing them, decreasing physical activity was associated with higher stress scores overall, and among people of high SES, with higher scores for DASS-21, depression, and anxiety. Among participants of low and medium SES only, increasing screen time was associated with higher DASS-21, depression, anxiety, and stress scores compared with maintaining low or decreasing leisure screen time.

This study introduces a third option, the Social and Ecological Thought approach, which promotes maximizing social and ecological well-being while remaining financially viable. A longitudinal pre-post intervention in a sample of undergraduate management students showed that teaching multiple approaches to managementFinancial Bottom Line, Triple Bottom Line, and Social and Ecological Thoughtresulted in learners becoming less likely to espouse profit-related goals (e.g. to maximize efficiency, productivity, profitability) and more likely to identify nonfinancial ones (e.g. extra-organizational prosociality and reduction of marginalization) when characterizing effective management. However, the results did not support predictions regarding intra-organizational prosociality and marginalization, or power asymmetries. We discuss implications for pedagogy and the future development of POS and CMS.","output":"Teaching multiple approaches to management to facilitate prosocial and environmental well-being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Air leak consisting of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema has been described as one of the complications of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection affecting disease course and outcome. We aimed to conduct a systematic review of published literature to highlight the risk factors, types, and outcomes in COVID-19. METHOD: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar was performed from November 1, 2019, to February 28, 2021. Seventy-one studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 136 adult patients were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: Majority of patients were male (75.2%) with the mean age of 58 years. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity followed by diabetes mellitus. Moreover, 12.5% of patients had a history of smoking while 11.7% had preexisting lung disease. Isolated pneumothorax (48.5%) was the most common and 17.65% had developed spontaneous pneumothorax. Mean onset time was 11.6 days and 67% of patients required an intercostal drainage tube for management. Mortality was 40%, and elderly, female gender, obese and hypertensive were at higher risk. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related air leaks are associated with higher mortality and longer hospital stay and can occur even without positive pressure ventilation. History of smoking and preexisting lung disease has not been shown to increase the incidence of air leak. A well-designed study is required for a better understanding of COVID-19-related air leak.

A baseline model was previously developed and calibrated for pre-COVID conditions as MATSim-NYC. A new COVID model is calibrated that represents travel behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic by recalibrating the population agendas to include work-from-home and re-estimating the mode choice model for MATSim-NYC to fit observed traffic and transit ridership data. Assuming the change in behavior exhibits inertia during reopening, we analyze the increase in car traffic due to the phased reopen plan guided by the state government of New York. Four reopening phases and two reopening scenarios (with and without transit capacity restrictions) are analyzed. A Phase 4 reopening with 100% transit capacity may only see as much as 73% of pre-COVID ridership and an increase in the number of car trips by as much as 142% of pre-pandemic levels. Limiting transit capacity to 50% would decrease transit ridership further from 73% to 64% while increasing car trips to as much as 143% of pre-pandemic levels. While the increase appears small, the impact on consumer surplus is disproportionately large due to already increased traffic congestion. Many of the trips also get shifted to other modes like micromobility. The findings imply that a transit capacity restriction policy during reopening needs to be accompanied by (1) support for micromobility modes, particularly in non-Manhattan boroughs, and (2) congestion alleviation policies that focus on reducing traffic in Manhattan, such as cordon-based pricing.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 behavioral inertia on reopening strategies for New York City Transit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical errors are a major public health concern and a leading cause of death worldwide. Many healthcare centers and hospitals use reporting systems where medical practitioners write a preliminary medical report and the report is later reviewed, revised, and finalized by a more experienced physician. The revisions range from stylistic to corrections of critical errors or misinterpretations of the case. Due to the large quantity of reports written daily, it is often difficult to manually and thoroughly review all the finalized reports to find such errors and learn from them. To address this challenge, we propose a novel ranking approach, consisting of textual and ontological overlaps between the preliminary and final versions of reports. The approach learns to rank the reports based on the degree of discrepancy between the versions. This allows medical practitioners to easily identify and learn from the reports in which their interpretation most substantially differed from that of the attending physician (who finalized the report). This is a crucial step towards uncovering potential errors and helping medical practitioners to learn from such errors, thus improving patient-care in the long run. We evaluate our model on a dataset of radiology reports and show that our approach outperforms both previously-proposed approaches and more recent language models by 4.5% to 15.4%.","output":"Ranking Significant Discrepancies in Clinical Reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review describes targeting neutrophils as a potential therapeutic strategy for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio can serve as a clinical marker for predicting fatal complications related to ARDS in patients with COVID-19. Neutrophil-associated inflammation plays a critical pathogenic role in ARDS. The effector functions of neutrophils, acting as respiratory burst oxidants, granule proteases, and neutrophil extracellular traps, are linked to the pathogenesis of ARDS.

There is no existing literature that focuses on such impact on RD organisations in any jurisdictions, nor RD populations across multiple jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to RD organisations between April and May 2020. Quantitative and qualitative data on the impact of COVID-19 on RD organisations and patients were collected from the organisation representatives perspective. Qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis. A follow-up focus group meeting was conducted in August 2020 to validate the survey findings and to discuss specific needs, support and recommendations for sustainable healthcare systems during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 80 RD organisations from Australia, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, India, Japan, mainland China, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan participated in the study. Of all, 89% were concerned about the impact of pandemic on their organisations. Results indicate that 63% of the organisations functioned at a reduced capacity and 42% stated a decrease in funding as their biggest challenge. Overall, 95% believed their patients were impacted, particularly in healthcare access, social lives, physical health, psychological health and financial impact. Specifically, 43% identified the reduced healthcare access as their top impact, followed by 26% about the impact on daily living and social life. Focus group meeting discussed differential impact across jurisdictions and point towards telemedicine and digitalisation as potential solutions. CONCLUSIONS: This serves as the first study to assess the impact of COVID-19 on RD patients and organisations across multiple jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region, identifying major themes on the impact on both RD patients and organisations. By including 80 organisations from ten jurisdictions, our study presents the most comprehensive assessment of the pandemics impact to date. It highlights the need for mental health support and sheds light on moving towards telemedicine and digitalisation of organisation operation, which constitutes a sustainable model in times of pandemics and beyond.

For SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, data on clinical onset serial intervals is limited, since symptom onset dates are not routinely recorded and do not exist in asymptomatic carriers. METHODS: We define the diagnostic serial interval as the time between the diagnosis dates of the infector and infectee. Based on the DS4C project data on SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in South Korea, we estimate the means of the diagnostic serial interval, the clinical onset serial interval and the difference between the two. We use the balanced cluster bootstrap method to construct 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. RESULTS: The mean of the diagnostic serial interval was estimated to be 3.63 days (95% CI: 3.24, 4.01). The diagnostic serial interval was shown to be significantly shorter than the clinical onset serial interval (estimated mean difference -1.12 days, 95% CI: -1.98, -0.26). CONCLUSIONS: The relatively short diagnostic serial intervals of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in South Korea are likely due to the countrys extensive efforts towards contact tracing.

To understand why people believe and share misinformation, we conducted a nationwide survey during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We found the indirect effects of COVID-19 risk on people's information accuracy judgment and associated information sharing intention through people's emotional states. People faced with a higher level of COVID-19 risk (measured by a 7-day moving average of daily new deaths or new cases) experienced weaker positive and stronger negative emotions, and heightened emotionality (both the positive and negative emotions) was associated with increased belief in and greater likelihood to share the COVID-19 information regardless of veracity. We also found that only the negative emotion mediated the relation between the COVID-19 risk and the truth discernment regarding accuracy judgment. However, the mediating effect of negative emotion disappeared among people with high analytic thinking ability. These findings suggest that the analytic thinking ability could moderate the destructive relationship between negative emotion and accuracy discernment.

The discursive theory of metaphor serves as a theoretical basis for our study. Within the framework of this theory metaphor is referred to as a cognitive frame, which operates in the discursive space for a certain period of time. J. Charteris-Black's Metaphor Critical Analysis has been used for the practical part of this paper. Linguistic analysis is based upon headlines and leads of Chinese and Russian news reports on the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 750 units of analysis in Chinese and 1,000 units of analysis in Russian have been examined. The authors arrive at the conclusion that media projections of the coronavirus image in the PRC and Russia are similar. Among the most widespread metaphorical models are ?Virus is Enemy/Antagonist,? ?Virus is Natural Disaster/Phenomenon,? ?Virus is Living Creature,? and ?Virus is Cause of Fear.? Despite overall homogeneity of metaphorical images, quantitative indicators of the distribution of metaphors and metaphorical implications (entailments) show significant differences. Critical analysis of Chinese and Russian media metaphors has made it possible to scrutinize public opinion within two different political systems.

In most cases these sound detection models are trained on publicly available sound databases, up to now, however, they do not include acoustic data from manufacturing environments. Within manufacturing industries, acoustic data can be exploited in order to evaluate the correct execution of assembling processes. As an example, in this paper the correct plugging of connectors is analyzed on the basis of multimodal contextual process information. The latter are the connectors acoustic properties and visual information recorded in form of video files while executing connector locking processes. For the first time optical microphones are used for the acquisition and analysis of connector sound data in order to differentiate connector locking sounds from each other respectively from background noise and sound events with similar acoustic properties. Therefore, different types of feature representations as well as neural network architectures are investigated for this specific task. The results from the proposed analysis show, that multimodal approaches clearly outperform unimodal neural network architectures for the task of connector locking validation by reaching maximal accuracy levels close to 85[Formula: see text]. Since in many cases there are no additional validation methods applied for the detection of correctly locked connectors in manufacturing industries, it is concluded that the proposed connector lock event detection framework is a significant improvement for the qualitative validation of plugging operations.","output":"Using Multimodal Contextual Process Information for the Supervised Detection of Connector Lock Events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in a number of patients with community-acquired pneumonia in a recent prospective study.

However, the mask adoption rate in the US is still less than optimal. This study aims to understand the beliefs held by individuals who oppose the use of facial masks, and the evidence that they use to support these beliefs, to inform the development of targeted public health communication strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed a total of 771,268 US-based tweets between January to October 2020. We developed machine-learning classifiers to identify and categorize relevant tweets, followed by a qualitative content analysis of a subset of the tweets to understand the rationale of those opposed mask wearing. RESULTS: We identified 267,152 tweets that contained personal opinions about wearing facial masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. While the majority of the tweets supported mask wearing, the proportion of anti-mask tweets stayed constant at about 10% level throughout the study period. Common reasons for opposition included physical discomfort and negative effects, lack of effectiveness, and being unnecessary or inappropriate for certain people or under certain circumstances. The opposing tweets were significantly less likely to cite external sources of information such as public health agencies websites to support the arguments. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Combining machine learning and qualitative content analysis is an effective strategy for identifying public attitudes toward mask wearing and the reasons for opposition. The results may inform better communication strategies to improve the public perception of wearing masks and, in particular, to specifically address common anti-mask beliefs.","output":"Why do people oppose mask wearing?

We aimed to see if responses to therapies using the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score on day 4 after unplanned admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) could be associated with short-term mortality. METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, data from 4 ICUs in a University Hospital included SOFA scores on admission and day 4, along with preadmission measurements of frailty, comorbidities, nutritional status and number of medications. Outcome measures included mortality and loss of autonomy on day 90 after admission. RESULTS: Eighty-seven critically ill patients aged 80 years or older with preadmission functional independence and no missing SOFA score data on day 4 were studied (primary analyses). The mortality rate on day 90 was 30%. In a univariate Cox model, the SOFA score on day 4 was significantly associated with mortality rate: hazard ratio = 1.18 per one-point increase, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08 to 1.28 (p<0.001). A SOFA score of 6 or more on day 4 could correctly classify 75% of patients who died on day 90, with a sensitivity of 54% and a specificity of 84%. After adjustment, the SOFA score on day 4, neurological failure on admission and the number of preadmission medications were significantly associated with mortality on day 90, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.91). These findings were confirmed in a sensitivity analysis with 109 patients. Preadmission frailty was the only variable independently associated with loss of autonomy in the 49 surviving patients.

This underscores the importance of controlling DM through self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) using biosensors. These biosensors, which can be either enzymatic or non-enzymatic, have undergone several rounds of development in terms of the materials used for device construction. In terms of the immobilization agent needed to anchor enzymatic or non-enzymatic detection elements to the electrode surface, marine polysaccharides, such as chitosan and alginate, hold a distinct advantage. This, in turn, can be ascribed to their biocompatibility, chemical stability, film-forming ability, functionality bind with enzymes/diagnostic elements, and easy availability. In this review, we focus extensively on the use of cationic chitosan and anionic alginate in the past decade for designing advanced glucose biosensors. Their role in enhancing sensor response via physical/chemical interactions with the conducting and diagnostic elements is analyzed in detail from a structural point of view. In addition, the possibility of using these polysaccharides in non-invasive CGM sensors is discussed and several potential future research avenues are presented.","output":"Design and development of advanced glucose biosensors via tuned interactions between marine polysaccharides and diagnostic elements C A survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThis article examines the potential of increasing commitment of medical knowledge-workers (medical-KWs) in hospitals, particularly in handling deadly pandemics like COVID-19, through servant leadership behaviour The authors hold that medical-KWs like doctors and nurses form the core team of knowledge-workers (KWs) at the forefront of fighting COVID-19 through seeking possible vaccines, treating patients and promoting behaviours that curtail its spread Thus research directed towards enhancing their continued commitment is both timely and valuable Design/methodology/approachThe study uses an explanatory cross-sectional survey design FindingsResults reveal that servant leadership behaviour significantly explains changes in commitment of medical-KWs Results further establish that perceived fairness C a key psychological factor C significantly explains how servant leadership enhances the commitment of medical-KWs Research limitations/implicationsData used were sourced from medical-KWs in selected public hospitals only Thus results may differ among medical-KWs in private hospitals, yet they have also championed the fight against COVID-19 Never the less these results provide a direction of thought to guide practice and other related studies on a wider-scale Practical implicationsIn their quest to eradicate COVID-19 and its negative effects on social-economic development, nations have to actively promote servant leadership behaviour in the hospitals (by establishing quality relationships, credibility and efficient processes for delivering the shared goal) as mechanisms for sustaining the continued commitment of medical-KWs towards fighting the pandemic Originality/valueResults portray events from an economy that has registered successes in combating pandemics like Ebola and currently COVID-19 and thus offer a plausible benchmark for practice","output":"Towards fighting COVID-19: can servant leadership behaviour enhance commitment of medical knowledge-workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic onset, many routine medical activities have been put on hold and this has deeply affected the management of patients with chronic diseases such as obstructive sleep apnea. Untreated OSA is associated with increased mortality and difficulties in social functioning. A delay in initiating treatment may therefore have harmful consequences. Between February and April 2020, the so-called first wave of the pandemic, the overall activity of sleep centers in Europe was reduced by 80%. As the international infection control authorities released guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 outbreak control, many of the national sleep societies provided strategies for a gradual re-opening of sleep facilities. Most of these strategies were not evidences-based and, in a climate of general concern, worldwide it was strongly advised to post-pone any non-urgent sleep-related procedure. Despite the initial idea that the outbreak could be transient, after one year it is still ongoing and the price we are paying, not only includes deaths caused by COVID-19, but also deaths caused by missed or late diagnosis. As further delays in diagnosing and treating patients with sleep apnea are no more acceptable, a new arrangement of sleep facilities and resources, in order to operate safely and effectively, is now mandatory. In this article, we review most recent literature and guidelines in order to provide practical advice for a new arrangement of sleep laboratories and the care of patients with obstructive sleep apnea after one year from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Continuum of care for patients with obstructive sleep apnea after one year from the COVID-19 pandemic onset: no time for further delays Practical issues for a safe and effective management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Faeces samples from calves with diarrhoea in 45 outbreaks were examined for six enteropathogens.

There was a significant statistical association of disease with the presence of rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium and Salmonella species (P less than 0.001). Healthy calves were not examined for calici-like viruses and the association of K99+ E coli with disease was not analysed because there were too few positive samples. Rotavirus infections were more common in dairy herds and single suckler beef herds whereas Salmonella infections were more often found in calf rearing units. Cryptosporidium were more common in single and multiple suckler beef herds. K99+ E coli were found in one dairy herd and one multiple suckler beef herd both with unhygienic calving accommodation. Variations in coronavirus detection among different farm types were not statistically significant. In this survey rotavirus was the most commonly detected agent in calf diarrhoea and Cryptosporidium were found in approximately one quarter of affected calves.

The present study aimed to measure the length of the extensor mechanism and to assess the effect of limb position on the quadriceps muscle length (QML)/femoral bone length (FL) ratio. STUDY DESIGN: Three-dimensional computed tomography images were taken of 12 Beagle dogs. Each dog underwent computed tomographic imaging 24 times with different limb positions. The QML/FL was measured on each image, along with the hip flexion-extension, hip abduction-adduction and stifle flexion-extension angles. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the effect of these angles on the QML/FL. RESULTS: The QML/FL was increased with the hip extended (standardized partial regression coefficient 0.855 with linear plotting, 0.829 with log plotting) and with the stifle flexed (standardized partial regression coefficient 0.814 with linear plotting, 0.800 with log plotting). The partial regression coefficient of the hip abduction-adduction angle was small, indicating a small impact on the QML/FL. The 95% confidence range of the QML/FL with the hip extended and stifle flexed was 0.87 to 1.00 (mean  standard deviation: 0.93  0.03). CONCLUSION: The QML/FL was more influenced by joint angles when the hip was flexed or the stifle was extended. Hence, these positions should be avoided when evaluating the QML/FL so that the QML is less altered by slight positioning disparities.","output":"Effect of Limb Position on Measurements of the Quadriceps Muscle Length/Femoral Length Ratio in Normal Beagle Dogs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Critically ill patients often undergo unpleasant procedures. We quantified the effects of an unpleasant stimulus on physiological and behavioral parameters and evaluated how they are modified by sedation and analgesia. METHODS A 6-month study in the 30-bed intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital examined 21 sedated patients from various diagnostic groups. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, pupil size, facial expression, muscle tone, body movement, and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score were measured before and during intratracheal suctioning, first in sedated patients, after sedation was stopped, and after an opioid bolus. RESULTS Before intratracheal suctioning, patients had RASS scores of -1.8  1.2 (mean  standard deviation; sedation), -0.6  1.7 (sedation stop), and -0.9  1.4 (analgesia) (P = 0.014). Intratracheal suctioning significantly increased RASS during both sedation (to -0.6  1.7) and sedation stop (to 1.0  1.5) (both P < 0.01), but not during analgesia. Systolic blood pressure increased during sedation (by 9  10 mmHg), during sedation stop (by 15  17 mmHg) and during analgesia (by 9  4 mmHg; all P < 0.01), but diastolic pressure only during sedation and sedation stop (both P < 0.01). Facial expression, body movement, and muscle tone changed significantly during the episodes of intratracheal suctioning. Heart rate, tidal volume, and pupil size remained stable under all conditions. CONCLUSIONS Intratracheal suctioning evoked significant changes in some physiological and behavioral parameters. Some physiological changes were suppressed by analgesia, but at our ICU's standard doses, neither analgesia nor sedation attenuated changes in behavioral parameters at the intensity tested.","output":"Assessment of pain in sedated and mechanically ventilated patients: an observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Research summary The discovery of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the spread of COVID-19 have led many governments to take drastic measures. The lockdown of large parts of society and economic life has come as an exogenous shock to many economic actors, not least innovative startups. This rapid response research combines a qualitative research design informed by entrepreneurial ecosystem actors with an analysis of policy measures called for, announced, and reportedly implemented in the international press. Interviews from an entrepreneurial ecosystem offer a first-hand account of the adversity startups face during a crisis and how by utilizing bricolage responses they cope, and the analysis of policy measures can serve as an inspiration to design support initiatives to protect startups from the consequences of the current lockdown and to alleviate the effects of future crises. Managerial summary The lockdown measures as a response to the spread of the new coronavirus threaten the existence of many innovative startups. Our rapid response research first illustrates the challenges entrepreneurs face as a consequence of the crisis. Second, we illustrate how entrepreneurs are dealing with the effects of the crisis and what they are doing to protect their ventures. Finally, we present measures that could be utilized by policymakers to assist entrepreneurs facing challenges. The research conducted suggests that while startups are successfully leveraging their available resources as a first response to the crisis, their growth and innovation potential are at risk. Therefore, policy measures should not only provide first aid to startups by alleviating the pressure caused by constrained cashflow, but also involve long-term measures embedded in and supported by the wider entrepreneurial ecosystem to ensure rapid recovery and growth.","output":"Startups in times of crisis C A rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic presented high mortality from its beginning, without effective treatment for seriously ill patients Build on the experience in Argentine hemorrhagic fever with convalescent plasma, we incorporated 90 patients with COVID-19, of which 87 were evaluable, into a multicenter study We collected 397 plasma donations from 278 convalescent donors Patients received plasma with an IgG concentration of 0 7-0 8 (measured by Abbott chemiluminescence) for every 10 kg of body weight Survival during the first 28 days was the primary objective;77% were male, age 54  15 6 y/o (range 27-85), body mass index 29 7  4 4;hypertension 39% and diabetes 20 7%;19 5% had an immunosuppressive condition, 23% were health workers Plasma was administered to 55 (63%) on spontaneous breathing with oxygen supplementation (mainly oxygen mask with reservoir bag in 80%), and to 32 patients (37%) on mechanical ventilation The 28-day survival rate was 80%;91% in patients infused on spontaneous breathing and 63% in those on mechanical ventilation (p = 0 0002) There was a significant improvement in the WHO pneumonia clinical scale at 7 and 14 days, and in PaO2 / FiO2, ferritin and LDH, in the week post-infusion We observed an episode of circulatory volume overload and a febrile reaction, both mild Convalescent plasma infusions are feasible, safe, and potentially effective, especially before requiring mechanical ventilation They are an attractive clinical option for treating severe forms of COVID-19 until other effective therapies become available La pandemia de COVID-19, present desde su inicio elevada mortalidad, sin tratamiento efectivo para pacientes graves Basados en experiencia previa con plasma de convaleciente en fiebre hemorrgica Argentina, incorporamos a un estudio multicntrico 90 pacientes con COVID-19 de los que 87 fueron evaluables Colectamos 397 donaciones de plasma de 278 convalecientes El plasma fue suministrado con una concentracin de IgG de 0 7-0 8 (medidos por quimioluminiscencia Abbott) por cada 10 kg/ peso La supervivencia a 28 das fue la variable de resultado primario El 77% fueron varones, edad 54  15 6 a?os (rango: 27-85);ndice de masa corporal de 29 7  4 4;tenan hipertensin 39%, diabetes 20 7%;19 5% tenan alguna condicin de inmunosupresin, y el 23% era personal de salud Se administr plasma a 55 (63%) en respiracin espontnea con oxgeno (con mscara reservorio en 80%), y a 32 (37%) en ventilacin mecnica La supervivencia global a 28 das fue del 80%;91% en quienes reciban oxgeno suplementario y 63% en los que permanecan en ventilacin mecnica (p = 0 0002) Hubo mejora significativa en la escala clnica de neumona de la OMS a los 7 y a los 14 das La ferritina, LDH y PaO2/FiO2, mejoraron en la semana post-infusin Observamos un episodio de sobrecarga de volumen circulatorio y una reaccin febril, leves Las infusiones de plasma de convaleciente son factibles, seguras y potencialmente efectivas, especialmente antes de requerir ventilacin mecnica Constituyen una opcin clnica atractiva para tratar formas graves de COVID-19 hasta que estn disponibles otras terapias eficaces","output":"Convalescent plasma as a therapy for severe COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Somatic symptoms are one of the most common complaints among patients with psychiatric disorders and are considered as one of the most common psychiatric disorders in the new coronavirus pandemic.

METHODS Using a prospective database, we identified all patients who underwent robotic surgery performed by the Gynecologic Oncology service at 1 institution between December 2006 and March 2010. Records of patients with confirmed malignancy were reviewed for clinicopathological data and information about port-site metastasis. RESULTS One hundred eighty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 55.4 years (range, 19-82 years), and the median body mass index was 29.6 kg/m2 (range, 17.9-70.7 kg/m2). Port-site metastases were detected in 2 patients (1.1%) at 3 weeks (patient 1) and 11 months (patient 2) after surgery. Patient 1 underwent surgery for an adnexal mass, and pathological examination revealed gallbladder adenocarcinoma metastatic to the ovary. She had a recurrence in the right lateral abdominal wall robotic trocar site with concurrent metastases in the gallbladder fossa and liver. Patient 2 was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of unclear (cervical vs endometrial) origin. Imaging showed metastases in pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes. She underwent laparoscopy and was found intraoperatively to have gross disease on the right ovary. The patient underwent right salpingo-oophorectomy and chemoradiation. She had residual disease in the cervix and subsequently underwent robotic hysterectomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy. Pathological examination revealed endometrial cancer. She had a recurrence at the transumbilical trocar site concurrent with retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and carcinomatosis. There were no cases of isolated port-site metastasis.

To review a literature published over the past 5 years and our own data on the etiology of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), antimicrobial resistance and its relationships between sepsis and choice of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Materials and methods. National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) criteria were used to diagnose LRTI. A review of the articles regarding LRTI from the Russian and international English language journals published over 6 years was performed. Identification of microorganisms was performed by culture over the period of 2003-2013;since 2014, MALDI-TOF MS method was used for this purpose. Results. Despite the ongoing policy to limit the use of antimicrobial therapy in the ICUs, there is an increase in carbapenemase-producing isolates in the ICUs from 2.2% (2018) to 11.7% (2020, 9 months). Along with the trend to increase in carbapenemase-producing pathogens causing LRTI, their variability is also increasing. In particular, it applies to strains producing carbapenemases OXA-48 or combination of OXA- 48 with KPC;with the trend to combined production of carbapenemase beginning at 2019. Conclusions. Carbapenemase producers are becoming more widespread in the ICU settings, including the lower respiratory tract in mechanically ventilated patients. Practitioners didnt get used to associate VAP with the Sepsis-3 criteria. The changes in etiology include the increased rate of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria, primarily Acinetobacter spp., in Russia. Its due to improved quality of respiratory support and increased consumption of carbapenems, tigecycline and polymyxins. Significant increase of OXA-48-producing pathogens is likely to be associated with a poor compliance with temporary guidelines on COVID-19 with regard to antibiotic therapy. ? 2021, Interregional Association for Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.

Summary The almost pandemic spread of cannabis among adolescents and young adults, especially in France, justifies the attention given to the consequences, not only acute but also delayed, of this intoxication. In the latter case, epigenetic mechanisms occur. We will first recall various types of epigenetic modifications involving either chromatin histones, mainly methylations or acetylations; either DNA, by methylation of cytosines. Such modifications caused by the tetrahydrocannabinol/THC of cannabis can intervene: either at the level of gametes before procreation, or at different points of the life cycle. These epigenetic modifications are associated with an increase in vulnerability to drug addiction, involving dopamine D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens, overexpression of enkephalin precursor synthesis, modifications of: CB1 receptors of endocannabinoids, glutamic acid receptors, GABA receptors, proteins involved in synaptic plasticity ...

Additionally, we integrate studies about differences in antibody neutralization to SARS-CoV-2 variants to understand how variants can affect the durability of the vaccine. The estimated days after first injection for binding antibodies to fall below levels of those from day 15 is 411 days. The estimated days after first injection to fall below the lower limit of detection of 20 GMTs is 327 days for pseudovirus neutralization and 461 days for live virus neutralization. Our model has pseudovirus neutralization against variant B.1.351 falling below 20 GMT on day 100; variant P.1 on day 202, variant B.1.429 on day 258; and variant B.1.1.7 on day 309. The data used contains many limitations including the small sample size with older age bias, sensitivity of the neutralization assays, and limited data on variants. Still, we believe mRNA-1273 two dose vaccine can provide over a year of protection against COVID-19 from the initial D614G variant. It is likely by the second year, protection against COVID-19 will fall below single dose efficacy. Therefore, there should be consideration for a booster shot a year after the first set of vaccines. If there is an observed increase in variants with higher resistance such as B.1.351 and P.1, a booster vaccine against the newer variants should be considered to increase protection against resistant variants.","output":"Modeling and Predicting Antibody Durability for mRNA-1273 Vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction En France, une 3e dose systmatique de vaccin anti-SARS-CoV-2 a t recommande chez les patients fortement immunodprims, sans obligation dvaluer la rponse srologique avant la 3e dose malgr les incertitudes concernant lefficacit de cette mesure chez les patients ayant une dpltion lymphocytaire B persistante.

In Spring of 2020, private laboratories and some hospitals began antibody testing despite lacking evidence-based guidance. Objective: To describe clinician-described indications for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, including cost implications, immediately following testing availability. Design: Retrospective chart review of patients who received antibody testing from May 14, 2020 to June 15, 2020. Setting: A large academic medical center, one of the first in the US to provide antibody testing capability to individual clinicians. Patients: 447 consecutive patients who received SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Measurements: Clinician-described indications for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, cost implications, and comparison with current expert-based guidance from the IDSA and CDC. Results: Of 444 individual antibody test results meeting inclusion criteria, the two most commonly described indications for ordering the antibody test, apart from public health epidemiology studies (n=223), were for patients with a now resolved COVID-19 compatible illness (n=105) with no previous molecular testing and in asymptomatic patients believed to have had a past exposure or contact with a person with COVID-19 compatible illness (n=60). The rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing among those indications consistent with current IDSA and CDC guidance was 17% compared with 5% (p<0.0001) among those indications inconsistent with current IDSA and CDC guidance. Total cost estimates ranged from $57,720 to $97,680, of which 42% was for testing inconsistent with current expert-based guidance. Limitations: The duration of antibody response following infection is unclear and asymptomatic individuals may not develop a positive antibody response. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate a dissociation between clinician described indications for testing and expert-based guidance and a significantly different rate of positive testing between these two groups. Clinical curiosity and patient preference appear to have played a significant role in testing decisions and substantially contributed to testing costs.","output":"Clinical Ordering Practices of the SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test at a Large Academic Medical Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Hypercoagulability may be a key mechanism of death in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Aims: To examine incidence of radiographically-confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) and major bleeding in a large nationally-representative U S cohort and assess whether therapeutic anticoagulation affects survival Methods: In a 67-center cohort study of 3239 critically ill adults with COVID-19, we examined incidence of VTE and major bleeding within 14 days following intensive care unit (ICU) admission We identified predictors of VTE using multivariable logistic regression To estimate the effect of therapeutic anticoagulation on 28-day mortality, we emulated a target trial in which critically ill patients with COVID-19 were assigned to receive or not receive therapeutic anticoagulation in the first two days of ICU admission (FIGURE 1) We adjusted for confounding using a Cox model with inverse probability weighting Results: Patients' median age was 61 years (IQR, 53-71) and 2088 (64 5%) were male 204 patients (6 3%) developed VTE, and 90 (2 8%) had a major bleeding event Independent predictors of VTE were male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1 70;95% CI, 1 05-2 77), severe obesity (OR 2 08;95% CI, 1 17-3 70 for body mass index  40 0 versus 10,000 versus 0 ng/ml) Among 2809 patients included in the target trial emulation, 384 (11 9%) received therapeutic anticoagulation in the first two days of ICU admission In the primary analysis, during a median follow-up of 27 days, patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation had a similar risk of death asthose who did not (hazard ratio, 1 12;95% CI, 0 92 to 1 35), FIGURE 2A Results were similar in subgroup analyses, FIGURE 2B Conclusions: Among 3239 critically ill adults with COVID-19, the 14-day incidence of VTE and major bleeding were 6 3% and 2 8% Receipt of therapeutic anticoagulation early after ICU admission did not affect survival","output":"Thrombosis, bleeding, and the effect of anticoagulation on survival in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research focuses on the initial results of the survey conducted to define the importance and attraction of a case study as a part of E-learning L2 University program course for Bachelor technical students in Russia The task was included into the course as it considered to be one of the most productive tasks of E-learning educational programs for students offered by internationally recognized universities The case study includes the problem-based learning, and can be used at any educational stage as an interdisciplinary type of work Thus, it allows to include the case study into the L2 course to help technical students form and support communicative and professional skills using a foreign language The necessity and timeliness of such a research work is based on the fact that modern higher education in developed and developing countries has to become resistant to unexpected challenges connected with huge force-majeure evens, like COVID-19 case, dramatically influencing traditionally stable systems ? 2020 ACM","output":"Case study and its role among most productive tasks in e-learning english as a second language course for technical students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Impairment of health after overcoming the acute phase of COVID-19 is being observed more and more frequently.

We, therefore investigated, whether GPCR-fAABs are detectable in 31 patients suffering from different Long-COVID-19 symptoms after recovery from the acute phase of the disease. The spectrum of symptoms was mostly of neurological origin (29/31 patients), including post-COVID-19 fatigue, alopecia, attention deficit, tremor and others. Combined neurological and cardiovascular disorders were reported in 17 of the 31 patients. Two recovered COVID-19 patients were free of follow-up symptoms. All 31 former COVID-19 patients had between 2 and 7 different GPCR-fAABs that acted as receptor agonists. Some of those GPCR-fAABs activate their target receptors which cause a positive chronotropic effect in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, the read-out in the test system for their detection (bioassay for GPCR-fAAB detection). Other GPCR-fAABs, in opposite, cause a negative chronotropic effect on those cells.

Anti-S antibody titers correlated with the frequency of S-specific BMPCs obtained from bone marrow aspirates of 18 SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients 7 to 8 months after infection. S-specific BMPCs were not detected in aspirates from 11 healthy subjects with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We demonstrate that S-binding BMPCs are quiescent, indicating that they are part of a long-lived compartment.

Recovery from alphavirus encephalitis can occur without apparent neurological damage through the effects of antibody and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). To establish an in vitro cell culture system that will allow the study of mechanisms of IFN-gamma-mediated control of Sindbis virus (SINV) replication in neurons, we have characterized the susceptibility to SINV infection and IFN-gamma responsiveness of two neuronal cell lines that can be differentiated in vitro: CSM14.1, a rat nigral cell line, and NSC34, a mouse motor neuron cell line. Undifferentiated CSM14.1 and NSC34 cells were permissive for SINV and susceptible to virus-induced cell death. With differentiation, CSM14.1 cells reduced virus replication and became progressively resistant to virus-induced cell death, resulting in prolonged virus replication. NSC34 cells did not differentiate completely and became only partially resistant to SINV infection. Both CSM14.1 and NSC34 cells responded to pretreatment with IFN-gamma by decreasing SINV replication. Differentiated CSM14.1 cells treated 24 h after infection with IFN-gamma responded with increased cell viability and clearance of infectious virus. IFN-gamma treatment sequentially altered the ratio of genomic to subgenomic viral RNA synthesis, promoted recovery of cellular protein synthesis, reduced viral protein synthesis, and inhibited viral RNA transcription within 24 h after treatment. We conclude that CSM14.1 cells provide an excellent model for the study of IFN-gamma-mediated noncytolytic clearance of SINV from mature neurons.","output":"Gamma interferon-dependent, noncytolytic clearance of sindbis virus infection from neurons in vitro."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is unarguably the biggest catastrophe of the 21st century, probably the most significant global crisis after the second world war.

For this, one cell line containing caveolae (HeLa) and other not containing (Caco-2) were used.

The cholesterol distribution was evaluated by filipin staining. The caveolin-1 expression was evaluated by Western Blotting. Ouabain had no effect on the total membrane lipid content in both cell lines. However, 21-BD increased total membrane phospholipid content and had no effect on the membrane cholesterol content in Caco-2 cells. CTS were not able to alter the specific phospholipids content. In the filipin experiments, 21-BD provoked a remarkable redistribution of cholesterol to the perinuclear region of HeLa cells. In Caco-2 cells, it was observed only a slight increase in cholesterol, especially as intracellular vesicles. The caveolin-1 expression was not altered by any of the compounds. Our data mainly show different effects of two cardiotonic steroids.

Furthermore, MHV spike protein bound to nonraftraft membrane at 4 degrees C but shifted to lipid rafts at 37 degrees C, indicating a redistribution of membrane following virus binding. Thus, the lipid raft involvement in MHV entry occurs at a step following virus binding. We also found that the viral spike protein in the plasma membrane of the infected cells was associated with lipid rafts, whereas that in the Golgi membrane, where MHV matures, was not. Moreover, the buoyant density of the virion was not changed when MHV was produced from the cholesterol-depleted cells, suggesting that MHV does not incorporate lipid rafts into the virion. These results indicate that MHV release does not involve lipid rafts. However, MHV spike protein has an inherent ability to associate with lipid rafts. Correspondingly, cell-cell fusion induced by MHV was retarded by cholesterol depletion, consistent with the association of the spike protein with lipid rafts in the plasma membrane. These findings suggest that MHV entry requires specific interactions between the spike protein and lipid rafts, probably during the virus internalization step.","output":"Murine coronavirus requires lipid rafts for virus entry and cell-cell fusion but not for virus release."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the association between physical activity (PA) and sitting time on adults' mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety and wellbeing) and the influence of mediators and confounders. Methods: An online survey was disseminated in the UK between May and June 2020. A total of 284 participants (33.5  12.4 years) self-reported their PA, sitting time and mental health through validated questionnaires. Results: Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that being of younger age, female, on a lower income, with one or more comorbid health conditions, with a previous diagnosis of mood disorder and increased sitting time independently correlated with higher depression scores (F (13,219) = 12.31, p < 0.001), and explained 42% of the variance. Similar results were found for wellbeing where socio-demographic, health outcomes and sitting time influenced the subjective wellbeing (F (14,218) = 5.77, p < 0.001, 27% variance), although only socio-demographic and health outcomes contributed to the variation in anxiety score (F (13,219) = 7.84, p < 0.001, 32% variance). PA did not explain variation when sitting time was taken into account in any of the models. Combined analysis revealed that participants with lower sedentary time (< 8 h) and with both low or moderate and high PA presented a significantly lower depression score [low PA: (B = -2.7, 95% CI -4.88, -0.52); moderate and high PA (B = -2.7, -4.88, -0.52)].

The IgA was peaked in 10-15 days after admission, and IgG was peaked at the time of admission time while HRCT and chest PA & LAT (posteroanterior oblique and lateral views) were peaked in 20-25 days after admission. We found that the time difference between their peaks was about 10 days. Viral RNA detection results showed that the positive rate in sputum and feces were the highest. Blood gas analysis showed that deterioration of hypoxia with the enlargement of pulmonary exudation area.

We observe that the submodels exhibit forward as well as backward bifurcations under provision restriction. Further, we derive thresholds for resource limitations regulating the dynamical behavior of the systems while analyzing the stability of endemic equilibrium of the models with single infections. Sophisticated simulation approaches are implemented to discover the influences of provision-restricted medication and awareness on dual epidemic. Our findings convey the persistence of co-infection though the basic reproduction number is below unity, if the provision restriction remains uncurbed. An observable insight is that, in spite of having epidemic threshold less than unity and no limitation in TB treatment, co-infection relapses and persists in the population, when there is no awareness attempt. Numerical findings emphasize the urgent need of increased treatment accessibility and importance of awareness in the current situation.

Moreover, we demonstrate that SLC7A11 expression is a novel and robust predictive biomarker for APR-246, a first-in-class mutant-p53 reactivator that also binds and depletes glutathione in tumours, triggering lipid peroxidative cell death. Importantly, system xC- antagonism strongly synergizes with APR-246 to induce apoptosis in mutant-p53 tumours. We propose a new paradigm for targeting cancers that accumulate mutant-p53 protein by inhibiting the SLC7A11-glutathione axis.","output":"Inhibiting the system xC-/glutathione axis selectively targets cancers with mutant-p53 accumulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Believed to be zoonotic in origin, COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus subtype, which spreads from person to person through droplet transmission. As of late April, 2020, 895,766 cases of COVID-19 infections were recorded in the United States. This infection was responsible for 50,439 deaths. Because of close, person-to-person proximity, coupled with possible contact with body fluids, transmission of COVID-19 during sexual activity is possible. However, some activities carry higher risks of transmission than others.

The optimal individual preemptive or intraoperative anesthetic modality on postoperative pain control is not well-known. PURPOSE: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis comparing postoperative pain scores (visual analog scale [VAS]), opioid consumption, and incidence of complications during the first 24 hours after primary ACLR in patients receiving spinal anesthetic, adjunct regional nerve blocks, or local analgesics. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Biosis Previews, SPORTDiscus, Ovid, PEDRO, and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched from inception to March 2020 for human studies, using a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist. Inclusion criteria consisted of (1) level 1 studies reporting on the use of spinal anesthesia, adjunct regional anesthesia (femoral nerve block [FNB] or adductor canal block [ACB]), or local analgesia in patients undergoing primary ACLR and (2) studies reporting on patient-reported VAS, opioid consumption, and incidence of complications related to anesthesia within the first 24 hours after surgery. Non-level 1 studies, studies utilizing a combination of anesthetic modalities, and those not reporting outcomes during the first 24 hours were excluded. Data were synthesized, and a random effects meta-analysis was performed to determine postoperative pain, opioid use, and complications based on anesthetic modality at multiple time points (0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24 hours). RESULTS: A total of 263 studies were screened, of which 27 level 1 studies (n = 16 regional blocks; n = 12 local; n = 4 spinal) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. VAS scores were significantly lower in patients receiving a regional block as compared with spinal anesthesia 8 to 12 hours after surgery (P < .01), patients receiving an FNB versus ACB at 12 to 24 hours (P < .01), and those treated with a continuous FNB rather than single-shot regional blocks (FNB, ACB) at 12 to 24 hours (P < .01). No significant difference in VAS was appreciated when spinal, regional, and local anesthesia groups were compared. CONCLUSION: Based on evidence from level 1 studies, pain control after primary ACLR based on VAS was significantly improved at 8 to 12 hours in patients receiving regional anesthesia as compared with spinal anesthesia. Pain scores were significantly lower at 12 to 24 hours in patients receiving FNB versus ACB and those treated with continuous FNB rather than single-shot regional anesthetic.","output":"Contribution of Multimodal Analgesia to Postoperative Pain Outcomes Immediately After Primary Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Level 1 Randomized Clinical Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Issue For several weeks, prophylactic messages against the extension of Covid-19 have saturated the public space To protect populations, efficient measures have been rapidly put to limit the movement of people and manufactured goods These policies have reduced global greenhouse gas emissions as well as air pollution, especially in China Problem If climate change were an epidemic, we would probably have already restored it But it results directly from the thermo-industrial activities linked to the consumption society For Friel (Lancet, 2020), the dramatic consequences of this disturbances have to be considered as an essential health issue She advocates for 'climate change and health alliances' Results Within such alliances, health professionals have the responsibility (1) to describe the morbidity inherent in our thermo-industrial societies (2) to alert populations, and (3) to work with allies to tackle climate change and protect human populations, starting with the most vulnerable This type of alliance is underway in the battle against air pollution, as it has been for years for fighting smoking Alliances are intended to extend to all population health issues, with a complete decompartmentalization of minds and practices at large scale Lessons Health professionals have to be mindful not to cause any harm while practicing The health system alone produces up to 8% of global greenhouse gas in developed countries (Pichler, 2019;HCWH, 2019) There is room for action Since 2009, the British health care system (NHS) has adopted an efficient decarbonation policy, reducing global emission from 8 to 4%, but this outstanding initiative remains an exception worldwide Key messages A review of public health strategies is necessary to meet the energy, environmental and health issues, both in terms of health risks due to climate change and of decarbonation of care activities Health professionals have the responsibility to alert populations and to work with allies to tackle climate change and protect human populations","output":"Climate change and health: time for action!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims The restrictions experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic had impacts on how clinical teaching and assessment is conducted. The Royal College of Psychiatrists decided to run the final part of the membership exam, the Clinical Assessment of Skills and Competencies (CASC) online for the first time in September 2020. We aimed to prepare candidates in the Northern Ireland deanery for this by developing a virtual mock examination using the Zoom platform. Method In previous years, higher psychiatry trainees in the Northern Ireland deanery have run successful face to face mock examinations to help pre-membership trainees prepare for the CASC. We adapted some of this material to our virtual examination. 16 stations were run in total, in two circuits of eight. These stations were mapped to the Royal College CASC blueprint. Higher trainees were recruited to act as examiners, with core trainees acting as simulated patients. The mock examination was advertised through the local deanery and all candidates sitting in September availed of the opportunity (a total of 8 trainees). Zoom was used as the platform due to ease of use, familiarity and breakout room function. Each station formed one breakout room, and a facilitator moved candidates between rooms and provided timing prompts. Instructions were emailed to candidates in advance. A comfort break was provided between circuits. At the end of the mock examination, everyone was returned to the main room and examiners gave general feedback and tips. Individual feedback was provided by collating mark schemes for each candidate, which included free text feedback, and sending these via email. Result Despite the evident challenges involved, the mock CASC ran smoothly. There was one minor delay of approximately 3 minutes due to technical difficulties, which was easily recouped. We obtained qualitative feedback from candidates which was positive, with trainees commenting that they felt more at ease  less worried about a digital exam, and that it was efficient and effective. All candidates who sat the mock examination were successful in the face to face CASC sitting which followed in September. Conclusion We were able to successfully adapt what was previously an in-person mock CASC exam to the new digital format in a way that reflected how the actual CASC exam will run, and it was considered beneficial preparation by the candidates who sat this mock.

Cleavage of S generates a polybasic Arg-Arg-Ala-Arg C-terminal sequence on S1, which conforms to a C-end rule (CendR) motif that binds to cell surface Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) receptors. Here, we used X-ray crystallography and biochemical approaches to show that the S1 CendR motif directly bound NRP1. Blocking this interaction using RNAi or selective inhibitors reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry and infectivity in cell culture.

In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 type B a long hairpin containing a three-nucleotide bulge is responsible for efficient frameshifting. This three-nucleotide bulge separates the hairpin in two domains: an unstable lower stem followed by a GC-rich upper stem. Toeprinting and chemical probing assays suggest that a hairpin-like structure is retained when ribosomes, initially bound at the slippery sequence, were allowed multiple EF-G catalyzed translocation cycles. However, while the upper stem remains intact the lower stem readily melts. After the first, and single step of translocation of deacylated tRNA to the 30 S P site, movement of the mRNA stem-loop in the 5 direction is halted, which is consistent with the notion that the downstream secondary structure resists unfolding. Mechanical stretching of the hairpin using optical tweezers only allows clear identification of unfolding of the upper stem at a force of 12.8  1.0 pN. This suggests that the lower stem is unstable and may indeed readily unfold in the presence of a translocating ribosome.","output":"Interaction of the HIV-1 frameshift signal with the ribosome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is noted that 2020 will go down in history as the year of pandemia of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 The data on the number of confirmed cases of the disease and the number of deaths in the world are giv-en Measures to counter the spread of COVID-19 in the Russian Federation are presented The characteristics of the disease are given: clinical symptoms, clinical variants and manifestations, forms of the disease, etc The content is con-sidered of the measures that are necessary to prevent the spread of a new coronavirus infection on the territory of the Russian Federation ?

We conducted a series of surveys based on open and closed questions. Before the pandemic, surveys were carried out in situ in eight parks of six districts, randomly chosen. During the confinement, online surveys were conducted. According to our results, the mean UGS density in CABA is 6.09 m2 /person, but marked differences between districts exist, ranging from 0.02 m2 /person to 17.68 m2 /person. This uneven distribution causes differences in the quality of life of CABA inhabitants, perhaps more pronounced during reduced-mobility situations like COVID-19 confinement. Socio economic analysis were done linking multidimensional poverty, COVID-19 positive cases and urban mobility in CABA. Regarding UGS visitors, before the confinement, the majority of respondents were employees or students;during the confinement, employees and retirees predominated. When asked to choose important attributes to describe their perception about the UGS from a given list, respondents selected calm, green, and sounds of nature, without differences before and during the confinement. However, when asked about the UGS role, the main answer was a place to be with nature before the confinement and an important place in the city during it.

METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive patients with COVID-19, confirmed by nucleic acid testing, were enrolled from two designated hospitals outside the district of disease origin. We collected clinical, laboratory, and CT data and assessed the concordance between CT manifestations and nucleic acid test results by comparing the percentage of patients with and without abnormal CT findings. Furthermore, using Chi-square tests, we analyzed the differences in CT manifestations between patients with and without an exposure history or symptoms. RESULTS: Multiple ground-glass opacities (GGOs), with or without consolidation, were observed on the initial CT scans of 19 patients (82.6%), whereas the remaining 4 (17.4%) showed no CT abnormalities, indicating that the initial chest CT findings were not entirely concordant with the nucleic acid test results in diagnosing COVID-19. Among the latter 4 patients, we observed multiple GGOs with and without consolidation in 2 patients on the follow-up chest CT scans taken on days 7 and 14 after admission, respectively.

Inactivation of ACE2 following binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to ACE2-R in situ might blunt ACE2-moderating effects upon ACE CNS neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Here, we propose a neurobiological mechanism directly involving SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2-R in the etiology of putative Neuro-CoViD-19.","output":"Towards Neuro-CoViD-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This retrospective analysis reports the results of patients with early-stage inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) followed by adjuvant high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS Seventeen medically inoperable patients with biopsy-proven Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer were treated with RFA followed by single fraction HDR brachytherapy. Brachytherapy catheters were inserted immediately after RFA, and one fraction of HDR brachytherapy was delivered on the same day. Doses of brachytherapy ranged from 14.4 to 20 Gy (median, 18 Gy). Patients were followed clinically and radiographically to determine tumor control and toxicity profile. RESULTS Median followup time was 22 months. Of the 17 patients, 3 patients have recurred locally. Each of the patients with local recurrences was originally treated for T2 disease. In total, three of seven cases with T2N0 disease experienced local recurrences, whereas all 9 patients with T1 disease were controlled locally. Five of the 17 patients required a chest tube posttreatment, and 1 patient developed an empyema. There were no deaths within 1 month of treatment. CONCLUSIONS RFA followed by HDR brachytherapy yields excellent local control with an acceptable toxicity profile for patients with otherwise inoperable early-stage lung cancer.","output":"Combined radiofrequency ablation and high-dose rate brachytherapy for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, countries around the world implemented lockdowns with varying intensities. Lockdowns, however, have been associated with a deterioration of mental health, including post-traumatic stress symptoms, anger and anxiety. Exposure to nature might reduce stress and provide relaxation opportunities. OBJECTIVE: Firstly, we aimed to determine which sociodemographic, housing and lockdown-related characteristics were associated with changes in exposure to nature during the COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal and Spain. Secondly, we sought to estimate the associations of these changes with mental health, and test whether these associations differed according to sociodemographic characteristics and between the two countries, which experienced different restrictions and epidemiological situations. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between March 27 and May 6, 2020, using an online questionnaire to measure changes in exposure to nature (including private green space and other greenery, views of nature from home and public natural spaces); sociodemographic, housing and lockdown-related characteristics; stress levels (visual stress scale); psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire ? 12 items) and somatization (somatization scale). Adjusted regression models were fitted to estimate associations. RESULTS: This study included 3157 participants (1638 from Portugal, 1519 from Spain). In Portugal, maintaining/increasing the use of public natural spaces during the lockdown was associated with lower levels of stress (adjusted beta ?0.29; 95%CI ?0.49, ?0.08) and maintaining/increasing the frequency of viewing nature from home was associated with reduced psychological distress (0.27; ?0.51, ?0.03), somatization (?0.79; ?1.39, ?0.20), and stress levels (?0.48; ?0.74, ?0.23). In Spain, maintaining/increasing contact with private green space and greenery was associated with lower stress levels: for contact with indoor plants (?0.52; ?0.96, ?0.07) and for use of private community green spaces (?0.82; ?1.61, ?0.03). CONCLUSION: Exposure to nature was associated with better mental health outcomes during lockdowns, but the natural features associated with improved mental health differed between the two countries. Nature should be incorporated into urban planning interventions and housing design and exposure to nature should be promoted during lockdowns.","output":"Exposure to nature and mental health outcomes during COVID-19 lockdown.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to explore risk factors of mortality and ICU admission in COVID-19 patients using combined CT and clinicolaboratory data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19 (N= 63) from University Hospitals in Tehran, Iran were studied. All patients underwent CT examination and a total CT score and the number of involved lung lobes were calculated and compared against collected laboratory and clinical information. Univariable and multivariate proportional hazards analysis were used to determine the relationship between the CT, laboratory and clinical data and ICU admission and in-hospital death. RESULTS: By univariable analysis, in-hospital mortality was higher in patients with lower O2 saturation on admission (<88%), higher CT scores and higher number of lung lobes (> 4) involved with a diffuse parenchymal pattern. By multivariable analysis, in-hospital mortality was higher in patients with O2 saturation below 88% on admission and a higher number of lung lobes involved with diffuse parenchymal pattern. The risk of ICU admission was higher with comorbidities (hypertension and ischemic heart disease), SaO2 below 88% and pericardial effusion.

The experience of lockdown leads to negative psychological outcomes for fragile people such as elderly with dementia, particularly for DLB, causing a worsening of cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Since an individual's feeling of time passage is strongly related to their cognitive and emotional state, it is conceivable to expect alterations of this construct in people with DLB during such a difficult period. We therefore assessed the subjective experience of the passage of time for present and past time intervals (Subjective Time Questionnaire, STQ) during the lockdown due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in 22 patients with DLB (17 of which were re-tested in a post-lockdown period) and compared their experience with that of 14 caregivers with similar age. Patients showed a significantly slower perception of present and past time spent under lockdown restrictions. We argue that these alterations might be related to the distinctive features of DLB and their exacerbation recorded by the patients' caregivers during the period of lockdown, though our results show that the patients' experience of time passage in a post-lockdown period remained similarly slow. Overall, we show an impairment of the subjective perception of time passage in DLB tested during the COVID-19 lockdown.

However, designing effective UV germicidal ir- radiation (UVGI) systems can be difficult because the effects of dried respiratory droplets and other fomites on UV light intensities are poorly understood. Numerical modeling of UV intensities inside virus- containing particles on surfaces can increase understanding of these possible reductions in UV intensity. We model UV intensities within spherical approximations of virions randomly positioned within spherical particles. The model virions and dried particles have sizes and optical properties to approximate SARS- CoV-2 and dried particles formed from respiratory droplets, respectively. In 1-, 5- and 9-m diameter par- ticles on a surface, illuminated by 260-nm UV light from a direction perpendicular to the surface, 0 , 10 and 18 (respectively) of simulated virions are exposed to intensities less than 1/100 th of intensities in individually exposed virions (i.e., they are partially shielded). Even for 302-nm light (simulating sunlight), where absorption is small, 0 and 11 of virions in 1- and 9-m particles have exposures 1/100 th those of individually exposed virions. Shielding is small to negligible in sub-micron particles. Results show that shielding of virions in a particle can be reduced by illuminating a particle either from multiple widely separated incident directions, or by illuminating a particle rotating in air for a time sufficient to rotate through enough orientations. Because highly UV-reflective paints and surfaces can increase the angular ranges of illumination and the intensities within particles, they appear likely to be useful for reducing shielding of virions embedded within particles.","output":"Viruses Such as SARS-CoV-2 Can Be Partially Shielded from UV Radiation When in Particles Generated by Sneezing or Coughing: Numerical Simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The COVID-19 epidemic had caused more than 100 million confirmed cases worldwide by the end of January 2021 The focus of this study was to explore which stress was felt the most by nursing staff in isolation wards in the face of dangerous infectious diseases (2) Methods: Nursing staff in negative pressure isolation wards were taken as the research objects The sources of stress were divided into 14 items in three categories, namely, patient care, infection protection, and support system, and the questionnaire results were ranked by a Gaussian curve (3) Results: Even during the COVID-19 epidemic, nurses in isolation wards still consider that the clinical symptoms of patients in isolation wards cannot be closely tracked as the primary consideration (4) Conclusions: During the epidemic period, the ability and confidence of nursing staff were strengthened through education and training, and their chances of infection were reduced through comprehensive vaccination and the improvement of protective equipment In the face of the unstable mood of patients and their families due to isolation, more protective measures should be prepared for nursing staff In order to relieve the stress, supervisors can adjust the nursing manpower timely according to the difficulty and risk of patient care to reduce the care stress","output":"Sources of Care Stress of Nursing Staff for Patients with Infectious Diseases during the Prevalence of COVID-19: A Case Study of Some Regional Teaching Hospitals in Southern Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The surge of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine stands on a lengthy, and frequently reticent, buildout [...].","output":"Artificial Intelligence in GastroenterologyWalking into the Room of Little Miracles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of viral load in the outcome of patients requiring hospital admission due to influenza is not well established.

The last three decades has been characterized by increased understanding of the pathobiology of COPD, with associated advances in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities; however, the identification of pathognomonic biomarkers that determine disease severity, affect disease course, predict clinical outcome, and inform therapeutic strategy remains a work in progress. Objectives: Hypothesizing that a multi-variable model rather than single variable model may be more pathognomonic of COPD emphysema (COPD-E), the present study explored for disease-associated determinants of disease severity, and treatment success in Taiwanese patients with COPD-E. Methods: The present single-center, prospective, non-randomized study enrolled 125 patients with COPD and 43 healthy subjects between March 2015 and February 2021. Adopting a multimodal approach, including bioinformatics-aided analyses and geospatial modeling, we performed an integrated analysis of selected epigenetic, clinicopathological, geospatial, and air pollutant variables, coupled with correlative analyses of time-phased changes in pulmonary function indices and COPD-E severity. Results: Our COPD cohort consisted of 10 non-, 57 current-, and 58 ex-smokers (median age = 69  7.76 years). Based on the percentages of low attenuation area below ? 950 Hounsfield units (%LAA(-950insp)), 36 had mild or no emphysema (%LAA(-950insp) < 6), 22 were moderate emphysema cases (6  %LAA(-950insp) < 14), and 9 presented with severe emphysema (%LAA-950insp  14). We found that BMI, lnc-IL7R, PM(2.5), PM(10), and SO(2) were differentially associated with disease severity, and are highly-specific predictors of COPD progression. Per geospatial levels, areas with high BMI and lnc-IL7R but low PM(2.5), PM(10), and SO(2) were associated with fewer and ameliorated COPD cases, while high PM(2.5), PM(10), and SO(2) but low BMI and lnc-IL7R characterized places with more COPD cases and indicated exacerbation. The prediction pentad effectively differentiates patients with mild/no COPD from moderate/severe COPD cases, (mean AUC = 0.714) and exhibited very high stratification precision (mean AUC = 0.939). Conclusion: Combined BMI, lnc-IL7R, PM(2.5), PM(10), and SO(2) levels are optimal classifiers for accurate patient stratification and management triage for COPD in Taiwan.

There are several controversial hypotheses on the potentially harmful or beneficial effects of antihypertensive drugs acting on the reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system (RAAS) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Furthermore, there is accumulating evidence, based on several observational studies, that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not increase the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, conflicting findings regarding the role of ACEIs/ARBs as prognosis modifiers in COVID-19 hospitalised patients have been reported. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this large-scale, retrospective cohort study was to investigate whether prior exposure to ACEIs and/or ARBs was associated with all-cause mortality among over 40,000 hospitalised COVID-19 patients compared with calcium channel blockers (CCBs), a potential therapeutic alternative. METHODS: This study was conducted using COVID-19 registries linked to claims databases from Lombardy, Veneto and Reggio Emilia (overall, 25% of Italian population). Overall, 42,926 patients hospitalised between 21 February and 21 April 2020 with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction tests were included in this study. All-cause mortality occurring in or out of hospital, as reported in the COVID-19 registry, was estimated. Using Cox models, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality (along with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were estimated separately for ACEIs/ARBs and other antihypertensives versus CCBs and non-use. RESULTS: Overall, 11,205 in- and out-of-hospital deaths occurred over a median of 24 days of follow-up after hospital admission due to COVID-19. Compared with CCBs, adjusted analyses showed no difference in the risk of death among ACEI (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89C1.06) or ARB (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89C1.06) users. When non-use of antihypertensives was considered as a comparator, a modest statistically significant increase in mortality risk was observed for any antihypertensive use. However, when restricting to drugs with antihypertensive indications only, these marginal increases disappeared. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses confirmed our main findings. CONCLUSIONS: ACEI/ARB use is not associated with either an increased or decreased risk of all-cause mortality, compared with CCB use, in the largest cohort of hospitalised COVID-19 patients exposed to these drugs studied to date. The use of these drugs therefore does not affect the prognosis of COVID-19.

However, there are still numerous problems that mask extraction techniques need to solve. Thus, the most advanced methods to deploy artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are necessary.

Hence, we introduce a new mask extraction method that is based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to minimize the long-term manual mask extraction and to enhance medical image segmentation frameworks. A DRL-based method is introduced to deal with mask extraction issues. This new method utilizes a modified version of the Deep Q-Network to enable the mask detector to select masks from the image studied.

One strain, JHM.SD, caused acute encephalitis, while infection with JHM.IA resulted in no acute disease. Using recombinant virus technology, we found that the differences between the two viruses mapped to the spike (S) glycoprotein and that the two S proteins differed at four amino acids. By engineering viruses that differed by only one amino acid, we identified a serine-to-glycine change at position 310 of the S protein (S310G) that recapitulated the more neurovirulent phenotype. The increased neurovirulence mediated by the virus encoding glycine at position S310 was not associated with a different tropism within the central nervous system (CNS) but was associated with increased lateral spread in the CNS, leading to significantly higher brain viral titers. In vitro studies revealed that S310G was associated with decreased S1-S2 stability and with enhanced ability to mediate infection of cells lacking the primary receptor for JHM (\\"receptor-independent spread\\"). These enhanced fusogenic properties of viruses encoding a glycine at position 310 of the S protein may contribute to spread within the CNS, a tissue in which expression of conventional JHM receptors is low.","output":"Enhanced virulence mediated by the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM, is associated with a glycine at residue 310 of the spike glycoprotein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid\\\\19) outbreak on admissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and related mortality, severity of presentation, major cardiac complications and outcome in a tertiary\\\\care university hospital in Berlin, Germany. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a single\\\\centre cross\\\\sectional observational study, we included 355 patients with AMI containing ST\\\\elevation or non\\\\ST\\\\elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI), admitted for emergency cardiac catheterization between January and April 2020 and the equivalent time in 2019. During the early phase of the Covid\\\\19 pandemic (e\\\\COV) in Berlin (March and April 2020), admissions for AMI halved compared with those in the pre\\\\Covid\\\\19 time (January and February 2020; pre\\\\COV) and with those in the corresponding months in 2019. However, mortality for AMI increased substantially from 5.2% pre\\\\COV to 17.7% (P < 0.05) during e\\\\COV. Severity of presentation for AMI was more pronounced during e\\\\COV [increased levels of cardiac enzymes, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), an increase in the need of inotropic support by 25% (P < 0.01)], while patients' demographic and angiographic characteristics did not differ between pre\\\\COV and e\\\\COV. Time from symptom onset to first medical contact was prolonged in all AMI during e\\\\COV (presentation > 72 h +21% in STEMI, p = 0.04 and presentation > 72 h in NSTEMI +22%, p = 0.02). Door to balloon time was similar in STEMI patients, while time from first medical contact to revascularization was significantly delayed in NSTEMI patients (p = 0.02). Major cardiac complications after AMI occurred significantly more often, and cardiac recovery was worse in e\\\\COV than in pre\\\\COV, demonstrated by a significantly lower LVEF (39  16 vs. 46  16, p < 0.05) at hospital discharge and substantially higher NTproBNP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The Covid\\\\19 outbreak affects hospital admissions for acute coronary syndromes. During the first phase of the pandemia, significantly less patients with AMI were admitted, but those admitted presented with a more severe phenotype and had a higher mortality, more complications, and a worse short\\\\term outcome.

It is not significantly associated with either chronic kidney disease or meningoencephalitis. E cuniculi infection is more common in stray or feral cats than in pet cats. DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT Serological tests for antibody detection in the blood are easy to perform and can be useful for diagnosis, but their specificity is low as antibodies have been found in apparently healthy cats. PCR appears to be more sensitive than histopathology for diagnosis, and is more sensitive when performed on cataractous lenses compared with aqueous humour, although ease of sampling is an obvious limitation. Treatment is with fenbendazole for 3 weeks and phacoemulsification to remove microsporidia from cataractous lenses.

CoVs are enveloped viruses whose proteins include spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) which are embedded in the viral envelope. The glycosylated S protein, which forms homo-trimeric spikes on the surface of the viral particle, mediates viral entry into host cells. SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, uses the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell surface protein for cellular entry. An attractive anti-viral approach is targeting virus entry into cells, for which three strategies are suggested: 1) direct targeting of the viral glycoprotein; 2) targeting the viral receptor on the cell surface; and 3) using soluble (s) ACE2 that binds to S protein thereby neutralizing the virus. In this article, the advantages and disadvantages of these strategies are explained. Moreover, we propose that fusion of the sACE2 to anti-CD16 to produce a bi-speci?c molecule could be a promising anti-viral strategy.","output":"An immunotherapeutic method for COVID-19 patients: a soluble ACE2-Anti-CD16 VHH to block SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Due to the growing burden of disease in South Africa, encompassing conditions such as tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, and cancer, the holistic management of affected patients incorporating ototoxicity monitoring is a necessity. However, ototoxicity monitoring in developing countries may be limited due to a lack of resources and inadequate healthcare facilities. Subsequently, the use of tele-audiology may be a revolutionary technique with the potential to provide audiology services to under-served populations with limited access. METHODS The study aimed to describe the use of tele-audiology services in ototoxicity monitoring through a scoping review of English peer-reviewed articles from June 2009 to June 2020. Seventeen articles were purposively selected from the following databases: PubMed, Science Direct, Taylor and Francis Online, WorldCat, and Google Scholar. Data was extracted as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses diagram and results were analyzed using deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION While a minority of the studies indicated that the cost of implementation and network connectivity within a South African context pose as barriers, most researchers reported that tele-audiology provides a reliable, time-efficient, cost-effective, and easily accessible alternative for ototoxicity monitoring. Hardware including the WAHTS, KUDUwave, and OtoID, along with software such as the TabSINT, Otocalc, uHear, and the hearTest, have proven to be useful for ototoxicity monitoring. A need for further investigations regarding the feasibility of tele-audiology implementation in South Africa is evident. Despite this, it provides audiologists with an opportunity to offer contact-less services during COVID-19, thus, confirming its versatility as an augmentative method for ototoxicity monitoring.","output":"The use of tele-audiology in ototoxicity monitoring: A scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guided by the risk information seeking and processing (RISP) model, this study aims to examine the key determinants that predispose individuals? online information seeking behavior and prevention intent during the COVID-19 outbreak Through an online survey with 741 respondents in China, results indicate that affective responses, informational subjective norms, and information insufficiency are positively related to online information seeking about COVID-19 Furthermore, online information seeking is positively associated with prevention intent, and attitude toward prevention partially mediates this association Finally, theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed in the context of COVID-19","output":"Online InformationSeeking and Disease Prevention Intent During COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The contribution of this paper is to question the 'official' estimates of global monetary poverty up to and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

High blood PRL level is known to provide an immunological advantage in many pathological conditions (with some exceptions like autoimmune diseases) and women, because of their higher blood PRL level, get an advantage in this regard. It has been reported that by controlled enhancement of blood PRL level (within the physiological limit and in some cases a little elevated above the normal to induce mild hyperprolactinemia) using dopamine antagonists such immune-stimulatory advantage can led to survival of the patients in many critical conditions. Here it is hypothesized that through controlled augmentation of blood PRL level using dopamine antagonists like domperidone/metoclopramide, which are commonly used drugs for the treatment of nausea and vomiting, both innate and adaptive immunity can be boosted to evade or tone down COVID-19. The hypothesis is strengthened from the fact that at least seven little-understood salient observations in coronavirus patients can apparently be explained by considering the role of enhanced PRL in line with the proposed hypothesis and hence, clinical trials (both therapeutic and prophylactic) on the role of enhanced PRL on the course and outcome of coronavirus patients should be conducted accordingly.","output":"Repurposing Prolactin as a Promising Immunomodulator for the Treatment of COVID-19: Are Common Antiemetics the Wonder Drug to Fight Coronavirus?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The surge of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 has challenged health systems worldwide and efficient tests to detect viral particles, as well as antibodies generated against them, are needed.

A similar trend was seen in the metro cities of India, where online shopping has increased. In the food supply sector, both retailers and farmers had to face difficulty in storing, transporting, and selling of the goods and had to bear losses due to increased wastage. Although with an increased demand, organic farming has increased but still increased expenditure, less yield, and selling of the products are the major challenges in front of them. Food, fruit and vegetable wastes have considerably reduced at the food supply due to the obvious impact of lockdown on food supplies, however, a shortage of cold storages and supply chain at the farmer level in developing countries has resulted in more wastage. Developed countries reported increased illegal dumping of wastes in the rural areas and the stoppage of the recycling services due to the lockdown.

These may vary from fatigue and myalgia to persistent, and even worsening breathlessness, due to pulmonary fibrosis. Management of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is currently limited to symptomatic management and largely an unexplored aspect. Objectives: To draw attention to the imminent threat of post-COVID-19 interstitial lung disease (PC-ILD) in COVID survivors through a case series. Methods: A retrospective analysis of data was done in patients admitted with severe COVID in December 2020 at our tertiary care hospital, and who had a prolonged stay with symptoms and signs suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis. HRCT was done to make a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis or ILD. Three such patients were identified. Results: All the three cases were laboratory proven SARS CoV-2 positive cases and had developed pulmonary fibrosis, with traction bronchiectasis, termed here as PC-ILD (Post Covid-Interstitial Lung Disease). Two of them survived and had improved oxygen saturation on room air at three-month follow-up, while one patient had developed arrhythmia and died.

We investigated whether AGYW at risk for adverse sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes accessed Safe Spaces that were part of an intervention, as well as their feasibility and acceptability. METHODS: In December 2020 to February 2021, as part of a process evaluation of a combination HIV prevention intervention, we randomly sampled 2160 AGYW intervention beneficiaries aged 15C24 years from 6 of the 12 intervention districts. We invited them to participate in a phone survey, with questions about their vulnerability to adverse SRH outcomes, and participation in intervention components including Safe Spaces. We examined factors associated with use of Safe Spaces using bivariate analyses and Pearsons chi squared tests. We also conducted in-depth interviews with 50 AGYW beneficiaries, 27 intervention implementers, 4 health workers, 7 social workers, and 12 community stakeholders, to explore perceptions and experiences of the intervention. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data was performed. RESULTS: At least 30 Safe Spaces were established across 6 districts. Five hundred fifteen of two thousand one hundred sixty sampled AGYW participated in the survey of whom 22.6% visited a Safe Space, accessing HIV testing (52.2%), mobile health services (21.2%) and counselling for distress (24.8%) while there. Beneficiaries of lower socioeconomic status (SES) were less likely to have visited a Safe Space, compared with those of higher SES (13.6% versus 25.3%; p < 0.01). Implementers described political, structural and financial challenges in identifying and setting up Safe Spaces that were safe, accessible and adequately-resourced, and challenges with AGYW not utilising them as expected. AGYW shared positive views of Safe Spaces, describing benefits such as access to computers and the internet, support with homework and job and education applications, and a space in which to connect with peers. CONCLUSION: AGYW are attracted to Safe Spaces by educational and employment promoting interventions and recreational activities, and many will take up the offer of SRH services while there.

In March 2020, ASCO launched a survey of clinical programs represented on its Cancer Research Committee and Research Community Forum Steering Group and taskforces to learn about the types of changes and challenges that clinical trial programs were experiencing early in the pandemic. There were 32 survey respondents; 14 represented academic programs, and 18 represented community-based programs. Respondents indicated that COVID-19 is leading programs to halt or prioritize screening and/or enrollment for certain clinical trials and cease research-only visits. Most reported conducting remote patient care where possible and remote visits and monitoring with sponsors and/or contract research organizations (CROs); respondents viewed this shift positively. Numerous challenges with conducting clinical trials were reported, including enrollment and protocol adherence difficulties with decreased patient visits, staffing constraints, and limited availability of ancillary services. Interactions with sponsors and CROs about modifying trial procedures were also challenging. The changes in clinical trial procedures identified by the survey could serve as strategies for other programs attempting to maintain their clinical trial portfolios during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, many of the adaptations to trials made during the pandemic provide a long-term opportunity to improve and transform the clinical trial system. Specific improvements could be expanded use of more pragmatic or streamlined trial designs, fewer clinical trial-related patient visits, and minimized sponsor and CRO visits to trial programs.","output":"Early Impact of COVID-19 on the Conduct of Oncology Clinical Trials and Long-Term Opportunities for Transformation: Findings From an American Society of Clinical Oncology Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The recent emergence of distinct and highly successful SARS-CoV-2 lineages has substantial implications for individual patients and public health measures. While next-generation-sequencing is routinely performed for surveillance purposes, RT-qPCR can be used to rapidly rule-in or rule-out relevant variants, e.g., in outbreak scenarios. The objective of this study was to create an adaptable and comprehensive toolset for multiplexed Spike-gene SNP detection, which was applied to screen for SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 lineage variants. Methods: We created a broad set of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-assays including del-Y144/145, E484K, E484Q, P681H, P681R, L452R, and V1176F based on a highly specific multi-LNA (locked nucleic acid)-probe design to maximize mismatch discrimination. As proof-of-concept, a multiplex-test was compiled and validated (SCOV2-617VOC-UCT) including SNP-detection for L452R, P681R, E484K, and E484Q to provide rapid screening capabilities for the novel B.1.617 lineages. Results: For the multiplex-test (SCOV2-617VOC-UCT), the analytic lower limit of detection was determined as 182 IU/mL for L452R, 144 IU/mL for P681R, and 79 IU/mL for E484Q. A total of 233 clinical samples were tested with the assay, including various on-target and off-target sequences. All SNPs (179/179 positive) were correctly identified as determined by SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing. Conclusion: The recurrence of SNP locations and flexibility of methodology presented in this study allows for rapid adaptation to current and future variants. Furthermore, the ability to multiplex various SNP-assays into screening panels improves speed and efficiency for variant testing.

The purpose of this study was to identify major epidemiological characteristics and transmission patterns of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children and adolescents. Methods This study was conducted through a system integrated in an epidemiological investigation by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency from January 20, 2020, to June 5, 2021. We analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of 14,967 children and adolescents with COVID-19 according to the age groups and transmission age patterns of 3721 infector-infectee pairs in South Korea. Results Among the total confirmed COVID-19 cases, 14,967 patients were aged 0C18 years. The most affected age group among children and adolescents were those aged 16C18 years (3589, 24.0%). For all age groups, the infection route through friends and family members (31.9%) was the highest. For the contact age pattern analysis, infection from infectors aged 30C49 years to infectees aged 0C12 years showed a statistically significant relation (p <0.001) compared to that in other age groups. On the other hand, among the infectees aged 13C15 years and 16C18 years were significantly related with adolescents aged 10C19 years (p <0.05). Conclusion These results suggest that adolescents aged 13C18 years were more infected with COVID-19 than those aged 0C12 years. Furthermore, they are particularly more likely to be infected by friends and family members. Besides, in patients aged 13C18 years, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was more common from adolescents to adolescents than from adults to adolescents.

In this study we aimed to compare two RDTs, the SD Biosensor Q SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (Roche) and the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott), against rRT-PCR. METHODS: We included 2,215 all-comers at a diagnostic center between February 1 and March 31, 2021. rRT-PCR-positive samples were examined for SARS-CoV-2 variants. FINDINGS: Three hundred and thirty eight participants (15%) were rRT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivities of Roche-RDT and Abbott-RDT were 60.4 and 56.8% (P < 0.0001) and specificities 99.7% and 99.8% (P = 0.076). Sensitivity inversely correlated with rRT-PCR-Ct values. The RDTs had higher sensitivities in individuals referred by treating physicians (79.5%, 78.7%) than in those referred by health departments (49.5%, 44.3%) or tested for other reasons (50%, 45.8%), in persons without any comorbidities (74.4%, 71%) compared to those with comorbidities (38.2%, 34.4%), in individuals with COVID-19 symptoms (75.2%, 74.3%) compared to those without (31.9%, 23.3%), and in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 variants (87.7%, 84%) compared to Alpha variant carriers (77.1%, 72.3%). If 10,000 symptomatic individuals are tested of which 500 are truly positive, the RDTs would generate 38 false-positive and 124 false-negative results. If 10,000 asymptomatic individuals are tested, including 50 true positives, 18 false-positives and 34 false-negatives would be generated. INTERPRETATION: The sensitivities of the two RDTs for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers are unsatisfactory. Their widespread use may not be effective in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The virus genotype influences the sensitivity of the two RDTs.

It requires intervention from skilled, costly, multidisciplinary wound-care teams, working with patients to manage their care. Compression therapy has been shown to help heal venous ulcers and to reduce recurrence, with some evidence suggesting the value of exercise as well. These activities require health education and health literacy (HL) as patients must process, understand and consistently apply health information for successful self-management. Research suggests that those most vulnerable to VLUs also tend to have limited HL, but there have been no reviews examining the state of HL in patients with previous or active VLUs. This scoping review aims to examine the level of HL in VLU patients and how HL may link to self-management behaviours (particularly exercise and compression adherence), and their VLU healing generally. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will use Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Scoping Review guidelines and the Levac methodology framework to explore eligible papers that examine the effect of HL on their exercise and compression adherence. Electronic databases will be searched (MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, PsycInfo and Health, OpenGray), examining for all papers on these subjects published between 2000 and 2020. All studies describing compression and or exercise during VLU management will be included. Study characteristics will be recorded; qualitative data will be extracted and evaluated.

We assessed the effect of the pandemic on the disruption of institutional delivery care in Nepal. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study among 52 356 women in nine hospitals to assess the disruption of institutional delivery care during the pandemic (comparing March to August in 2019 with the same months in 2020). We also conducted a nested follow up cohort study with 2022 women during the pandemic to assess their provision and experience of respectful care. We used linear regression models to assess the association between provision and experience of care with volume of hospital births and womens residence in a COVID-19 hotspot area. RESULTS: The mean institutional births during the pandemic across the nine hospitals was 24 563, an average decrease of 11.6% (P < 0.0001) in comparison to the same time-period in 2019. The institutional birth in high-medium volume hospitals declined on average by 20.8% (P < 0.0001) during the pandemic, whereas in low-volume hospital institutional birth increased on average by 7.9% (P = 0.001). Maternity services halted for a mean of 4.3 days during the pandemic and there was a redeployment staff to COVID-19 dedicated care.

Global hypoxic-ischemic induced neural damage has been studied recently under well-controlled, non-invasive, reproducible conditions using a zebrafish model. Our earlier report on sex difference in global acute hypoxia-induced neural damage and recovery in zebrafish prompted us to conduct a comprehensive study on the mechanisms underlying the recovery. An omics approach for studying quantitative changes in brain proteome upon hypoxia insult following recovery was undertaken using iTRAQ-based LC-MS/MS approach. The results shed light on the altered expression of many regulatory proteins in the zebrafish brain upon acute hypoxia following recovery. The sex difference in differentially expressed proteins along with the proteins expressed in a uniform direction in both the sexes was studied. Core expression analysis by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed a distinct sex difference in the disease function heatmap. Most of the upstream regulators obtained through IPA were validated at the transcriptional level. Translational upregulation of H3K9me3 in males led us to elucidate the mechanism of recovery by confirming transcriptional targets through ChIP-qPCR. The upregulation of H3K9me3 level in males at 4 h post-hypoxia appears to affect the early neurogenic markers nestin, klf4, and sox2, which might explain the late recovery in males, compared to females. Acute hypoxia-induced sex-specific comparison of brain proteome led us to reveal many differentially expressed proteins, which can be further studied for the development of novel targets for better therapeutic strategy.","output":"Hypoxia Induced Sex-Difference in Zebrafish Brain Proteome Profile Reveals the Crucial Role of H3K9me3 in Recovery From Acute Hypoxia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel suicide gene therapy approach was tested in U87 MG glioblastoma multiforme cells.

METHODS: A case series of necrotizing pneumonia presenting as a primary or coprimary infection, secondary to CA-MRSA without evidence of antecedent viral URI, is presented. Cases were identified through the infectious diseases consultation service records. Clinical and radiographic data were collected by chart review and electronic records. MRSA strains were isolated from sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, pleural fluid or blood cultures and confirmed using standard laboratory procedures. MRSA strains were characterized by susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, spa typing, agr typing and multilocus sequence typing. Testing for respiratory viruses was performed by appropriate serological testing of banked sera, or nucleic acid testing of nasopharyngeal or bronchoalveloar lavage specimens. RESULTS: Ten patients who presented or copresented with CA necrotizing pneumonia secondary to CA-MRSA from April 2004 to October 2011 were identified. The median length of stay was 22.5 days. Mortality was 20.0%. Classical risk factors for CA-MRSA were identified in seven of 10 (70.0%) cases. Chest tube placement occurred in seven of 10 patients with empyema. None of the patients had historical evidence of antecedent URI. In eight of 10 patients, serological or nucleic acid testing testing revealed no evidence of acute viral coinfection.

However, there have been conflicting reports of the role of IL-33 in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the potential of this axis in differentiating CVD patients and controls and with CVD disease severity, remains unclear. AIMS: 1) To quantify differences in circulating IL-33 and/or sST2 levels between CVD patients versus controls. 2) Determine association of these biomarkers with mortality in CVD and community cohorts. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Pubmed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Prospero and Cochrane databases, systematic review of studies published on IL-33 and/or sST2 levels in patients with CVD (heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, stroke, coronary artery disease and hypertension) vs controls, and in cohorts of each CVD subtype was performed. Pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) of biomarker levels between CVD-cases versus controls and hazard ratios (HRs) for risk of mortality during follow-up in CVD patients, were assessed by random effects meta-analyses. Heterogeneity was evaluated with random-effects meta-regressions. From 1071 studies screened, 77 were meta-analysed. IL-33 levels were lower in HF and CAD patients vs controls, however levels were higher in stroke patients compared controls [Meta-SMD 1.455, 95% CI 0.372C2.537; p = 0.008, I(2) = 97.645]. Soluble ST2 had a stronger association with risk of all-cause mortality in ACS (Meta-multivariate HR 2.207, 95% CI 1.160C4.198; p = 0.016, I(2) = 95.661) than risk of all-cause mortality in HF (Meta-multivariate HR 1.425, 95% CI 1.268C1.601; p<0.0001, I(2) = 92.276). There were insufficient data to examine the association of IL-33 with clinical outcomes in CVD. CONCLUSIONS: IL-33 and sST2 levels differ between CVD patients and controls. Higher levels of sST2 are associated with increased mortality in individuals with CVD. Further study of IL-33/ST2 in cardiovascular studies is essential to progress diagnostic and therapeutic advances related to IL-33/ST2 signalling.","output":"Role of the IL-33/ST2 axis in cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health care providers have faced unprecedented changes in practice since the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020.

The objective of this study was to identify potential facilitators and barriers for event reporting from the curative sector to the preventive medicine sector in Viet Nam. METHODS: In 2016, we conducted 18 semi-structured, in-depth interviews, as well as nine focus group discussions, with representatives from the curative and preventive medicine sectors in four provinces. We transcribed the interviews and focus group discussions and used thematic analysis to identify the factors that appeared to affect public health event reporting. RESULTS: We identified five major themes. First, the lack of a legal framework to guide reporting meant hospital staff relied on internal procedures that varied from hospital to hospital, which sometimes delayed reporting. Second, participants stated the importance of an enabling environment, such as leadership support and having focal points for reporting, to facilitate reporting. Third, participants described the potential benefits of reporting, such as support provided during outbreaks and information received about local outbreaks. Fourth, some challenges prohibited timely reporting such as not perceiving reporting to be the task of the curative sector and hesitancy to report without laboratory confirmation. Finally, limited resources and specialist capacities in remote areas hindered timely detection and reporting of unusual events. DISCUSSION: This study identified potential opportunities to promote the detection and reporting of unusual events from health-care workers to the public health sector, and thus to improve the overall health security system in Viet Nam.The influenza virus is a respiratory pathogen that is transmitted through respiratory droplets.(1) During seasonal influenza epidemics, high attack rates cause a significant public health burden.(2) The infection is usually self-limited in young adults but can lead to severe infections in people in high-risk groups, including elderly people (> 65 years old), pregnant women, children aged 6C59 months and adults with chronic illnesses.(3)","output":"Building the hospital event-based surveillance system in Viet Nam: a qualitative study to identify potential facilitators and barriers for event reporting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) are some of the most common human diseases worldwide.

Pathogens were identified in 2361/4242 (55.7%) patients, and the positivity rate varied seasonally. Ten of the 17 pathogens investigated showed positivity rates of more than 5%. The most frequently detected pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (768/2361, 32.5%), influenza A virus (428/2361, 18.1%), enterovirus (138/2361, 13.3%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (267/2361, 11.3%) and adenovirus (213/2361, 9.0%).

We analyzed DENV-specific neutralization titers (NT(50)), IgM and IgG avidity, and antibody titer in serum samples collected during acute and convalescent phases and 3, 6, and 18 months post-infection. NT(50) titers peaked at convalescence and decreased thereafter. IgG avidity to DENV3 significantly increased between convalescent and 3-month time-points in primary DENV infections and between the acute and convalescent phase in secondary DENV infections. While avidity to DENV2, a likely previous infecting serotype, was initially higher than avidity to DENV3 in secondary DENV infections, the opposite relation was observed 3C18 months post-infection. We found significant correlations between IgM avidity and NT(50) in acute primary cases and between IgG avidity and NT(50) in secondary DENV infections. In summary, our findings indicate that IgM antibodies likely play a role in early control of DENV infections. IgG serum avidity to DENV, analyzed for the first time in longitudinal samples, switches from targeting mainly cross-reactive serotype(s) to the current infecting serotype over time.

We used surgical simulation to define performance differences between surgeons with and without single-port clinical experience and examined whether a short course of training resulted in improved performance. METHODS Study participants were assigned to 3 groups: resident group (RES), experienced laparoscopic surgeons with (SP) and without (LAP) prior single-port laparoscopic experience. Participants performed the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery precision cutting task on a ProMIS trainer through conventional ports or with articulating instruments via a SILS Port (Covidien, Inc). Two iterations of each method were performed. Then, 6 residents performed 10 successive single-port iterations to assess the effect of practice on task performance. RESULTS The SP group had faster task times for both laparoscopic (P = .0486) and single-port (P = .0238) methods. The LAP group had longer path lengths for the single-port task than for the laparoscopic task (P = .03). The RES group was slower (P = .0019), with longer path length (P = .0010) but with greater smoothness (P = .0186) on the single-port task than the conventional laparoscopic task. Resident performance task time (P = .005) and smoothness (P = .045) improved with successive iterations. DISCUSSION Our data show that surgeons with clinical single-port surgery experience perform a simulated single-port surgical task better than inexperienced single-port surgeons. Furthermore, this performance is comparable to that achieved with conventional laparoscopic techniques. Performance of residents declined dramatically when confronted with the challenges of the single-port task but improved with practice.

Understanding the role of weather factors in COVID-19 in Brazil is helpful in the long-term mitigation strategy of COVID-19 in other tropical countries because Brazil experienced early large-scale outbreak among tropical countries. Recent COVID-19 studies indicate that relevant weather factors such as temperature, humidity, UV Index (UVI), precipitation, ozone, pollution and cloud cover may influence the spread of COVID-19. Yet, the magnitude and direction of those associations remain inconclusive. Furthermore, there is only limited research exploring the impact of these weather factors in a tropical country like Brazil. In this observational study, we outline the roles of 7 relevant weather factors including temperature, humidity, UVI, precipitation, ozone, pollution (visibility) and cloud cover in COVID-19 deaths in Brazil. Methods: We use a log-linear fixed-effects model to a panel dataset of 27 administrative regions in Brazil across 182 days (n=3882) and analyze the role of relevant weather factors by using daily cumulative COVID-19 deaths in Brazil as the dependent variable. We carry out robustness checks using case-fatality-rate (CFR) as the dependent variable. Findings: We control for all time-fixed and various time-varying region-specific factors confounding factors. We observe a significant negative association of COVID-19 daily deaths growth rate in Brazil with weather factors - UVI, temperature, ozone and cloud cover. Specifically, a unit increase in UVI, maximum temperature, and ozone independently associate with 6.0 percentage points [p<0.001], 1.8 percentage points [p<0.01] and 0.3 percentage points [p<0. 1] decline in COVID-19 deaths growth rate. Further, a unit percentage increase in cloud cover associates with a decline of 0.148 percentage points [p<0.05] in COVID-19 deaths growth rate. Surprisingly, contrary to other studies, we do not find evidence of any association between COVID-19 daily deaths growth rate and humidity, visibility and precipitation. We find our results to be consistent even when we use the CFR as the dependent variable. Interpretation: We find independent protective roles of UVI, temperature, ozone and cloud cover in mitigating COVID-19 deaths, even in a tropical country like Brazil. We observe these results to be consistent across various model specifications, especially for UVI and cloud cover, even after incorporating additional time-varying weather parameters such as dewpoint, pressure, wind speed and wind gust.

We here reveal features of the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which optimize the virus towards different parts of the respiratory tract. First, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (SARS-2-S) reached higher levels in pseudoparticles when produced at 33C instead of 37C. Even stronger preference for the upper airway temperature of 33C was evident for the S protein of HCoV-229E, a common cold coronavirus. In contrast, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV favored 37C, in accordance with their preference for the lower airways. Next, SARS-2-S proved efficiently activated by TMPRSS13, besides the previously identified host cell protease TMPRSS2, which may broaden the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS13 was found to be an effective spike activator for the virulent coronaviruses but not the common cold HCoV-229E virus. Activation by these proteases requires pre-cleavage of the SARS-2-S S1/S2 cleavage loop, and both its furin motif and extended loop length proved critical to achieve virus entry into airway epithelial cells. Finally, we show that the D614G mutation in SARS-2-S increases S protein stability and expression at 37C, and promotes virus entry via cathepsin B/L activation. These spike properties might promote virus spread, potentially explaining why the G614 variant is currently predominating worldwide. Collectively, our findings indicate how the coronavirus spike protein is fine-tuned towards the temperature and protease conditions of the airways, to enhance virus transmission and pathology. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is related to abundant replication in the upper airways, which is not observed for other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. We here reveal features of the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which optimize the virus towards different parts of the respiratory tract. Coronavirus spikes exhibit distinct temperature preference to precisely match the upper (~33C) or lower (37C) airways. We identified airway proteases that activate the spike for virus entry into cells, including one protease that may mediate coronavirus virulence. Also, a link was seen between spike stability and entry via endosomal proteases. This mechanism of spike fine-tuning could explain why the SARS-CoV-2 spike-D614G mutant is more transmissible and therefore globally predominant.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronavirus spike proteins are fine-tuned towards temperature and proteases of the human airways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evaluation of the antigenic similarity degree between the strains of the influenza virus is highly important for vaccine production. The conventional method used to measure such a degree is related to performing the immunological assays of hemagglutinin inhibition. Namely, the antigenic distance between two strains is calculated on the basis of HI assays. Usually, such distances are visualized by using some kind of antigenic cartography method. The known drawback of the HI assay is that it is rather time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for antigenic distance approximation based on deep learning in the feature spaces induced by hemagglutinin protein sequences and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To apply a CNN to compare the protein sequences, we utilize the encoding based on the physical and chemical characteristics of amino acids. By varying (hyper)parameters of the CNN architecture design, we find the most robust network. Further, we provide insight into the relationship between approximated antigenic distance and antigenicity by evaluating the network on the HI assay database for the H1N1 subtype. The results indicate that the best-trained network gives a high-precision approximation for the ground-truth antigenic distances, and can be used as a good exploratory tool in practical tasks.","output":"Convolutional Neural Network Based Approach to In Silico Non-Anticipating Prediction of Antigenic Distance for Influenza Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reports of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection have raised important questions about the strength and durability of the immune response to primary infection, which are key factors in predicting the course of the pandemic. Identifying reinfection requires detecting the virus at two different time points and using viral genomic data to distinguish reinfection from persistent viral carriage. This process is hindered by challenges of logistics and capacity, such as banking samples from primary infection and performing viral genome sequencing. These challenges may help to explain why very few cases have been described to date. In addition, reinfection may be a rare phenomenon, but detailed prospective studies are needed to rigorously assess its frequency. To provide context for future investigations of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, we review 16 cases that have been published to date or are available in preprint. Reinfection occurred across demographic spectra and in patients whose initial infections were both asymptomatic/mild and moderate/severe. For cases in which severity could be compared between episodes, half of reinfections were less severe, raising the possibility of partial immune protection. Although many patients had a positive total immunoglobulin or IgG result at the time of reinfection, very little examination of their immune response was performed. Further work is needed to elucidate the frequency, determinants, and consequences of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.

The goal of this study was to provide an external, independent validation of the SPIN score for in-hospital and 6-month mortality. METHODS: To accomplish this, the authors retrospectively reviewed 6 years of data from their institutional trauma registry. Variables used to determine SPIN score were collected, including sex, transfer status, injury motive, pupillary reactivity, motor component of the Glasgow Coma Scale (mGCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), and international normalized ratio (INR) at admission. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified variables associated with mortality. The authors compared AUC between models by using a nonparametric test for equality. RESULTS: Of the 108 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 101 had all SPIN score components available. The SPIN model had an AUC of 0.962. The AUC for continuous mGCS score alone (0.932) did not differ significantly from the AUC for the full SPIN model (p = 0.26). The AUC for continuous mGCS score (0.932) was significantly higher compared to categorical mGCS score (0.891, p = 0.005). Use of only mGCS score resulted in fewer exclusions due to missing data. No additional variable included in the predictive model alongside continuous mGCS score was a significant predictor of inpatient mortality, 6-month mortality, or increased model discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: Given these findings, continuous 6-point mGCS score may be sufficient as a generalizable predictor of inpatient and 6-month mortality in patients with cGSW, demonstrating excellent discrimination and reduced bias due to missing data.","output":"An independent, external validation and component analysis of the Surviving Penetrating Injury to the Brain score for civilian cranial gunshot injuries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Suicidality is a widespread phenomenon with a dramatic burden worldwide.

Methods: The setting is a 27,000 visit Veterans Health Administration ED that is also an ACEP Level 1 Geriatric ED. The existing vaccine program used the Pfizer vaccine, with appointments scheduled through a vaccine clinic that operated 7 days a week. With the approval of the single dose Janssen vaccine, to expand our outreach and vaccinate more patients, an ED-based vaccination program was developed. At triage, the triage nurse reviewed the charts of all stable (ESI 3-5) patients to determine if they had already received at least one dose of vaccine, or were scheduled to receive a dose of vaccine in the outpatient clinic. If not, then a flag would be placed on the tracking board to alert the provider seeing the patient that they were a candidate for the single-dose Janssen vaccine. The provider would then screen for contraindications and obtain consent for the vaccine.

There were no documented allergic reactions or other immediate adverse events reported for any of the ED-vaccinated patients. Conclusion: We report preliminary results for an ED-based COVID vaccine program using the single-dose JAndJ/Janssen vaccine. Female patients represented a higher percentage of those receiving the vaccine than represented by their percentage of our total ED visits. Further research needs to be done into those who refuse the vaccine, as well as interventions to reduce the number of missed opportunities (patients who were flagged on the tracking board but did not receive further screening for vaccine eligibility by the ED provider). Adverse events were not reported in our cohort.","output":"71 Implementation of an Ed-Based COVID-19 Vaccine Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe respiratory tract infection caused by family of Corona viruses has become world pandemic. The purpose of this study was to describe the first few COVID 19 cases in Ethiopia. METHOD: Descriptive study was conducted on the first 33 consecutive RT-PCR confirmed COVID 19 cases diagnosed and managed at Ekka-Kotebe COVID Treatment Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. RESULT: The median age of the cases was 36 years. Cough, headache and fever were the most frequent symptoms. Diarrhea, sore throats, loss of taste and/or smell sensation were among the rare symptoms. Most (84.8%) had mild to moderate disease, and 15.2%(n=5) were critical at the time of admission. Among the five ICU admissions, four patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. Thirty cases were discharged after two pairs of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples turned negative for SARS CoV2. Three cases from the ICU died while on mechanical ventilator. The age of the two deaths was 65 years, and one was 60 years. With the exception of three, all cases were either imported from abroad or had contact with confirmed cases. CONCLUSION: Most of our patients were in the younger age group with male predominance and few with comorbidities. Cough was the commonest symptom followed by headache and fever. As it was in the early stage of the pandemic, observation of more cases in the future will reveal further clinical and demographic profiles of COVID-19 cases in Ethiopia.","output":"Clinical and Socio-demographic Profile of the First 33 COVID-19 Cases Treated at Dedicated Treatment Center in Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend adults who discontinue statin therapy because of statin-associated symptoms be reinitiated. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels achieved after statin reinitiation are unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine LDL-C levels after statin reinitiation. METHODS: We analyzed data from 5498 participants in the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke study who reported ever taking a statin. We categorized participants according to their pattern of statin use including those taking a statin who did not experience statin-associated symptoms and continued treatment, and those who discontinued statins because of statin-associated symptoms and were not reinitiated, reinitiated and remained on treatment, and discontinued treatment after being reinitiated. Mortality and vascular event reduction with statin reinitiation was estimated using data from the Cholesterol-Lowering Treatment Trialists Collaboration. RESULTS: After multivariable adjustment, LDL-C was 14.1 (95% CI: 9.9-18.3) mg/dL higher among participants reinitiated and taking a statin compared with those without statin-associated symptoms who continued statin therapy. Mean LDL-C was 18.1 mg/dL (95% CI: 13.0-23.1) and 27.5 mg/dL (95% CI: 20.7-34.4) lower among participants reinitiated and taking a statin compared with those who discontinued statin therapy and were not reinitiated and those who discontinued statins after being reinitiated, respectively. An LDL-C reduction of 18.1 mg/dL with statin reinitiation was projected to reduce all-cause and coronary heart disease mortality by 5.6% and 8.9%, respectively, and myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death and major vascular events by 10.7% and 9.8%, respectively, over 5 years.

We aimed to determine the impact of telehealth on the completion of postpartum care goals. Study Design: We compared a 14-week period, March-June 2019, before implementation of telehealth to the same calendar months post-implementation during 2020. Patients with a postpartum visit (PPV) scheduled at our institution during the study period were included. Our primary outcome was attendance to the PPV. Secondary outcomes included completion of postpartum depression (PPD) screening, contraception selection, breastfeeding status at PPV, completion of postpartum 2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) for women with gestational diabetes, and cardiology follow-up when recommended. Multivariable logistic regression with backward elimination was used to control for confounders. Results: Of the 1,579 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 780 were in the pre-telehealth group and 799 were in the post-telehealth group. Subjects in the post-telehealth group were 90% more likely to attend a PPV compared to those in the pre-telehealth group, even when controlling for race, prenatal care provider, parity, gestational age at delivery, and insurance status (82.9% vs. 72.4%, p < 0.001;aOR 1.90, 95% CI [1.47-2.46]). Patients in the post-telehealth group were also more likely to get screened for PPD (86.3% vs. 65.1%, p < 0.001). While subjects were as likely to choose a contraceptive method at the PPV, those in the post-telehealth group were less likely to choose long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) or permanent sterilization (26.2% vs. 33.2%, p=0.03). There was no difference in breastfeeding status at the PPV, completion rate of postpartum 2-hour GTT, or attendance to cardiology follow-up appointments between groups. Conclusion: Availability of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased PPV attendance and PPD screening.

Skeletal muscle area index (SMI) and skeletal muscle density (SMD) was assessed using CT. Coronary atherosclerotic plaques and stenosis on CCTA were evaluated. The associations of low SMI and low SMD with coronary atherosclerotic plaques and significant stenosis were determined by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, there were significant associations of low SMI or low SMD with atherosclerotic plaque, total significant stenosis, and significant stenosis caused by calcified or mixed plaques (for all p<0.05). In addition, multivariate regression analysis also showed that low SMI was independently associated with calcified plaque (p=0.038) and non-calcified plaque (p=0.006), and individuals with low SMD were more likely to have mixed plaque (p=0.001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the reports relative to 9061 US-guided FNABs for the histologic definition of the nature of thyroid nodules: 45.4% completed with the cytopathologist assistance and 54.6% by the radiologist alone. We also performed the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of the procedure with and without the cytopathologist assistance. RESULTS: We found a significant positive correlation between the adoption/non-adoption of cytopathologist assistance and the number of indeterminate (TIR1) (Chi-square; z-score, Z = 10.22; critical value 5%, C = 1.96; p < 0.001). The cytopathologist's absence was correlated with the number of TIR 1 (Pearson correlation, productCmoment correlation r = 0.059; critical value 5%, C = 0.008; p < 0.001). The total cost of the model's cytopathologist-assistance branch is 109.87, while the total cost of the non-cytopathologist-assistance branch is 95.08. CONCLUSION: The cytopathologist assistance resulted in fewer nondiagnostic results, thus excluding the procedure's repetition but involved a higher expense, mainly due to the professional cost of the pathologist's participation. These data may provide decision-makers in healthcare with a practical evidence based on the opportunity to include the cytopathologist assistance in the thyroid nodule's FNAB depending on the available resources and the population's expectance.

Our objectives were: i) to assess malnutrition in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, ii) to investigate the links between malnutrition and disease severity at admission, iii) to study the impact of malnutrition on clinical outcomes such as transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU) or death. METHODS: Consecutive patients hospitalized in a medicine ward at a university hospital were included from March 21st to April 24th 2020 (n = 114, 60.5% males, age: 59.9  15.9 years). Nutritional status was defined using Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria. Clinical, radiological and biological characteristics of COVID-19 patients were compared according to the presence of malnutrition. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between nutritional parameters and unfavourable outcomes such as transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) or death. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of malnutrition was 42.1% (moderate: 23.7%, severe: 18.4%). The prevalence of malnutrition reached 66.7% in patients admitted from ICU. No significant association was found between nutritional status and clinical signs of COVID-19. Lower albumin levels were associated with a higher risk of transfer to ICU (for 10 g/l of albumin, OR [95%CI]: 0.31 [0.1; 0.7]; p < 0.01) and this association was independent of age and CRP levels.

Several studies identified crucial barriers such as insufficient financial reimbursement. In contrast to the barriers-account, we assume that low implementation readiness of GPs may be less attributed to external barriers but rather more so to inherent characteristics of SBI. To test our assumption, we conducted a vignette study assessing the GPs' readiness to implement SBI in comparison to a pharmacological intervention also designed for the treatment of excessive drinkers in relation to standard or above-standard financial reimbursement. According to our hypothesis GPs should be less ready to implement SBI regardless of financial reimbursement. METHODS: A convenience sample of GPs was recruited to answer the questionnaire. To assess the GPs' implementation readiness a 4-item 6-point Likert scale was developed and pretested. RESULTS: One hundred forty GPs completed the questionnaire. GPs were more ready to implement the pharmacological intervention than SBI, F(1,132) = 27.58, p > .001 (main effect). We found no effect for financial reimbursement, F(1,132) = 3.60, ns, and no interaction effect, F(1,132) = 2.20, ns.

Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell response is imperative for cell-mediated immune response during COVID-19. However, the level of CD8(+) T cell response reduced to almost half as compared to CD4(+) after 6 months of infection. The long-term protection is mediated via generation of immunological memory response during COVID-19. The presence of memory CD4(+) T cells in all the severely infected and recovered individuals shows that the memory response is predominated by CD4(+) T cells. Prominently, the antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are specifically observed during day 0 to day 28 in COVID-19-vaccinated individuals.

This was performed to mimic the probable cumulative epidemic trajectories and predict future daily incidence by fitting the data to existing daily incidence and the estimated R0 by a model based on the assumption that daily incidence follows Poisson distribution. The maximum-likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.242 for COVID-19 outbreak, as on June 2020. The median with 95% CI of R0 values was 2.242 (1.50-3.00) estimated by bootstrap resampling method.

Pigs have high-contact rates with humans and other animals, transmit similar pathogens as humans including CoVs, and serve as reservoirs and intermediate hosts for notable human pandemics.Wild and domestic pigs both interface with humans and each other but have unique ecologies that demand different surveillance strategies. Three fundamental questions shape any surveillance program: where, when, and how can surveillance be conducted to optimize the surveillance objective? Using theory of mechanisms of zoonotic spillover and data on risk factors, we propose a framework for determining where surveillance might begin initially to maximize a detection in each host species at their interface. We illustrate the utility of the framework using data from the United States. We then discuss variables to consider in refining when and how to conduct surveillance. Recent advances in accounting for opportunistic sampling designs and in translating serology samples into infection times provide promising directions for extracting spatio-temporal estimates of disease risk from typical surveillance data. Such robust estimates of population-level disease risk allow surveillance plans to be updated in space and time based on new information (adaptive surveillance) thus optimizing allocation of surveillance resources to maximize the quality of risk assessment insight.","output":"A framework for surveillance of emerging pathogens at the human-animal interface: pigs and coronaviruses as a case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to several studies, children represent only about 2% of the patients affected by the current SARS-CoV-2, and most often, they are asymptomatic.

The Australian Healthier Wealthier Families project seeks to reduce the childhood inequities caused by poverty and deprivation by creating a systematic referral pathway between two free, community-based services: universal, well-child nursing services, which provide health and development support to families with children from birth to school entry, and financial counselling. By adapting the successful Scottish Healthier Wealthier Children model, the objectives of this Australian pilot are to test the (1) feasibility of systematising the referral pathway, and (2) short-term impacts on household finances, caregiver health, parenting efficacy and financial service use. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This pilot randomised controlled trial will run in three sites across two Australian states (Victoria and New South Wales), recruiting a total of 180 participants. Nurses identify eligible caregivers with a 6-item, study-designed screening survey for financial hardship. Caregivers who report one or more risk factors and consent are randomised. The intervention is financial counselling. The comparator is usual care plus information from a government money advice website. Feasibility will be evaluated using the number/proportion of caregivers who complete screening, consent and research measures, and access financial counselling. Though powered to assess feasibility, impacts will be measured 6 months post-enrolment with qualitative interviews and questionnaires about caregiver-reported income, loans and costs (adapted from national surveys, for example, the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey); health (General Health Questionnaire 1, EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale short-form); efficacy (from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children); and financial service use (study-designed) compared between arms.

However, the eGOV services' adoption level still low in developing countries, which explains the need for understanding the motives underlying to the satisfaction with and the adoption of such services. This article explores the motives citizens would adopt eGOV services in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Data was collected through 34 semi-structured individual interviews. After an examination of the citizens' overall evaluation of eGOV services, a thematic analysis method was used to investigate the critical factors underlying eGOV success, their impacts on users' satisfaction and eGOV adoption. Findings showed that eGOV success hinges on the users' characteristics and their perception of the eGOV portals' features. Moreover, results revealed that 11 factors influence citizens' satisfaction and eGOV adoption success. The factors classified at the top five by the interviewees are (1) the service relevance to the users' needs and it personalization, (2) the ease of use of portals, (3) the security, privacy as well as the service quality levels, (4) the information quality offered, and (5) the accessibility. The other factors cited by respondents are associated to the design technology, the interactivity, and the transparency. In light of the outcomes, advices to support eGOV adoption were formulated. Since results demonstrated that user needs and characteristics are at the core success of an eGOV service, governments in developing countries in general, and the Saudi government, in particular, should adapt their e-services' content and technology to users, as well as implement an efficient communication strategy on efforts deployed in eGOV services to enhance citizens trust.

Study findings suggest that individuals with a lifetime history of disordered eating behavior may be negatively affected by COVID-19Crelated anxiety, and prevention measures may disrupt daily functioning and limit access to treatment. However, data describing the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on disordered eating behaviors are limited, and most findings focus on individuals in treatment settings. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the experiences of Reddit users worldwide who post in eating disorder (ED)Crelated discussion forums describing the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on their overall mental health and disordered eating behavior. METHODS: Data were collected from popular subreddits acknowledging EDs as their primary discussion topic. Unique discussion posts dated from January 1 to May 31, 2020 that referenced the COVID-19 pandemic were extracted and evaluated using inductive, thematic data analysis. RESULTS: Six primary themes were identified: change in ED symptoms, change in exercise routine, impact of quarantine on daily life, emotional well-being, help-seeking behavior, and associated risks and health outcomes. The majority of users reported that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health prevention measures negatively impacted their psychiatric health and contributed to increased disordered eating behaviors.

Studies have shown that the average number of working hours per week is a significant predictor of stress and that the severity of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the nurses stress levels. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the nursing staffs working hours during the COVID-19 pandemic on the perceived level of stress. METHOD: We carried out an online cross-sectional survey and measured the stress level with the perceived stress scale. RESULTS: Most of the nurses experienced a moderate level of stress. We identified a statistically significant association between increased numbers of working hours per week and the nurses perceived stress level. In addition, 15% of the nurses who had worked more than 40 h reported experiencing a high level of stress. CONCLUSION: These results reflect the negative consequences of prolonged working hours. For this reason, a (inter)national discussion is needed on the topic of restricting the working hours of healthcare workers during such pandemics.

There is a current race for developing strategies to treat and/or prevent COVID-19 worldwide. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the efficacy of the combined complex (nano-conjugates) of two FDA-approved drugs, sitagliptin (SIT) and glatiramer acetate (GA), against a human isolate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. SIT-GA nano-conjugates were prepared according to a full three-factor bilevel (2(3)) factorial design. The SIT concentration (mM, X(1)), GA concentration (mM, X(2)), and pH (X(3)) were selected as the factors. The particle size (nm, Y(1)) and zeta potential (mV, Y(2)) were assessed as responses. Characterization of the optimized formula for the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out. In addition, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) in Vero-E6 epithelial cells previously infected with the virus was investigated. The results revealed that the optimized formula of the prepared complex was a 1:1 SIT:GA molar ratio at a pH of 10, which met the required criteria with a desirability value of 0.878 and had a particle size and zeta potential at values of 77.42 nm and 27.67 V, respectively. The SIT-GA nano-complex showed antiviral potential against an isolate of SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values of 16.14, 14.09, and 8.52 M for SIT, GA, and SIT-GA nano-conjugates, respectively. Molecular docking has shown that the formulas components have a high binding affinity to the COVID 3CL protease, essential for coronavirus replication, paralleled by 3CL protease inhibition (IC(50) = 2.87 M). An optimized formulation of SIT-GA could guarantee both enhanced deliveries to target cells and improved cellular uptake.

In this study, we investigated whether the dietary supplementation of pomegranate seed oil (PSO) exerted a protective effect on liver lipid uptake, fibrosis, and mitochondrial function in a mouse model of obesity and insulin resistance. Method: In this in vivo study, eight-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were fed with a high fat diet (HFD) for 24 weeks and then were divided into three groups as follows: group (1) Lean; group (n = 6) (2) HF diet; group (n = 6) (3) HF diet treated with PSO (40 mL/kg food) (n = 6) for eight additional weeks starting at 24 weeks. Physiological parameters, lipid droplet accumulation, inflammatory biomarkers, antioxidant biomarkers, mitochondrial biogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and hepatic fibrosis were determined to examine whether PSO intervention prevents obesity-associated metabolic syndrome. Results: The PSO group displayed an increase in oxygen consumption, as well as a decrease in fasting glucose and blood pressure (p < 0.05) when compared to the HFD-fed mice group. PSO increased both the activity and expression of hepatic HO-1, downregulated inflammatory adipokines, and decreased hepatic fibrosis. PSO increased the levels of thermogenic genes, mitochondrial signaling, and lipid metabolism through increases in Mfn2, OPA-1, PRDM 16, and PGC1. Furthermore, PSO upregulated obesity-mediated hepatic insulin receptor phosphorylation Tyr-(972), p-IRB tyr(1146), and pAMPK, thereby decreasing insulin resistance. Conclusions: These results indicated that PSO decreased obesity-mediated insulin resistance and the progression of hepatic fibrosis through an improved liver signaling, as manifested by increased insulin receptor phosphorylation and thermogenic genes. Furthermore, our findings indicate a potential therapeutic role for PSO in the prevention of obesity-associated NAFLD, NASH, and other metabolic disorders.","output":"Cold Press Pomegranate Seed Oil Attenuates Dietary-Obesity Induced Hepatic Steatosis and Fibrosis through Antioxidant and Mitochondrial Pathways in Obese Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought catastrophic impact on the world since the beginning of December 2019.

Through systems pharmacology and virtual screening approaches, we explored the potential mechanism of action and the active ingredients of the QFPD decoction for COVID-19 treatment. A ingredients-targets dataset was generated. ADME/Tox and molecular docking analyses were conducted to screen the potentially-active ingredients. Protein-protein interaction network and the detection algorithm were applied to dynamically identify functionally-relevant protein groupings. Totally, 705 ingredients and 1,489 targets were obtained.

School closure and home confinement might have adverse effects on children's physical and mental health. In this study, we aimed to compare the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological reactions and coping of CF patients and healthy controls. Methods: 132 CF patients and 135 volunteers, ages 7 years and older, were included in the study. The survey included questions regarding family environment and peer relations, self care during lockdown and psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Compared to the patient group, the control group showed more anxiety symptoms, tried to have new hobbies during lockdown and needed more psychological help (Table 1). [Table presented] Conclusion: Surprisingly, symptoms of anxiety were higher in the control group compared to the CF group. CF patients seem to show more resiliance in coping with the outbreak and with school closure than their peers. Also, they reported needing less psychological help (not statistically significant). Since CF patients are already used to wearing face masks and follow infection control measures in their daily lives, these measures may not cause extra anxiety as in their healthy peers.

The workplace is a priority setting for health promotion. This systematic review will describe dietary and physical activity workplace interventions that have aimed to improve the health of staff in hospital settings; and the barriers and enablers of implementing these interventions. METHODS A systematic search retrieved 551 studies from 2004 to 2020 using the following databases CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE Complete, Academic Search Complete, Global Health, Health Source Nursing/Academic Edition and PsycINFO. Studies were included if they: (1) took place in a hospital setting; (2) employed a physical activity or dietary intervention to improve the well-being of staff; (3) the intervention duration was 12 weeks or over; (4) used a control group. The Integrated quality Criteria for the Review of Multiple Study designs (ICROMS) and National Institute of Health's National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Quality Assessment Tools for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies tools were used to assess quality of included studies. A narrative review was conducted. RESULTS Quality analysis identified six studies of high quality, nine moderate quality, and three low quality. Of these 18 studies, 15 reported at least one positive health outcome. The evidence revealed that multi-component strategies, financial incentives and motivational strategies were the most effective approaches to improve health behaviours of hospital staff.

PARTICIPANTS: We recruited adults representing at least one of five stakeholder groups with experience in CBE and/or HIV: (1) adults living with HIV, (2) rehabilitation professionals, (3) fitness personnel, (4) educators with eLearning experience and (5) representatives from HIV community-based organisations (CBOs). DATA COLLECTION: We asked participants to describe their experiences with online CBE, need and utility for online CBE and factors in developing and implementing online CBE interventions. We analysed data using a group-based thematic analytical approach. RESULTS: Among the 11 participants, most had experience working with adults living with HIV (73%) or with telehealth/rehabilitation/coaching in HIV or other chronic conditions (91%). Participants (eight women; two men; one non-binary; median age: 49 years), identified the need and utility for online CBE interventions to increase accessibility and continuity of care with adults living with HIV. Six factors to consider in developing and implementing online CBE included: (1) person-specific considerations (episodic nature of HIV, stigma, HIV disclosure), (2) accessibility of programme (physical space to exercise, reliable internet, access to devices, digital literacy), (3) programme delivery and technology (live vs prerecorded online classes, multiple online platforms for delivery, physical activity tracking, troubleshooting technology), (4) attributes of programme personnel (working with CBOs, relatable instructors, diverse staff), (5) programme content and design (tailored exercise classes, educational sessions) and (6) building community (shared experiences, peer support, social opportunities).

Concordantly, high app adoption rates were a stipulated prerequisite for success. Early studies on potential adoption were encouraging. Several factors predicting adoption rates were investigated, especially pertaining to user characteristics. Since then, several countries have released COVID-19 contact tracing apps. OBJECTIVE: This study's primary aim is to investigate the quality characteristics of national European COVID-19 contact tracing apps, thereby shifting attention from user to app characteristics. The secondary aim is to investigate associations between app quality and adoption. Finally, app features contributing to higher app quality were identified. METHODS: Eligible COVID-19 contact tracing apps were those released by national health authorities of European Union member states, former member states, and countries of the European Free Trade Association, all countries with comparable legal standards concerning personal data protection and app use voluntariness. The Mobile App Rating Scale was used to assess app quality. An interdisciplinary team, consisting of two health and two human-computer interaction scientists, independently conducted Mobile App Rating Scale ratings. To investigate associations between app quality and adoption rates and infection rates, Bayesian linear regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: We discovered 21 national COVID-19 contact tracing apps, all demonstrating high quality overall and high-level functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. However, the average app adoption rate of 22.9% (SD 12.5%) was below the level recommended by simulation studies. Lower levels of engagement-oriented app design were detected, with substantial variations between apps. By regression analyses, the best-case adoption rate was calculated by assuming apps achieve the highest ratings. The mean best-case adoption rates for engagement and overall app quality were 39.5% and 43.6%, respectively. Higher adoption rates were associated with lower cumulative infection rates. Overall, we identified 5 feature categories (symptom assessment and monitoring, regularly updated information, individualization, tracing, and communication) and 14 individual features that contributed to higher app quality. These 14 features were a symptom checker, a symptom diary, statistics on COVID-19, app use, public health instructions and restrictions, information of burden on health care system, assigning personal data, regional updates, control over tracing activity, contact diary, venue check-in, chats, helplines, and app-sharing capacity. CONCLUSIONS: European national health authorities have generally released high quality COVID-19 contact tracing apps, with regard to functionality, aesthetics, and information quality. However, the app's engagement-oriented design generally was of lower quality, even though regression analyses results identify engagement as a promising optimization target to increase adoption rates. Associations between higher app adoption and lower infection rates are consistent with simulation study results, albeit acknowledging that app use might be part of a broader set of protective attitudes and behaviors for self and others.

One of the most effective ways to prevent injuries is through policy and legislation. The aim of this research study was to identify and critically review all policy and legislation in Nepal that had the potential to prevent injuries. METHODS: We identified legislation and policy that met inclusion criteria through a stakeholder meeting, networks and contacts, and websites and electronic resources. Each included document was critically reviewed to identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. We compared the included documents against WHOs recommendations of known effective interventions. RESULTS: Sixty-two documents met the inclusion criteria for this review. Of these, 24 (38.7%) were exclusively related to road injuries, 11 (17.7%) to occupational injuries, 6 (9.7%) to injuries in the home and 5 (8.1%) to injuries at school; 30 (48.4%) documents included text related to the first response to injuries. Of 127 strategic recommendations by WHO that provided an area for policy or legislative focus, 21 (16.5%) were considered adequately met by Nepali policy and legislation, 43 (33.9%) were considered partially met and 63 (49.6%) were not met. CONCLUSION: We drew five conclusions from this critical policy review, which we have related to recommendations as follows: widening the scope of legislation and policy for injury prevention to emphasize injuries occurring at home or school; addressing the causes of injuries and promoting proven preventive measures; greater clarity on both individual and institutional roles and responsibilities; trustworthy data and quality evidence to inform decision-making; and financial investment and capacity-strengthening for injury prevention and first response.

Despite this, no research to date has explored the experiences of social support in elite para-athletes. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of social support in elite British para-swimmers and the influence on their wellbeing and performance. METHODS: A hermeneutic phenomenological study involving semi-structured interviews was undertaken with 8 elite British para-swimmers (3 male, 5 female, mean age 24.9 years). Participants represented 5 para-swimming classes and all 10 of the International Paralympic Committee impairment categories. Data were analysed following a modified version of the Framework Method. Research quality and trustworthiness were ensured through employing techniques including data triangulation, member checking and reflexivity. RESULTS: Five themes and 11 sub-themes were generated. The five themes were: the coach-athlete relationship, team bond, tangible aid, The Podium Illusion and British para-swimming. The overall findings and the magnitude of support mentioned in the fourth theme led to the development of a new model called The Podium Illusion which reflects the magnitude of support that is available to elite para-swimmers to help maximise their performance and wellbeing. CONCLUSION: Social support is essential for athlete wellbeing and performance. Findings underpin a new model, The Podium Illusion.

Rapid and sensitive diagnosis aids effective disease management at points of need (PON). A commercially available, field-deployable and user-friendly system, designed with insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) technology, displays excellent sensitivity and specificity for nucleic acid detection. An iiPCR method was developed for on-site detection of all circulating CPV-2 strains. Limit of detection was determined using plasmid DNA. CPV-2a, 2b and 2c strains, a feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) strain, and nine canine pathogens were tested to evaluate assay specificity. Reaction sensitivity and performance were compared with an in-house real-time PCR using serial dilutions of a CPV-2b strain and 100 canine fecal clinical samples collected from 2010 to 2014, respectively. The 95% limit of detection of the iiPCR method was 13 copies of standard DNA and detection limits for CPV-2b DNA were equivalent for iiPCR and real-time PCR. The iiPCR reaction detected CPV-2a, 2b and 2c and FPV. Non-targeted pathogens were not detected. Test results of real-time PCR and iiPCR from 99 fecal samples agreed with each other, while one real-time PCR-positive sample tested negative by iiPCR. Therefore, excellent agreement (k = 0.98) with sensitivity of 98.41% and specificity of 100% in detecting CPV-2 in feces was found between the two methods. In conclusion, the iiPCR system has potential to serve as a useful tool for rapid and accurate PON, molecular detection of CPV-2.","output":"An insulated isothermal PCR method on a field-deployable device for rapid and sensitive detection of canine parvovirus type 2 at points of need"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antioxidant proteins can not only balance the oxidative stress in the body, but are also an important component of antioxidant drugs. Accurate identification of antioxidant proteins is essential to help humans fight diseases and develop new drugs.

In March 2021, a fatal disease characterized by visceral urate deposition broke out in 5-day-old Beijing ducks on a commercial farm in Guangdong province, China. We identified a novel duck astrovirus from the ducklings suffering from gout disease. The complete genome sequence of this DAstV was obtained by virome sequencing and amplification. Phylogenetic analyses and pairwise comparisons demonstrated that this DAstV represented a novel group of avastrovirus. Thus, we designated this duck astrovirus as DAstV-5 JM strain. DAstV-5 JM shared genome sequence identities of 15C45% with other avastroviruses. Amino acid identities with proteins from other avastroviruses did not exceed 59% for ORF1a, 79% for ORF1b, and 60% for ORF2. The capsid region of JM shared genetic distances of 0.596 to 0.695 with the three official avastrovirus species. suggesting that JM could be classified as a novel genotype species in the Avastrovirus genus. Meanwhile, JM shares genetic distances of 0.402C0.662 with all the other known unassigned avastroviruses, revealing that it represents an additional unassigned avastrovirus.

This acute pandemic has spread from the East and has been overlaid onto a slow pandemic of metabolic diseases of obesity and diabetes consequent from the increasing adoption of a Western-lifestyle characterized by excess calorie consumption with limited physical activity. It has become clear that these conditions predispose individuals to a more severe COVID-19 with increased morbidity and mortality. There are many features of diabetes and obesity that may accentuate the clinical response to SARS-CoV-2 infection: including an impaired immune response, an atherothrombotic state, accumulation of advanced glycation end products and a chronic inflammatory state. These could prime an exaggerated cytokine response to viral infection, predisposing to the cytokine storm that triggers progression to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multi-organ failure. Infection leads to an inflammatory response and tissue damage resulting in increased metabolic activity and an associated increase in the mechanisms by which cells ingest and degrade tissue debris and foreign materials. It is becoming clear that viruses have acquired an ability to exploit these mechanisms to invade cells and facilitate their own life-cycle. In obesity and diabetes these mechanisms are chronically activated due to the deteriorating metabolic state and this may provide an increased opportunity for a more profound and sustained viral infection.","output":"Obesity, Diabetes and COVID-19: An Infectious Disease Spreading From the East Collides With the Consequences of an Unhealthy Western Lifestyle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To examine the social and health impacts of the pandemic and social policies on people with muscular dystrophies. Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and social policies have disrupted all aspects of community life in the United States, but the impact on people with progressive muscular dystrophies is unknown. Design/Methods: The COVID-19 and Social Policy Impact Survey was developed by muscular dystrophy experts in association with patient collaborators and advocacy groups. The survey assesses social impact;impact on disease;exercise;use of telemedicine;and effect on research. Overall stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale, a validated 10-item inventory of stress. We conducted a prospective de-identified electronic survey of people with muscular dystrophy residing in the US from May 8, 2020 to May 28, 2020. An IRB-approved information letter with an embedded link to the survey was emailed to registry participants who had agreed to be contacted by email, or posted as notifications on advocacy websites. Results: Respondents (n=774: 56% FSHD;35% DM, and 9% LGMD) were mostly women and middle-aged (range 19-87 years). Rates of COVID-19 infections were low (<1%) and compliance with social distancing policies high (98%). Major challenges reported during the pandemic included: obtaining treatment (40%), managing stress (37%), social distancing (36%), and obtaining essentials (34%). Of those who reported a change in their disease, the majority reported slight worsening. Respondents reported moderate stress levels (stress score= 15.4;range= 0-35), with higher stress levels reported by women and those under age 30 years. Threequarters of participants who participated in telemedicine visits were satisfied with the encounters;however, most reported a preference for in-person visits. Conclusions: People with muscular dystrophy reported multiple challenges due to COVID-19 social policies, and moderate levels of stress.

We conducted four surveys between April and August 2020 using the graph-based open-ended survey (GOS) framework, and investigated the most pressing concerns and issues for the general public in Japan. The GOS framework is a hybrid of the two traditional survey frameworks that allows respondents to post their opinions in a free-format style, which can subsequently serve as one of the choice items for other respondents, just as in a multiple-choice survey. As a result, this framework generates an opinion graph that relates opinions and respondents. We can also construct annotated opinion graphs to achieve a higher resolution. By clustering the annotated opinion graphs, we revealed the characteristic evolution of the response patterns as well as the interconnectedness and multi-faceted nature of opinions. Substantively, our notable finding is that \\"social pressure,\\" not \\"infection risk,\\" was one of the major concerns of our respondents. Social pressure refers to criticism and discrimination that they anticipate receiving from others should they contract COVID-19. It is possible that the collectivist nature of Japanese culture coupled with the government's policy of relying on personal responsibility to combat COVID-19 explains some of the above findings, as the latter has led to the emergence of vigilantes. The presence of mutual surveillance can contribute to growing skepticism toward others as well as fear of ostracism, which may have negative consequences at both the societal and individual levels.","output":"Graph-based open-ended survey on concerns related to COVID-19 (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We sequenced 10% of imported severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections detected in travelers to Hong Kong and revealed the genomic diversity of regions of origin, including lineages not previously reported from those countries.

Prior studies on sex disparities were limited by moderate sample sizes, varying years of data acquisition, and inconsistent inclusions of covariates leading to controversial findings. We aimed to analyze sex differences in AIS severity, treatments, and early outcome and to systematically evaluate the effect of important covariates in a large German stroke registry. METHODS Analyses were based on the Stroke Registry of Northwestern Germany from 2000 to 2018. We focused on admission-stroke severity and disability, acute recanalization treatment, and early stroke outcomes. Potential sex divergences were investigated via odds ratio (OR) using logistic regression models. Covariates were introduced in 3 steps: (1) base models (age and admission year), (2) partially adjusted models (additionally corrected for acute stroke severity and recanalization treatment), (3) fully adjusted models (additionally adjusted for onset-to-admission time interval, prestroke functional status, comorbidities, and stroke cause). Models were separately fitted for the periods 2000 to 2009 and 2010 to 2018. RESULTS Data from 761 106 patients with AIS were included. In fully adjusted models, there were no sex differences with respect to treatment with intravenous thrombolysis (2000-2009: OR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94-1.03]; 2010-2018: OR, 1.0 [0.98-1.02]), but women were more likely to receive intraarterial therapy (2010-2018: OR, 1.12 [1.08-1.15]). Despite higher disability on admission (2000-2009: OR, 1.10 [1.07-1.13]; 2010-2018: OR, 1.09 [1.07-1.10]), female patients were more likely to be discharged with a favorable functional outcome (2003-2009: OR, 1.05 [1.02-1.09]; 2010-2018: OR, 1.05 [1.04-1.07]) and experienced lower in-hospital mortality (2000-2009: OR, 0.92 [0.86-0.97]; 2010-2018: OR, 0.91 [0.88-0.93]). CONCLUSIONS Female patients with AIS have a higher chance of receiving intraarterial treatment that cannot be explained by clinical characteristics, such as age, premorbid disability, stroke severity, or cause. Women have a more favorable in-hospital recovery than men because their higher disability upon admission was followed by a lower in-hospital mortality and a higher likelihood of favorable functional outcome at discharge after adjustment for covariates.","output":"Female Stroke: Sex Differences in Acute Treatment and Early Outcomes of Acute Ischemic Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly infectious resulting in increased infection and death among the front-line Healthcare Workers (HCW) because of limited access to personal protective equipment (PPE).

Mobile health (mHealth) services can help out-of-hospital patients to self-manage. However, not all management is effective, possibly because the behavior mechanism and behavior preferences of patients with various characteristics in hypertension management were unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to (1) explore patient multibehavior engagement trails in the pathway-based hypertension self-management, (2) discover patient behavior preference patterns, and (3) identify the characteristics of patients with different behavior preferences. METHODS: This study included 863 hypertensive patients who generated 295,855 use records in the mHealth app from December 28, 2016, to July 2, 2020. Markov chain was used to infer the patient multibehavior engagement trails, which contained the type, quantity, time spent, sequence, and transition probability value (TP value) of patient behavior. K-means algorithm was used to group patients by the normalized behavior preference features: the number of behavioral states that a patient performed in each trail. The pages in the app represented the behavior states. Chi-square tests, Z-test, analyses of variance, and Bonferroni multiple comparisons were conducted to characterize the patient behavior preference patterns. RESULTS: Markov chain analysis revealed 3 types of behavior transition (1-way transition, cycle transition, and self-transition) and 4 trails of patient multibehavior engagement. In perform task trail (PT-T), patients preferred to start self-management from the states of task blood pressure (BP), task drug, and task weight (TP value 0.29, 0.18, and 0.20, respectively), and spent more time on the task food state (35.87 s). Some patients entered the states of task BP and task drug (TP value 0.20, 0.25) from the reminder item state. In the result-oriented trail (RO-T), patients spent more energy on the ranking state (19.66 s) compared to the health report state (13.25 s). In the knowledge learning trail (KL-T), there was a high probability of cycle transition (TP value 0.47, 0.31) between the states of knowledge list and knowledge content. In the support acquisition trail (SA-T), there was a high probability of self-transition in the questionnaire (TP value 0.29) state. Cluster analysis discovered 3 patient behavior preference patterns: PT-T cluster, PT-T and KL-T cluster, and PT-T and SA-T cluster. There were statistically significant associations between the behavior preference pattern and gender, education level, and BP. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the dynamic, longitudinal, and multidimensional characteristics of patient behavior. Patients preferred to focus on BP, medications, and weight conditions and paid attention to BP and medications using reminders. The diet management and questionnaires were complicated and difficult to implement and record. Competitive methods such as ranking were more likely to attract patients to pay attention to their own self-management states.

After excluding unqualified subjects, 30,507 adults with T2DM were included in the final analysis. 21,355 and 9,152 subjects were randomly assigned to the model developing group and validation group, respectively, with a ratio of 7:3. The potential risk factors used in this study to assess hypertension in patients with T2DM included questionnaire investigation and physical measurement variables. We used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator models to optimize feature selection, and the multivariable logistic regression analysis was for predicting model. Discrimination and calibration were assessed using the receiver operating curve (ROC) and calibration curve. RESULTS: The results showed that the major determinants of hypertension in patients with T2DM were age, gender, drinking, exercise, smoking, obesity and atherosclerotic vascular disease. The area under ROC curve of developing group and validation group are both 0.814, indicating that the prediction model owns high disease recognition ability.

In the critical group, the plasma levels of albumin continued to have a significant association for the risk of nonsurvivors (p < 0.05), even after adjusting for confounding factors. Conclusion: Albumin levels could be used as an independent predictor of the risk of nonsurvivors in critically ill patients with COVID-19.","output":"Plasma albumin levels predict risk for nonsurvivors in critically ill patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. Although a number of new vaccines are available to combat this threat, a high prevalence of novel mutant viral variants is observed in all world regions affected by this infection. Among viral proteomes, the highly glycosylated spike protein (Sprot) of SARS-CoV-2 has received the most attention due to its interaction with the host receptor ACE2. To understand the mechanisms of viral variant infectivity and the interaction of the RBD of Sprot with the host ACE2, we performed a large-scale mutagenesis study of the RBD-ACE2 interface by performing 1780 point mutations in silico and identifying the ambiguous stabilisation of the interface by the most common point mutations described in the literature. Furthermore, we pinpointed the N501Y mutation at the RBD of Sprot as profoundly affecting complex formation and confirmed greater stability of the N501Y mutant compared to wild-type (WT) viral S protein by molecular dynamics experiments. These findings could be important for the study and design of upcoming vaccines, PPI inhibitor molecules, and therapeutic antibodies or antibody mimics. ? 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","output":"Bioinformatic and MD Analysis of N501Y SARS-CoV-2 (UK) Variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People who provide health and social care services, transport, food, and other essential services have maintained the economy, vital services, and crucial support systems during the COVID-19 pandemic, and many of these workers have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 Davies and Pearson-Stuttard advocate a total health approach that includes physical, mental, and social health and also the underlying drivers that influence all those aspects of our lives to address society's health needs before people become ill The authors recommended three innovative new societal contracts: new shared values between the private sector, civil society and our nation's total health;a new 21st century public health system that includes monitoring with surveillance and health security;and an expanded NHS [the UK National Health Service] that provides a health and care system that encompasses acute and chronic illness along with social care [ ]a total health approach will improve not only the overall health of the society but also productivity","output":"Your health is my health: how everyone's health is interconnected"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This study aimed to explore the clinical characteristics of 742 patients with re-current Corona Virus Disease in 2019 (COVID-19), so as to provide relevant evidence for clinical diagnosis and treatment of reinfected patients. Methods: Altogether 742 discharged COVID-19 patients were analyzed retrospectively and were divided into re-infected patients (n=60) and non-re-infected patients (n=682) according to whether they became nucleic acid positive again after discharge. The time form leaving the hospital to re-infection and the time form the first nucleic acid negative test results to being re-infected were recorded. The clinical characteristics of the two groups were compared when they were admitted to the hospital. Logistic regression analysis was carried out on disease indicators with statistical differences between the two groups. Results: Compared with non-re-infected patients, there were statistical differences in age, contact history, fatigue, chills, nasal congestion and runny nose, lung CT observations, clinical classification and lymphocyte count of re-infected patients (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that nasal congestion and a runny nose, a lymphocyte count less than 0.93109 cells/L, and age 65 years were the risk factors of being re-infected. The ROC curve showed that the cut-off value of lymphocyte count was 0.847109 cells/L, and the AUC of predicted re-infection was 0.867.

Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study at four medical centers from 3/2020-1/2021 to evaluate POCUS findings and clinical outcomes with COVID-19. Our inclusion criteria included adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19 who received cardiac or lung POCUS with a 12-zone protocol. Images were interpreted by two reviewers blinded to clinical outcomes. Our primary outcome was ICU admission incidence. Secondary outcomes included intubation and supplemental oxygen usage. Results: N=160 patients (N=201 scans) were included. Scans were collected a median 23 hours (IQR:7-80) from emergency department triage. Triage POCUS findings associated with ICU admission included B-lines (OR 4.41 [95% CI:1.71-14.30]; p<0.01) or consolidation (OR 2.49 [95% CI:1.35-4.86]; p<0.01). B-lines were associated with intubation (OR 3.10 [95% CI:1.15-10.27]; p=0.02) and supplemental oxygen usage (OR 3.74 [95% CI:1.63-8.63; p<0.01). Consolidations present on triage were associated with the need for oxygen at discharge (OR 2.16 [95% CI: 1.01-4.70]; p=0.047). A normal lung triage scan was protective for ICU admission (OR 0.28 [95% CI:0.09-0.75; p<0.01) or need for supplemental oxygen during the hospitalization (OR 0.26 [95% CI:0.11-0.61]; p<0.01).

Increased DNA damage after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, partly due to increased oxidative stress, was transient, whereas the inherent DNA repair capacity was found intact.

Early SSC was defined as when the infant was placed directly onto the mother's chest within 180 minutes of birth. Two authors independently searched the databases, appraised study quality and extracted the study design and outcome data. The primary outcomes were the infants' physiological stability after birth: thermoregulation and stabilisation. The secondary outcomes were exclusive breastfeeding and mother-infant interaction. RESULTS We reviewed 30 studies that assessed the benefits of early SSC: 22 comprised term-born healthy infants and eight focused on preterm or ill infants. These included various gestational ages, birth methods and cultural backgrounds. The studies demonstrated that early SSC stabilised neonatal physiological parameters, promoted exclusive breastfeeding and supported bonding. Most of the data were from term and late preterm births. CONCLUSION This systematic review showed that early SSC could be beneficial.

This review discusses current evidence regarding the pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19. Observations SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure to symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, are common, but nonspecific. Diagnosis is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, although false-negative test results may occur in up to 20% to 67% of patients; however, this is dependent on the quality and timing of testing. Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19, and 20% of those hospitalized, experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with COVID-19 includes best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Emerging data indicate that dexamethasone therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared with usual care (21.6% vs 24.6%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]) and that remdesivir improves time to recovery (hospital discharge or no supplemental oxygen requirement) from 15 to 11 days. In a randomized trial of 103 patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma did not shorten time to recovery. Ongoing trials are testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by age, ranging from 0.3 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 85 years or older in the US. Among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case fatality is up to 40%. At least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development. Until an effective vaccine is available, the primary methods to reduce spread are face masks, social distancing, and contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin may provide additional preventive strategies. Conclusions and Relevance As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects of transmission, infection, and treatment remain unclear. Advances in prevention and effective management of COVID-19 will require basic and clinical investigation and public health and clinical interventions.","output":"Pathophysiology, Transmission, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, novel henipavirus-related sequences have been identified in bats in Africa. To evaluate the potential of African bat henipaviruses to spread in non-bat mammalian cells, we compared the biological functions of the surface glycoproteins G and F of the prototype African henipavirus GH-M74a with those of the glycoproteins of Nipah virus (NiV), a well-characterized pathogenic member of the henipavirus genus. Glycoproteins are central determinants for virus tropism, as efficient binding of henipavirus G proteins to cellular ephrin receptors and functional expression of fusion-competent F proteins are indispensable prerequisites for virus entry and cell-to-cell spread. In this study, we analysed the ability of the GH-M74a G and F proteins to cause cell-to-cell fusion in mammalian cell types readily permissive to NiV or Hendra virus infections. Except for limited syncytium formation in a bat cell line derived from Hypsignathus monstrosus, HypNi/1.1 cells, we did not observe any fusion. The highly restricted fusion activity was predominantly due to the F protein. Whilst GH-M74a G protein was found to interact with the main henipavirus receptor ephrin-B2 and induced syncytia upon co-expression with heterotypic NiV F protein, GH-M74a F protein did not cause evident fusion in the presence of heterotypic NiV G protein. Pulse-chase and surface biotinylation analyses revealed delayed F cleavage kinetics with a reduced expression of cleaved and fusion-active GH-M74a F protein on the cell surface. Thus, the F protein of GH-M74a showed a functional defect that is most likely caused by impaired trafficking leading to less efficient proteolytic activation and surface expression.","output":"Characterization of African bat henipavirus GH-M74a glycoproteins."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Expectations are high on serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 Further knowledge of the immunity is needed, but also evaluation of the reliability of the tests Important for the latter is for which purpose the test is conducted and how common the outcome to be identified is (antibodies) For the determination of immunity at the individual level, the specificity of the test must be very high, preferably 100% Even tests where the specificity is perceived as high, e g 95% or 99%, can lead to a large proportion of false positives, if the proportion of the population actually infected is small","output":"[Serological tests should be related to the aim of the testing, as well as the population]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using 27 million flight bookings for 2 years from a major international airline company, we built a Next Likely Destination model to ascertain customers next flight booking.

Excessive consumption is assumed to lead to a sedentary lifestyle, psychiatric disorders, overconsumption of sexual content and suicidal behaviour. But are these assumptions valid? METHODS We supplemented data from the 2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Study for Belgium with a bibliographical search of online databases (Medline, Scopus, PsycArticles, PsycInfo, PubMed) with the keywords 'adolescent' - 'internet' and 'sedentarity' or 'suicide' or 'family' or 'sex*' or 'porno*' for articles published between 2014 and 2019. We selected 27 original research articles and/ or quantitative or qualitative meta-analyses. RESULTS Total consumption of different media (television, video games, internet) remained stable until 2010, and significantly increased in 2014. No parallel increase in sedentarity was reported. Controversy continues to surround the quantification of overconsumption, and the definition of 'problematic use'. Nevertheless, it appears that 5% of young people have unusual internet use, and 97.5% of these meet the criteria for a mental disorder. The risk of overconsumption is related to four factors: familial, personality, peer influence and supply. These general factors are supplemented by specific factors related to the abuse of sexual content and suicidal behaviour. For the latter, specific risk factors are the same as for suicidal young people who are not influenced by social media. CONCLUSION Even if screen time is higher for Generation Alpha, these young people are no more at risk unless they accumulate risk factors. They are also exposed to challenges that researchers have not yet studied in any depth. One question relates to how they can manage their privacy if their parents published, without their consent, photographs of them as children? Another issue is their relationship to knowledge, given that everything they need to know can easily be found online.","output":"Screen Time and (Belgian) Teenagers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented on physical and mental health.

Natural killer (NK) cells provide the first line of innate defense against IAV by killing infected epithelial cells, by producing antiviral cytokines and affecting adaptive immunity. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that NK cells play a pivotal role in reducing IAV-induced pulmonary infection; however, little is known about the therapeutic potential of adoptively transferred NK cells for IAV infections. Celularity Inc. is developing human placental hematopoietic stem cell-derived allogeneic, off-the-shelf NK cell therapy (CYNK-001) for the treatment of viral infections, including coronavirus disease of 2019. Here, we report the evaluation of antiviral activities of CYNK-001 against IAV infection. Methods: In vitro antiviral activities of CYNK-001 were evaluated using human alveolar epithelial cell line A549, infected with IAV strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) at variable multiplicity of infection (MOI). The expression of ligands for NK cell receptors was analyzed on infected A549 cells using Fc-coupled recombinant proteins. CYNK-001 was added to A549 cells 16 hours post infection. CYNK-001 degranulation was measured after 4 hours of coculture, and CYNK-001 cytotoxicity against IAV-infected A549 was measured real-time using impedance-based xCELLigence platform. In vivo antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of CYNK-001 were assessed in A/PR/8/34 (H1N1)-induced severe acute lung injury mouse model. Mice were intranasally infected with 2500 PFU IAV. PBS or 1 x 107 CYNK-001 cells were intravenously administered twice at 1 and 3 days post infection (dpi). At 6 dpi, lungs were collected for the evaluation of viral load by qPCR, lung injury and immune cell profiling by histology. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected at 6 dpi for cytokine analysis by multiplex assays, total protein concentration by ELISA and immune cell profiling by flow cytometry. Results: In vitro, IAV infection corresponded with dose-dependent expression of ligands to NK cell-activating receptors, including NKp44, NKp46 and NKG2D. CYNK-001 cells exhibited increased IFN, TNF and GM-CSF production, and elevated level of degranulation upon coculture with IAV-infected A549 cells. Cytokines in culture supernatant and CD107a expression in CYNK-001 cells were upregulated in a virus dose-dependent manner. Consistent with this finding, CYNK-001 cytotoxicity against IAV-infected A549 cells increased from 35% at 0 MOI to 50%, 60% and 75% at 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 MOI, respectively. These data indicate that CYNK-001 cells recognize virally infected cells, resulting in specific cytotoxic elimination of the source of infection. In vivo, treatment of IAV-infected mice with CYNK-001 reduced weight loss and increased their likelihood of survival. PBS control group developed a severe disease and 37.5% mortality was observed as early as day 4. In the group treated with CYNK-001, disease onset was delayed by 2 days. qPCR analysis of viral RNA showed that CYNK-001-treated mice had lower viral load in the lung than vehicle-treated mice, demonstrating antiviral function of CYNK-001 in vivo. CYNK-001-treated mice had reduced lung injury as assessed by lower total protein concentration in BALF. Moreover, CYNK-001 reduced BALF murine cytokines and chemokines, including IFN (p<0.001), IL-6, TNF, MCP-1 (p<0.05), CXCL2 and CXCL9. Lastly, immunohistochemical analysis of the lung showed that CYNK-001-treated mice had an altered immune response to IAV with higher number of CD68+ macrophages and CD8+ T cells at 6 dpi. Conclusions: Our in vitro and in vivo data show the promising antiviral activities of CYNK-001 against IAV infection. In a severe IAV infection mouse model, CYNK-001 treatment demonstrates lower mortality rate, lower weight loss, lower lung viral load and reduced lung injury along with reduced inflammation. These results support our hypothesis that the adoptive transfer of CYNK-001 could reduce the burden of viral infection through the elimination of infected epithelial cells, coordinate a more effective immune response, and result in a clinical benefit in patients with severe viral infection.

OBJECTIVE To detect myocardial injury in critically ill paediatric patients, and to compare cardiac involvement between children with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and children with multisystemic inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). METHODS All COVID-19 children admitted to a referral intensive care unit were prospectively enrolled and had a two-dimensional echocardiogram (2D-TTE) and a cardiac troponin I (cTnI) assay within the first 72 hours. For statistical analysis, two-sided p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Thirty-three patients were included, of which 51.5% presented elevated cTnI and/or abnormal 2D-TTE and 36.4% needed cardiovascular support, which was more frequent in patients with both raised cTnI and 2D-TTE abnormalities than in patients with normal exams (83.3% and 33.3%, respectively; p 0.006, 95% CI = 0.15-0.73). The most common 2D-TTE findings were pericardial effusion (15.2%) and mitral/tricuspid regurgitation (15.2%). Signs of cardiac involvement were more common in MIS-C than in SARS. MIS-C patients also presented a higher rate of the need for cardiovascular support (66.7% vs 25%, p 0.03, 95% CI = -0.7 to -0.04) and a more frequent rate of raised cTnI (77.8% vs 20.8%; p 0.002, 95% CI = 0.19 to 0.79).

Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak could alter their psychological state. The objective was to analyze the psychological impact of the pandemic and confinement on stress levels and psychopathological symptoms in patients with SLE. Patients and method: In this cross-sectional study, stress levels were compared with the Perceived Stress Scale, the Stress Vulnerability Inventory and psychopathological symptoms of the SCL-90-R Symptom Inventory in patients with SLE during the period of confinement (group 1; n = 276) in comparison to patients with SLE evaluated in a period before the pandemic (group 2; n = 152). Results: The comparison between both groups showed there were statistically significant differences in vulnerability to stress (p < 0.0001), depression (p &#8804; 0.05), anxiety (p &#8804; 0.05), phobic anxiety (p < 0.0001), interpersonal sensitivity (p &#8804; 0.043), and psychoticism (p &#8804; 0.023). In these variables, the group of patients with lupus in confinement obtained higher scores. Conclusions: The confinement and threat of the COVID-19 outbreak had important repercussions on the psychological state of patients with SLE with high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.

However, in the early 2000s, the effectiveness of LIT was questioned. Recently, meta-analyses have observed the effectiveness and safety of LIT in treating couples with RM. Some studies evaluated the use of LIT in recurrent implantation failure (RIF) in in vitro fertilization cycles. METHODS: This systematic and narrative review evaluated the data available in the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of the use of LIT. Searches in PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were conducted, using the following keywords: \\"recurrent miscarriage,\\" \\"lymphocyte immunotherapy,\\" and \\"recurrent implantation failure\\". RESULTS: This review describes the historical aspects of LIT and discusses its protocols, mechanisms of action, side effects, complications, and current evidence of the effectiveness in cases of reproductive failure. It also discusses the use of LIT during the COVID-19 pandemic and new immunological therapies. CONCLUSION: In the vast majority of studies, the use of LIT for RM couples has shown an improvement in pregnancy outcomes.

This study aims to identify whether inequalities in the completeness of death registration between states in India, including by sex, have narrowed during this period of CRVS system strengthening. METHODS: Data used in this study are registered deaths by state and year from 2000 to 2018 (and by sex from 2009 to 2018) reported in the Civil Registration Reports published by the Office of Registrar General of India. Completeness of death registration is calculated using the empirical completeness method. Levels and trends inequalities in completeness are measured in each state a socio-economic indicator C the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI). RESULTS: Estimated completeness of death registration in India increased from 58% in 2000 to 81% in 2018. Male completeness rose from 60% in 2009 to 85% in 2018 and was much higher than female completeness, which increased from 54 to 74% in the same period. Completeness remained very low in some states, particularly from the eastern (e.g. Bihar) and north-eastern regions. However, in states from the northern region (e.g. Uttar Pradesh) completeness increased significantly from a low level. There was a narrowing of inequalities in completeness according to the SDI during the period, however large inequalities between states remain. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in completeness of death registration in India is a substantial achievement and increases the potential of the death registration system as a routine source of mortality data. Although narrowing of inequalities in completeness demonstrates that the benefits of higher levels of death registration have spread to relatively poorer states of India in recent years, the continued low completeness in some states and for females are concerning. The Indian CRVS system also needs to increase the number of registered deaths with age at death reported to improve their usability for mortality statistics.

The current continent-wide pandemic has persisted for over 10 years, and its economy-devastating effect was highlighted after spreading to China, which possesses half of the world pig industry. So far, development of an effective and safe vaccine has not been finished largely due to the knowledge gaps in pathogenesis and immunology, particularly the role of cytokines in the host's immune response. Therefore, we performed experiments in domestic pigs to analyze the kinetics of representative circulating interferons (IFNs), interleukins (ILs), growth factors, tumor necrosis factors (TNFs), and chemokines induced by infection of type II virulent ASFV SY18. Pigs infected with this Chinese prototypical isolate developed severe clinical manifestations mostly from 3 days post inoculation (dpi) and died from 7 to 8 dpi. Serum analysis revealed a trend of robust and sustained elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-, IFN-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), and IFN--induced protein 10 (IP-10) from 3 dpi, but not the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor- (TGF-). Moreover, secondary drastic increase of the levels of TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8, as well as elevated IL-10, was observed at the terminal phase of infection. This pattern of cytokine secretion clearly drew an image of a typical cytokine storm characterized by delayed and dysregulated initiation of the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine and imbalanced pro- and anti-inflammatory response, which paved a way for further understanding of the molecular basis of ASFV pathogenesis.","output":"Cytokine Storm in Domestic Pigs Induced by Infection of Virulent African Swine Fever Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Editor's Note: For those whose response to COVID-19 includes exploring beyond vaccines, conventional pharmaceuticals, and the watchful or healthy waiting until such tools might arrive, interest in cannabinoids has been high - and controversial.

To analyse spatial patterns of historical and/or contemporary hybridization between these two taxa and understand how species boundaries are maintained in the region of secondary contact, we sampled sympatric and allopatric populations of the two species and obtained genome-wide SNP data using a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing approach. We used Bayesian clustering analyses to test the hypothesis of contemporary hybridization in sympatric populations and employed a suite of phylogenomic approaches and a coalescent-based simulation framework to evaluate alternative hypothetical scenarios of interspecific gene flow. Our analyses rejected the hypothesis of contemporary hybridization but revealed past introgression in the area where the distributions of the two species overlap. Overall, these results point to a scenario of historical gene flow after secondary contact followed by the evolution of reproductive isolation that currently prevents hybridization among sympatric populations.","output":"Genomic footprints of an old affair: SNP data reveal historical hybridization and the subsequent evolution of reproductive barriers in two recently diverged grasshoppers with partly overlapping distributions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Never in history has the fabric of African neurosurgery been challenged as it is today with the advent of the novel coronavirus identified in 2019 (COVID-19).

Specifically, accurately identify the whole growth cycle of Z. latifolia. Microstructure observations showed that the presence of U. esculenta could be clearly observed after gall formation but was absent after the TDF treatment.

The sudden spike in the number of infections and high mortality rates have put immense pressure on the public healthcare systems. Hence, it is crucial to identify the key factors for mortality prediction to optimize patient treatment strategy. Different routine blood test results are widely available compared to other forms of data like X-rays, CT-scans, and ultrasounds for mortality prediction. This study proposes machine learning (ML) methods based on blood tests data to predict COVID-19 mortality risk. A powerful combination of five features: neutrophils, lymphocytes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and age helps to predict mortality with 96% accuracy. Various ML models (neural networks, logistic regression, XGBoost, random forests, SVM, and decision trees) have been trained and performance compared to determine the model that achieves consistently high accuracy across the days that span the disease. The best performing method using XGBoost feature importance and neural network classification, predicts with an accuracy of 90% as early as 16 days before the outcome. Robust testing with three cases based on days to outcome confirms the strong predictive performance and practicality of the proposed model. A detailed analysis and identification of trends was performed using these key biomarkers to provide useful insights for intuitive application.

The recent SARS-CoV-2 presents the main protease (MCoV2pro) with 12 mutations compared to SARS-CoV (MCoV1pro). Recent studies point out that these subtle differences lead to mobility variances at the active site loops with functional implications. We use metadynamics simulations and a sort of computational analysis to probe the dynamic, pharmacophoric and catalytic environment differences between the monomers of both enzymes. So, we verify how much intrinsic distinctions are preserved in the functional dimer of MCoV2pro, as well as its implications for ligand accessibility and optimized drug screening. We find a significantly higher accessibility to open binding conformers in the MCoV2pro monomer compared to MCoV1pro. A higher hydration propensity for the MCoV2pro S2 loop with the A46S substitution seems to exercise a key role. Quantum calculations suggest that the wider conformations for MCoV2pro are less catalytically active in the monomer. However, the statistics for contacts involving the N-finger suggest higher maintenance of this activity at the dimer. Docking analyses suggest that the ability to vary the active site width can be important to improve the access of the ligand to the active site in different ways. So, we carry out a multiconformational virtual screening with different ligand bases. The results point to the importance of taking into account the protein conformational multiplicity for new promissors anti MCoV2pro ligands.

Numerous studies aim to estimate the effects of these policies. Many statistical and econometric methods, such as difference-in-differences, leverage repeated measurements, and variation in timing to estimate policy effects, including in the COVID-19 context. Although these methods are less common in epidemiology, epidemiologic researchers are well accustomed to handling similar complexities in studies of individual-level interventions. Target trial emulation emphasizes the need to carefully design a nonexperimental study in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, covariates, exposure definition, and outcome measurement-and the timing of those variables. We argue that policy evaluations using group-level longitudinal (\\"panel\\") data need to take a similar careful approach to study design that we refer to as policy trial emulation. This approach is especially important when intervention timing varies across jurisdictions; the main idea is to construct target trials separately for each treatment cohort (states that implement the policy at the same time) and then aggregate.

This study addressed the clinical and immunopathological characteristics of severe COVID-19. METHODS Sixty-nine COVID-19 patients were classified into as severe and non-severe groups to analyze their clinical and laboratory characteristics. A panel of blood cytokines was quantified over time. Biopsy specimens from two deceased cases were obtained for immunopathological, ultrastructural, and in situ hybridization examinations. RESULTS Circulating cytokines, including IL8, IL6, TNF, IP10, MCP1, and RANTES, were significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients. Dynamic IL6 and IL8 were associated with disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated to infect type II, type I pneumocytes and endothelial cells, leading to severe lung damage through cell pyroptosis and apoptosis. In severe cases, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and massive macrophage and neutrophil infiltrates were observed in both blood and lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS A panel of circulating cytokines could be used to predict disease deterioration and inform clinical interventions. Severe pulmonary damage was predominantly attributed to both SARS-CoV-2 caused cytopathy and immunopathologic damage.

A regular pathobiological hallmark of CP is oligodendrocyte maturation impairment resulting in white matter (WM) injury and reduced axonal myelination. Regeneration therapies based on cell replacement are currently limited, but neural precursor cells (NPCs), as cellular support for myelination, represent a promising regeneration strategy to treat CP, although the transplantation parameters (e.g., timing, dosage, mechanism) remain to be determined. We optimized a hemiplegic mouse model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia that mirrors the pathobiological hallmarks of CP and transplanted NPCs into the corpus callosum (CC), a major white matter structure impacted in CP patients. The NPCs survived, engrafted, and differentiated morphologically in male and female mice. Histology and MRI showed repair of lesioned structures. Furthermore, electrophysiology revealed functional myelination of the CC (e.g., restoration of conduction velocity), while cylinder and CatWalk tests demonstrated motor recovery of the affected forelimb. Endogenous oligodendrocytes, recruited in the CC following transplantation of exogenous NPCs, are the principal actors in this recovery process. The lack of differentiation of the transplanted NPCs is consistent with enhanced recovery due to an indirect mechanism, such as a trophic and/or \\"bio-bridge\\" support mediated by endogenous oligodendrocytes. Our work establishes that transplantation of NPCs represents a viable therapeutic strategy for CP treatment, and that the enhanced recovery is mediated by endogenous oligodendrocytes.

The function of Nrf2 is regulated by its negative regulator Keap1 by inducing its cytoplasmic degradation. Recent studies have suggested that Nrf2 is also regulated post-transcriptionally via miRNAs. However, to date, how miRNAs regulate Nrf2 in fish skeletal muscles is unknown. In this study, the full-length cDNAs with 2398 bp of the Nrf2 was firstly cloned by SMART RACE amplification tools from Chinese perch. The Nrf2 gene structure and its 3'-UTR region for possible miRNA binding sites, as well as its spatial expression profile were assayed. Then, we employed TargetScan Fish tool MiRNAnome to predict putative sites for five miRNAs including miR-181a-5p, MiR-194a, MiR-216a, miR-459-5p, and miR-724. Using qRT-PCR assay, we found that Nrf2 mRNA levels have negative correlation with all five miRNAs expression in muscle of nutritionally deprived fish, and that ectopic expression of miR-181a-5p alone reduces Nrf2 mRNA levels. Luciferase reporter assay in a heterologous cell system revealed that each of the five miRNAs reduced Nrf2 expression, suggesting a direct regulatory mechanism. Moreover, the miR-181a-5p suppression using specific antagomir led to a significant increase in Nrf2 expression in vivo. At the same time, the expression levels of the antioxidant enzymes CAT, ZnSOD, GPx, GSTA, and GSTA genes increased significantly after injecting miR-181a-5p antagomir.

This lethality seems to be very low in Africa and Asia, but exceedingly high in western Europe and North America. Many factors could have a role in this disparity such as comorbidities. Advanced age, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer were the most frequently cited in the reported COVID-19 data. The main objective was to analyse the association between the COVID-19 mortality and the mentioned factors in 164 countries. Methods: The Data of COVID-19 deaths, latitude degrees, population age distribution, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes and cancer were extracted from different online sources. For the statistical analysis, we used Spearman to measure the correlation coefficient between numbers of deaths and the mentioned factors until June 29, 2020. Results: The correlation between COVID-19 mortality and latitude, high age, obesity, CVD and number of cancer patients per 100,000 is significant at 0.01 level with r = 0.489, r=0.511, r=0.489, r=0.561 and r=0.536 respectively. The correlation between the number of deaths and diabetes is less strong than the previous ones, and the correlation coefficient is r= 0.154.

METHODS: In line with the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was conducted including trials that investigated the effect of home-based prehabilitation (HBP) in patients undergoing surgery for cancer. The primary outcome was postoperative functional capacity (6 min walking test, 6MWT). Secondary outcomes were postoperative complications and compliance. RESULTS: Five randomized controlled trials were included with 351 patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer, oesophagogastric cancer, bladder cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Three studies presented results of significant progress after eight weeks. The meta-analysis showed a significant improvement of the 6MWT in the prehabilitation group compared to the control group preoperatively (MD 35.06; 95% CI 11.58 to 58.54; p = .003) and eight weeks postoperatively (MD 44.91; 95% CI 6.04 to 83.79; p = .02) compared to baseline. Compliance rate varied from 63% to 83% with no significant difference between prehabilitation and control groups. These data must be interpreted with caution because of a high amount of heterogeneity and small sample sizes. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, HBP may enhance overall functional capacity of patients receiving oncological surgery compared to standard of care. This could be a promising alternative to hospital-based prehabilitation regarding the current pandemic and further digitalization in the future. In order to increase accessibility and effectiveness of prehabilitation, home-based solutions should be further investigated.","output":"Fit4Surgery for cancer patients during covid-19 lockdown C A systematic review and meta-analysis()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic impacted early childhood programs serving infants, toddlers, and preschoolers in dramatic ways.

This manuscript reports on statewide efforts to continue quality improvement initiatives for early childhood programs amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. We first describe the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic for over 2000 educators-teachers, administrators, and specialists-who completed surveys in the Spring and Fall of 2020. These survey data come from a statewide system called the Texas Early Childhood Professional Development System (TECPDS), designed to track the professional development needs/progress of early childhood educators. Second, we describe an example of how a statewide professional development and quality improvement program shifted to remote delivery during the pandemic. As an increasing number of educators turn to virtual training resources, we explain lessons learned from these response efforts and how they can inform future virtual professional development efforts, even amidst crisis, to ensure that a focus on quality improvement continues while supporting teachers' individual needs.","output":"\\"Doing What I can, but I got no Magic Wand:\\" A Snapshot of Early Childhood Educator Experiences and Efforts to Ensure Quality During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Various formalisms have been developed to represent clinical practice guideline recommendations in a computer-interpretable way. However, none of the existing formalisms leverage the structured and computable information that emerge from the evidence-based guideline development process. Thus, we here propose a FHIR-based guideline representation format that is structurally aligned to the knowledge artifacts emerging during the process of evidence-based guideline development. Methods We identified the information required to represent evidence-based clinical practice guideline recommendations and reviewed the knowledge artifacts emerging during the evidence-based guideline development process. Then we conducted a consensus-based design process with domain experts to develop an information model for guideline recommendation representation that is structurally aligned to the evidence-based guideline recommendation development process and a corresponding representation based on evidence-based medicine (EBM)-on-FHIR resources. Results The information model of clinical practice guideline recommendations and its EBMonFHIR-based representation contain the clinical contents of individual guideline recommendations, a set of metadata for the recommendations, the ratings for the recommendations (e.g., strength of recommendation, certainty of overall evidence), the ratings of certainty of evidence for individual outcomes (e.g., risk of bias) and links to the underlying evidence (systematic reviews based on primary studies). We created profiles and an implementation guide for all FHIR resources required to represent a complete clinical practice guideline and used the profiles to implement an exemplary clinical guideline recommendation. Conclusions Our EBMonFHIR-based representation of clinical practice guideline recommendations allows to directly link the evidence assessment process through systematic reviews and evidence grading, and the underlying evidence from primary studies to the resulting guideline recommendations. This not only allows to evaluate the evidence on which recommendations are based on transparently and critically, but also allows for a more direct and in future automatable way to generate computer-interpretable guideline recommendations based on computable evidence.","output":"Representation of evidence-based clinical practice guideline recommendations on FHIR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acromioclavicular joint pathology such as osteoarthritis has historically been treated with either an open or arthroscopic distal clavicle resection.

The historical factors, which contributed to the emergence of the hearths of Islamic culture in the countries which entered the Arab Caliphate in the Greater Mediterranean parallel with the Antique centers of European civilization, are retrospectively exposed. The Islamist ideologues called the Ottoman Imperia the heir of the Arab Caliphate. The main doctrinal conceptions of Political Islam and its more influential movement Muslim Brotherhood (forbidden in Russia) are discovered. The factor of the Arab Spring, which considerably influenced the strengthening of the Islamist movements, as well as its continuation of the protests in the Arab countries in 20182021, is examined. The main attention is allotted to analyzing the actions of the Islamic movements in Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, and in the Libyan and Syrian conflicts too. The influence of external actors, the most active of which was Turkey, is revealed. The author also analyzes the situation in the Arab-Muslim communities in the European Mediterranean on the example of France, where social-economic problems, aggravated by COVID-19, have contributed to the activation of radical Islamist elements. It is concluded that confronting the Islamist challenge is a complex and controversial task. Its solution depends on both forceful opposition to radical groups and an appropriate foreign policy. An important negative factor is the aggravation of socio-economic problems and crisis phenomena in the institutions of Western democracy, in response to which the ideologues of Islamism preach an alternative world order in the form of an Islamic state.

In total, there are publications on 873 SARS-CoV-2 positive MS patients and information on the outcome can be given for 700 patients. With regard to the different disease modifying therapies (DMTs), by far the most cases were described under anti-CD20 treatment (n = 317). The mortality rate of all MS patients was 4% and a further 3% required invasive or non-invasive ventilation. When looking at the severe and fatal cases, it is particularly noticeable that patients without DMTs, with previous cardiovascular diseases, or with a severe degree of disability are at risk. Immunosuppressive therapy itself does not appear to be a substantial risk factor.

Studies on temporal dynamics of its shedding suggests it peaks 1-2 days prior to any symptom onset. Therefore, a large proportion of patients are actively spreading the disease unknowingly whilst undetected. However, lengthy lockdowns and isolation leads to a host of socioeconomic issues and are impractical. Conversely, there exists no study describing this group and their clinical significance despite their key role in disease transmission. METHODS: As a result, we devised a retrospective study to look at the prevalence of presymptomatic patients with COVID-19 from data sourced via our medical records office. Subsequently, we identify early indicators of infection through demographic information, biochemical and radiological abnormalities which would allow early diagnosis and isolation. In addition, we will look into the clinical significance of this group and their outcome; if it differs from asymptomatic or symptomatic patients. Descriptive statistics were used in addition to tabulating the variables and corresponding values for reference. Variables are compared between the presymptomatic group and others via Chi-square testing and Fisher's exact test, accepting a p value of < 0.05 as significant. RESULTS: Our analysis shows a higher proportion of presymptomatic patients with atypical symptoms like chest pain while symptomatic patients commonly present with respiratory symptoms like cough and shortness of breath. Besides that, there were more females presenting as presymptomatic patients compared to males (p = 0.019) and these group of patients were likely to receive treatment (p < 0.001). Otherwise, we were not able to identify other statistically significant markers suggesting a patient is presymptomatic. CONCLUSION: As we have little means of identifying these silent spreaders, it highlights further the importance of general measures implemented to stop COVID-19 transmission like social distancing, face mask, and widespread testing.","output":"The prevalence and clinical significance of Presymptomatic COVID-19 patients: how we can be one step ahead in mitigating a deadly pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, can cause life-threatening pneumonia, respiratory failure and even death. Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in primary human target cells and tissues is crucial for developing vaccines and therapeutics. However, given the limited access to clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, there is a pressing need for in vitro/in vivo models to investigate authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary human lung cells or tissues with mature structures. The present study was designed to evaluate a humanized mouse model carrying human lung xenografts for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Methods: Human fetal lung tissue surgically grafted under the dorsal skin of SCID mice were assessed for growth and development after 8 weeks. Following SARS-CoV-2 inoculation into the differentiated lung xenografts, viral replication, cell-type tropism and histopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and local cytokine/chemokine expression were determined over a 6-day period. The effect of IFN-&#945; treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection was tested in the lung xenografts. Results: Human lung xenografts expanded and developed mature structures closely resembling normal human lung. SARS-CoV-2 replicated and spread efficiently in the lung xenografts with the epithelial cells as the main target, caused severe lung damage, and induced a robust pro-inflammatory response.

Semi-structured interviews with a range of health and support services staff were conducted in person or by telephone in late 2018. Staff were asked about their perceptions of 1) health and wellbeing issues for international students, 2) barriers to international students accessing campus-based services for health and wellbeing concerns, and 3) strategies to improve international students health and wellbeing. Transcribed interviews were analysed thematically. Mental health/illness was identified as the most important health and wellbeing concern for international students. Barriers to help-seeking included fear of repercussions for coming forward, lack of problem and symptom recognition, poor understanding of health information, cultural stigma associated with counselling and language barriers. A tendency among international students to delay help-seeking until problems reached crisis-point was also identified as a concern. Suggested strategies to improve wellbeing included pre-departure education/orientation to life in Australia, the integration of health and wellbeing education with other university programs, education about confidentiality, better supporting students in how to access services, and skill building to promote social connection.

However, more extensive exploration of this link is required to identify the underlying modifiable risk factors. In the present study, one such factor, namely, emotion regulation difficulties, was explored to see its mediating effect in the relationship between neuroticism and HRBs-the first two constructs of the mentioned link. In this quantitative study, a total of 759 adolescents belonging to the Indian state of Punjab (Males= 402; M(age)=16.08) provided relevant information on a set of standardized questionnaires. Mediation analysis supported the major hypothesis of the present study. The results suggest that emotion regulation difficulty may be a significant mediator in the neuroticism-HRBs link. One's difficulty in regulating emotions might be an underlying mechanism through which high neuroticism increases the probability of indulging in HRBs, resulting in adverse health outcomes.

MAVS levels were also compared in unexposed HTEpC treated with supernatants or lysates from UVA-exposed cells or from unexposed controls. Also, MAVS was assessed in different sections of confluent monolayer plates where only one section was exposed to NB-UVA. The results show that UVA increases the expression of MAVS protein. Cells in a confluent monolayer exposed to UVA were able to confer an elevation in MAVS in cells adjacent to the exposed section, and even cells in the most distant sections not exposed to UVA.

In addition to gains in simplicity, speed, and cost, new applications were included to monitor protein surface exposure and protein retention in the secretion pathway. The enhanced methodologies were applied to investigate de-novo evolution of protein-protein interaction sites. Selecting binding from a mix of 6 protein-libraries towards two targets using high stringency selection led to the isolations of single high-affinity binders to each of the targets, without the need for high complexity libraries. Conversely, low-stringency selection resulted in the creation of many solutions for weak binding, demonstrating the plasticity of weak de-novo interactions.","output":"An enhanced yeast display platform demonstrates the binding plasticity under various selection pressures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines work predominantly by eliciting neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), how the protection they confer depends on the NAb response to vaccination is unclear.

We mimicked responses of individuals by sampling NAb subsets of known sizes from the landscape and found that they recapitulated responses of convalescent patients. Combining individual responses with a mathematical model of within-host SARS-CoV-2 infection post-vaccination, we predicted how the population-level protection conferred would increase with the NAb response to vaccination.

The Act was amended by the Parliament on January 8, 2018, with the changes coming into effect shortly afterwards on January 28. The Act was revised to extend a living donor pool from close relatives (e.g., parents, adult sons and daughters, adult brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts from both the paternal and maternal sides, and spouses) to include certain other relatives such as grandparents, grandchildren, and first cousins (Section 2:4). The Act was also revised to allow individuals to prioritize family members in receiving their organs after their death (Section 7c:3). The aim of this paper is not to carry out an ethical analysis of the Act as a whole but only to focus on aspects relating to priority access for family members to organs. Despite Islam encouraging Muslims to be sympathetic, and to save the life of any member of humankind (Quran 5:32), saving the life of a relative through organ donation is even more highly valued. The collective and extended structure of the family impacts on the provisions of the Act that only allows Bangladeshis to legally donate their organs to save the lives of relatives and allows individuals to prioritize family members. Recent progress in the practice of organ transplantation raises a number of ethical dilemmas around the allocation of available organs in the context of organ scarcity. A key purpose of introducing incentive into the system of organ allocation is to increase the number of donations from living relatives and initiation of vital organ donations from brain-dead donors. However, allocation criteria based on a living organ donation incentive system would appear to be unethical because there is no provision in the Act with regard to financial compensation for a distant relative donors post-operative care in the absence of healthcare coverage. Receiving organs from a distant relative without giving financial compensation for post-operative care places them in a grave health condition and violates the biomedical principle of non-maleficence. An incentive system around brain-dead donors would appear to be ethical as the amended Act allows individuals to prioritize relatives in receiving their organs after death. This provision is intended to initiate the transplantation of vital organs (e.g., kidney, liver, heart, pancreas, bone marrow) from brain-dead donors as families might bear the cost of keeping the organs alive for transplantation. Regular reassessment of the impact of the Act is necessary to maximize the donation rate of transplantable organs using ethical means.","output":"The Human Organ Transplantation Act in Bangladesh: Towards Proper Family-Based Ethics and Law"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes an innovative remote surface sterilization approach that could be applicable to the new coronavirus. The process is based on the application of a liquid film on the surface or object under sterilization (OUS). A beacon signal is required to self-steer the transmitted power from the designed retrodirective antenna array (RDA) towards the OUS;once the liquid film reaches the required temperature, the sterilization can be considered complete. Results suggest that the process takes 5 minutes or less for an angular coverage range over 60 whilst abiding by the relevant safety protocols. This paper also models the power incident onto the OUS and results are consistent with full-wave simulations. A practical RDA system is developed operating at 2.5 GHz and tested through the positioning of a representative target aperture surface. Measurements, developed by sampling the power transmitted by the heterodyne RDA, are reported for various distances and angles, operating in the near-field of the system. To further validate the methodology, an additional experiment investigating virus deactivation through microwave heating was also reported using live Coronavirus (strain 229E). Possible applications of the method include the sterilization of ambulances, medical equipment, and internet of things (IoT) devices.

Methods: In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, we calculated multiple rehabilitation indices of patients discharged from our rehabilitation ward between February 28 and May 25, 2020 when Hokkaido was initially affected by COVID-19, and compared them with those calculated during the same period in 2019. The Fisher exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis. We also verified the impact of implementing the original infection control measures for the rehabilitation team on preventing nosocomial infections. Results: A total of 93 patients (47 of 2020 group, 46 of 2019 group) were included. The median age was 87 and 88 years, respectively, with no differences in age, sex, and main disease between the groups. Training time per day in the ward in 2020 was significantly lower than that in 2019 (p = 0.013). No significant differences were found in the qualitative evaluation indices of Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score at admission, FIM gain, length of ward stay, FIM efficiency, and rate of discharge to home. None of the patients or staff members had confirmed COVID-19 during the study period.

However, a subset of patients fails to respond or relapse after CD19 CAR T cell therapy, in part due to antigen loss, which has prompted the search for alternative antigen targets. CD22 is another antigen found on the surface of B cells. CARs targeting CD22 alone or in combination with other antigens have been investigated in several pre-clinical and clinical trials. Given the heterogeneity and small size of CAR T cell therapy clinical trials, systematic reviews are needed to evaluate their efficacy and safety. Here, we propose a systematic review of CAR T cell therapies targeting CD22, alone or in combination with other antigen targets, in B cell malignancies. METHODS We will perform a systematic search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, clinicaltrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Ongoing and completed clinical trials will be identified and cataloged. Interventional studies investigating CD22 CAR T cells, including various multi-antigen targeting approaches, in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies will be eligible for inclusion. Only full-text articles, conference abstracts, letters, and case reports will be considered. Our primary outcome will be a complete response, defined as absence of detectable cancer. Secondary outcomes will include adverse events, overall response, minimal residual disease, and relapse, among others. Quality assessment will be performed using a modified Institute of Health Economics tool designed for interventional single-arm studies. We will report a narrative synthesis of clinical studies, presented in tabular format. If appropriate, a meta-analysis will be performed using a random effects model to synthesize results. DISCUSSION The results of the proposed review will help inform clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders of the risks and benefits of CD22 CAR T cell therapies. It will identify gaps or inconsistencies in outcome reporting and help to guide future clinical trials investigating CAR T cells.

Unsurprisingly, acute phase reactant was not a satisfactory explanation. Moreover, the behavior of ferritin in patients with severe COVID-19 and the subsequent high mortality rates in patients with high ferritin levels necessitated further investigations to understand the role of ferritin in the diseases. Ferritin was initially described to accompany various acute infections, both viral and bacterial, indicating an acute response to inflammation. However, with the introduction of the hyperferritinemic syndrome connecting four severe pathological conditions such as adult-onset Still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and septic shock added another aspect of ferritin where it could have a pathogenetic role rather than an extremely elevated protein only. In fact, suggesting that COVID-19 is a new member in the spectrum of hyperferritinemic syndrome besides the four mentioned conditions could hopefully direct further search on the pathogenetic role of ferritin. Doubtlessly, improving our understanding of those aspects of ferritin would enormously contribute to better coping with severe diseases in terms of treatment and prevention of complications. The origin, history, importance, and the advances of searching the role of ferritin in various pathological and clinical processes are presented hereby in our article.

Participants filled out detailed questionnaires about their physical and mental health and experiences on a weekly basis starting in late March 2020, and the cohort consists of everyone who filled in at least one questionnaire in the first 8 weeks of the project. FINDINGS TO DATE: >71 000 unique participants responded to the questionnaires at least once during the first 8 weeks, with >22 000 participants responding to seven questionnaires. Compiled questionnaire results are continuously updated and shared with the public through the Corona Barometer website. Early results included a clear signal that younger people living alone were experiencing greater levels of loneliness due to lockdown, and subsequent results showed the easing of anxiety as lockdown was eased in June 2020.

Proteases, the hydrolases, can be of several types based on the nucleophilic amino acid or the metal cofactor needed for their activity. Cathepsins are proteases with serine, cysteine, or aspartic acid residues as the nucleophiles, which are vital for digestion, coagulation, immune response, adipogenesis, hormone liberation, peptide synthesis, among a litany of other functions. But inflammatory state radically affects their normal roles. Released from the lysosomes, they degrade extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and elastin, mediating parasite infection, autoimmune diseases, tumor metastasis, cardiovascular issues, and neural degeneration, among other health hazards. Over the years, the different types and isoforms of cathepsin, their optimal pH and functions have been studied, yet much information is still elusive. By taming and harnessing cathepsins, by inhibitors and judicious lifestyle, a gamut of malignancies can be resolved.

However, exposure to fragranced cleaning products has been associated with adverse effects on human health. Products can emit a range of volatile chemicals, including some classified as hazardous, but relatively few ingredients are disclosed to the public. Thus, relatively little is known about the specific emissions from these products. This study investigates the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from pandemic products that are being used frequently and extensively in society. In addition, among these emissions, this study identifies potentially hazardous compounds, compares so-called green and regular versions of products, and examines whether ingredients are disclosed to the public. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, 26 commonly used pandemic products, including 13 regular and 13 so-called green versions, were analyzed for their volatile emissions. Product types included hand sanitizers, air disinfectants, multipurpose cleaners, and handwashing soap. All products were fragranced. The analyses found the products collectively emitted 399 VOCs with 127 VOCs classified as potentially hazardous. All products emitted potentially hazardous compounds. Comparing regular products and green products, no significant difference was found in the emissions of the most prevalent compounds. Further, among the 399 compounds emitted, only 4% of all VOCs and 11% of potentially hazardous VOCs were disclosed on any product label or safety data sheet. This study reveals that pandemic products can generate volatile emissions that could pose risks to health, that could be unrecognized, and that could be reduced, such as by using fragrance-free versions of products.

Among various comorbidities potentially impacting on this process, the weight and the consequences of an antibody deficiency have not yet been clarified. METHODS: We used serum protein electrophoresis to screen for hypogammaglobulinemia in a cohort of consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, hospitalized in non-intensive care setting between December 2020 and January 2021. The disease severity, measured by a validated score and by the need for semi intensive (sICU) or intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and the 30-day mortality was compared between patients presenting hypogammaglobulinemia (HYPO) and without hypogammaglobulinemia (no-HYPO). Demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 specific treatment during the hospital stay, disease duration, complications and laboratory parameters were also evaluated in both groups. RESULTS: We enrolled 374 patients, of which 39 represented the HYPO cohort (10.4%). In 10/39 the condition was previously neglected, while in the other 29/39 hematologic malignancies were common (61.5%); 2/39 were on regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT). Patients belonging to the HYPO group more frequently developed a severe COVID-19 and more often required sICU/ICU admission than no-HYPO patients. IgRT were administered in 8/39 during hospitalization; none of them died or needed sICU/ICU. Among HYPO cohort, we observed a significantly higher prevalence of neoplastic affections, of active oncologic treatment and bronchiectasis, together with higher prevalence of viral and bacterial superinfections, mechanical ventilation, convalescent plasma and SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies administration during hospital stay, and longer disease duration. Multivariate logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed the impact of hypogammaglobulinemia on the COVID-19 severity and the probability of sICU/ICU admission. The analysis of the mortality rate in the whole cohort showed no significant difference between HYPO and no-HYPO. CONCLUSIONS: Hypogammaglobulinemia, regardless of its cause, in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a non-intensive care setting was associated to a more severe disease course and more frequent admission to s-ICU/ICU, particularly in absence of IgRT. Our findings emphasize the add-value of routine serum protein electrophoresis evaluation in patients admitted with COVID-19 to support clinicians in patient care and to consider IgRT initiation during hospitalization.","output":"Impact of Hypogammaglobulinemia on the Course of COVID-19 in a Non-Intensive Care Setting: A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Retinal autoantibodies, commonly referred to as antiretinal antibodies (ARA), have been implicated in the pathogenicity of a variety of immune-mediated visual disorders. In the paraneoplastic syndrome, cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR), ARA with their targeted retinal antigens have been identified. There are many other infectious, inflammatory as well as degenerative retinopathies associated with the presence of ARA. More than 15 ARA have been identified in CAR. For these autoantibodies, the autoantigens still remain unknown. Recoverin, a calcium-binding retinal protein involved in the reversal of the phototransduction cascade, is well established as the most common CAR autoantigen. The proposed mechanism of antibody-mediated degeneration involves molecular mimicry and loss of peripheral tolerance to residing retinal antigens. In vitro, ARA have been shown to cause apoptotic death of photoreceptors. Questions remain though, regarding the access and penetration of these antibodies into the retina. Furthermore, the titer of ARA does not always correlate with clinical disease status. There exists lack of standardization of antibody and antigen detection. Thus, results from different laboratories cannot exactly be compared. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of pathogenic ARA is also lacking. Though there are many caveats, presence of ARA still serves as an adjunctive study for the clinician to confirm a diagnosis, which often is difficult to make.
