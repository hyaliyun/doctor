The purpose of this research was to measure the safety and pharmacokinetics of clearance of intranasally administered UFH solution from the nasal cavity. MethodsDouble-blinded daily intranasal dosing in C57Bl6 mice with four doses (60 ng to 60 {micro}g) of UFH was carried out for fourteen consecutive days, with both blood coagulation measurements and subject adverse event monitoring. The pharmacokinetics of fluorescent-labeled UFH clearance from the nasal cavity were measured in mice by in vivo imaging. Intranasal UFH at 2000 U/day solution with nasal spray device was tested for safety in a small number of healthy human subjects. ResultsUFH showed no evidence of toxicity in mice at any dose measured. No significant changes were observed in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, or frequency of minor irritant events over vehicle-only control. Human subjects showed no significant changes in aPTT time, international normalized ratio (INR), or platelet count over baseline measurements. No serious adverse events were observed. In vivo imaging in a mouse model showed a two-phase clearance of UFH from the nasal cavity. After 12 hours, 2.1% of the initial administered UFH remained in the nasal cavity, decaying to background levels after 24 hours. ConclusionsUFH showed no toxic effects for extended daily intranasal dosing in mice as well as humans. The clearance kinetics of intranasal heparin solution from the nasal cavity indicates potentially protective levels for up to 12 hours after dosing.","output":"Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Intranasally Administered Heparin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) causes great economic losses to the chicken industry worldwide.

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of GA dating uncertainty on the observed performance of a validated proteomic biomarker risk predictor, and then to test the generalizability of that effect in a broader range of GA at blood draw. In a secondary analysis of a prospective clinical trial (PAPR; NCT01371019), we compared two GA dating categories: both ultrasound and dating by last menstrual period (LMP) (all subjects) and excluding dating by LMP (excluding LMP). The risk predictors performance was observed at the validated risk predictor threshold both in weeks 19(1/7)C20(6/7) and extended to weeks 18(0/7)C20(6/7). Strict blinding and independent statistical analyses were employed. The validated biomarker risk predictor showed greater observed sensitivity of 88% at 75% specificity (increases of 17% and 1%) in more reliably dated (excluding-LMP) subjects, relative to all subjects. Excluding dating by LMP significantly improved the sensitivity in weeks 19(1/7)C20(6/7). In the broader blood draw window, the previously validated risk predictor threshold significantly stratified higher and lower risk of sPTB, and the risk predictor again showed significantly greater observed sensitivity in excluding-LMP subjects.

AIM: To describe trends in HAIs in a Tunisian university hospital through repeated point prevalence surveys over 9 years, assess the impact of measures implemented for COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify associated factors of HAI. METHODS: The current study focused on data collected from annual point prevalence surveys conducted from 2012 to 2020. All types of HAIs as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were included. Data collection was carried out using NosoTun plug. Univariate and multivariate logistic analysis were used to identify HAI risk factors. RESULTS: Overall, 2729 patients were observed in the 9 surveys; the mean age was 48.3  23.3 years and 57.5% were male. We identified 267 infected patients (9.8%) and 296 HAIs (10.8%). Pneumonia/lower respiratory tract infections were the most frequent HAI (24%), followed by urinary tract infection (20.9%).The prevalence of infected patients increased from 10.6% in 2012 to 14.9% in 2020. However, this increase was not statistically significant. The prevalence of HAIs increased significantly from 12.3% to 15.5% (P =.003). The only decrease involved is bloodstream infections (from 2% to 1%). Independent risk factors significantly associated with HAI were undergoing surgical intervention (aOR = 1.7), the use of antibiotic treatment in previous 6 months (aOR = 1.8), peripheral line (aOR=2), parenteral nutrition (aOR=2.4), urinary tract within 7 days (aOR=2.4), central line (aOR = 6.3), and prosthesis (aOR = 12.8), length of stay (aOR = 3), and the year of the survey. Young age was found as protective factor (aOR = .98). CONCLUSION: Contrary to what was expected, we noticed an increase in the HAIs rates despite the preventive measures put in place to control the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partly explained by the vulnerability of hospitalized patients during this period.","output":"Trends of Healthcare-associated Infections in a Tuinisian University Hospital and Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetes is considered as an critical comorbidity linked with the latest coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which spreads through Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2).

While Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) sets continue to expand our understanding of the mutational landscape of single proteins, the results continue to challenge analyses. Protein Language Models (pLMs) use the latest deep learning (DL) algorithms to leverage growing databases of protein sequences. These methods learn to predict missing or masked amino acids from the context of entire sequence regions. Here, we used pLM representations (embeddings) to predict sequence conservation and SAV effects without multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Embeddings alone predicted residue conservation almost as accurately from single sequences as ConSeq using MSAs (two-state Matthew Correlation Coefficient C MCC - for ProtT5 embeddings of 0.596  0.006 vs. 0.608  0.006 for ConSeq). Inputting the conservation prediction along with BLOSUM62 substitution scores and pLM mask reconstruction probabilities into a simplistic logistic regression (LR) ensemble for Variant Effect Scoring without alignments (VESPA) predicted SAV effect magnitude without any optimization on DMS data. Comparing predictions for a standard set of 39 DMS experiments to other methods (incl. ESM-1v, DeepSequence, and GEMME) revealed our approach as competitive with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods using MSA input. No method outperformed all others, neither consistently nor in a statistically significant manner, independently of the performance measure applied (incl. two-state accuracy: Q2, MCC, Spearman and Pearson correlation). Lastly, we investigated binary effect predictions on DMS experiments for four human proteins. Overall, embedding-based methods have become competitive with methods relying on MSAs for SAV effect prediction at a fraction of the costs in computing/energy. Our method predicted SAV effects for the entire human proteome (~ 20k proteins) within 40 minutes on one Nvidia Quadro RTX 8000.

This includes updates on initiation of feeding, immunonutrition, and metabolic substrates including ketogenic diet, cerebral microdialysis (CMD) monitoring, and the microbiome. RECENT FINDINGS: Little evidence exists to support differences in feeding practices among the neurocritical care population. New areas of interest with limited data include use of immunonutrition, pre/probiotics for microbiome manipulation, ketogenic diet, and use of CMD catheters for substrate utilization monitoring. SUMMARY: Acute neurologic injury incites a cascade of adrenergic and neuroendocrine events resulting in a pro-inflammatory and hypercatabolic state, which is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality. Nutritional support provides substrates to mitigate the damaging effects of hypermetabolism. Despite this practice, studies on feeding delivery outcomes remain inconsistent. Guidelines suggest use of early enteral nutrition using standard polymeric formulas. Population heterogeneity, variability in interventions, complexities of the metabolic and inflammatory responses, and paucity of nutrition research in patients requiring neurocritical care have led to controversies in the field. It is imperative that more pragmatic and reproducible research be conducted to better understand underlying pathophysiology and develop interventions that may improve outcomes.","output":"Nutrition in the Neurocritical Care Unit: a New Frontier"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The primary objective was to describe the clinical characteristics and 30-day mortality rates in emergency department patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in different diagnostic groupings. MATERIAL AND METHODS Secondary analysis of the COVID-19 registry compiled by the emergency department of Hospital Clnico San Carlos in Madrid, Spain. We selected suspected COVID-19 cases treated in the emergency department between February 28 and March 31, 2020. The cases were grouped as follows: 1) suspected, no polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (S/no-PCR); 2) suspected, negative PCR (S/PCR-); 3) suspected, positive PCR (S/PCR+); 4) highly suspected, no PCR, or negative PCR (HS/no or PCR-); and 5) highly suspected, positive PCR (HS/PCR+). We collected clinical, radiologic, and microbiologic data related to the emergency visit. The main outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were hospitalization and clinical severity of the episode. RESULTS A total of 1993 cases (90.9%) were included as follows: S/no-PCR, 17.2%; S/PCR-, 11.4%; S/PCR+, 22.1%; HS/no PCR or PCR-, 11.7%; and HS/PCR+, 37.6%. Short-term outcomes differed significantly in the different groups according to demographic characteristics; comorbidity and clinical, radiographic, analytical, and therapeutic variables. Thirty-day mortality was 11.5% (56.5% in hospitalized cases and 19.6% in cases classified as severe). The 2 HS categories and the S/PCR+ category had a greater adjusted risk for 30-day mortality and for having a clinically severe episode during hospitalization in comparison with S/PCR- cases.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore how COVID-19 impacted nurses through capturing public sentiments expressed by nurses on a social media discussion platform and how these sentiments changed over time. METHODS: We collected over 110,993 Facebook discussion posts and comments in an open COVID-19 group for nurses from March 2020 until the end of November 2020. Scraping of deidentified offline HTML tags on social media posts and comments was performed. Using subject-matter expert opinions and social media analytics (ie, topic modeling, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis), we performed a human-in-a-loop analysis of nursing professionals key perspectives to identify trends of the COVID-19 impact among at-risk nursing communities. We further investigated the key insights of the trends of the nursing professionals perspectives by detecting temporal changes of comments related to emotional effects, feelings of frustration, impacts of isolation, shortage of safety equipment, and frequency of safety equipment uses. Anonymous quotes were highlighted to add context to the data.

Studies chosen for review had a sample size of at least 40 patients, level IV evidence at most, and a Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies index of at least 10. Indications for use of biologic mesh, type of mesh, patient comorbidities, and surgical techniques were also noted. RESULTS Eight studies fulfilled the search criteria and included 635 patients using AlloDerm, Surgisis, and Strattice biologic tissue matrices. In one study, indications and surgical techniques were standardized, and follow-up was prospective. In the other seven studies, indications, surgical techniques, and follow-up were assessed retrospectively. The mean patient age, when reported, was 55.7 years. Body mass index ranged from 30 to 35 kg/m2 in 44 percent of the reported patients. In seven of the eight studies [565 patients (89 percent)], the mean follow-up was 25.8 months and the mean hernia recurrence rate was 21 percent.

Data generated with light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and RT-PCR assays were reviewed. RESULTS: 20 patients were enrolled in the study and the main pulmonary finding was alveolar damage, which was focal in 11 patients and diffuse in 8 patients. Chronic fibrotic and inflammatory lesions were observed in 18 cases, with acute inflammatory lesions in 12 cases. Diffuse lesions, collapsed alveoli and dystrophic pneumocytes were more frequent in the ICU group (62.5%, vs. 25%; 63%, vs. 55%; 87.5%, vs. 54%).

In mice, piRNAs are most abundantly expressed in male germ cells, and form effector complexes with three distinct PIWI proteins. The depletion of individual Piwi genes causes male-specific sterility owing to severe defects in spermatogenesis with no discernible phenotype in female mice. Unlike mice, most other mammals have four PIWI genes, some of which are expressed in the ovary. Here, purification of PIWI complexes from oocytes of the golden hamster revealed that the size of the piRNAs loaded onto PIWIL1 changed during oocyte maturation. In contrast, PIWIL3, an ovary-specific PIWI in most mammals, associates with short piRNAs only in metaphase II oocytes, which coincides with intense phosphorylation of the protein. An improved high-quality genome assembly and annotation revealed that PIWIL1- and PIWIL3-associated piRNAs appear to share the 5- ends of common piRNA precursors and are mostly derived from unannotated sequences with a diminished contribution from TE-derived sequences, most of which correspond to endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Although binding sites for the transcription factor A-Myb are identified in the transcription start site regions of the testis piRNA clusters, the piRNA clusters in the ovary show no well-defined binding motifs in their upstream regions. These results show that hamster piRNA clusters are transcribed by different transcriptional factors in the ovary and testis, resulting in the generation of sex-specific piRNAs. Our findings show the complex and dynamic nature of biogenesis of piRNAs in hamster oocytes, and together with the new genome sequence generated, serve as the foundation for developing useful models to study the piRNA pathway in mammalian oocytes. Highlights - The size of PIWIL1-associated piRNAs changes during oocyte maturation - Phosphorylation of PIWIL3 in MII oocytes coincides with its association with small 19-nt piRNAs - Improved high-quality genome assembly and annotation identifies young endogenous retroviruses as major targets of piRNAs in hamster oocytes - PIWIL1- and PIWIL3-associated piRNAs share the 5-ends of the common piRNA precursors in oocytes","output":"Hamster PIWI proteins bind to piRNAs with stage-specific size variations during oocyte maturation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 is a health emergency. SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) and has rapidly spread worldwide, leaving no country untouched. COVID-19 is a respiratory infection characterized by a pneumonia of unknown etiology. It is transmitted through respiratory droplets; for example: through breathing, talking, and coughing. Transmission of the virus is high. Health care workers play important roles in helping those affected by COVID-19; this could not be done without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE involves the use of goggles, masks, gloves, and gowns and is known to reduce COVID-19 transmission; however, multiple reports of skin disease and damage associated with occupational mask-wearing have emerged. Objective: The objective of this study is to review the literature for newly emerging dermatological conditions as a result of occupational mask-wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A narrative review of new reports of dermatological conditions associated with occupational mask-wearing was carried out in May 2020 by referencing keywords including: \\"covid mask dermatology,\\" \\"covid dermatological damage,\\" \\"covid mask skin,\\" \\"covid N95 mask damage,\\" and \\"covid mask skin damage\\" from PubMed, supplemented by searches on both Google Scholar and ResearchGate. A total of 287 articles were found, of which 40 were successfully included in this study, and an additional 7 were selected from the reference lists of these 40 articles. The findings were tabulated and analyzed under the following headings: dermatological diagnosis, causes, and management. Results: Qualitative analysis of the reviewed data was carried out. A number of dermatological conditions were found to increasingly occur owing to prolonged and frequent use of face masks. Pressure-related injuries were often the most serious complaint; recommendations to reduce this type of injury include the use of hydrocolloid dressings, plastic handles, education, and regular moisturization. Innovation in PPE as well as services, such as virtual clinics, need to be advanced to protect the welfare of health care staff. Conclusions: In these unprecedented times, PPE has been an effective barrier to the transmission of COVID-19 among health care workers. This has allowed health care workers to provide care to patients, with minimal risk. However, our findings suggest that despite the obvious benefits of using face masks to protect the respiratory system, there are also considerable health consequences to the skin. Future research studies are required to focus on improving face masks to ensure both the protection of the respiratory system as well as skin care, which, according to our study, has been overlooked.","output":"Does Wearing a Face Mask During the COVID-19 Pandemic Increase the Incidence of Dermatological Conditions in Health Care Workers?

In the absence of robust preventive or curative strategies, the implementation of social distancing has been a key component of limiting the spread of the virus. METHODS: Daily estimates of R(t) were calculated and compared with measures of social distancing made publicly available by Unacast. Daily generated variables representing an overall grade for distancing, changes in distances traveled, encounters between individuals, and daily visitation, were modeled as predictors of average R value for the following week, using linear regression techniques for 8 counties surrounding the city of Syracuse, New York. Supplementary analysis examined differences between counties. RESULTS: A total of 225 observations were available across the 8 counties, with 166 meeting the mean R(t) < 3 outlier criterion for the regression models. Measurements for distance (? = 1.002, P = .012), visitation (? = .887, P = .017), and encounters (? = 1.070, P = .001) were each predictors of R(t) for the following week. Mean R(t) drops when overall distancing grades move from D+ to C-. These trends were significant (P < .001 for each). CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing, when assessed by free and publicly available measures such as those shared by Unacast, has an impact on viral transmission rates. The scorecard may also be useful for public messaging about social distance, in hospital planning, and in the interpretation of epidemiological models.","output":"Social Distancing Metrics and Estimates of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Rates: Associations Between Mobile Telephone Data Tracking and R"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains a global public health crisis. Although widespread vaccination campaigns are underway, their efficacy is reduced against emerging variants of concern (VOCs) 1,2. Development of host-directed therapeutics and prophylactics could limit such resistance and offer urgently needed protection against VOCs 3,4. Attractive pharmacological targets to impede viral entry include type-II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), such as TMPRSS2, whose essential role in the virus lifecycle is responsible for the cleavage and priming of the viral spike protein 5C7. Here, we identify and characterize a small-molecule compound, N-0385, as the most potent inhibitor of TMPRSS2 reported to date. N-0385 exhibited low nanomolar potency and a selectivity index of >106 at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells and in donor-derived colonoids 8. Importantly, N-0385 acted as a broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor of two SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Strikingly, single daily intranasal administration of N-0385 early in infection significantly improved weight loss and clinical outcomes, and yielded 100% survival in the severe K18-human ACE2 transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 disease. This demonstrates that TTSP-mediated proteolytic maturation of spike is critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo and suggests that N-0385 provides a novel effective early treatment option against COVID-19 and emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.","output":"A novel highly potent inhibitor of TMPRSS2-like proteases blocks SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and is broadly protective against infection and mortality in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is necessary to conduct Clinical Trials in children, including for novel vaccines. Children cannot legally provide valid consent, but can assent to research participation. Informed consent and assent communications are frequently criticized for their lack of comprehensibility and often, researchers do not involve patients in informed consent design. We tested a blended research-design approach to co-design multimedia informed consent prototypes for experimental vaccine studies targeted at the pediatric population. We report details on the methodology utilized, and the insights, ideas, and prototype solutions we generated using social media data analysis, a survey, and workshops. A survey of clinical trial researchers indicated that while the most did not use technology for informed consent, they considered its utilization favorable. Social media analysis enabled researchers to quickly understand where community perspectives were concordant and discordant and build their understanding of the types of topics that they may want to focus on during the design workshops. Participatory design workshops for children and their families reaped insights, ideas, and prototypes for a range of tools including apps and websites. Participants felt that the prototypes were better able to communicate necessary content than the original text document format. We propose using a participatory, mixed-methods approach to design informed consent so that it is better adapted to patients' needs. Such an approach would be helpful in better addressing the needs of different segments of the populations involved in clinical trials.

One of many negative impacts may be on animal reproduction. Elevated ambient temperature unfavourably influences reproductive processes in mammals. High temperature can affect reproductive processes such as follicle development and may alter follicular fluid concentrations of amino acids, fatty acids, minerals, enzymes, antioxidants defence and growth factors. These impacts may lead to inferior oocyte competence and abnormal granulosa cell (GCs) function. Mammalian oocytes are enclosed by GCs that secret hormones and signalling molecules to promote oocyte competence. GCs are essential for proper follicular development, oocyte maturation, ovulation, and luteinization. Many environmental stressors, including thermal stress, affect GC function and alter oocyte development and growth. Several studies documented a link between elevated ambient temperature and increased generation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can damage DNA, reduce cell proliferation, and induce apoptosis in GCs, thus altering oocyte development. Additionally, thermal stress induces upregulation of thermal shock proteins, such as HSP70 and HSP90. This review provides an update on the influence of thermal stress on GCs of mammals. Discussions include impacts to steroidogenesis (estradiol and progesterone), proliferation and cell cycle transition, apoptosis, oxidative stress (ROS), antioxidants related genes, heat shock proteins (HSPs) and endoplasmic reticulum responses.","output":"Cellular and functional adaptation to thermal stress in ovarian granulosa cells in mammals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute thrombosis and thromboembolisms are one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in both developed and developing countries, placing a huge burden on health and economic systems.

Additionally, clinically used antithrombotics and thrombolytics suffer from severe side effects and are limited in efficacy by a short half-life and susceptibility to degradation. The use of systems containing both diagnostic and therapeutic moieties, known as theranostics, can potentially improve patient outcomes by increasing the precision and efficacy of diagnosis and treatment, enabling personalised and precision medicine.

Antipsychotics are used routinely for the management of ICU delirium despite limited reliable data supporting this approach. The unwarranted continuation of antipsychotics initiated for ICU delirium is an emerging transitions of care concern, especially considering the adverse event profile of these agents. We sought to evaluate the magnitude of this issue across 6 centers in New Jersey and describe risk factors for continuation. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study examined adult ICU patients who developed ICU delirium from June 2016 to June 2018. Patients were included in the study if they received at least 3 doses of antipsychotics while in the ICU with presence of either a clinical diagnosis of delirium or a positive Confusion Assessment Method score. Patients were excluded if they were on an antipsychotic before ICU admission. RESULTS: Of the 300 patients included and initiated on antipsychotics for ICU delirium, 157 (52.3%) were continued on therapy upon transfer from the ICU to another level of inpatient care. The number of patients continued on newly initiated antipsychotics further increased to 183 (61%) upon discharge from the hospital. CONCLUSION: The continuation of antipsychotics for the management of delirium during transitions of care was a common practice across ICUs in New Jersey. Several risk factors for continuation of antipsychotics were identified.

However, patient satisfaction is always a concern regarding the use of telemedicine. Introduction: The aim of this study is to evaluate the perception and satisfaction level of patients toward the use of telemedicine during the pandemic of COVID-19 among Pakistani population. Materials and Methods: The survey questionnaires were distributed to 251 patients who received telemedicine consultation in any of three specializations: orthopedic, ophthalmology, and general medicine. The questionnaire contains 15 questions that covered four categories of patient satisfaction: interpersonal communication, caring, care delivery, and proficiency. Descriptive and analytical statistics were obtained by analyzing data using SPSS software version 20. Results: A total of 251 patients responded to the telemedicine questionnaire. Overall, 61.35% patients reported that they did not need any support for using technology during consultation and 96.41% of the patient population reported that telemedicine saved their travel time. It was found that gender, education, and age were significantly associated with the ease in technology with the p-value 0.012, 0.004 and <0.001, respectively, whereas the use of telemedicine again in future is found to be significantly associated with only education and age p-value <0.001.

The Ultra-High Risk for psychosis (UHR) paradigm provides an opportunity to explore the stage at which such factors influence the development of psychosis. In this systematic review, we collate and appraise the literature on the association between ethnicity and migrant status and the rate of identification of individuals at UHR, as well as their rate of transition to psychosis. METHODS We conducted a systematic review in the Ovid Medline, PsychINFO, Pubmed, CINAHL and EMBASE databases according to PRISMA guidelines. We included studies written in English that included an UHR cohort, provided a measure of ethnicity or migrant status, and examined the incidence, rate, or risk of UHR identification or transition to psychosis. RESULTS Of 2182 unique articles identified, seven fulfilled the criteria. One study found overrepresentation of UHR individuals from black ethnic groups, while another found underrepresentation. Two studies found increased rates of transition among certain ethnic groups and a further two found no association. Regarding migrant status, one study found that first-generation migrants were underrepresented in an UHR sample. Lastly, a lower transition rate in migrant populations was identified in one study, while two found no association.

Findings will inform recommendations by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. METHODS: We searched five databases (to January 24, 2020), trial registries, conference proceedings, and reference lists for English and French literature published since 1996. Screening, study selection, and risk of bias assessments were independently undertaken by two reviewers, with consensus for final decisions. Data extraction was conducted by one reviewer and checked by another for accuracy and completeness. Meta-analysis was conducted where appropriate. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of the evidence. The Task Force and content experts provided input on determining thresholds for important effect sizes and on interpretation of findings. RESULTS: Of 41 included studies, 17 and 11 reported on benefits and harms of screening, respectively, and 14 reported on patient preferences. Universal screening for CT in general populations 16 to 29 years of age, using population-based or opportunistic approaches achieving low screening rates, may make little-to-no difference for a females risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (2 RCTs, n=141,362; 0.3 more in 1000 [7.6 fewer to 11 more]) or ectopic pregnancy (1 RCT, n=15,459; 0.20 more per 1000 [2.2 fewer to 3.9 more]). It may also not make a difference for CT transmission (3 RCTs, n=41,709; 3 fewer per 1000 [11.5 fewer to 6.9 more]). However, benefits may be achieved for reducing PID if screening rates are increased (2 trials, n=30,652; 5.7 fewer per 1000 [10.8 fewer to 1.1 more]), and for reducing CT and NG transmission when intensely screening high-prevalence female populations (2 trials, n=6127; 34.3 fewer per 1000 [4 to 58 fewer]; NNS 29 [17 to 250]). Evidence on infertility in females from CT screening and on transmission of NG in males and both sexes from screening for CT and NG is very uncertain. No evidence was found for cervicitis, chronic pelvic pain, or infertility in males from CT screening, or on any clinical outcomes from NG screening. Undergoing screening, or having a diagnosis of CT, may cause a small-to-moderate number of people to experience some degree of harm, mainly due to feelings of stigmatization and anxiety about future infertility risk. The number of individuals affected in the entire screening-eligible population is likely smaller. Screening may make little-to-no difference for general anxiety, self-esteem, or relationship break-up. Evidence on transmission from studies comparing home versus clinic screening is very uncertain. Four studies on patient preferences found that although utility values for the different consequences of CT and NG infections are probably quite similar, when considering the duration of the health state experiences, infertility and chronic pelvic pain are probably valued much more than PID, ectopic pregnancy, and cervicitis. How patients weigh the potential benefits versus harms of screening is very uncertain (1 survey, 10 qualitative studies); risks to reproductive health and transmission appear to be more important than the (often transient) psychosocial harms. DISCUSSION: Most of the evidence on screening for CT and/or NG offers low or very low certainty about the benefits and harms. Indirectness from use of comparison groups receiving some screening, incomplete outcome ascertainment, and use of outreach settings was a major contributor to uncertainty. Patient preferences indicate that the potential benefits from screening appear to outweigh the possible harms. Direct evidence about which screening strategies and intervals to use, which age to start and stop screening, and whether screening males in addition to females is necessary to prevent clinical outcomes is scarce, and further research in these areas would be informative. Apart from the evidence in this review, information on factors related to equity, acceptability, implementation, cost/resources, and feasibility will support recommendations made by the Task Force.

We sought to determine if N95s and snorkel masks with attached high-efficiency filters provide consistent protection levels in healthcare workers and if the addition of positive pressure via an inexpensive powered-air purifying respirator to the snorkel mask would provide enhanced protection. Fifty-one healthcare workers who were qualitatively fitted with N95 masks underwent quantitative mask fit testing according to a simulated workplace exercise protocol. N95, snorkel masks with high-efficiency filters and snorkel masks with powered-air purifying respirators were tested. Respiratory filtration ratios were collected for each step and averaged to obtain an overall workplace protocol fit factor. Failure was defined as either an individual filtration ratio or an overall fit factor below 100. N95s and snorkel masks with high-efficiency filters failed one or more testing steps in 59% and 20% of participants, respectively, and 24% and 12% failed overall fit factors, respectively.

Here, we show that interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) is a useful and effective tool for creating Mpro complexes. We make these tools and models freely available. iMD-VR provides an immersive environment in which users can interact with MD simulations and so build protein complexes in a physically rigorous and flexible way. Recently, we have demonstrated that iMD-VR is an effective method for interactive, flexible docking of small molecule drugs into their protein targets (Deeks et al. PLoS One2020, 15, e022846132160194). Here, we apply this approach to both an Mpro inhibitor and an oligopeptide substrate, using experimentally determined crystal structures. For the oligopeptide, we test against a crystallographic structure of the original SARS Mpro. Docking with iMD-VR gives models in agreement with experimentally observed (crystal) structures. The docked structures are also tested in MD simulations and found to be stable. Different protocols for iMD-VR docking are explored, e.g., with and without restraints on protein backbone, and we provide recommendations for its use. We find that it is important for the user to focus on forming binding interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, and not to rely on using simple metrics (such as RMSD), in order to create realistic, stable complexes. We also test the use of apo (uncomplexed) crystal structures for docking and find that they can give good results. This is because of the flexibility and dynamic response allowed by the physically rigorous, atomically detailed simulation approach of iMD-VR. We make our models (and interactive simulations) freely available. The software framework that we use, Narupa, is open source, and uses commodity VR hardware, so these tools are readily accessible to the wider research community working on Mpro (and other COVID-19 targets). These should be widely useful in drug development, in education applications, e.g., on viral enzyme structure and function, and in scientific communication more generally.","output":"Interactive Molecular Dynamics in Virtual Reality Is an Effective Tool for Flexible Substrate and Inhibitor Docking to the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In emerging epidemics, early estimates of key epidemiological characteristics of the disease are critical for guiding public policy. In particular, identifying high-risk population subgroups aids policymakers and health officials in combating the epidemic. This has been challenging during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic because governmental agencies typically release aggregate COVID-19 data as summary statistics of patient demographics. These data may identify disparities in COVID-19 outcomes between broad population subgroups, but do not provide comparisons between more granular population subgroups defined by combinations of multiple demographics. We introduce a method that helps to overcome the limitations of aggregated summary statistics and yields estimates of COVID-19 infection and case fatality rates  key quantities for guiding public policy related to the control and prevention of COVID-19  for population subgroups across combinations of demographic characteristics. Our approach uses pseudo-likelihood based logistic regression to combine aggregate COVID-19 case and fatality data with population-level demographic survey data to estimate infection and case fatality rates for population subgroups across combinations of demographic characteristics. We illustrate our method on California COVID-19 data to estimate test-based infection and case fatality rates for population subgroups defined by gender, age, and race/ethnicity. Our analysis indicates that in California, males have higher test-based infection rates and test-based case fatality rates across age and race/ethnicity groups, with the gender gap widening with increasing age. Although elderly infected with COVID-19 are at an elevated risk of mortality, the test-based infection rates do not increase monotonically with age. The workforce population, especially, has a higher test-based infection rate than children, adolescents, and other elderly people in their 60C80. LatinX and African Americans have higher test-based infection rates than other race/ethnicity groups.

In silico studies will be carried out, including protein-peptide docking and protein-protein docking, to identify, evaluate, and explore the affinity and molecular interactions of the Magainin-1 and Magainin-2 peptide molecules derived from frog skin (Xenopus laevis) to the main protease macromolecule (Mpro) SARS-CoV-2, and its effect on the ACE-2 receptor (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 Receptor). Protein-peptide docking simulations show that both peptide molecules have a good affinity for the active site area of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro macromolecule. These results were then confirmed using protein-protein docking simulations to observe the ability of the peptide molecule in preventing attachment to the ACE-2 receptor surface area. In silico studies show that Magainin-2 has the best affinity, with a bond free energy value of ?3054.53 kJ/mol. Then the protein-protein docking simulation provided Magainin-2 was able to prevent the attachment of ACE-2 receptors, with an ACE score of 1697.99 kJ/mol.

AIM To investigate cerebral autoregulation (CAR) and activity after propofol for endotracheal intubation in preterm neonates. METHODS Twenty-two neonates received propofol before intubation as part of a published dose-finding study. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), near-infrared spectroscopy-derived cerebral oxygenation (rScO2), and amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) were analyzed until 180 min after propofol. CAR was expressed as transfer function (TF) gain, indicating % change in rScO2 per 1 mmHg change in MABP. Values exceeding mean TF gain + 2 standard deviations (SD) defined impaired CAR. RESULTS After intubation with a median propofol dose of 1 (0.5-4.5) mg/kg, rScO2 remained stable during decreasing MABP. Mean (SD) TF gain was 0.8 (0.3)%/mmHg. Impaired CAR was identified in 1 and 5 patient(s) during drug-related hypotension and normal to raised MABP, respectively. Suppressed aEEG was observed up to 60 min after propofol. CONCLUSIONS Drug-related hypotension and decreased cerebral activity after intubation with low propofol doses in preterm neonates were observed, without evidence of cerebral ischemic hypoxia. CAR remained intact during drug-related hypotension in 95.5% of patients.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to parental perceived stress and child abuse potential.

METHOD: Tests of group differences and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were employed to assess the relationships among demographic characteristics, COVID-19 related stressors, mental health risk, protective factors, parental perceived stress, and child abuse potential. RESULTS: Greater COVID-19 related stressors and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher parental perceived stress and child abuse potential. Conversely, greater parental support and perceived control during the pandemic may have a protective effect against perceived stress and child abuse potential. Results also indicate racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 related stressors, but not in mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, or child abuse potential.

This was an unexpected finding, as thermogenic BAT was believed to be the only site of nonshivering thermogenesis in the young mouse. However, the transcriptional landscape of BAT in P6 mice suggests that it is still undergoing differentiation and maturation, and that the iWAT temporally adopts thermogenic and lipolytic potential. Moreover, P6 iWAT and adult (P56) BAT were similar in their expression of immune gene networks, but P6 iWAT was unique in the abundant expression of antimicrobial proteins and virus entry factors, including a possible receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In summary, postnatal iWAT development is associated with a metabolic shift from thermogenesis and lipolysis towards fat storage.

[Nature 581, 396 (2020)]. This and similar molecules are considered to search for the new physics effects. The radium nucleus is of interest as it is octupole-deformed and has close levels of opposite parity. The preparation of such experiments can be simplified if there are reliable theoretical predictions. It is shown that the accurate prediction of the hyperfine structure of the RaF molecule requires to take into account the finite magnetization distribution inside the radium nucleus. For atoms, this effect is known as the Bohr-Weisskopf (BW) effect. Its magnitude depends on the model of the nuclear magnetization distribution which is usually not well known. We show that it is possible to express the nuclear magnetization distribution contribution to the hyperfine structure constant in terms of one magnetization distribution dependent parameter: BW matrix element for 1s-state of the corresponding hydrogen-like ion.

Understanding how and by whom the virus is transmitted can help implement better disease control strategies. Here we have described the use of a noninvasive mask sampling method to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory particles expelled by COVID-19 patients and discussed its relationship to transmission risk. Respiratory particles of 31 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and 31 asymptomatic healthy volunteers were captured on N-95 masks layered with a gelatin membrane in a 30-minute process that involved talking/reading, coughing, and tidal breathing. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected and quantified using rRT-PCR in the mask and in concomitantly collected nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. The data were analyzed with respect to patient demographics and clinical presentation. Thirteen of 31(41.9%) patients showed SARS-COV-2 positivity in both the mask and NPS samples, while 16 patients were mask negative but NPS positive. Two patients were both mask and NPS negative. All healthy volunteers except one were mask and NPS negative. The mask positive patients had significantly lower NPS Ct value (26) compared to mask negative patients (30.5) and were more likely to be rapid antigen test positive. The mask positive patients could be further grouped into low emitters (expelling <100 viral copies) and high emitters (expelling >1000 viral copies). The study presents evidence for variation in emission of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles by COVID-19 patients reflecting differences in infectivity and transmission risk among individuals.

METHODS: A survey was emailed to all ESNR members and associates as well as distributed via professional social media channels. The survey was held in the summer of 2020 when the first wave had subsided in most of Europe, while the second wave was not yet widespread. The questionnaire featured a total of 46 questions on general demographics, the various phases of the healthcare crisis, and the numbers of Covid-19 patients. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-seven responses were received from 48 countries mostly from neuroradiologists (72%). Most commonly taken measures during the crisis phase were reduction of outpatient exams (87%), reduction of number of staff present in the department (83%), reporting from home (62%), and shift work (54%). In the exit phase, these measures were less frequently applied, but reporting from home was still frequent (33%). However, only 22% had access to a fully equipped work station at home. While 81% felt safe at work during the crisis, fewer than 50% had sufficient personal protection equipment for the duration of the entire crisis.

The source and evolutionary history of this virus is, however, unknown. PDCoV belongs to the Deltacoronavirus genus that comprises predominantly avian CoV. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that PDCoV originated relatively recently from a host-switching event between birds and mammals. Insight into receptor engagement by PDCoV may shed light into such an exceptional phenomenon. Here we report that PDCoV employs host aminopeptidase N (APN) as an entry receptor and interacts with APN via domain B of its spike (S) protein. Infection of porcine cells with PDCoV was drastically reduced by APN knockout and rescued after reconstitution of APN expression. In addition, we observed that PDCoV efficiently infects cells of unusual broad species range, including human and chicken. Accordingly, PDCoV S was found to target the phylogenetically conserved catalytic domain of APN. Moreover, transient expression of porcine, feline, human, and chicken APN renders cells susceptible to PDCoV infection. Binding of PDCoV to an interspecies conserved site on APN may facilitate direct transmission of PDCoV to nonreservoir species, including humans, potentially reflecting the mechanism that enabled a virus, ancestral to PDCoV, to breach the species barrier between birds and mammals. The APN cell surface protein is also used by several members of the Alphacoronavirus genus. Hence, our data constitute the second identification of CoVs from different genera that use the same receptor, implying that CoV receptor selection is subjected to specific restrictions that are still poorly understood.","output":"Broad receptor engagement of an emerging global coronavirus may potentiate its diverse cross-species transmissibility."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was described in China in late 2019.

In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV in its brief epidemic in 2003, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection. The sequence similarity of the spike receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably due to an ancient intergenomic introgression.

In contrast to neutrophils, the contribution of classical monocyte (CM) and non-classical monocyte (NCM) remains poorly defined. We tested the hypothesis that CMs contribute to antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) and that colony-stimulating factor-2 (CSF2, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)) is an important monocyte-directed disease modifier. METHODS: Myeloperoxidase (MPO)-immunised MPO-/- mice were transplanted with haematopoietic cells from wild-type (WT) mice, C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-/- mice to abrogate CM, or transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBP?)-/- mice to reduce NCM, respectively. Monocytes were stimulated with CSF2, and CSF2 receptor subunit beta (CSF2rb)-deficient mice were used. Urinary monocytes and CSF2 were quantified and kidney Csf2 expression was analysed. CSF2-blocking antibody was used in the nephrotoxic nephritis (NTN) model. RESULTS: Compared with WT mice, CCR2-/- chimeric mice showed reduced circulating CM and were protected from NCGN. C/EBP?-/- chimeric mice lacked NCM but developed NCGN similar to WT chimeric mice. Kidney and urinary CSF2 were upregulated in AAV mice. CSF2 increased the ability of ANCA-stimulated monocytes to generate interleukin-1? and to promote TH17 effector cell polarisation. CSF2rb-/- chimeric mice harboured reduced numbers of kidney TH17 cells and were protected from NCGN. CSF2 neutralisation reduced renal damage in the NTN model. Finally, patients with active AAV displayed increased urinary CM numbers, CSF2 levels and expression of GM-CSF in infiltrating renal cells. CONCLUSIONS: CMs but not NCMs are important for inducing kidney damage in AAV. CSF2 is a crucial pathological factor by modulating monocyte proinflammatory functions and thereby TH17 cell polarisation.","output":"CSF2-dependent monocyte education in the pathogenesis of ANCA-induced glomerulonephritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present research, we replicate and extend previous findings on the relations between human values and bright\\\\dark traits of personality, using the functional theory of human values (Gouveia, 2013).

The digital close-range photogrammetry is used to obtain monitoring data. The error compensation method is used to optimize the center of the monitoring point. Aiming at the limitations of back propagation neural network (BPNN), a genetic algorithm (GA)-optimized BPNN algorithm is proposed. Then, the optimized algorithm is applied to predict the deformation and displacement of foundation pits from three aspects, i.e., simple horizontal displacement, simple longitudinal displacement, and the combination of horizontal and longitudinal displacements. Meanwhile, the time domain, space domain, and time-space domain are used as input features to compare the prediction results of the BPNN model and the GA-optimized BPNN model. Finally, the GA-improved BPNN is compared with the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model and Random Forest (RF) model. The results show that the prediction result, obtained by simultaneously using horizontal displacement and longitudinal displacement as input features, has smaller errors; also, the actual output is closer to the expected output. Compared with the prediction result with time domain and space domain as input features, the prediction result with time-space domain as input features is closer to the expected output. Taking the combination of time and space domains as input features, compared with the BPNN model, the GA-optimized BPNN model has a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value (0.0163), a larger Index of Agreement (IA) value (0.9800), and a shorter training time (7.08 s). Compared with the SVR model and RF model, the GA-improved BPNN model has a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value (0.0211), a larger Index of Agreement (IA) value (0.9706), and shorter training time (7.61 s).

At this time, four vaccines against COVID-19 (Pfizer-BioNtechs Comirnaty ?, Modernas Spikevax ?, AstraZenecas Vaxzevria?, Johnson & Johnsons Janssen ?) have been approved for use by Health Canada. Due to the novelty of these vaccines, clinical studies in patients with PID are ongoing. Despite limited evidence, Canadas National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommend that patients with PID without any contraindications should be vaccinated with any of the approved vaccines as the potential benefits of being immunized against the virus likely outweigh the risks of contracting a severe infection. The aim of this study was to understand the perceptions regarding COVID-19 vaccination among patients with PID and to identify specific factors related to vaccine hesitancy. Methods The Canadian Immunodeficiencies Patient Organization (CIPO) conducted an online survey of its members to evaluate uptake of the COVID-19 vaccines by patients with PID. Data was collected using a self-administered online questionnaire. The survey was conducted between March and April 2021. Results At the time of survey, among 370 respondents who had not received the COVID-19 vaccine, 302 respondents (81.6%) indicated they were very or somewhat likely to get vaccinated against COVID-19;and 68 respondents (18.4%) indicated they were somewhat or very unlikely, undecided, or not planning to get vaccinated. A large majority of respondents indicated they had a diagnosis of PID (67.8%) and/or specified their type of PID (27.7%). The most common reason for vaccine hesitancy was primarily due to uncertainty about immune response given an underlying immunodeficiency. Other concerns included unknown long-term side effects of COVID-19 vaccination, pre-existing history of allergic reactions, limited amount of data, lack of investigation of safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in those with medical conditions, and skepticism of the underlying science and/or the medical system. Conclusions The results point to the importance of ongoing patient outreach, education, and up-to-date information on the rapidly evolving scientific knowledge and evidence on COVID-19 relevant to the PID community, from clinical trials to real-world evidence and observational studies.","output":"Understanding Attitudes and Obstacles To Vaccination Against COVID-19 in Patients With Primary Immunodeficiency (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): a new virus with high infectivity and moderate mortality. The major clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is interstitial pneumonia, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the disease causes a potent systemic hyperin-flammatory response, i.e., a cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), which is associated with thrombotic complications. The complexity of the disease requires appropriate intensive treatment. One of promising treatment is statin administration, these being 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors that exert pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects. Recent studies indicate that statin therapy is associated with decreased mortality in COVID-19, which may be caused by direct and indirect mechanisms. According to literature data, statins can limit SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and replication by inhibiting the main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The cytokine storm can be ameliorated by lowering serum IL-6 levels; this can be achieved by inhibiting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and modulating macrophage activity. Statins can also reduce the complications of COVID-19, such as thrombosis and pulmonary fibrosis, by reducing serum PAI-1 levels, attenuating TGF-? and VEGF in lung tissue, and improving endothelial function. Despite these benefits, statin therapy may have side effects that should be considered, such as elevated creatinine kinase (CK), liver enzyme and serum glucose levels, which are already elevated in severe COVID-19 infection. The present study analyzes the latest findings regarding the benefits and limitations of statin therapy in patients with COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19: Direct and Indirect Mechanisms of Statins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ľ F ޤ  29 Rڷڴx Update ǤϴL̩ Τ򤤤JES-WE CAN 󻭤Ȥ ƥߥͥѧо@åФޤ vݤǰˤϥꥢѥvơˤͬŤ 2 βμӤҽ Burn out v review 򤷤ޤ  JES-WE CAN ǤvݤΥޥ׹ҽ v٤Ƥޤ 1ꥫǤڷڿҽȤƤΥꥢѥ 2005     New York  Mount Sinai Beth Is-rael Medical Center ǳޤޤ 6 gLos Angeles  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center ƄӤ´ λAоR 5 gߥͥѧ ڷڴxƤ Assistant Professor Ȥ 3  뤬U^ޤ|ȥ ꥫζζ襤ʤ^ƤޤӢ Zͨʤץ쥼Ʃ\`󤬤ǤʤӢ ZZԒߤ󤿤Ϥʤɶय yޤMount Sinai Beth Israel ǤR ᡢMentor Ǥ Dr Shlomo Melmed ȤΤFǡLos Angeles  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Ƅӡ´ о 5 gָƤޤߥͥ  faculty ȤƄӡ˽ 2018 ˫Ӥb ޤFڤ Full time Endocrinology Faculty Ȥ RоȽͥڤǤˤΥ٥ө\`å\` ȥ\`Ʃ\`MƤ^LСաय ͬš塢ˤ֧ΤȤ¤ ͥIƤޤ 2´оv ´оǤϡ F餷ͬоߤː{ޤ졢 ˻AоMƤޤޤǤ Cushing's syndrome  POMC gene ˤzˤĤ Ԥо¤ˤޤȤޤ 2-1 E2F1 medicated POMC gene regulations in ecto-pic Cushing's syndrome POMC zоϹŤयΥ\` פǤʤƤޤۤܥå POMC zӤ ʹä޶졢ҥ POMC hPOMC zӤ ϴޤƤޤ 2016 ҡΥ\`פ hPOMC z {٤Y  ACTH b[Ǥ Tpit 1  Pitx1 2  NeuroD1 3 ʤɤΥå POMC ֪Ƥܞд ӤˤȤҊޤˡ ե\`ˤץ\`\`顢  hPOMC z    Proximal I      -42/ 68 Ӥ E2F1 Ǥ뤳Ȥ椷ޤ  4   1     E2F1  DNA binding mechanism  E2F1 饹\`״˼ϤơE2F1 νY Ϥ Ser 337 Υữѥữˤ Ȥ椷ޤҊϮ ACTH b [Υǥ饤ǤҥȤСΰμ  DMS79 ʹäΤǤޤ E2F1 躦ӄ HLM6474 äPOMC  mRNA  ACTH b ƤԤQ줵ޤᡢ¤ε ´Ǥ E2F1 Υå󥰲ˤؕפ Ƥޤ1E2F1protein kF corticotroph خĤҊ 5  2E2F1 躦ӄ HLM6474 ϥå󥰲[ˤ primary culture ˤ POM-CmRNA ΰkF ACTH ڤԤ ƤǤ ´AоηҰǤϥҥȤ´[ cell line _Ƥޤ󡣤ΤᡢȤ٤ Tpit ؕ פͤ hPOM zӤᥫ˥ϡ ACTH b[خĤǤΤ뤤ϥҥȤ åȤηN\`ˤҊǤΤϤޤ ǤϤʤ˼ޤ","output":"JES We Can "},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An increase in fat mass is considered to be an important risk factor for the worldwide increase in type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, for a given fat mass, there is a large variability in the risk prediction of these cardiometabolic diseases. For example, some lean people unexpectedly have a risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease that is similar to the increased risk that is observed in most people who have obesity. What both of these phenotypes have in common is a very characteristic fat distribution. As a result, much focus has been given on the strong predictive power of increased visceral fat mass. However, an analysis of the causes of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, as well as comparisons to rare diseases such as lipodystrophy and studying genetically determined fat distribution in the general population, suggest that an impaired ability to expand subcutaneous fat in the lower part of the body is also important for predicting the incidence of these cardiometabolic diseases. This Review, first, addresses the identification of distinct fat distribution phenotypes and their risk of cardiometabolic diseases by discussing findings from published studies that have applied precise quantification of different fat depots. Second, this Review provides support for the theory that a lower amount of lower-body fat mass is equally important to a high amount of visceral fat mass as a determinant of cardiometabolic diseases. Third, this Review discusses the genetic and lifestyle-related causes of metabolically healthy and unhealthy fat distribution. Finally, this Review summarises and appraises the effectiveness of lifestyle-related interventions and pharmacological interventions for reducing visceral adiposity and maintaining lower-body fat mass to prevent and treat cardiometabolic diseases.","output":"Causes, consequences, and treatment of metabolically unhealthy fat distribution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of early intervention of Tongxinluo (, TXL) on right ventricular function (RVF) of rats with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) induced by monocrotaline (MCT). METHODS: A total of 30 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 5 groups with complete random experiment design: Sham group (Sham), MCT group, TXL group, sildenafil (SIL) group and combination group (TXL+SIL), 6 rats in each group. Rats were injected with 50 mg/kg MCT solution for inducing PAH model except for those in the sham group. From the day of modeling, rats of TXL, SIL and TXL+SIL groups were given TXL (1.2 g/kg), SIL (10 mg/kg) and combination solution (TXL:1.2 g/kg, SIL: 10 mg/kg) respectively, and rats in Sham and MCT groups were given normal saline (5 mL/kg). The samples were collected and tested after 21 consecutive days of intragastric administration. Echocardiography was used to measure the related indices of RVF, including pulmonary arterial flow spectrum, pulmonary artery diameter (PAD), right ventricular wall thickness (RVWT), right ventricular diameter (RVD), tricuspidannular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), right atrium transverse diameter (RAT), and inferior vena cava diameter (IVCD). Elastic Verhoeff-Van Gieson staining was adopted to measure the percentage of wall thickness (WT%) of pulmonary arteriols. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) of right ventricular cardiomyocytes. RESULTS: MCT-induced PAH rat model was successfully established. In MCT group the wall of pulmonary arterioles exhibited a prominent-increase thickness, PAD, RVWT, RVD, RAT, IVCD, WT%, right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVHI) as well as CSA of RV cardiomyocyte significantly increased (all P<0.01), and TAPSE markedly decreased (P<0.01). At the same time, TXL prominently improved all of the above indices (all P<0.01). In comparison with SIL, TXL significantly reduced RVD (P<0.05) and decreased CAS of RV cardiomyocytes (P<0.01), but TAPSE in SIL group was much larger than in TXL group (P<0.01). Moreover, TAPSE in TXL+SIL group was larger than that in TXL group (P<0.01), while the two groups performed equally well in terms of the other indices. CONCLUSION: Early intervention of TXL could inhibit pulmonary arterioles remodeling, and improve RVF by attenuating right ventricular hypertrophy, and TXL has a stronger effect on inhibiting right ventricular remodeling than SIL.","output":"Early Intervention of Tongxinluo () on Right Ventricular Function Assessed by Echocardiography in Rats with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Induced by Monocrotaline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Coronary subclavian steal syndrome (CSSS) is an uncommon complication observed in patients after coronary artery bypass surgery with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) grafts. It is defined as coronary ischaemia due to reversal flow from the LIMA to the left subclavian artery (SA) when a proximal left SA stenosis is present. In practice, the entire clinical spectrum of ischaemic heart disease, ranging from asymptomatic patients to acute myocardial infarction, may be encountered. Case summary Three cases of CSSS recently detected at our hospital are being described. Two patients presented with an acute coronary syndrome, so diagnosis was suspected based on coronary angiography findings, as retrograde blood flow from LIMA to the distal SA was present. Myocardial ischaemia was documented by myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in one case. The third patient was asymptomatic and CSSS was suspected during physical examination and confirmed by computed tomography (CT). Endovascular intervention with balloon-expandable stent implantation of the stenotic SA was performed by vascular surgeons in all patients. No periprocedural complications occurred, and complete resolution of symptoms was achieved. Discussion In CSSS, subclavian angiography is the standard diagnostic test. However, other diagnostic techniques may be valuable to better clarify this challenging diagnosis. In the herein small series, the usefulness of a multimodality imaging approach including Doppler ultrasound, myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, and CT is well demonstrated. Furthermore, this study endorses the safety and utility of endovascular treatment in different clinical scenarios, including asymptomatic patients.","output":"Endovascular treatment of coronary subclavian steal syndrome: a case series highlighting the diagnostic usefulness of a multimodality imaging approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Excessive alcohol (ethanol) consumption, such as binge-drinking, is extremely commonplace and represents a major health concern. Through modeling excessive drinking in rodents, we are beginning to uncover the neurobiological and neurobehavioral causes and consequences of this pattern of ethanol intake. One important factor for modeling binge drinking in mice is that subjects reliably drink to blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) of 80 mg/dl or higher. Drinking-in-the-dark (DID) is a commonly used mouse model of binge drinking, and we have shown these methods reliably result in robust ethanol front-loading and binge-level BECs in C57BL/6J (B6) mice as well as other ethanol-preferring mouse strains/lines. However, establishing the DID model in a new vivarium space forced us to consider the use of rodent diet formulations we had not previously used. The current set of experiments were designed to investigate the role of two standard rodent diet formulations on binge drinking and the development of ethanol front-loading using DID. We found that BECs in animals maintained on LabDiet 5001 (LD01) were double those found in mice maintained on Teklad 2920x (TL20). Interestingly, this effect was paralleled by differences in the degree of front-loading, such that LD01-fed mice consumed approximately twice as much ethanol in the first 15 minutes of the 2-hour DID sessions compared to TL20-fed mice. Surprisingly however, mice that developed front-loading during maintenance on the LD01 diet continued to display front-loading behavior after being switched to the TL20 diet. These data emphasize the importance of choosing and reporting diet formulations when conducting voluntary drinking studies and support the need for further investigation into the mechanisms behind diet-induced differences in binge drinking, particularly front-loading.","output":"The Development, but not Expression, of Alcohol Front-loading in C57BL/6J Mice Maintained on LabDiet 5001 is Abolished by Maintenance on Teklad 2920x Rodent Diet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, various cutaneous manifestations have been described as associated with SARS\\\\CoV2 infection.

However, it is crucial to assess the impact of atmospheric conditions on air quality and air pollutant dispersion in the face of the potential variability of all sources. In this study, the impact of mobility restrictions on the air quality was analyzed for the most populous Brazilian State, S?o Paulo, severely impacted by COVID-19. Ground-based air quality data (PM(10), PM(2.5), CO, SO(2), NO(x), NO(2), NO, and O(3)) were used from 50 automatic air quality monitoring stations to evaluate the changes in concentrations before (January 01 - March 25) and during the partial quarantine (March 16 - June 30). Rainfall, fires, and daily cell phone mobility data were also used as supplementary information to the analyses. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the heterogeneity of the air quality data during and before mobility restrictions. In general, the results demonstrated no substantial improvements in air quality for most of the pollutants when comparing before and during restrictions periods. Besides, when the analyzed period of 2020 is compared with the year 2019, there is no significant air quality improvement in the S?o Paulo State. However, special attention should be given to the Metropolitan Area of S?o Paulo (MASP), due to the vast population residing in this area and exposed to air pollution. The region reached an average decrease of 29% in CO, 28% in NO(x), 40% in NO, 19% in SO(2), 15% in PM(2.5), and 8% in PM(10) concentrations during the mobility restrictions period compared to the same period in 2019. The only pollutant that showed an increase in concentration was ozone, with a 20% increase compared to 2019 during the mobility restrictions period. Before the mobility restrictions period, the region reached an average decrease of 30% in CO, 39% in NO(x), 63% in NO, 12% in SO(2), 23% in PM(2.5), 18% in PM(10), and 16% in O(3) concentrations when compared to the same period in 2019. On the other hand, Cubat?o, a highly industrialized area, showed statistically significant increases above 20% for most monitored pollutants in both periods of 2020 compared to 2019. This study reinforces that the main driving force of pollutant concentration variability is the dynamics of the atmosphere at its various time scales. An abnormal rainy season, with above average rainfall before the restrictions and below average after it, generated a scenario in which the probable significant reductions in emissions did not substantially affect the concentration of pollutants.","output":"How mobility restrictions policy and atmospheric conditions impacted air quality in the State of S?o Paulo during the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An array of carbon nanotube (CNT)-based sensors was produced for sensing selective biomarkers and evaluating breathomics applications with the aid of clustering and classification algorithms.

The sensor array was exposed to ammonia (NH(3)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), hydrogen sulphide (H(2)S), and benzene (C(6)H(6)). Among them, ammonia (NH(3)) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) are known biomarkers of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Calibration curves for individual sensors in the array were obtained following exposure to the four target molecules. A remarkable response to ammonia (NH(3)) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), according to benchmarking with available data in the literature, was observed. Sensor array responses were analyzed through principal component analysis (PCA), thus assessing the array selectivity and its capability to discriminate the four different target volatile molecules. The sensor array was then exposed to exhaled breath samples from patients affected by COPD and healthy control volunteers. A combination of PCA, supported vector machine (SVM), and linear discrimination analysis (LDA) shows that the sensor array can be trained to accurately discriminate healthy from COPD subjects, in spite of the limited dataset.","output":"Exploring the performance of a functionalized CNT-based sensor array for breathomics through clustering and classification algorithms: from gas sensing of selective biomarkers to discrimination of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Knowing the true infected and symptomatic case fatality ratios (IFR and CFR) for COVID-19 is of high importance for epidemiological model projections. Early in the pandemic many locations had limited testing and reporting, so that standard methods for determining IFR and CFR required large adjustments for missed cases. We present an alternate approach, based on results from the countries at the time that had a high test to positive case ratio to estimate symptomatic CFR. METHODS: We calculated age specific (0C69, 70C79, 80+ years old) time corrected crude symptomatic CFR values from 7 countries using two independent time to fatality correction methods. Data was obtained through May 7, 2020. We applied linear regression to determine whether the mean of these coefficients had converged to the true symptomatic CFR values. We then tested these coefficients against values derived in later studies as well as a large random serological study in NYC at that time. RESULTS: The age dependent symptomatic CFR values accurately predicted the percentage of the population infected as reported by two random testing studies in NYC. They also were in good agreement with later studies that estimated age specific IFR and CFR values from serological studies and more extensive data sets available later in the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We found that for regions with extensive testing it is possible to get early accurate symptomatic CFR coefficients. These values, in combination with an estimate of the age dependence of infection, allows symptomatic CFR values and percentage of the population that is infected to be determined in similar regions with limited testing.","output":"Analysis of the time course of COVID-19 cases and deaths from countries with extensive testing allows accurate early estimates of the age specific symptomatic CFR values"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blockchain is arguably the next technology-mediated socioeconomic mega trend after the ongoing era of Net Neutrality and Big Data.

In this hermeneutic phenomenological study, we explore how the community is adaptingand even reconceptualisingtheir personal and professional roles amidst the COVID\\\\19 crisis. METHOD: Between April and October 2020, we conducted 27 (17F, 10M) semi\\\\structured interviews with medical trainees (8), physicians (8), graduate students (3) and PhD scientists (8) working in medical education in Canada, the United States and Switzerland. Data analysis involved a variety of strategies, including coding for van Manen's four lifeworld existentials, reflexive writing and multiple team meetings.

To curb the spread of the disease in mid-March, different states issued mandatory stay-at-home (SAH) orders. These nonpharmaceutical interventions were mandated based on prior experiences, such as the 1918 influenza epidemic. Hence, we decided to study the impact of restrictions on mobility on reducing COVID-19 transmission. Methods: We designed an ecological time series study with our exposure variable as Mobility patterns in the state of Maryland for March- December 2020 and our outcome variable as the COVID-19 hospitalizations for the same period. We built an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ensemble machine learning model and regressed the lagged COVID-19 hospitalizations with Mobility volume for different regions of Maryland. Results: We found an 18% increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations when mobility was increased by a factor of five, similarly a 43% increase when mobility was further increased by a factor of ten. Conclusion: The findings of our study demonstrated a positive linear relationship between mobility and the incidence of COVID-19 cases. These findings are partially consistent with other studies suggesting the benefits of mobility restrictions. Although more detailed approach is needed to precisely understand the benefits and limitations of mobility restrictions as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Influence of Mobility Restrictions on Transmission of COVID-19 in the state of Maryland -- the USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We tested whether the political climate in each U.S. state and Washington, DC determined the nature of the spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths in those polities during 2020. Political climate for each polity was indexed as a weighted average of the proportion of Republicans in legislatures in 2018 and the degree of public trust in both the White House and President Trump to handle COVID-19 in April, 2020. We found that polities higher on the political climate index had faster increases in per capita COVID-19 cases and deaths. Such Republican-trusting polities also had lower access to health care and less public engagement in prevention behavior, both of which mediated the influence of political climate on COVID-19 cases and deaths. Further, the relationship between incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths was weaker in more Republican-trusting polities. Political climate can be seen as contributing to more cases and deaths due to lower access to health care and to lower public adherence to public health guidelines in polities led by Republicans and which trusted the Trump White House to handle the pandemic.","output":"United States' political climates and the spread of SARS-2-COVID-19 during 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, first identified in Wuhan (China) in December 2019, represents the same family as the Serve Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1). These viruses spread mainly via the droplet route. However, during the pandemic of COVID-19 other reservoirs, i.e., water (surface and ground), sewage, garbage, or soil, should be considered. As the infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles are also present in human excretions, such a non-droplet transmission is also possible. A significant problem is the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital environment, including patients' rooms, medical equipment, everyday objects and the air. Relevant is selecting the type of equipment in the COVID-19 hospital wards on which the virus particles persist the shortest or do not remain infectious. Elimination of plastic objects/equipment from the environment of the infected person seems to be of great importance. It is particularly relevant in water reservoirs contaminated with raw discharges. Wastewater may contain coronaviruses and therefore there is a need for expanding Water-Based Epidemiology (WBE) studies to use obtained values as tool in determination of the actual percentage of the SARS-CoV-2 infected population in an area. It is of great importance to evaluate the available disinfection methods to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. Exposure of SARS-CoV-2 to 65-70% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite has effectively eliminated the virus from the surfaces. Since there are many unanswered questions about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the research on this topic is still ongoing.

In this study, we aimed to compare the clinical course of COVID-19 in adult SCD patients under the organ injury mitigation and clinical care improvement program (BASCARE) with healthcare professionals without significant comorbid conditions. The study was planned as a retrospective, multicenter and cross-sectional study. Thirty-nine SCD patients, ages 18 to 64 years, and 121 healthcare professionals, ages 21 to 53, were included in the study. The data were collected from the Electronic Health Recording System of PRANA, where SCD patients under the BASCARE program had been registered. The data of other patients were collected from the Electronic Hospital Data Recording System and patient files. In the SCD group, the crude incidence of COVID-19 was 9%, while in healthcare professionals at the same period was 23%. Among the symptoms, besides fever, loss of smell and taste were more prominent in the SCD group than in healthcare professionals. There was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of development of pneumonia, hospitalization, and need for intubation (43 vs 5%, P < 0.00001; 26 vs 7%, P = 0.002; and 10 vs 1%, P = 0.002, respectively). Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin and salicylate were used more in the SCD group than in healthcare professionals group (41 vs 9% and 28 vs 1%; P < 0.0001 for both). The 3-month mortality rate was demonstrated as 5% in the SCD group, while 0 in the healthcare professionals group. One patient in the SCD group became continously dependent on respiratory support. The cause of death was acute chest syndrome in the first case, hepatic necrosis and multi-organ failure in the second case. In conclusion, these observations supported the expectation that the course of COVID-19 in SCD patients will get worse.

In deep learning, we have multiple approaches for building a classification system for analyzing radiographic images. In this work, we used the transfer learning technique. This approach makes it possible to store and use the knowledge acquired from a pretrained convolutional neural network to solve a new problem. To ensure the robustness of the proposed system for diagnosing patients with COVID-19 using X-ray images, we used a machine learning method called the stacking approach to combine the performances of the many transfer learning-based models. The generated model was trained on a dataset containing four classes, namely, COVID-19, tuberculosis, viral pneumonia, and normal cases. The dataset used was collected from a six-source dataset of X-ray images. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we used different common evaluation measures.

RESULTS: A 59-year-old woman with a background of transfusion-dependent aplastic anemia presented with seizures and reduced level of consciousness 10 days after the onset of subjective fever, cough, and headache. Nasopharyngeal swab testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was positive, and CT during admission demonstrated diffuse swelling of the brain stem.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) have faced particular challenges: being exposed to the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and caring for patients having a new and potentially life-threatening disease. The aim of this study was to explore how HCWs in the Swedish healthcare system perceived their work situation during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. METHODS: Focus group discussions and interviews with HCWs were performed from June to October 2020 in one Swedish healthcare region. A purposeful sampling approach was used to select a variety of professions (physicians, nurses, nurse aides and cleaners) and workplaces (hospital inpatient wards, emergency department, nursing home and home care service). Qualitative content analysis was used for data analysis. RESULTS: In total, 51 HCWs participated in eight focus group discussions and one HCW participated in an individual interview. The content analysis identified two main categories: Concerns about the risk of infection and transmission of infection to others, and Transition from chaos to managing in a new and challenging work situation. The findings revealed how HCWs perceived working conditions, including experiences of fear for personal health, confusion and uncertainty regarding personal protective equipment and infection prevention and control (PPE/IPC), and fear of infecting others. Both fearful and appreciating attitudes were achieved from the surrounding community. Helpful strategies for transition from chaos to control were lifted i.e. present and supportive leadership, and finding comfort and strength in the working team. Both helplessness and meaningfulness were described when caring for COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides unique insights into HCWs experiences of an extremely challenging work situation during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, including feelings of stress and insecurity in a chaotic and hazardous working environment. But there is also mitigation of these challenges and even positive experiences including feelings of safety and meaningfulness.

OBJECTIVE: We explored (1) changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviors since the onset of COVID-19, along with changes in mental health status, and (2) alternative strategies to support survivors' physical activity and social health during and after COVID-19, along with the role of digital health in such strategies. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed among survivors participating (currently or previously) in the community-based physical activity program LIVESTRONG at the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), from 3 sites outside an urban area in Massachusetts. Questions addressed pre-COVID-19 vs current changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2) and 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), and scores &#8805;3 indicated a clinical diagnosis of anxiety or depression, respectively. Digital health preferences were assessed through closed-ended questions. Open-ended responses addressing other preferences for physical activity programs and social support were analyzed, coded, and categorized into themes. RESULTS: Among 61 participants (mean age 62 [SD 10.4] years; females: 51/61 [83.6%]), 67.2% (n=41) reported decreased physical activity and 67.2% (n=41) reported prolonged sitting times since the onset of COVID-19. Further, 24.6% (n=15) and 26.2% (n=16) met the GAD-2 and PHQ-2 criteria for clinical anxiety and depression, respectively. All participants owned a cellphone; 90% (n=54) owned a smartphone. Preferences for physical activity programs (n=28) included three themes: (1) use of digital or remote platforms (Zoom, other online platforms, and video platforms), (2) specific activities and locations (eg, outdoor activities, walking, gardening, biking, and physical activities at the YMCA and at senior centers), and (3) importance of social support regardless of activity type (eg, time spent with family, friends, peers, or coaches). The survey revealed a mean score of 71.8 (SD 21.4; scale 0-100) for the importance of social support during physical activity programs.

However, poor evidence was shown on ACS in a non-hot-spot region. We sought to clarify the influence of the first-wave COVID-19 pandemic on emergency ACS from a non-epicenter region. Methods: : This retrospective multicenter study was conducted in emergency ACS patients during the pandemic (from 2020-01-23 to 2020-03-29) and the ones during the same period in 2019. Clinical characteristics, timeline parameters and treatment strategies were compared between different groups. Association of the pandemic with non-invasive therapy was further assessed. Results: : Compared with 2019, ACS had a drop in admission (267 cases vs. 475 cases) and invasive therapy (140 cases vs. 318 cases). Also, process delays were detected including the period from symptom onset to first medical contact (S-to-FMC, 5h vs. 2.5h), the period from FMC to electrocardiogram (ECG) completed (8min vs. 4min) and the period from FMC to dual antiplatelet therapy (FMC-to-DAPT, 25min vs. 19min). Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) decreased by 54.9% in STEMI and early invasive therapy decreased by 59.2% in NSTE-ACS. The proportion of invasive therapy in NSTE-ACS decreased more than in STEMI (16.9% vs. 10.1%) with longer process delay. The pandemic was associated with increased non-PPCI in STEMI (OR=1.707, 95%CI 1.082-2.692, P=0.021) and elevated medication in NSTE-ACS (OR=2.029, 95%CI 1.268-3.247, P=0.003), respectively. Conclusion: Even in a non-epicenter region, the first-wave COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant reduction of invasive therapy and evident process delays in emergency ACS.","output":"Influence of the First-wave COVID-19 Pandemic on Emergency Acute Coronary Syndrome: a Multicenter Retrospective Study From a Non-epicenter Region (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on population mental health are unknown.

Saccharochelins feature a series of fatty acyl groups appended to the same tetrapeptide skeleton. With the help of gene disruption and heterologous expression, we identified the saccharochelin biosynthetic pathway. The diversity of saccharochelins originates from the flexible specificity of the starter condensation (CS) domain at the beginning of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) toward various fatty acyl substrates. Saccharochelins showed cytotoxicity against several human tumor cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 2.3 to 17 M. Additionally, the fatty acid side chains of the saccharochelins remarkably affected the cytotoxicity, suggesting changing the N-terminal acyl groups of lipopeptides may be a promising approach to produce more potent derivatives.","output":"Saccharochelins A-H, Cytotoxic Amphiphilic Siderophores from the Rare Marine Actinomycete Saccharothrix sp.

The spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) highlights the need for novel treatment options. Sodium new houttuyfonate (SNH) is an analogue of houttuynin, the main antibacterial ingredient of Houttuynia cordata Thunb. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro activity of SNH and its potential for synergy with antibiotics against hospital-associated MRSA. METHODOLOGY: A total of 103 MRSA clinical isolates recovered in two hospitals in Beijing were evaluated for susceptibility to SNH, oxacillin, cephalothin, meropenem, vancomycin, levofloxacin, minocycline, netilmicin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole by broth microdilution. Ten isolates were evaluated for potential for synergy between SNH and the antibiotics above by checkerboard assay. Time-kill analysis was performed in three isolates to characterize the kill kinetics of SNH alone and in combination with the antibiotics that engendered synergy in checkerboard assays. Besides, two reference strains were included in all assays. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: SNH inhibited all test strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 16 to 64 g/mL in susceptibility tests, and displayed inhibition to bacterial growth in concentration-dependent manner in time-kill analysis. In synergy studies, the combinations of SNH-oxacillin, SNH-cephalothin, SNH-meropenem and SNH-netilmicin showed synergistic effects against 12 MRSA strains with median fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices of 0.38, 0.38, 0.25 and 0.38 in checkerboard assays. In time-kill analysis, SNH at 1/2 MIC in combination with oxacillin at 1/128 to 1/64 MIC or netilmicin at 1/8 to 1/2 MIC decreased the viable colonies by 2log(10) CFU/mL. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SNH demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activity against 103 hospital-associated MRSA isolates. Combinations of sub-MIC levels of SNH and oxacillin or netilmicin significantly improved the in vitro antibacterial activity against MRSA compared with either drug alone. The SNH-based combinations showed promise in combating MRSA.","output":"In Vitro Activity of Sodium New Houttuyfonate Alone and in Combination with Oxacillin or Netilmicin against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study describes the baseline characteristics and treatment patterns of US patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pulmonary involvement.

Considering the Brazilian peculiarities, we analyze the in-hospital mortality concerning socio-epidemiological characteristics of patients and the health system of all states during the first and second waves of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of hospitalized patients with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil. Data was obtained from the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System (SIVEP-Gripe) and comprised the period from February 25, 2020, to April 30, 2021, separated in two waves on November 5, 2020. We performed a descriptive study of patients analyzing socio-demographic characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, and risk factors stratified by age. In addition, we analyzed in-hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in both waves and how it varies in each Brazilian state. FINDINGS: Between February 25, 2020 and April 30, 2021, 678 235 patients were admitted with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, with 325 903 and 352 332 patients for the first and second wave, respectively. The mean age of patients was 59 [Formula: see text] 65 (IQR 48 [Formula: see text] 0 - 72 [Formula: see text] 0). In total, 379 817 (56 [Formula: see text] 00%) patients had a risk factor or comorbidity. In-hospital mortality increased from 34 [Formula: see text] 81% in the first to 39 [Formula: see text] 30% in the second wave. In the second wave, there were more ICU admissions, use of non-invasive and invasive ventilation, and increased mortality for younger age groups. The southern and southeastern regions of Brazil had the highest hospitalization rates per 100 000 inhabitants. However, the in-hospital mortality rate was higher in the northern and northeastern states of the country. Racial differences were observed in clinical outcomes, with White being the most prevalent hospitalized population, but with Blacks/Browns (Pardos) having higher mortality rates. Younger age groups had more considerable differences in mortality as compared to groups with and without comorbidities in both waves. INTERPRETATION: We observed a more considerable burden on the Brazilian hospital system throughout the second wave. Furthermore, the north and northeast of Brazil, which present lower Human Development Indexes, concentrated the worst in-hospital mortality rates. The highest mortality rates are also shown among vulnerable social groups. Finally, we believe that the results can help to understand the behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, helping to define public policies, allocate resources, and improve strategies for vaccination of priority groups.

Upon excitation at 300 nm, the obtained GQD@Tb/GMP ICP nanoparticles exhibited enhanced green fluorescence from Tb/GMP. With the addition of Cu2+, the competitive coordination between Cu2+ and GQDs weakened the antenna effect, leading to a decrease in the fluorescence of GQD@Tb/GMP ICPs. However, in the presence of thiocholine (TCh), a thiol-containing compound hydrolyzed from acetylthiocholine (ATCh) by AChE, a stronger coordination interaction between Cu2+ and TCh occurred, resulting in the restoration of the fluorescence of GQD@Tb/GMP ICPs.

Divergent national responses to COVID-19 reflect different national preferences and political legitimacy, and thus cannot be completely avoided. In this article, we argue that these responses should be better coordinated. Without coordination, the price for diversity is high. Firstly, there are damaging spill-overs between Member States, which undermine key pillars of European integration such as the free movement of persons and of goods. Secondly, national policy-making is easily captured by local interest groups. Our proposal is that the EU indicates - not mandates - a European exit strategy from asymmetric containment policies of COVID-19. In particular, the EU should help Member States procure and validate tests for infection and immunity. The EU should also indicate ways in which testing could be used to create safe spaces to work, thereby restoring the free movement of persons and of goods. We see a great advantage in such EU guidance_ it could improve mutual learning between Member States, which have faced different timings of the epidemic and learned different lessons.

Intriguingly, both RNS and ROS are commonly triggered by the pathogenic viruses and are famous for their dual roles in the clearance of viruses and pathological implications. Uncontrolled production of reactive species results in oxidative stress and causes damage in proteins, lipids, DNA, and cellular structures. In this review, we describe the production of RS, their detoxification by a cellular antioxidant system, and how these RS damage the proteins, lipids, and DNA. Given the widespread importance of RS in avian viral diseases, oxidative stress pathways are of utmost importance for targeted therapeutics. Therefore, a special focus is provided on avian virus-mediated oxidative stresses. Finally, future research perspectives are discussed on the exploitation of these pathways to treat viral diseases of poultry.","output":"Oxidative Stress in Poultry: Lessons from the Viral Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Astrovirus-like, coronavirus-like, and parvovirus-like particles were detected through electron microscopic (EM) examination of loose and diarrheal stools from a litter of beagle pups.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a new type of RNAs, are implicated in viral pathogenesis and host immune responses. However, their dynamic expression patterns and functions during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be unclear. We herein performed genome-wide dynamic analysis of circRNAs in human lung epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at four time points. A total of 6118 circRNAs were identified at different genomic locations, including 5641 known and 477 novel circRNAs. Notably, a total of 42 circRNAs were significantly dysregulated, wherein 17 were up-regulated and 25 were down-regulated following infection at multiple phases. The gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that the parental genes of circRNAs were mainly involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Further, the RNA binding protein (RBP) prediction analysis indicated that the dysregulated circRNAs could regulate mRNA stability, immunity, cell death by binding specific proteins. Additionally, the circRNA-miRNA-gene network analysis showed that circRNAs indirectly regulated gene expression by absorbing their targeted miRNAs.

The clinical manifestations of the infection differ and depend mainly on the age and comorbidities. Cardiovascular involvement is associated with poor clinical course of the disease. The incidence of COVID-19 is higher in patients with cardiovascular diseases and risk factors. A significant challenge for the health care system during the ongoing pandemic is not only the treatment of COVID-19 patients and limitation of the spread of the infection, but also provision of proper care to all other patients. The latter is difficult due to the necessity of redistributing resources, limiting access to medical care and patients' fear of becoming infected, as a result of which they delay seeking medical help and avoid contacting medical services despite intensifying symptoms. Those factors determine a different profile of patients admitted to the hospital in acute cardiac conditions and also the modification of standard procedures, especially in relation to acute coronary syndrome, heart failure and pulmonary embolism. The crucial issue is to provide the optimal treatment and at the same time effectively protect the personnel and other patients against infection of SARS-CoV-2.

During the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea in 2015, some dialysis patients in three centers who were incidentally exposed to patients or medical staff with confirmed MERS-CoV infection were isolated to interrupt the spread of the infection. We aimed to investigate post-traumatic stress symptoms and risk factors among these patients. Materials and methods: In total, 116 hemodialysis (HD) patients in contact with MERS-CoV-confirmed subjects were isolated using three strategies, namely, single room isolation, cohort isolation, and self-quarantine. We used the Impact of Event Scale-Revised-Korean (IES-R-K) to examine post-traumatic stress symptoms at 12 months after the isolation period. Results: Of the 116 HD patients, 27 were lost to follow-up. Of the 89 patients, 67 (75.3%) completed the questionnaires. Single room isolation was used on 40 (58.8%) of the patients, cohort isolation on 20 (29.4%), and self-imposed quarantine on 8 (11.8%). In total, 17.9% of participants (n = 12) reported post-traumatic stress symptoms exceeding the IES-R-K's cutoff point (a18).

AIM: The aim of this study was to understand better, perceptions of risk and responses to covid-19 of members of the Muslim community living in the North West of England, and to understand the facilitators and barriers to adherence to restrictions and guidance measures. METHOD: A total of 47 participants took part in 25 in-depth qualitative interviews and four focus groups (n=22) that explored perceptions of risk and responses to risk from covid-19. Data were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: Participants were aware of the mechanism of transmission of covid-19 and took steps to mitigate risk of transmission including, observing a range of hygiene practices and following social distancing guidance. Increased risk of covid-19 for BAME populations was explained largely in terms of exposure to the virus due to the types of employment people from BAME populations are employed in. Limitations both within the working environment and more generally in public spaces, was identified as problematic for effective social distancing. The closure of mosques sent out a strong message about the seriousness of the virus and religious teachings reinforced hygiene and social distancing guidelines. CONCLUSION: Across society there are people that adhere to restrictions and guidelines and those that do not.

Relatively high mortality, a still-growing number of newly diagnosed cases, and insufficiently effective methods of therapy necessitate melanoma research. Tetracyclines are compounds with pleiotropic pharmacological properties. Previously published studies on melanotic melanoma cells ascertained that minocycline and doxycycline exerted an anti-melanoma effect. The purpose of the study was to assess the anti-melanoma potential and mechanisms of action of minocycline and doxycycline using A375 and C32 human amelanotic melanoma cell lines. The obtained results indicate that the tested drugs inhibited proliferation, decreased cell viability, and induced apoptosis in amelanotic melanoma cells. The treatment caused changes in the cell cycle profile and decreased the intracellular level of reduced thiols and mitochondrial membrane potential. The exposure of A375 and C32 cells to minocycline and doxycycline triggered the release of cytochrome c and activated initiator and effector caspases. The anti-melanoma effect of analyzed drugs appeared to be related to the up-regulation of ERK1/2 and MITF. Moreover, it was noticed that minocycline and doxycycline increased the level of LC3A/B, an autophagy marker, in A375 cells. In summary, the study showed the pleiotropic anti-cancer action of minocycline and doxycycline against amelanotic melanoma cells.

Here, we analyze the impact of previous and continued in-hospital treatment with RASi in all-cause mortality and the development of in-stay complications. RESULTS: We included 6503 patients, over 18 years, from Spain and Italy with data on their RASi status. Of those, 36.8% were receiving any RASi before admission. RASi patients were older, more frequently male, with more comorbidities and frailer. Their probability of death and ICU admission was higher. However, after adjustment, these differences disappeared. Regarding RASi in-hospital use, those who continued the treatment were younger, with balanced comorbidities but with less severe COVID19. Raw mortality and secondary events were less frequent in RASi. After adjustment, patients receiving RASi still presented significantly better outcomes, with less mortality, ICU admissions, respiratory insufficiency, need for mechanical ventilation or prone, sepsis, SIRS and renal failure (p<0.05 for all). However, we did not find differences regarding the hospital use of RASi and the development of heart failure.

METHODS: Using the PRISMA 2020 guidance, we first conducted a systematic review of available literature on PubMed, MedRxIV and FDA briefings to identify clinical studies either comparing COVID vaccination to natural immunity or delineating the benefit of vaccination in recovered individuals. After assessing for eligibility, studies were qualitatively appraised and formally graded using the NOS system for observational, case-control and RCTs. Incidence rates were tabulated for the following groups: never infected (NI) and unvaccinated (UV), NI and vaccinated (V), previously infected (PI) and UV, PI and UV. Pooling was performed by grouping the RCTs and observational studies separately, and then all studies in total. Risk ratios and risk differences are reported for individual studies and pooled groups, in 1) NPI/V vs. PI/UV and 2) PI/UV vs. PI/V analysis. In addition, number needed to treat (NNT) analysis was performed for vaccination in naive and previously infected cohorts. RESULTS: Nine clinical studies were identified including three randomized controlled studies, four retrospective observational cohorts, one prospective observational cohort, and a case-control study. The NOS quality appraisals of these articles ranged from four to nine (out of nine stars). All of the included studies found at least statistical equivalence between the protection of full vaccination and natural immunity; and, three studies found superiority of natural immunity. Four observational studies found a statistically significant incremental benefit to vaccination in the COVID-recovered individuals. In total pooled analysis, incidence in NPI/V trended higher than PI/UV groups (RR=1.86 [95%CI 0.77-4.51], P=0.17). Vaccination in COVID-recovered individuals provided modest protection from reinfection (RR=1.82 [95%CI 1.21-2.73], P=0.004), but the absolute risk difference was extremely small (AR= 0.004 person-years [95% CI 0.001-0.007], P=0.02). The NNT to prevent one annual case of infection in COVID-recovered patients was 218, compared to 6.5 in COVID-naive patients, representing a 33.5-fold difference in benefit between the two populations. CONCLUSIONS: While vaccinations are highly effective at protecting against infection and severe COVID-19 disease, our review demonstrates that natural immunity in COVID-recovered individuals is, at least, equivalent to the protection afforded by full vaccination of COVID-naive populations. There is a modest and incremental relative benefit to vaccination in COVID-recovered individuals; however, the net benefit is marginal on an absolute basis. COVID-recovered individuals represent a distinctly different benefit-risk calculus. Therefore, vaccination of COVID-recovered individuals should be subject to clinical equipoise and individual preference.","output":"Equivalency of Protection from Natural Immunity in COVID-19 Recovered Versus Fully Vaccinated Persons: A Systematic Review and Pooled Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are the potential cause of several diseases including novel corona virus-19, flu, small pox, chicken pox, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome etc. The objectives of this review article are to summarize the reasons behind the epidemics caused by several emerging viruses and bacteria, how to control the infection and preventive strategies.

In particular, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) has been used to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater, while monitoring viral genome mutations requires separate approaches such as deep genomic sequencing. A high throughput sequencing platform (ATOPlex) that uses a multiplex tiled PCR-based enrichment technique has shown promise in detecting viral variants while also providing virus quantitation data. However, sensitivities of both RT-qPCR and sequencing analyses can be impacted through losses occurring during sample processing (e.g., sample handling, concentration, nucleic acid extraction and RT-qPCR), therefore process limit of detection (PLOD) assessments are needed to estimate the copy numbers of target molecule required to attain specific probability of detection. In this study, we compare the PLOD estimates of four commonly used RT-qPCR assays for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 (US CDC N1 and N2, China CDC N and ORF1ab) to that of ATOPlex sequence analyses through seeding known concentrations of gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 into wastewater. Results suggest that among the RT-qPCR assays, US CDC N1 was the most sensitive, especially at lower SARS-CoV-2 seed levels. However, when results from all RT-qPCR assays were combined, it resulted in the greater detection rates than individual assays, suggesting that application of multiple assays is better suited for detection of trace levels of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, while ATOPlex offers promising approach to SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance, this technology is appeared to be less sensitive compared to RT-qPCR and requires further refinements for routine monitoring and quantification of SARS-CoV-2.

The vast range of existing protein ligands enable those macromolecules to be used as efficient receptors to cover a diversity of applications. In addition, appropriate protein engineering approaches enable further improvement of the receptor functioning such as enhancing affinity or specificity in the ligand binding. Recently, several protein-only sensors are being developed, in which either both the receptor and signal transducer are parts of the same protein, or that use the whole cell where the protein is produced as transducer. In both cases, as no further chemical coupling is required, the production process is very convenient. However, protein platforms, being rather rigid, restrict the proper signal transduction that necessarily occurs through ligand-induced conformational changes. In this context, insertional protein engineering offers the possibility to develop new devices, efficiently responding to ligand interaction by dramatic conformational changes, in which the specificity and magnitude of the sensing response can be adjusted up to a convenient level for specific analyte species.

The study utilized the abbreviated version of the Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Scales 21 (DASS21) to evaluate the students' level of stress, anxiety and, depression with the participants' socio-demographic characteristics. The data compilation uses online questionnaires through the platform Google Forms, with participants recruited via social media. Results found that 18.6 % of the students were depressed, 35.1 % anxious, and 2.85 % stressed amidst the COVID C 19 pandemics. The symptoms of disorders were moderate to very severe in 6.1 %, 23.5 %, and 0.6 % of the study sample. Age, gender, marital status, and family history of illness differ significantly, with age group 20 and below, females, singles, and families with no history of sickness displaying a high level of anxiety. Results also found an association between anxiety and familys monthly income and history of sickness. The higher the family monthly income with no presence of family sickness, the more anxious the person. Finally, the variables explained only 1.5 % depression, 3.4 % anxiety, and 1.4 % stress in this time of COVID-19 outbreak. With these findings, it is necessary to develop community-based mental health programs.","output":"Level of depression, anxiety and stress among students amidst COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has caused psychological problems in all age groups since it emerged from the first day. One of the most important groups has been affected negatively during the COVID-19 pandemic process are university students. One of the negative situations caused by the pandemic process in university students is student stress caused by COVID-19. To assess stress situations in Italian culture, the COVID-19 student stress scale (CSS-S) has been developed. In this context, the aim of this study was to adapt the CSS-S into Turkish. Another aim of the study was to investigate the direct and indirect relationships of COVID-19 student stress with school burnout, depression and subjective well-being. The participants of the study were 485 Turkish university students. The values obtained with the confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the factor structure of CSS-S is satisfying ((2)/df = 2.99, AGFI = .95, TLI = .93, CFI = .96, IFI = .96, REMSEA = .06, SRMR = .04). Moreover, it was found that school burnout has a mediating role in the relationship between COVID-19 student stress and depression and subjective well-being (structure of CSS-S is satisfying/df = 2.41, AGFI = .87, TLI = .91, CFI = .91, IFI = .91, REMSEA = .05, SRMR = .05). These findings imply that psychosocial intervention studies to reduce COVID-19 student stress can reduce students' school burnout and depression.

To facilitate the search for new promising inhibitors of TNF-, we developed an efficient competitive binding screening assay based on analytical size exclusion chromatography coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Application of this screening method to the NP library led to the discovery of a potent inhibitor of TNF-, sennoside B, with an IC(50) value of 0.32 M in TNF- induced HeLa cell toxicity assays. Surprisingly, the potency of sennoside B was 5.7-fold higher than that of the synthetic TNF- inhibitor SPD304. Molecular docking was performed to determine the binding mode of sennoside B to TNF-.

Discrimination can occur in this health care sector. Few studies, however, have investigated implicit and explicit biases in general practice against ethnic and migrant groups. This study, therefore, investigated the extent of implicit ethnic biases and willingness to adapt care to migrant patients among trainee GPs, and the factors involved therein, in order to measure explicit bias and explore a dimension of cultural competence. METHODS: In 2021, data were collected from 207 trainee GPs in the French-speaking part of Belgium. The respondents passed an Implicit Association Test (IAT), a validated tool used to measure implicit biases against ethnic groups. An explicit attitude of willingness to adapt care to diversity, one of the dimensions of cultural competence, was measured using the Hudelson scale. RESULTS: The overwhelming majority of trainee GPs (82.6%, 95% CI: 0.77 C 0.88) had implicit preferences for their ingroup to the detriment of ethnic and migrant groups. Overall, the majority of respondents considered it the responsibility of GPs to adapt their attitudes and practices to migrants needs. More than 50% of trainee GPs, however, considered it the responsibility of migrant patients to adapt to the values and habits of the host country. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the trainee GPs had high to very high levels of implicit ethnic bias and that they were not always willing to adapt care to the values of migrants. We therefore recommend that they are made aware of this bias and we recommend using the IAT and Hudelson scales as educational tools to address ethnic biases in primary care.

However, most studies focus on the complete rumor censorship behavior rather than the soft censorship behavior of (social media) platforms. To characterize soft censorship behavior, we conduct analytical, numerical, and experimental analyses using game theory to determine the specific strategies of platforms and rumormongers. Given that (1) the censorship behavior of platforms is costly and (2) platforms have a limited accuracy rate to identify rumors correctly, the platform may identify rumors as true information or identify true information as rumors; moreover, (3) rumormongers decide whether to publish rumors or not to avoid been deleted by the platforms. We found that (1) if deleting true information mistakenly has benefits rather than cost (the platform may cost less by not improving their rumor identification algorithms if the public pays less attention to the freedom of their speech), then platforms are more likely to censor rumormongers and delete the information they published; (2) if deleting true information is costly, then platforms become more cautious about their deleting behavior. This study explains why censoring is accepted by the public in some countries but is highly questionable in others.

METHODS: This observational study enrolled 92 recently COVID-19 recovered subjects who underwent measurement of heart rate and blood pressure response to standing up from supine position and a 12-lead ECG recording for 60 s period during supine paced breathing. Using feature extraction, ECG features including those of HRV (RMSSD and SDNN) were obtained. An AI model was constructed with ShAP AI interpretability to determine time domain HRV features representing post COVID-19 recovered state. In addition, 120 healthy volunteers were enrolled as controls. RESULTS: Cardiovascular dysautonomia was present in 15.21% (OH:13.04%; POTS:2.17%). Patients with OH had significantly lower HRV and higher inflammatory markers. HRV (RMSSD) was significantly lower in post COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (13.9  11.8 ms vs 19.9  19.5 ms; P = 0.01) with inverse correlation between HRV and inflammatory markers.

We applied electric pulses with different durations on plated cells, cells grown on collagen layer and cells embedded in collagen gel (3D model) and analyzed gene electrotransfer efficiency. In order to analyze the effect of impaired mobility on gene electrotransfer efficiency, we applied electric pulses with different durations on plated cells, cells grown on collagen layer and cells embedded in collagen gel (3D model) and analyzed gene electrotransfer efficiency. RESULTS: We obtained the highest transfection in plated cells, while transfection efficiency of embedded cells in 3D model was lowest, similarly as in in vivo. To further analyze DNA diffusion in 3D model, we applied DNA on top or injected it into 3D model and showed, that for the former gene electrotransfer efficiency was similarly as in in vivo. The experimental results are explained with theoretical analysis of DNA diffusion and electromobility. CONCLUSION: We show, empirically and theoretically that DNA has impaired electromobility and especially diffusion in collagen environment, where the latter crucially limits electrotransfection.

Unfortunately, its epitaxial wafers are so far limited to a size of 2 inches, which greatly increases the cost of massive production. In this work, a 4-inch crack-free high-power UVC-LED wafer is reported. This achievement relies on a proposed strain-tailored strategy, where a 3D to 2D (3D-2D) transition layer is introduced during the homo-epitaxy of AlN on the high temperature annealed (HTA)-AlN template, which successfully drives the original compressive strain into a tensile one and thus solves the challenge of realizing a high-quality Al0.6Ga0.4N layer with a flat surface. This smooth Al0.6Ga0.4N layer is nearly pseudomorphically grown on the strain-tailored HTA-AlN template, leading to 4-inch UVC-LED wafers with outstanding performances. The strategy succeeds in compromising the bottlenecked contradictory in producing a large-sized UVC-LED wafer on pronounced crystalline AlN template: The compressive strain in HTA-AlN allows for a crack-free 4-inch wafer, but at the same time leads to a deterioration of the AlGaN morphology and crystal quality.

METHODS: In this observational cohort study, we identified all neonates born between March 22 and May 17, 2020, at three New York Presbyterian Hospitals in New York City (NY, USA) to mothers positive for SARS-CoV-2 at delivery. Mothers could practice skin-to-skin care and breastfeed in the delivery room, but had to wear a surgical mask when near their neonate and practice proper hand hygiene before skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding, and routine care. Unless medically required, neonates were kept in a closed Giraffe isolette in the same room as their mothers, and were held by mothers for feeding after appropriate hand hygiene, breast cleansing, and placement of a surgical mask. Neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by use of real-time PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs taken at 24 h, 5C7 days, and 14 days of life, and were clinically evaluated by telemedicine at 1 month of age. We recorded demographics, neonatal, and maternal clinical presentation, as well as infection control practices in the hospital and at home. FINDINGS: Of 1481 deliveries, 116 (8%) mothers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 120 neonates were identified. All neonates were tested at 24 h of life and none were positive for SARS-CoV-2. 82 (68%) neonates completed follow-up at day 5C7 of life. Of the 82 neonates, 68 (83%) roomed in with the mothers. All mothers were allowed to breastfeed; at 5C7 days of life, 64 (78%) were still breastfeeding. 79 (96%) of 82 neonates had a repeat PCR at 5C7 days of life, which was negative in all; 72 (88%) neonates were also tested at 14 days of life and none were positive.

METHODS This descriptive, cross-sectional study investigated epilepsy among indigenous people residing in Jaguapir Village, Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Participants had their clinical histories reviewed and physical examination performed, as well as one or more electroencephalograms (EEG) registered. Other laboratory tests and neuroimaging data available were analyzed and patients with nonepileptic paroxysmal events were additionally identified. RESULTS Out of 2,994 respondents, 49 had a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy (2.37%) and 22 had self-limited epileptic syndromes, a rate that exceeds the global prevalence but is close to other data reported in the Brazilian population. Focal epilepsy, predominantly from temporal lobe origin, was the most prevalent epileptic syndrome (71.4%). Febrile seizures occurred in only 0.4% of respondents, much lower rate than reported in the general population, which can be attributed to the cross-sectional study design. The etiology of epilepsy was undetermined in 82.6% of cases, with the remaining cases attributed to head trauma, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and brain malformations. A history of delayed neuropsychomotor development was significantly associated with epilepsy. Monotherapy with first-generation antiseizure medications was greatly effective in most epilepsy cases (87.7%). Electroencephalogram helped to define focal epilepsies and diagnose seizures of nonepileptic origin; the latter mostly included cases of psychogenic seizures and, less frequently, syncope.

The prevalence of childhood stunting has fallen, and linear growth faltering in early life has become less pronounced over time, markedly in middle-income countries but less so in low-income countries. Stunting and wasting remain public health problems in low-income countries, where 47% of children are simultaneously affected by both, a condition associated with a 48-times increase in mortality. New evidence shows that stunting and wasting might already be present at birth, and that the incidence of both conditions peaks in the first 6 months of life. Global low birthweight prevalence declined slowly at about 10% a year. Knowledge has accumulated on the short-term and long-term consequences of child undernutrition and on its adverse effect on adult human capital. Existing data on vitamin A deficiency among children suggest persisting high prevalence in Africa and south Asia. Zinc deficiency affects close to half of all children in the few countries with data. New evidence on the causes of poor growth points towards subclinical inflammation and environmental enteric dysfunction. Among women of reproductive age, the prevalence of low body-mass index has been reduced by half in middle-income countries, but trends in short stature prevalence are less evident. Both conditions are associated with poor outcomes for mothers and their children, whereas data on gestational weight gain are scarce. Data on the micronutrient status of women are conspicuously scarce, which constitutes an unacceptable data gap. Prevalence of anaemia in women remains high and unabated in many countries. Social inequalities are evident for many forms of undernutrition in women and children, suggesting a key role for poverty and low education, and reinforcing the need for multisectoral actions to accelerate progress. Despite little progress in some areas, maternal and child undernutrition remains a major global health concern, particularly as improvements since 2000 might be offset by the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Revisiting maternal and child undernutrition in low-income and middle-income countries: variable progress towards an unfinished agenda."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many LGBTQ youth experience rejection and discrimination in their families and schools, and the range of interventions for improving their resilience and well-being is limited. We developed and piloted an LGBTQ-youth-focused intervention to build resilience and promote health equity, called Pride Camp, in an urban environment in the Midwest. METHODS: Using a mixed-method approach we examined the impact of Pride Camp on resilience and other measures of well-being among LGBTQ high school students who attended camp on a college campus in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Camp attendees and the research sample included a majority proportion of transgender and gender nonbinary (TGN) youth. RESULTS: Pre- and post-test data from our quantitative surveys (n = 28), indicated significant increases in resilience, self-esteem, and quality of life in LGBTQ youth who attended camp. Similar results were found among the TGN participants (n = 19). Qualitative data from focus groups indicated that specifically for TGN youth, the affirming environment at the camp provided social opportunities that they had not found elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that the Pride Camp intervention provides a platform for LGBTQ youth to meet peers and engage in LGBTQ communities, improving their resilience and outlook on the future. A larger controlled study of the Pride Camp intervention including measurement of additional specific health outcomes over a longer follow-up period is warranted to examine the impact of this program on health equity.","output":"Pride Camp: Pilot study of an intervention to develop resilience and self-esteem among LGBTQ youth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interest in self-management approaches to abortion with pills in the United States preceded the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and has accelerated during this global health crisis.

We aimed to quantify reliably the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections at schools detected with reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-qPCR). METHODS: This nationwide prospective cohort study monitors a representative sample of pupils (grade 1C8) and teachers at Austrian schools throughout the school year 2020/2021. We repeatedly test participants for SARS-CoV-2 infection using a gargling solution and RT-qPCR. We herein report on the first two rounds of examinations. We used mixed-effects logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and robust 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). FINDINGS: We analysed data on 10,734 participants from 245 schools (9465 pupils, 1269 teachers). Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection increased from 039% at round 1 (95% CI 028C055%, 28 September-22 October 2020) to 139% at round 2 (95% CI 104C185%, 10C16 November). Odds ratios for SARS-CoV-2 infection were 226 (95% CI 125C412, P = 0007) in regions with >500 vs. 500 inhabitants/km(2), 167 (95% CI 142C197, P<0001) per two-fold higher regional 7-day community incidence, and 278 (95% CI 173C448, P<0001) in pupils at schools with high/very high vs. low/moderate social deprivation. Associations of regional community incidence and social deprivation persisted in a multivariable adjusted model. Prevalence did not differ by average number of pupils per class nor between age groups, sexes, pupils vs. teachers, or primary (grade 1C4) vs. secondary schools (grade 5C8).

Vital signs and respiratory patterns, C-reactive protein, radiography, computed tomography, and endoscopy results after intraluminal stenting were assessed for 3-5 months. RESULTS No dogs showed evidence of intraluminal tracheal stenosis or tracheitis in the region of stent insertion on tracheoscopy and computed tomography after tracheal stent placement. After 1-2 weeks of tracheal stent placement, all dogs resolved coughing and dyspnea signs and resumed normal activities.

Methods: Twenty-five kidney-transplanted recipients were immunized with two doses of the mRNA-based PfizerCBioNTech COVID19 vaccine three weeks apart. Cell-immune response (CIR) was evaluated ten weeks later using an in vivo DTH skin test and in vitro with an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). Humoral Immune Response (HIR) was determined by the measurement of specific IgG anti-S1 SARS-CoV-2. Results: Ten weeks after the second dose of the vaccine, 23 out of 25 transplanted patients had a positive DTH skin test, while in vitro CIR was considered positive in 20 patients. Unspecific stimulation was positive in all 25 patients, showing no T-cell defect. Seven out of twenty-five patients had a negative specific anti-spike IgG. CIR was positive in all immune-competent control patients. Conclusions: DTH is a useful, simple, and cheaper tool that can be used to assess cellular immune response, with an excellent correlation with the in vitro CIR. CIR assessment after vaccination in these immunocompromised patients is an excellent complement to HIR-based methods.

End-of-day diary (EDD) provides an attractive alternative to EMA, though no direct comparison has been performed in the tinnitus field. DESIGN: Four thousand seven-hundred thirty-two data entries were collected from nine participants undergoing cognitive behavioral treatment for tinnitus.

Tinnitus experience (i.e., anger, annoyance, avoidance, distraction, fear, invasiveness, pleasantness, and sadness) and well-being (i.e., anxiety, happiness, and stress) were correlated and means compared (t-tests). RESULTS: All variables presented adequate correlation (r > 0.68) between the EMA and EDD counterparts. Small (<3.9%) significant daily mean differences between EMA and EDD were found for six variables (tinnitus anger, invasiveness, pleasantness, sadness, as well as anxiety and stress) with worse results reported in EDD.

Encephalitis and meningitis are some of the critical immune-related adverse events. Atezolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that inhibits the programmed cell death-ligand. Encephalitis and meningitis were reported in 0.8% of the patients in the atezolizumab versus docetaxel in patients with previously treated NSCLC. However, none of the reports have clarified the details concerning atezolizumab-induced encephalitis and meningitis, including their background, time of onset, treatment, and therapeutic course. We herein report about three patients who experienced atezolizumab-induced meningitis in our department. Methods Of the 29 patients who received atezolizumab in our department between October 2015 and September 2018, three developed aseptic meningitis. We retrospectively examined their clinical, radiologic, and cytologic features. Results In all three cases, a depressed level of consciousness followed fever in cycle 1, days 15 and 16 after administration of atezolizumab. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed that the number of cells was not increased despite the protein level being high. No definite malignant cells were identified in the cerebrospinal fluid in any of the three cases. Only one patient exhibited abnormal enhancement along the lines of the corpus callosum on magnetic resonance imaging. On the basis of these findings, the patients were diagnosed with atezolizumab-induced meningitis.

The objective of this study was to assess the functional exercise capacity of patients with severe COVID-19 and to evaluate the effect of a telerehabilitation program in the specific context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Patients hospitalized for severe or critical COVID-19 were recruited. The functional exercise capacity (1-min sit-to-stand test (STST)) was prospectively quantified at discharge. A telerehabilitation program was then proposed. A control group was composed with the patients refusing the program. RESULTS: At discharge, none of the 48 recruited patients had a STST higher than the 50th percentile and 77% of them were below the 2.5th percentile. SpO2 was 92.6  3.0% after STST and 15 patients had oxygen desaturation.

The secondary objective was to assess the patient acceptability of the two sampling methods. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study done at a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India, on 50 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Paired swab (NPS and OPS) and gargle samples were taken within 72 h of their diagnosis. Samples were processed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Post-sample collection, a 10-point scale was administered to assess the level of discomfort with either of the collection methods. RESULTS: All gargle samples were positive and comparable to their corresponding swab samples irrespective of the symptoms and duration of illness. The cycle threshold (C(t)) values for gargle samples were slightly higher but comparable to those of swabs. Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement between the two methods.

The clinical picture of these different pneumonias can be very similar, but viral infection is more common in the pediatric and geriatric populations, leukocytes are not generally elevated, fever is variable, and upper respiratory tract symptoms often occur; procalcitonin levels are not generally affected. For years, the diagnosis of viral pneumonia was based on cell culture and antigen detection, but since the introduction of polymerase chain reaction techniques in the clinical setting, identification of these pathogens has increased and new microorganisms such as human bocavirus have been discovered. In general, influenza virus type A and syncytial respiratory virus are still the main pathogens involved in this entity. However, in recent years, outbreaks of deadly coronavirus and zoonotic influenza virus have demonstrated the need for constant alert in the face of new emerging pathogens. Neuraminidase inhibitors for viral pneumonia have been shown to reduce transmission in cases of exposure and to improve the clinical progress of patients in intensive care; their use in common infections is not recommended. Ribavirin has been used in children with syncytial respiratory virus, and in immunosuppressed subjects. Apart from these drugs, no antiviral has been shown to be effective.

Most children are falsely labelled and can safely tolerate a penicillin but delabelling strategies are underutilised and paediatric-specific resources are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate an allergy assessment tool for children in hospital. METHODS We evaluated a paediatric-adapted penicillin allergy assessment tool, using an online survey of clinicians in a tertiary paediatric hospital, with 10 hypothetical potential penicillin allergy or adverse reaction cases (including non-allergy reactions). For each case, respondents were asked to use the tool to assign a reaction phenotype and recommend management. We determined the tool's sensitivity, specificity and acceptability to end users. RESULTS We evaluated 30 complete survey responses from senior and junior medical staff, nurses and pharmacists. The tool's overall sensitivity was 80.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 74.2-87.1%) for assigning the correct reaction phenotype and 85.3% (95% CI 79.4-91.3%) for appropriate management. The tool had high sensitivity for identifying immediate hypersensitivity reactions at 95.6% (95% CI 90.2-100%). Most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they would use the tool in their practice (22/30, 73.3%). CONCLUSION This survey evaluated a paediatric-adapted penicillin allergy assessment tool in a tertiary paediatric hospital among multidisciplinary clinician groups. The tool performed well overall and had high safety in identifying immediate hypersensitivity reactions.

Methods The Critical COVID France (CCF) study was an observational multicenter study including patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Primary composite outcome included transfer to ICU or in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular complications diagnosed by the referring medical team according to available clinical, biological and radiological findings. Results Among 2,878 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in 24 centers, 321 (11.2%) patients were under the age of 45 y/o. They had a higher body mass index (BMI) (28.96.6 vs 27.76.0, P =0.004) but less other cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension (29 (9.2%) vs. 1422 (56.1%), P <0.001), diabetes (20 (6.3%) vs. 656 (25.9%), P <0.001) and dyslipidemia (15 (4.7%) vs. 783 (30.7%), P <0.001).

Participants asked for the changes after starting the COVID-19 pandemic in health status, workload, daily life, and health behavior. Ordinal logistic regression was performed to elucidate factors associated with deterioration in general health status. RESULTS: A deterioration in general health status was reported by 17.0% of male and 19.4% of female. There has been a clear shift to sedentary life with decreasing moderate activity and increasing screen time. The multivariate analysis revealed that deteriorated work style, increased burden of housework, decreased moderate activity, increased digital media exposure, and increased body weight were significantly associated with deteriorating health status.

METHOD: This case study involves a 19-year-old male in a residential setting with a psychiatric history of major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder who had been stabilized on mirtazapine for 9 months. Then, the patient exhibited fever, sore throat, cough, nausea, diarrhea, and malaise and was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection;he did not require hospitalization, was treated with supportive care, and signs and symptoms resolved uneventfully. Approximately 2 months later, in the winter, the patient presented for clinical assessment due to hematuria and painful urination. History revealed that he had been exercising excessively exercising over the past 24 hours, completing hundreds of push-ups and sit-ups. The patient presented to a nearby community hospital and was found to have creatine kinase of over 500,000. He was transferred to a large Midwestern university hospital for further evaluation and management. RESULTS: The patient's serum creatine kinase level was found to be 510,000 U/L. Patient's ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase were 283, 79, and 76 IU/L, respectively, while creatinine was 0.92. Patient received vigorous hydration, supportive care, and further evaluation. Treatment with mirtazapine was discontinued. The following week he developed severe nausea and vomiting;creatine kinase had decreased to 920, while hepatic function tests remained mildly elevated. Evaluation for hepatitis, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus were negative, as was Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis.

Infected pigs develop a strong and rapid humoral response but these initial antibodies do not confer protection and can even be harmful by mediating an antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. In contrast, development of neutralising antibodies (NAs) is delayed and generation of cell-mediated immune responses, such as PRRSV-specific interferon (IFN)- secreting cells, is initially erratic. In spite of this, induction of strong and rapid NAs and IFN- responses seem to be required for effective vaccination. PRRSV strongly modulates the hosts immune responses. The virus inhibits key cytokines, such as IFN-, and may induce regulatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10. Development of NAs seems to be impaired by the existence of a decoy epitope close to the main neutralisation epitope in glycoprotein 5. This ability to modulate the host immune response probably varies among strains or isolates. The genetic diversity of the virus is very high and it has been shown that this diversity can have serious implications for the development of vaccines, since the immunity induced by one strain may be only partial against a different strain, even within the same genotype.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between perceived change in physical activity or exercise and mental health outcomes over the short-term in response to COVID-19 mitigation strategies in a sample of adult twins. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 3,971 identical and same-sex fraternal adult twins (909 pairs, 77% identical) from the community-based Washington State Twin Registry. Participants in this study completed an online survey examining the impact of COVID-19 mitigation on a number of health-related behaviors and outcomes, administered between March 26 and April 5, 2020. In the present study, the exposure was perceived change in physical activity or exercise. The outcomes were levels of perceived anxiety and stress. RESULTS: More twin pairs reported a decrease in physical activity levels (42%) than those reporting no change (31%) or increased physical activity levels (27%). A perceived decrease in physical activity or exercise was associated with higher stress and anxiety levels. However, the physical activity-stress relationship was confounded by genetic and shared environmental factors. On the other hand, the physical activity-anxiety relationship held after controlling for genetic and shared environmental factors, although it was no longer significant after further controlling for age and sex, with older twins more likely to report lower levels of anxiety and females more likely to report higher levels of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic may be impacting physical activity and mental health, with those experiencing a decrease in physical activity also having higher levels of stress and anxiety.

However, the clinical characteristics of patients in other areas around Wuhan, Hubei Province are still unclear. In this study, we performed epidemiological and clinical characteristics analysis on these regional cases. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated COVID-19 patients positively confirmed by nucleic acid Q-PCR at Taihe Hospital from January 16 to February 4, 2020. Their epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and imaging characteristics were analysed. RESULTS: Among the 73 patients studied, 12.3 % developed symptoms after returning to Shiyan from Wuhan, and 71.2 % had a history of close contact with Wuhan personnel or confirmed cases. Among these patients, 9 cases were associated with family clustering. The first main symptoms presented by these patients were fever (84.9 %) and cough (21.9 %). The longest incubation period was 26 days, and the median interval from the first symptoms to admission was 5 days. Of the patients, 67.1 % were originally healthy people with no underlying diseases, others mostly had common comorbidities including hypertension (12.3 %) and diabetes (5.5 %), 10.9 % were current smokers, 30.1 % had low white blood cell counts and 45.2 % showed decreased lymphocytes at the first time of diagnosis. CT scans showed that multiple patchy ground glass shadows outside of the patient lungs were commonly observed, and a single sub-pleural sheet of ground glass shadow with enhanced vascular bundles was also found located under the pleura. Patient follow-up to February 14 presented 38.4 % severe cases and 2.7 % critical cases. After follow-up, the parameter of lymphocyte counts below 0.8  10(9)/L cannot be used to predict severe and critical groups from the ordinary group, and a lower proportion of smokers and higher proportion of diabetes patients occur in the poor outcome group. Other co-morbidities are observed but did not lead to poor outcomes. CONCLUSION: The epidemiological characteristics of patients in the area around Wuhan, such as Shiyan, at first diagnosis are described as follows: Patients had histories of Wuhan residences in the early stage and family clustering in the later period. The incubation period was relatively long, and the incidence was relatively hidden, but the virulence was relatively low. The initial diagnosis of the patients was mostly ordinary, and the percentage of critical patients who evolved into the ICU during follow-up is 2.7 %, which is lower than the 26.1 % reported by Wuhan city. According to the Shiyan experience, early diagnosis with multiple swaps of the Q-PCR test and timely treatment can reduce the death rate. Diabetes could be one of the risk factors for progression to severe/critical outcomes. No evidence exists that smoking protects COVID-19 patients from developing to severe/critical cases, and the absolute number of lymphocytes at initial diagnosis could not predict the progression risk from severe to critical condition. Multivariate regression analysis should be used to further guide the allocation of clinical resources.","output":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics analysis of COVID-19 in the surrounding areas of Wuhan, Hubei Province in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS coronavirus encodes non-structural protein 13 (nsP13), a nucleic acid helicase/NTPase belonging to superfamily 1 helicase, which efficiently unwinds both partial-duplex RNA and DNA. In this study, unwinding of DNA substrates that had different duplex lengths and 5-overhangs was examined under single-turnover reaction conditions in the presence of excess enzyme. The amount of DNA unwound decreased significantly as the length of the duplex increased, indicating a poor in vitro processivity. However, the quantity of duplex DNA unwound increased as the length of the single-stranded 5-tail increased for the 50-bp duplex. This enhanced processivity was also observed for duplex DNA that had a longer single-stranded gap in between. These results demonstrate that nsP13 requires the presence of a long 5-overhang to unwind longer DNA duplexes. In addition, enhanced DNA unwinding was observed for gapped DNA substrates that had a 5-overhang, indicating that the translocated nsP13 molecules pile up and the preceding helicase facilitate DNA unwinding. Together with the propensity of oligomer formation of nsP13 molecules, we propose that the cooperative translocation by the functionally interacting oligomers of the helicase molecules loaded onto the 5-overhang account for the observed enhanced processivity of DNA unwinding.","output":"Cooperative translocation enhances the unwinding of duplex DNA by SARS coronavirus helicase nsP13"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recombinant measles viruses (rMV) based on the live attenuated measles vaccine strain (MVb) expressing antigens of HIV-1 clade B were generated by reverse genetics.

In many indoor spaces, such as elevators, it is difficult to maintain social distancing. This investigation used computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) to study airborne particle exposure in riding an elevator in a typical building with 35 floors. The elevator traveled from the ground floor to the 35th floor with two stops on floor 10 and floor 20, comprising 114 s. The CFD simulated the dispersion of the aerosolized particles exhaled by an index person while breathing in both lobby and elevator areas. The study calculated the accumulated dose of susceptible riders riding in elevators with the index person under different conditions including different ventilation rates, air supply methods, and elevator cab geometries. This investigation also studied a case with a single cough from the index person as the person entered the elevator. The results show that, due to the short duration of the average elevator ride, the number of particles inhaled by a susceptible rider was low. For the reference case with a 72 ACH (air changes per hour) ventilation rate, the highest accumulated particle dose by a susceptible passenger close to the index person was only 1.59. The cough would cause other riders to inhale approximately 8 orders of magnitude higher particle mass than from continuous breathing by the index person for the whole duration of the ride.","output":"Evaluation of airborne particle exposure for riding elevators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of using electrostatic precipitation to manage the surgical plume during low pressure laparoscopic gynecologic procedures. Methods This was a prospective, blinded, randomized controlled study of women with a clinical indication for laparoscopic hysterectomy (n = 30) or myomectomy (n = 5). Patients were randomized to either use electrostatic precipitation (EP) during the procedure, or not (No EP, hysterectomy group only). Results Low pressure surgery could be undertaken in 87% of hysterectomy cases (13/15) when using EP to manage the surgical plume, compared to only 53% (8/15) in the No EP group. Overall average rating of the visual field was excellent with EP vs fair for No EP. Average CO2 consumption was reduced by 29% when using EP (16.7L vs 23.5L, p = 0.152). The average number of procedural pauses to vent smoke was lower with EP than the No EP group (1.5 per case vs. 3.7 per case, p = 0.005). Average procedure duration for the EP vs No EP group was 40.5 min vs. 46.9 min (p = 0.987). There were no measurable differences between groups for body temperature, end-tidal CO2, and discharge pain scores.

This was achieved by minimizing interruptions to surgery and exchange of CO2; providing a clear visual field throughout the procedure; and eliminating surgical smoke at the site of origin.","output":"Electrostatic Precipitation in Low Pressure Laparoscopic Hysterectomy and Myomectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since COVID-19 was first discovered, it exploded into a pandemic resulting in devastating effects on human lives and a global recession. While there have been discussions that COVID-19 will accelerate the 'end of globalization and multilateralism', we have already seen the high costs of non-cooperation in responding to the virus resulting in sub-optimal use of resources, rapid spread of the virus between countries, and, ultimately, significant loss of life. In spite of their favorable demographic structures and relatively young populations, countries in the Global South are still harshly affected in both epidemiological and economic terms. Nations must find innovative ways to address health concerns and regional bodies are possible mechanisms for facilitating international cooperation on health. We delineate how regional organizations can support how countries address health threats namely by serving as a bridge between the global and national policy levels; strengthening disease surveillance; mobilizing supply chains and facilitating trade; supporting the production and procurement of medicines and supplies; and coordinating policies and work with other actors. We finalize by arguing that mechanisms for regional cooperation must be strengthened themselves in order to effectively contribute to positive health outcomes within member states.","output":"Regional cooperation is essential to combatting health emergencies in the Global South"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Phase I trials are a crucial step in the evaluation of new cancer therapies. Historically, low rates of response (5%) and comparably high rates of death from toxicities (0.5%) have contributed to debates on the ethics and orientation of these trials. With the introduction of novel targeted therapies, a contemporary estimate is needed. METHODS We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov for reports of phase I oncology trials of single-agent targeted immunomodulators, molecularly targeted therapies, and antiangiogenic agents, published between January 2015 and July 2018. Adult and pediatric trials of solid and hematological malignancies were eligible. Treatment-related adverse events (grades 3, 4, and 5) and response rates (objective, complete, and partial) were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS One hundred and fifty-eight trial reports, covering 6,707 patients, were included. The rate of treatment-related deaths was 0.0% (95% CI, 0.0 to 0.1), while 13.2% of patients (9.5 to 17.3) experienced a grade 3 or 4 treatment-related toxicity. The combined objective response rate was 6.4% (4.6 to 8.5). Among trials using tumor biomarkers as eligibility criteria, the objective response rate was higher (12.0% [7.3 to 17.6] compared to 4.9% [2.5 to 5.7], P value < .01). The same was true of trials focusing on a single tumor type (13.4% [8.2 to 19.4]) compared to multiple tumor types (3.8% [2.5 to 5.3], P value < .01). CONCLUSION Reduced grade 5 risk and improved benefit appears to exist in modern phase I oncology trials, particularly in trials that target single tumor types and integrate biomarkers as eligibility criteria. These findings provide information to support informed consent discussions, highlight the need for improved reporting of phase I oncology trials, and provide direction for optimizing their design.","output":"Revisiting Risk and Benefit in Early Oncology Trials in the Era of Precision Medicine: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Phase I Trials of Targeted Single-Agent Anticancer Therapies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The sudden and unexpected pandemic changed the daily routine of the children with cerebral palsy (CP) and their caregivers. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the utilization of health and rehabilitation services and the general health and physical status of children with CP. In addition, the second aim of the study was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on caregivers quality of life (QOL) and their fear of COVID-19. METHODS: The utilization of children health and rehabilitation services during the pandemic, the general health and physical status of the children during the pandemic, and the children and caregivers history of COVID-19 infections were questioned. Furthermore, the caregivers level of fear of COVID-19 and their QOL were examined. RESULTS: One hundred twenty caregivers were contacted by phone, and 94 (78.33%) caregivers agreed to participate in the study. Sixty-three of 94 children (67.1%) did not attend their routine control check-up during the pandemic. Twelve children (12.8%) discontinued their physical therapy sessions during the pandemic. Caregivers physical and mental QOL significantly decreased during the pandemic (p < 0.05). The median of caregivers Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) was 17.5 (7C35).

METHODS: Of the 769 consecutive aSAH patients from a defined population (2005C2015), 269 (35%) were in poor condition on admission: 145 (54%) with H&H 4 and 124 (46%) with H&H 5. Their clinical lifelines were re-constructed from the Kuopio Intracranial Aneurysm Database and Finnish nationwide registries. Of the 269 patients, 155 (58%) were alive at 14 days, 125 (46%) at 12 months, and 120 (45%) at 3 years. RESULTS: The 120 H&H 4C5 patients alive at 3 years form the final study population. On admission, 73% had H&H 4 but only 27% H&H 5, 59% intracerebral hematoma (ICH; median 22 cm(3)), and 26% intraventricular blood clot (IVH). The outcome was favorable (mRS 0C1) in 45% (54 patients: ICH 44%; IVH clot 31%; shunt 46%), moderate (mRS 2C3) in 30% (36 patients: ICH 64%; IVH clot 19%; shunt 42%), and unfavorable (mRS 4C5) in 25% (30 patients: ICH 80%; IVH clot 23%; shunt 50%). A total of 46% carried a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. ICH volume was a significant predictor of mRS at 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Of poor-grade aSAH patients, 45% were alive at 3 years, even 27% of those extending to pain (H&H 5). Of the survivors, 75% were at least in moderate condition, while only 2.6% ended in hospice care. Consequently, we propose non-selected admission to neurointensive care (1) for a possibility of moderate outcome, and (2), in case of brain death, possibly improved organ donation rates.","output":"Clinical condition of 120 patients alive at 3 years after poor-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We envision a paradigm shift where our profession no longer follows but leads the charge to develop a whole mind approach in our pharmacists.

Therefore, early diagnosis is particularly important to prevent the further exacerbation of AMD. This paper proposed a novel automatic detection method of AMD from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images based on deep learning and a local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm. A ResNet-50 model with L2-constrained softmax loss was retrained to extract features from OCT images and the LOF algorithm was used as the classifier. The proposed method was trained on the UCSD dataset and tested on both the UCSD dataset and Duke dataset, with an accuracy of 99.87% and 97.56%, respectively. Even though the model was only trained on the UCSD dataset, it obtained good detection accuracy when tested on another dataset. Comparison with other methods also indicates the efficiency of the proposed method in detecting AMD.","output":"Automatic Detection of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Based on Deep Learning and Local Outlier Factor Algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The WHO has defined international targets toward the elimination of hepatitis C by 2030. Most countries cannot be on track to achieve this goal unless many challenges are surpassed. The Let's End HepC (LEHC) tool aims to contribute to the control of hepatitis C. The innovation of this tool combines the modelling of public health policies (PHP) focused on hepatitis C with epidemiological modelling of the disease, obtaining a unique result that allows to forecast the impact of policy outcomes. The model was applied to several countries, including Spain. Methods: To address the stated objective, we applied the Adaptive Conjoint Analysis for PHP decision-making and Markov Chains in the LEHC modelling tool. The tool also aims to be used as an element of health literacy for patient advocacy through gamification mechanisms and country comparability. The LEHC project has been conducted in several countries, including Spain. The population segments comprised in the project are: People Who Inject Drugs (PWID), prisoners, blood products, remnant population. Results: A total of 24 PHP related to hepatitis C were included in the LEHC project. It was identified that Spain had fully implemented 14 of those policies to control hepatitis C. According to LEHC's model forecast, the WHO's Hepatitis C elimination goal on reducing the number of patients living with Hepatitis C to 10% can be achieved in Spain by 2026 if current policies are maintained. The model estimates that the total population in Spain, by 2026, is expected to comprise 26,367 individuals living with hepatitis C. Moreover, if the 24 PHP considered for this study are fully implemented in Spain, the elimination goal may be achieved in 2024, with 29,615 individuals living with hepatitis C by that year. Conclusion: The findings corroborate the view that Spain has set great efforts in directing PHP toward Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) elimination by 2030. However, there is still room for improvement, namely in further implementing 10 of the 24 PHP considered for the LEHC project. By maintaining the 14 PHP in force, the LEHC model estimates the HCV elimination in the country by 2026, and by 2024 if further measures are employed to control the disease.","output":"Let's End HepC: Modelling Public Health Epidemiological Policies Applied to Hepatitis C in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increase in methamphetamine in OD dataEffects of early\\\\life stress in the father on the brain of the newbornIgnoring pandemic rules leads to selfish teen behavior [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Brown University Child & Adolescent Behavior Letter is the property of John Wiley & Sons, Inc and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Keep your eye on"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent epidemic outbreak of a novel human coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 and causing the respiratory tract disease COVID-19 has reached worldwide resonance and a global effort is being undertaken to characterize the molecular features and evolutionary origins of this virus.

We use publicly available monthly data from January 2011 through April 2020 on all-cause death counts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and employment from the Current Population Survey to estimate excess all-cause mortality and employment displacement in April 2020 in the United States. We report results nationally and separately by state and by age group. Nationally, excess all-cause mortality was 2.4 per 10,000 individuals (about 30% higher than reported COVID deaths in April) and employment displacement was 9.9 per 100 individuals. Across age groups 25 y and older, excess mortality was negatively correlated with economic damage; excess mortality was largest among the oldest (individuals 85 y and over: 39.0 per 10,000), while employment displacement was largest among the youngest (individuals 25 to 44 y: 11.6 per 100 individuals). Across states, employment displacement was positively correlated with excess mortality (correlation = 0.29). However, mortality was highly concentrated geographically, with the top two states (New York and New Jersey) each experiencing over 10 excess deaths per 10,000 and accounting for about half of national excess mortality. By contrast, employment displacement was more geographically spread, with the states with the largest point estimates (Nevada and Michigan) each experiencing over 16 percentage points employment displacement but accounting for only 7% of the national displacement.

Additionally, ACE2 has also been reported to show anti-tumorigenic activity. However, the mechanistic basis of this function has remained largely unexplored. In the current study, using a lentivirus-based expression system in lung cancer cells (A549), we show that ACE2 overexpression reduces the viability and migratory potential of cancer cells, highlighting the robust anti-tumorigenic effects of ACE2 function. Moreover, a quantitative proteome-level comparison between ACE2 overexpressed (OE) and empty vector-controlled (NC) cells reveals a large number (227) of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) that may have contributed to this phenomenon. Functional enrichment of these DEPs has uncovered that most of them perform binding activities and enzymatic reactions associated with metabolic pathways and various post-transcriptional gene expression regulatory mechanisms. Besides, cellular component analysis reveals that the DEPs function across a range of compartments within a cell with a relatively heterogeneous distribution. Our study, therefore, supports the previously established anti-tumorigenic effects of ACE2 overexpression in lung cancer cells.

The focus lays especially on the educational technology usage within the older adult English language classes mainly at the Universities of the Third Age (U3As) or similar institutions in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and to a certain extent also in Germany and Austria. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Educational technology at older adult English language courses during the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seroconversion rates following infection and vaccination are lower in dialysis patients compared to healthy controls. There is an urgent need for the characterization of humoral responses and success of a single-dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in previously infected dialysis patients. We performed a dual-center cohort study comparing three different groups: 25 unvaccinated hemodialysis patients after PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (Group 1), 43 hemodialysis patients after two-time BNT162b2 vaccination without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Group 2), and 13 single-dose vaccinated hemodialysis patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Group 3). Group 3 consists of seven patients from Group 1 and 6 additional patients with sera only available after single-dose vaccination. Anti-S1 IgG, neutralizing antibodies, and antibodies against various SARS-CoV-2 protein epitopes were measured 3 weeks after the first and 3 weeks after the second vaccination in patients without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, 6 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 in unvaccinated patients, and 3 weeks after single-dose vaccination in patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, respectively. Unvaccinated patients after COVID-19 showed a significantly higher neutralizing antibody capacity than two-time vaccinated patients without prior COVID-19 [median (IQR) percent inhibition 88.0 (71.5C95.5) vs. 50.7 (26.4C81.0); P = 0.018]. After one single vaccine dose, previously infected individuals generated 15- to 34-fold higher levels of anti-S1 IgG than age- and dialysis vintage-matched unvaccinated patients after infection or two-time vaccinated patients without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with a median (IQR) index of 274 (151C791) compared to 18 (8C41) and 8 (1C21) (for both P < 0.001). With a median (IQR) percent inhibition of 97.6 (97.2C98.9), the neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was significantly higher in single-dose vaccinated patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to other groups (for both P < 0.01). Bead-based analysis showed high antibody reactivity against various SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes after single-dose vaccination in previously infected patients. In conclusion, single-dose vaccination in previously infected dialysis patients induced a strong and broad antibody reactivity against various SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes with high neutralizing capacity.","output":"Humoral Responses to Single-Dose BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccination in Dialysis Patients Previously Infected With SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has impacted populations around the world, with the fatality rate varying dramatically across countries. Selenium, as one of the important micronutrients implicated in viral infections, was suggested to play roles. METHODS: An ecological study was performed to assess the association between the COVID-19 related fatality and the selenium content both from crops and topsoil, in China. RESULTS: Totally, 14,045 COVID-19 cases were reported from 147 cities during 8 December 2019-13 December 2020 were included. Based on selenium content in crops, the case fatality rates (CFRs) gradually increased from 1.17% in non-selenium-deficient areas, to 1.28% in moderate-selenium-deficient areas, and further to 3.16% in severe-selenium-deficient areas (P = 0.002). Based on selenium content in topsoil, the CFRs gradually increased from 0.76% in non-selenium-deficient areas, to 1.70% in moderate-selenium-deficient areas, and further to 1.85% in severe-selenium-deficient areas (P < 0.001). The zero-inflated negative binomial regression model showed a significantly higher fatality risk in cities with severe-selenium-deficient selenium content in crops than non-selenium-deficient cities, with incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 3.88 (95% CIs: 1.21-12.52), which was further confirmed by regression fitting the association between CFR of COVID-19 and selenium content in topsoil, with the IRR of 2.38 (95% CIs: 1.14-4.98) for moderate-selenium-deficient cities and 3.06 (1.49-6.27) for severe-selenium-deficient cities. CONCLUSIONS: Regional selenium deficiency might be related to an increased CFR of COVID-19.

However, these processes can be obstructed by a lack of knowledge on habitat requirements for wildlife. In order to aggregate and assess the suitability of current information available on habitat requirements for proactive conservation, we used a research weaving approach, and conducted a systematic literature review on peer reviewed literature on elephant and rhino habitat requirements. We synthesized data by combining a vote counting assessment with bibliometric and term maps, and contextualized this with a narrative review. We mapped out the current methodologies, results, terminology and collaborations of 693 studies. Our results indicated that the gathering of habitat suitability knowledge and the ability for proactive conservation interventions to succeed will further increase by embracing two types of inclusiveness. First, since habitat requirements can be classified as both ecological and anthropogenic, we call for the integration of these two dimensions into holistic habitat suitability and carrying capacity estimates, when planning conservation interventions like habitat restoration and (re-) introductions. Secondly, the active creation of collaborations within and across networks of researchers focusing on different species, as well as across regional and continental borders, and science-policy realms is necessary to avoid a waste of limited resources. These arguments are supported by previous research findings; yet, our literature case-study regarding elephant and rhino habitat requirements shows that there is still substantial room for improvement.

Children under age 20 in a statewide health system with SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined by positive PCR testing, between February 1 and August 30, 2020 were included in this observational cohort study. Data extracted from the medical record included age, demographic information, clinical illness severity, hospital stay, and comorbidities. Analysis included descriptive statistics and Chi-square as appropriate. Nine hundred and eighty-children met inclusion criteria for this study, ranging from 1 month to 20 years in age. Most children (62.4%) were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis and children over the age of 2 were significantly more likely to be asymptomatic at diagnosis than younger children (P < .05). Hispanic children were significantly more likely to be symptomatic at the time of diagnosis (56.3% asymptomatic; P < .05). The high proportion of children with asymptomatic infection emphasizes the importance of understanding the unique role of children in the pandemic.

However, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)/HIV-1 coinfection has been described in only few cases worldwide and no data are available on immunological outcomes in HIV-1-patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Hence, this study aims to compare type I IFN response and T cell activation levels between a SARS-CoV-2/HIV-1-coinfected female patient and age-matched HIV-1-positive or uninfected women. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 52-year-old woman diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2/HIV-1 coinfection, ten HIV-1-positive women and five age-matched-healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. DIAGNOSES: SARS-CoV-2 infection caused severe pneumonia in the second week of illness in HIV-1-positive patient under protease inhibitors. Chest high-resolution computed tomography images of the SARS-CoV-2/HIV-1-coinfected patient showed bilateral ground-glass opacities. INTERVENTIONS: SARS-CoV-2/HIV-1-coinfected female patient under darunavir/cobicistat regimen received a 7-days hydroxychloroquine therapy. Analysis of IFN&#945;/? mRNA levels and CD4 and CD8 T cell (CD38, human leukocyte antigen-DR [HLA-DR], CD38 HLA-DR) frequencies were performed by RT/real-time PCR assays and flow cytometry, respectively. Median relative difference (MRD) was calculated for each immunological variable. For values greater than reference, MRD should be a positive number and for values that are smaller, MRD should be negative. OUTCOMES: The severe pneumonia observed in SARS-CoV-2/HIV-1-positive patient under protease inhibitors was reversed by a 7-days hydroxychloroquine therapy. At the end of treatment, on day 7, patient reported resolution of fever, normalization of respiratory rate (14a??breaths/min), and improved oxygen arterial pressure with a FiO2 of 30%.

Clinical manifestations include symptoms and signs such as leg pain and heaviness, edema, redness, telangiectasia, new varicose veins, hyperpigmentation, skin thickening and in severe cases, leg ulcers. The best way to prevent PTS is to prevent DVT with pharmacologic or mechanical thromboprophylaxis used in high risk patients and settings. In patients whose DVT is treated with a vitamin K antagonist, subtherapeutic INRs should be avoided. We do not suggest routine use of elastic compression stockings (ECS) after DVT to prevent PTS, but in patients with acute DVT-related leg swelling that is bothersome, a trial of ECS is reasonable. We suggest that selecting patients for catheter-directed thrombolytic techniques be done on a case-by-case basis, with a focus on patients with extensive thrombosis, recent symptoms onset, and low bleeding risk, who are seen at experienced hospital centers. For patients with established PTS, we suggest prescribing 20-30 mm Hg knee-length ECS to be worn daily. If ineffective, a stronger pressure stocking can be tried. We suggest that intermittent compression devices or pneumatic compression sleeve units be tried in patients with moderate-to-severe PTS whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with ECS alone. We suggest that a supervised exercise training program for 6 months or more is reasonable for PTS patients who can tolerate it.

Variant frequency and linkage disequilibrium varied among continents, especially in North America. Recombination between different strains was only observed in North American and European sequences. Additionally, we structurally modeled the two most common mutations D614G and P314L which suggested that these linked mutations may enhance viral entry and stability. Overall, we propose that COVID-19 virulence may be more severe in Europe and North America due to coinfection with different SARS-CoV-2 strains leading to genomic recombination which might be challenging for current treatment regimens and vaccine development.

Despite their importance, the population mutation properties of tumor evolution have not been well studied, especially in terms of overall genetic heterogeneity. The current study aims to examine factors in tumor evolution influencing overall genetic heterogeneity. Extensive simulations of the representative evolutionary patterns of various tumors were conducted in the current study to determine the overall genetic characteristics of tumor evolution. The variations in cell birth/death rates and angiogenesis duration were examined based on the simplest growth pattern of tumors with avascular growth, angiogenesis, and vascular growth. To examine the impact of evolutionary tree structure, three-step linear evolution and branching evolution were investigated based on various subpopulation initiation times. The population size during the initial growth phase and the duration of angiogenesis are important factors affecting overall genetic heterogeneity. Furthermore, the shape of the evolutionary tree is crucial for defining the genetic heterogeneity of the extant tumor cell population, indicating the importance of the initiation timing of subpopulations. Branching evolution results in slightly greater genetic heterogeneity in terms of allelic distribution than in terms of the number of variants.

For parents, having a hospitalized newborn can be a traumatic experience. In sub-Saharan Africa, there is limited literature about the parents experience in NCUs. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to explore the experience of parents in the NCU of a rural district hospital in Rwanda. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted with parents whose newborns were hospitalized in the Ruli District Hospital NCU from September 2018 to January 2019. Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured guide in the participants homes by trained data collectors. Data were transcribed, translated, and then coded using a structured code book. All data were organized using Dedoose software for analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one interviews were conducted primarily with mothers (90.5%, n = 19) among newborns who were most often discharged home alive (90.5%, n = 19). Four themes emerged from the interviews. These were the parental adaptation to having a sick neonate in NCU, adaptation to the NCU environment, interaction with people (healthcare providers and fellow parents) in the NCU, and financial stressors. CONCLUSION: The admission of a newborn to the NCU is a source of stress for parents and caregivers in rural Rwanda, however, there were several positive aspects which helped mothers adapt to the NCU. The experience in the NCU can be improved when healthcare providers communicate and explain the newborns status to the parents and actively involve them in the care of their newborn.

Conclusions Many training paradigms for promoting an accessible communicative environment are available in the speech-language pathology literature, yet institutional barriers exist for their widespread implementation. Overcoming these barriers is a challenge that requires awareness and learning on the part of staff and administration regarding the impact of an unfriendly communicative environment on social isolation, and the resulting psychosocial consequences.

The results showed that XRCC1 was recruited to the DNA damage with ultrafast kinetics in a poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) dependent manner. The consecutive reaction model well explained the response of XRCC1 at ion hits, and we found that the XRCC1 recruitment was faster and dissociation was slower in the G2 phase than those in the G1 phase. The fractionated irradiation of the same cells resulted in accelerated dissociation at the previous damage sites, while the dissociated XRCC1 immediately recycled with a higher recruitment efficiency.

We used a population-based design on all-cause mortality data, for the 7,904 Italian municipalities. We estimated sex-specific weekly mortality rates for each municipality, based on the first four months of 2016-2019, while adjusting for age, localised temporal trends and the effect of temperature. Then, we predicted all-cause weekly deaths and mortality rates at municipality level for the same period in 2020, based on the modelled spatio-temporal trends. Lombardia showed higher mortality rates than expected from the end of February, with 23,946 (23,013 to 24,786) total excess deaths. North-West and North-East regions showed one week lag, with higher mortality from the beginning of March and 6,942 (6,142 to 7,667) and 8,033 (7,061 to 9,044) total excess deaths respectively. We observed marked geographical differences also at municipality level. For males, the city of Bergamo (Lombardia) showed the largest percent excess, 88.9% (81.9% to 95.2%), at the peak of the pandemic. An excess of 84.2% (73.8% to 93.4%) was also estimated at the same time for males in the city of Pesaro (Central Italy), in stark contrast with the rest of the region, which does not show evidence of excess deaths. We provided a fully probabilistic analysis of excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic at sub-national level, suggesting a differential direct and indirect effect in space and time. Our model can be used to help policy-makers target measures locally to contain the burden on the health-care system as well as reducing social and economic consequences. Additionally, this framework can be used for real-time mortality surveillance, continuous monitoring of local temporal trends and to flag where and when mortality rates deviate from the expected range, which might suggest a second wave of the pandemic.","output":"Estimating weekly excess mortality at sub-national level in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Treatment for lower-grade gliomas (LGG) has been challenging.

The underlying TNF--inducing action of jasminin was also investigated in RAW264.7 cells. The level of endogenous TNF- stimulated by jasminin was first analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from the cell culture supernatant of RAW264.7 cells. The supernatants were then collected to investigate the potential antiviral effect against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). The antiviral effects of jasminin alone or its supernatants were evaluated by a plaque reduction assay. The potential activation of the PI3KCAkt pathway, three main mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and nuclear factor (NF)CB signaling pathways that induce TNF- production were also investigated. Jasminin induces TNF- protein expression in RAW264.7 cells without additional stimuli 10-fold more than the control. No significant up-expression of type I, II, and III interferons; interleukins 2 and 10; nor TNF- were observed by the jasminin stimuli. The supernatants, containing jasminin-induced-TNF-, showed antiviral activity against HSV-1. The jasminin-stimulated cells caused the simultaneous activation of the Akt, MAPKs, and NFCB signal pathways. Furthermore, the pretreatment of the cells with the Akt, MAPKs, and NFCB inhibitors effectively suppressed jasminin-induced TNF- production. Our research provides evidence that endogenous TNF- can be used as a strategy to encounter viral infections.

We aimed to investigate the odds of developing severe COVID-19 in health and shift workers. METHODS: We included UK Biobank participants in employment or self-employed at baseline (2006-2010) and with linked COVID-19 data to 31st August 2020. Participants were grouped as neither a health worker nor shift worker (reference category) at baseline, health worker only, shift worker only, or both, and associations with severe COVID-19 investigated in logistic regressions. RESULTS: Of 235,685 participants (815% neither health nor shift worker, 14% health worker only, 169% shift worker only, and 03% both), there were 580 (025%) cases of severe COVID-19. The odds of severe COVID-19 was higher in health workers (adjusted odds ratio: 232 [95% CI: 133, 405]; shift workers (206 [172, 247]); and in health workers who worked shifts (756 [386, 1479]). Being both a health worker and a shift worker had a possible greater impact on the odds of severe COVID-19 in South Asian and Black and African Caribbean ethnicities compared to White individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Both health and shift work (measured at baseline, 2006-2010) were independently associated with over twice the odds of severe COVID-19 in 2020; the odds were over seven times higher in health workers who work shifts.

Globally, the toll of confirmed cases has reached 182,641,391 people, where 3,955,679 cases were fatal with a fatality rate of 2.17% (from the virus outbreak until July 1, 2021). Considering the disease has not been under control yet and IT still significantly influences people's daily travel behavior worldwide, it is urgent to investigate as to what extent it changes people's travel habits. Therefore, we conducted a survey from April 24 to May 2, 2020, to obtain data on Taiwanese people's travel behavior before and after the outbreak of COVID-19. Two models, logistic regression and ordered logit models, were used. As for the models' performance, the estimated thresholds of the ordered logit model are significantly positive, and its coefficient is smaller than that of the logistic model, indicating that the estimated coefficients would be overestimated if the dependent variable is dichotomous. Hence, this study suggests that the influence of COVID-19 on travel behaviors in Taiwan can be explained by the ordered logit models. Several important conclusions are described as follows. First, people might significantly reduce travel activities related to social entertainment during the pandemic outbreak. Second, the total travel activities by private vehicles are significantly reduced, while there is no significant decrease in the use of transit. Finally, the important explanatory variables included the importance of the time to promote government policies (such as implementing the real-name registration system for mask purchases, publishing confirmed cases, and establishing the transit disinfection system), types and number of weekly activities, and storage of various types of consumer goods. The results of our study can serve as an important reference for accommodating similar scales of pandemics occurring in the future.

Little is known about this topic in Greece, which, although a traditionally conservative country, is changing at the legal level towards a greater recognition of transgender peoples rights. This study aimed to investigate transgender peoples attitudes towards having a child to whom they are genetically related and pursuing fertility treatments in Greece. METHODS: This is a prospective qualitative study conducted with adult individuals who identified as transgender men or transgender women between April 2019 and March 2020. Individual in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 participants. The interviews were carried out in person and were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. We performed a thematic analysis of the data. RESULTS: The thematic data analysis resulted in the identification of themes that represent key barriers to pursuing fertility preservation or the use of assisted reproductive technology. Six major themes were clearly present in the findings (lack of adequate information and counseling, worsening gender dysphoria, increased discrimination against transgender people due to the rise of extreme far-right populism, low parental self-efficacy, high costs, and a less-than-perfect legal framework). Moreover, diverse cases were examined, and minor themes, such as the symbolic value of the uterus and pregnancy, the relationship between the type of gender transition and willingness to pursue fertility treatments, and transgender peoples adherence to heteronormative patterns in the context of reproduction, were identified. Various reasons for transgender peoples differing degrees of desire for parenthood were identified. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated contextual factors as well as factors related to transgender people themselves as barriers to pursuing transgender parenthood. Most aspects of our findings are consistent with those of previous research. However, some aspects of our findings (regarding aggressive behaviors and economic instability) are specific to the context of Greece, which is characterized by the rise of extreme far-right populism due to the decade-long Greek economic crisis and a deeply conservative traditionalist background. In that regard, the participants highlighted the (perceived as) less-than-perfect Greek legislation on transgender peoples rights as a barrier to transgender (biological) parenthood.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the regulation of vascular function and assess the vascular redox balance in ACE2-deficient (ACE2(-/y)) animals. Experiments were performed in 20C22 week-old C57BL/6 and ACE2(-/y) male mice. Evaluation of endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation revealed an impairment of in vitro and in vivo vascular function in ACE2(-/y) mice. Drastic reduction in eNOS expression at both protein and mRNA levels, and a decrease in (?)NO concentrations were observed in aortas of ACE2(-/y) mice in comparison to controls. Consistently, these mice presented a lower plasma and urine nitrite concentration, confirming reduced (?)NO availability in ACE2-deficient animals. Lipid peroxidation was significantly increased and superoxide dismutase activity was decreased in aorta homogenates of ACE2(-/y) mice, indicating impaired antioxidant capacity.

In this work, we evaluate whether disruptions related to Covid-19 have affected new and existing patients access to pharmacological therapies without interruption. We do so by performing a retrospective analysis on a dataset of 9.4 billion US prescription drug claims from 252 million patients from May, 2019 through August, 2020 (about 93% of prescriptions dispensed within those months). Using fixed effect (conditional likelihood) linear models, we evaluate continuity of care, how many days of supply patients received, and the likelihood of discontinuing therapy for drugs from classes with significant population health impacts. Findings indicate that more prescriptions were filled in March 2020 than in any prior month, followed by a significant drop in monthly dispensing. Compared to the pre-Covid era, a patients likelihood of discontinuing some medications increased after the spread of Covid: norgestrel-ethinyl estradiol (hormonal contraceptive) discontinuation increased 0.62% (95% CI: 0.59% to 0.65%, p<0.001); dexmethylphenidate HCL (ADHD stimulant treatment) discontinuation increased 2.84% (95% CI: 2.79% to 2.89%, p<0.001); escitalopram oxalate (SSRI antidepressant) discontinuation increased 0.57% (95% CI: 0.561% to 0.578%, p<0.001); and haloperidol (antipsychotic) discontinuation increased 1.49% (95% CI: 1.41% to 1.57%, p<0.001). In contrast, the likelihood of discontinuing tacrolimus (immunosuppressant) decreased 0.15% (95% CI: 0.12% to 0.19%, p<0.001). The likelihood of discontinuing buprenorphine/naloxone (opioid addiction therapy) decreased 0.59% (95% CI: 0.55% to 0.62% decrease, p<0.001). We also observe a notable decline in new patients accessing these latter two therapies. Most US patients were able to access chronic medications during the early months of Covid-19, but still were more likely to discontinue their therapies than in previous months. Further, fewer than normal new patients started taking medications that may be vital to their care. Providers would do well to inquire about adherence and provide prompt, nonjudgmental, re-initiation of medications.

After reviewing the titles and abstracts for inclusion, some irrelevant papers were excluded. Additional relevant articles were identified from a review of citations referenced. KEY FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2, directly and indirectly, affects the immune system and avoids being eliminated in early stages. On the other hand, the secretion of inflammatory cytokines creates critical conditions that lead to multi-organ failure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data covering the period between January 1, 2020 and June 4, 2020 were extracted from The National Health Insurance Service-COVID-19 (NHIS-COVID-19) database in South Korea and analyzed as a population-based cohort study. RESULTS: A total of 101657 hypertensive adults aged 20 years or older were included for final analysis. Among them, 1889 patients (1.9%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and June 4, 2020, and hospital mortality occurred in 193 patients (10.2%). In a multivariable model, the use of beta-blockers was associated with an 18% lower incidence of COVID-19 [odds ratio (OR): 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69-0.98; p=0.029]. Among 1889 hypertensive patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the use of a calcium channel blocker (CCB) was associated with a 42% lower hospital mortality rate (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.38-0.89; p=0.012). The use of other cardiovascular drugs was not associated with the incidence of COVID-19 or hospital mortality rate among COVID-19 patients. Similar results were observed in all 328374 adults in the NHIS-COVID-19 database, irrespective of the presence of hypertension. CONCLUSION: In South Korea, beta-blockers exhibited potential benefits in lowering the incidence of COVID-19 among hypertensive patients. Furthermore, CCBs may lower the hospital mortality rate among hypertensive COVID-19 patients.

No precise way, however, is currently available to predict its occurrence. We and others have demonstrated that microparticles (MPs) can induce ALI and were increased in patients with ALI. However, whether MPs can be used to predict ALI after cardiac surgery with CPB remains unknown. METHODS: In this prospective study, 103 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB and 53 healthy subjects were enrolled. MPs were isolated from the plasma before, 12 h after, and 3 d after surgery. The size distributions of MPs were measured by the LitesizerTM 500 Particle Analyzer. The patients were divided into two subgroups (ALI and non-ALI) according to the diagnosis of ALI. Descriptive and correlational analyzes were conducted between the size distribution of MPs and clinical data. RESULTS: Compared to the non-ALI group, the size at peak and interquartile range (IQR) of MPs in patients with ALI were smaller, but the peak intensity of MPs is higher. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the size at peak of MPs at postoperative 12 h was an independent risk factor for ALI. The area under the curve (AUC) of peak diameter at postoperative 12 h was 0.803. The best cutoff value of peak diameter to diagnose ALI was 223.05 nm with a sensitivity of 88.0% and a negative predictive value of 94.5%. The AUC of IQR at postoperative 12 h was 0.717. The best cutoff value of IQR to diagnose ALI was 132.65 nm with a sensitivity of 88.0% and a negative predictive value of 92.5%. Combining these two parameters, the sensitivity reached 92% and the negative predictive value was 96%.

As our tertiary-care medical center's screening program provides SM at four sites across our metropolitan area, we examined whether sites that historically served more patients from more disadvantaged areas returned slower to pre-COVID volumes. Methods: Patient records were linked by ZIP code of residence to ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)-level area-based social metrics (ABSMs) from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey. We compared baseline pre-COVID (MayOctober, 2015-2019) SM population ABSMs between our four imaging sites for: % persons below poverty ( vs < 10%), % persons of color (POC) (quintiles: top 2 vs bottom 3), index of racialized economic segregation (quintiles: bottom 2 [more POC low-income households] vs top 3 [more white non-Hispanic (WNH) highincome households]);and race/ethnicity (% WNH vs POC). We modeled weekly SM volumes per screening day by site using Poisson regression and tested for weekly differences at each site, COVID-era (May-October 2020) vs preCOVID;and tested for monthly differences in SM population composition by logistic regression modeling. Results: There were 89,082 pre-COVID and 16,220 COVID-era SM exams. At pre-COVID baselines the four sites differed in population composition by ABSMs and race/ethnicity (all chi-square P values <.001) (Table). The two sites that served more disadvantaged populations (A, B) returned slower to pre-COVID volumes (site-specific weekly screening volume no longer different [P >.05] vs pre-COVID) (Table). As a result, compositions of the aggregate SM population across all sites showed a smaller proportion of patients from the most disadvantaged ZCTAs by ABSMs (all P values <.001) before returning to pre-COVID compositions three months after SM resumption. Conclusions: SM was slower to return to pre-COVID volumes at imaging sites that historically served lower-income communities of color. As a result, our COVIDera SM population skewed away from patients in disadvantaged ZCTAs. Our findings highlight the need to monitor for emergent disparities in the pandemic era. Future work will focus on understanding causes of inequitable SM engagement across our imaging sites to mitigate care disparities for our most vulnerable patients.

OBJECTIVE: This article elucidates the mechanisms, the evidence of expected effects, contraindications and possible adverse effects of vaccinations in pregnancy. METHOD: A selective literature search was carried out with particular attention to the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Vaccinations of the Robert Koch Institute (STIKO) and the pertinent guidelines. RESULTS: Vaccinations during pregnancy protect expectant mothers from a severe course of a number of different infectious diseases and therefore the associated pregnancy complications. Moreover, neonates are given passive immune protection against life-threatening infections by the vertical transmission of maternal antibodies. The efficacy and safety of vaccination in pregnancy is well-established for inactivated vaccines against tetanus, influenza and pertussis; vaccinations with live-attenuated vaccines are contraindicated due to a theoretical risk for the fetus. Currently available data on the deployment of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) are still limited. CONCLUSION: The goals of vaccination during pregnancy are to directly protect pregnant women by active immunization and/or the child by natural passive immunization. Pregnant women should not be excluded from an indicated vaccination for their own protection and that of the child. Additional reasonable measures to protect the health of mother and child include the vaccination of other persons in close contact as well as the closure of relevant vaccination gaps among young adults, particularly for women of childbearing age.","output":"Impfen in der Schwangerschaft"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), many studies have been published to determine the spectrum of illness, risk factors, prevention, and treatment strategies.

While efforts continue in studying the large scale dissemination of contagious diseases, individual-based activity and behaviour study benefits not only disease transmission modelling but also the control, containment, and prevention decision making at the local scale. The potential for using tracking technologies to capture detailed space-time trajectories and model individual behaviour is increasing rapidly, as technological advances enable the manufacture of small, lightweight, highly sensitive, and affordable receivers and the routine use of location-aware devices has become widespread (e.g., smart cellular phones). The use of low-cost tracking devices in medical research has also been proved effective by more and more studies. This study describes the use of tracking devices to collect data of space-time trajectories and the spatiotemporal processing of such data to facilitate micro-scale flu transmission study. We also reports preliminary findings on activity patterns related to chances of influenza infection in a pilot study. METHODS: Specifically, this study employed A-GPS tracking devices to collect data on a university campus. Spatiotemporal processing was conducted for data cleaning and segmentation. Processed data was validated with traditional activity diaries. The A-GPS data set was then used for visual explorations including density surface visualization and connection analysis to examine space-time activity patterns in relation to chances of influenza infection.

Methods: We proposed a simple time alignment approach based on the direct cross-correlation of temporal amplitudes, making it agnostic and thus generalizable to different signal types. The approach was tested on a public electrocardiographic (ECG) dataset to simulate the synchronization of signals collected from an ECG watch and an ECG patch. The algorithm was evaluated considering key practical factors, including sample durations, signal quality index (SQI), resilience to noise, and varying sampling rates. Results: The proposed approach requires a short sample duration (30 s) to operate, and demonstrates stable performance across varying sampling rates and resilience to common noise. The lowest synchronization delay achieved by the algorithm is 0.13 s with the integration of SQI thresholding.

Among the major groups of viruses, RNA viruses contribute significantly to the global mortality and morbidity index associated with viral infection. Despite multiple routes of entry adopted by these viruses, facing complement is inevitable. The initial interaction with complement and the nature of this interaction play an important role in determining host resistance versus susceptibility to the viral infection. Many RNA viruses are potent activators of complement, often resulting in virus neutralization. Yet, another facet of virus-induced activation is the exacerbation in pathogenesis contributing to the overall morbidity. The severity in disease and death associated with RNA virus infections shows a tip in the scale favoring viruses. Growing evidence suggest that like their DNA counterparts, RNA viruses have co-evolved to master ingenious strategies to remarkably restrict complement. Modulation of host genes involved in antiviral responses contributed prominently to the adoption of unique strategies to keep complement at bay, which included either down regulation of activation components (C3, C4) or up regulation of complement regulatory proteins.

This work presents the design, implementation and performance analysis of a system for recognizing the use of masks from image sequences, with the ability to operate in real time. Based on a generic object detection network, a training scheme is proposed for a detector of faces with masks and faces without masks, wherewith an average detection accuracy higher than 90% is obtained. This accuracy can be improved by using a network with a greater number of parameters, but with a longer computation time.

While debate still persists over the role of these novel products, they are now in widespread use. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and methods of attempts to quit EC and HTP. SETTING: We analysed the 2020 Eurobarometer survey, which collected data in 28 European countries. PARTICIPANTS: A representative sample of individuals residing in these countries aged 15 years. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Multilevel regression analyses were performed to assess differences in quit attempts and cessation methods among tobacco smokers and exclusive EC/HTP users separately. RESULTS: 51.1% of current tobacco smokers and 27.1% of exclusive EC or HTP users reported having ever made a quit attempt. The majority of former and current smokers (75.8%) who made a quit attempt did so unassisted, with 28.8% reporting at least one attempt using a cessation aid. The most popular cessation aids were nicotine replacement therapy or other medication (13.4%) and ECs (11.3%). 58.8% of exclusive EC or HTP users who had made a quit attempt did so unassisted, with 39.5% reporting the use of a cessation aid. CONCLUSION: Most EC and HTP users in Europe try to quit unassisted, although more of them report the use of a cessation aid compared with tobacco smokers.

METHODS We did a prospective multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial on LH capsule in confirmed cases with Covid-19. Patients were randomized to receive usual treatment alone or in combination with LH capsules (4 capsules, thrice daily) for 14 days. The primary endpoint was the rate of symptom (fever, fatigue, coughing) recovery. RESULTS We included 284 patients (142 each in treatment and control group) in the full-analysis set. The recovery rate was significantly higher in treatment group as compared with control group (91.5% vs. 82.4%, p = 0.022). The median time to symptom recovery was markedly shorter in treatment group (median: 7 vs. 10 days, p < 0.001). Time to recovery of fever (2 vs. 3 days), fatigue (3 vs. 6 days) and coughing (7 vs. 10 days) was also significantly shorter in treatment group (all p < 0.001).

New pedagogical methods, including augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), are on the rise as alternatives to traditional teaching methods. While AR enhances real world experiences by overlaying information, VR immerses users in a computerized world rather than enhancing reality. It is crucial to understand the limitations of these learning modalities and that at best these approaches should be used to supplement and not replace traditional medical education. Objectives This study is part of a larger project that investigates the advantages and disadvantages of AR/VR in medical education. This portion of the study focused on the limitations of AR/VR and the parameters that we explored are professional and interpersonal skill development, visual haptic training, problem solving skills, physician-patient relationship, technological limitations, and financial challenges. Methods This study is a part of a systematic review of the literature seeking to identify the strengths and weaknesses associated with application of AR/VR to medical education. In this portion of the larger study we outline the limitations of AR/VR in medical education. Results Our research indicates that AR/VR may not provide the same learning experience with regards to professional and interpersonal skill development. In person anatomy learning provides an immersive visuohaptic training experience, which has been shown to promote better recall results in comparison to visual or haptic training alone. Current VR headsets have struggles with regards to video quality and latency, which can cause a sensory mismatch called cybersickness. With the high cost of medical education, AR/VR may bring additional financial burdens for students. A study showed one simulation session totaled nearly $107,000. Conclusion Virtual and augmented reality are rapidly being adopted in many academic fields, and while it is certain that tools using these modalities will be used in medical programs, it is important to understand the limitations that these learning tools pose. VR and AR learning environments can be incredibly fruitful, but in their still-nascent state these technologies are best used as a supplementation to well-vetted existing educational approaches rather than a replacement.","output":"Limitations of Visualization Technology and Virtual Instruction in Medical Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2) continues to pose international public health threat and thus far, has resulted in greater than 5.6 million deaths worldwide. Vaccines are critical tools to limit COVID-19 spread, but antiviral drug development is an ongoing global priority due to fast spreading COVID-19 variants that may elude vaccines efficacies. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 is an essential enzyme of viral replication and transcription machinery complex. Therefore, the RdRp is an attractive target for the development of effective anti-COVID-19 therapeutics. In this study, we developed a cell-based assay to determine the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp through luciferase reporter system. The SARS-CoV-2 RdRp reporter assay was validated using a known inhibitors of RdRp polymerase, remdesivir along with other anti-virals including ribavirin, penciclovir, rhoifolin, 5CT, and dasabuvir. Among these inhibitors, dasabuvir (FDA-approved drug) exhibited promising RdRp inhibitory activity. Anti-viral activity of dasabuvir was also tested on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 through infection of Vero E6 cells. Dasabuvir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2, USA-WA1/2020 as well as B.1.617.2 (delta variant) in Vero E6 cells in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values 9.47 M and 10.48 M, for USA-WA1/2020 and B.1.617.2 variants, respectively). Our results suggests that dasabuvir can be further evaluated as a therapeutic drug for COVID-19. In addition, our assays provide robust, target-specific, and high-throughput screening compatible (z- and z-factors of > 0.5) platforms that will be a valuable tool for the screening SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitors. SignificanceSARS-CoV-2 has caused a major public crisis world has seen in recent history. Development of vaccines and emergency use authorization of anti-virals are helping in reducing the burden of SARS-CoV-2 caused hospitalization and deaths. However, there is still need for optimal anti-viral(s) that can efficiently block viral propagation, and targeting viral polymerase (RdRp) is an among the most suitable targets for clamping viral replication. In this study, we developed a cell-based assay to screen potential compounds capable of blocking RdRp activity. The efficacy of our assay was validated by using already approved anti-virals, which reduced RdRp activity and slowed the replication of two SARS-CoV-2 variants (WA1 USA-WA1/2020 and B.1.617.2) in a cell culture model. This confirmed that our system can be used for identifying potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-virals.","output":"Screening of SARS-CoV-2 Antivirals Through a Cell-Based RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) Reporter Assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: In this paper, researcher describe how the educational innovations and creativity affects the efficiency and performance of the Universities in South Africa in their bid to cope with challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic since the beginning of the 2020 academic year.

Here, this work demonstrated the rapid thermal response behaviour of CNT fibers fabricated by floating catalyst CVD method, which was measured by an in-situ technique based on the CNT film electric heater with excellent electrothermal response properties. The temperature dependences of resistance and structure were both explored. Experimental investigation indicates that the reduction in the inter-CNT interspace in the fibers caused by thermally driven actuation was dominantly responsible for the decrease of the fibers resistance during the heating process. Especially, the heated fibers showed 7.2% decrease in electrical resistance at the applied square-wave voltage of 8 V, and good temperature sensitivity (-0.15% C-1). The as-prepared CNT fibers also featured a rapid and reversible electrical resistance response behaviour when exposed to external heating stimulation. Additionally, with the increment of temperature and twist-degree, the generated contraction actuation increased, which endowed the CNT fibers with more decrease in electrical resistance. These observations further suggested that the temperature-dependent conduction behavior of the CNT fibers with a high reversibility and repeatability was strongly correlated with their structure response to heat stimulation. As a consequence, the temperature-conduction behavior described here may be applied in other CNT-structured fibers and facilitated the improvement in their temperature-sensing applications.","output":"Temperature-dependent resistance of carbon nanotube fibers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The continuous rise of antimicrobial resistance urgently demands new therapeutic agents for human health.

The objective of the present study was to compare the perception of safety culture and intention to comply with infection control guidelines in professionals who were required by their supervisors to take the course, and those who did so voluntarily. METHODS Survey responses on learning environment, safety climate and intention to comply with infection control guidelines in health care professionals who were required to take the course (supervisor-required group [n=143]) and those who took the same course voluntarily (voluntary group [n=105]) were compared.

Some of these shifts have called into question the role of physical places for face-to-face gatherings, including those used by LGBTQ+ people. Such open questions are a key concern for a book on gayborhoods, so this chapter engages in three analytic tasks to provide preliminary reflections on how pandemics problematize places. While acknowledging a range of threats and challenges that the pandemic poses to the future of LGBTQ+ spaces, this chapter focuses on the potential opportunities and unexpected benefits that COVID-19 can create, running counter to more pessimistic predictions that abound in popular discourse. First, the chapter contextualizes how the COVID-19 pandemic is reminiscent of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, allowing the gayborhood to be well-equipped to respond with grassroots activism, particularly in the face of government inaction or apathy. Second, the chapter explores trends that can ensure the future vitality of LGBTQ+ spaces, including (i) the potential of mutual aid networks, (ii) the power of institutional anchors in LGBTQ+ placemaking efforts, (iii) urban changes related to homesteading and population shifts, (iv) innovations in the interior design of physical spaces, and (v) opportunities to enhance social connections through augmented virtual engagements. Far from signaling the death knell of LGBTQ+ spaces, these trends demonstrate the enduring appeal provided by neighborhoods and communities. Third, the cognitive schemas of lockdowns, re-closeting, and digitalscapes are identified as unique expressions of the shifting spatialities of sexuality in post-pandemic urban space. The chapter concludes by arguing that place will still matter for LGBTQ+ people in a post-COVID-19 era, albeit with altered meanings and material expressions.

In this study of recipients of allogeneic (Allo) and autologous (Auto) hematopoietic cell transplant and CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we aimed to identify clinical variables associated with COVID-19 severity and assess lymphocyte populations. METHODS We retrospectively investigated patients diagnosed between March 15th and May 7th, 2020. In a subset of patients, lymphocyte immunophenotyping, quantitative real-time PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody status were available. RESULTS We identified 77 SARS-CoV-2 + cellular therapy recipients (Allo = 35, Auto = 37, CAR-T = 5; median time from cellular therapy 782 days (IQR 354,1611). Overall survival at 30 days was 78%. Clinical variables significantly associated with the composite endpoint of non-rebreather or higher oxygen requirement and death (n events = 25/77) included number of co-morbidities (HR 5.41, P = 0.004), infiltrates (HR 3.08, P = 0.032), and neutropenia (HR 1.15, P = 0.04). Worsening graft-versus-host-disease was not identified among Allo subjects. Immune profiling revealed reductions and rapid recovery in lymphocyte populations across lymphocyte subsets. Antibody responses were seen in a subset of patients. CONCLUSION In this series of Allo, Auto, and CAR-T recipients, we report overall favorable clinical outcomes for COVID-19 patients without active malignancy and provide preliminary insights into the lymphocyte populations that are key for the anti-viral response and immune reconstitution.

To contain it, preventive measures including social distancing, economic shutdown, and school closures were introduced, carrying the risk of mental health burden in adults and children. Although the knowledge base regarding children's response to trauma and adverse events in general has broadened, descriptions of their mental health during epidemics remain scarce. In particular, the role of family socioeconomic characteristics and parental mental health are poorly understood. METHODS: We assessed the correlates of children's emotional difficulties and symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention during the COVID-19 lockdown in a French community-based sample. Data came from 432 community-based parents (27-46 years, TEMPO cohort) and their children (mean age 6.8  4.1) interviewed online. Children's symptoms of emotional difficulties and hyperactivity/inattention were assessed using the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire during the 5th week of home confinement. Family socioeconomic characteristics and parental mental health and substance use were assessed weekly during the first 5 weeks of home confinement. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: 7.1% of children presented symptoms of emotional difficulties and 24.7% symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention. Family financial difficulties and parental symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as children's sleeping difficulties and screen time, were associated with the presence of psychological difficulties.

Currently used methods of repair have high recurrence rates and considerable risk for complications. We have developed a new technique for parastomal hernia repair that uses full-thickness skin graft as reinforcement. METHODS: This study protocol describes a multicentre randomised controlled trial on parastomal hernia repair comparing a new full-thickness skin graft technique with conventional synthetic composite mesh as reinforcement of the abdominal wall. Patients with a symptomatic parastomal hernia will be included and followed up at 3, 12 and 36 months, with surgical complication as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will be recurrence rate and health-related quality of life assessed with VHPQ, EORTC C30 and CR29. Tissue biology and collagen metabolism will be investigated pre- and postoperatively using biopsies of the abdominal wall fascia and blood samples. DISCUSSION: Parastomal hernia constitutes a major clinical problem where the prospects of a good result after hernia repair are presently poor. This new method of repair with full-thickness skin grafting could be a new alternative in our surgical toolbox, but before then, it must be evaluated properly.

We suggest performing PET/CT at least two weeks after vaccination in patients with a cancer for which interpretation is anticipated to be potentially impacted by the vaccination, though optimally 4-6 weeks after vaccination given increased immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines and potentially longer time for resolution than lymphadenopathy after other vaccines. PET/CT should not be delayed when clinically indicated to be performed sooner. Details regarding vaccination should be collected at the time of PET/CT to facilitate interpretation. Follow-up recommendations for post-vaccination lymphadenopathy are provided, considering the lymph node's morphology and likely clinical relevance. Consideration should also be given to administering the vaccine in the arm contralateral to a unilateral cancer to avoid potentially confounding FDG uptake on the side of cancer.

Negative affect was assessed during baseline, induction, and recovery. Blood pressure was assessed continuously using a finger cuff. RESULTS: Both the lonely and non-lonely stress conditions reported increased negative affect following the induction, with neither condition having fully recovered to baseline levels by the end of the study. For blood pressure, during recovery, blood pressure increased linearly for the lonely stress condition, but remained steady for the other conditions.

DATA SOURCES: ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for COVID-19 and related terms to identify trials registered between 1 December 2019 and 1 May 2020 that test interventions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We classified trials according to intervention type, and report key trial characteristics including recruitment status, location, funder type, target enrolment number, intervention model (single group, randomised or sequential assignment) and projected completion date. RESULTS: Of the 630 identified clinical trials related to COVID-19, 509 (81%) involved the study of drugs or biological agents. Of these trials of drugs and biologics, 305 (60%) use an open-label design, 43 (8%) are single blinded (participant only) and 161 (32%) are double blinded (participant and investigator). 94 (18%) of the drug/biological trials are non-randomised. Either hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is administered as part of the study protocol in 152 (30%) of the drug/biological trials. The total planned enrolment for these hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine trials is over 200 000 participants, which represents 65% of the total planned enrolment for all registered trials of drugs or biologics.

As the clinical utility of current therapies is limited, new anti-HBV agents and sources for such agents are still highly sought after. Here, we report that Mucroporin-M1, a scorpion venom-derived peptide, reduces the amount of extracellular HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA productions of HepG2.2.15 cells in a dose-dependent manner and inhibits HBV capsid DNA, HBV intracellular RNA replication intermediates and the HBV Core protein in the cytoplasm of HepG2.2.15 cells. Using a mouse model of HBV infection, we found that HBV replication was significantly inhibited by intravenous injection of the Mucroporin-M1 peptide. This inhibitory activity was due to a reduction in HBV promoter activity caused by a decrease in the binding of HNF4 to the precore/core promoter region. Furthermore, we confirmed that Mucroporin-M1 could selectively activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and lead to the down-regulation of HNF4 expression, which explains the decreased binding of HNF4 to the HBV promoter. Moreover, when the protein phosphorylation activity of the MAPK pathway was inhibited, both HNF4 expression and HBV replication recovered.

The use of this technology is resource-intensive and limited in its implementation. In this descriptive pilot study, we report neurophysiological patterns and the potential prognostic capability of an abbreviated frontal EEG electrode montage in critically ill COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients receiving mechanical ventilation for SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure were monitored with Sedline Root Devices using EEG electrodes were placed over the forehead. Qualitative EEG assessments were conducted daily. The primary outcome was mortality, and secondary outcomes were duration of endotracheal intubation and lengths of intensive care and hospitalization stay. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were included in the study, and EEG discontinuity was identified in 22 (84.6%) patients. The limited sample size and patient heterogeneity precluded statistical analysis, but certain patterns were suggested by trends in the data. Survival was 100% (4/4) for those patients in which a discontinuous EEG pattern was not observed. The majority of patients (87.5%, 7/8) demonstrating activity in the low-moderate frequency range (7 to 17 Hz) survived compared with 61.1% (11/18) of those without this observation. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of COVID-19 patients showed signs of EEG discontinuity during monitoring with an abbreviated electrode montage. The trends towards worse survival among those with EEG discontinuity support the need for additional studies to investigate these associations in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Frontal Electroencephalography Findings in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Executive Summary: \\"The COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] outbreak posed and continues to pose significant challenges for emergency services and public authorities Whilst emergency services call centres have remarked changes in the volume of emergency calls during this period, the pandemic has also considerably impacted helplines for mental health and domestic violence \\"","output":"COVID-19 Impact on Mental Health and Domestic Abuse Helplines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Covid-19 has forced many institutions into rapid adoption of eLearning, but course designers who are used to live classrooms are often unsure how to design for virtual ones.

Various safety tests are conducted to confirm accurate needle tip positioning into the abdominal cavity. However, these occasionally yield unclear results and do not help directly visualize the peritoneum puncture. We validated a negative pressure-based technique that helps instantly visualize the moment of the Veress needle entry into the abdominal cavity. METHODS This study included 761 patients who underwent laparoscopic hernioplasty between 2003 and 2021 that entailed pneumoperitoneum creation using a Veress needle. They were divided into conventional technique (CON) and negative pressure visualization technique (NPV) groups. The patients were propensity score-matched (1:1) to minimize selection bias. To determine whether the technique gave a clear result to the surgeon and precisely informed the moment of entry, failed entry and emphysematous complications were compared between the groups. RESULTS The propensity score-matching yielded 105 pairs in the matched CON and NPV groups. Failed entry did not occur in the NPV group, whereas it occurred in 8 patients (7.6%) in the CON group (p = 0.004). No patient experienced extraperitoneal emphysema in the matched NPV group, whereas 7 patients (6.7%) in the CON group did (p = 0.007). The groups did not differ in the incidence of omental or mesenteric emphysema. CONCLUSION The NPV eliminated the incidence of failed entry and decreased the incidence of extraperitoneal emphysema, indicating that it could simply and adequately inform the moment of needle entry into the abdominal cavity.","output":"A negative pressure-based visualization technique for abdominal Veress needle insertion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, interest in the unique pathways linking discrete positive emotions to specific health outcomes has gained increasing attention, but the role of awe is yet to be elucidated.

Many studies have indicated that the current BMI cutoff value for obesity may be inaccurate in identifying individuals with excess body fat (BF) and at risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This study aims to assess the performance of BMI in diagnosing obesity defined by BF percentage (BF%). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 136 participants who attended an annual health screening programme were recruited. The subjects completed the health examinations, including BMI, BF% and blood pressure measurement. A receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was conducted to determine the optimal cutoff value of BMI in classifying obesity based on BF% (>25%). RESULTS: The ROC analysis revealed that the optimal BMI cutoff value in classifying subjects with obesity based on BF% was 24.8 kg/m(2). The agreement between the classification scheme based on the new BMI cutoff (>24.8 kg/m(2)) and BF% was higher (=0.722) compared to the standard BMI cutoff (>27.5 kg/m(2)) (=0.532). BMI 24.8 kg/m(2) also had higher sensitivity (80.0%) than 27.5 kg/m(2) (56.0%) in detecting subjects with high adiposity. The new BMI cutoff also showed a sensitivity of 63.9% in identifying subjects with hypertension compared to the standard cutoff (36.1%). CONCLUSION: The current definition of obesity based on BMI value needs to be reassessed by taking BF% into account. A new BMI cutoff point, 24.8 kg/m(2) for obesity, can identify a higher percentage of Malaysian at risk for CVD.","output":"Performance of Body Mass Index in Identifying Obesity Defined by Body Fat Percentage and Hypertension Among Malaysian Population: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To clarify the molecular basis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) adaptation to different host species, we serially passaged SARS-CoV in rat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-expressing cells.

Here we are describing our results and experience of VSD closure via anterolateral thoracotomy approach. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate early outcomes of VSD repair via anterolateral thoracotomy with central cannulation. METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational, descriptive type of study. Fifty four patients (31 males, 23 females) underwent VSD repair from November 2016 to November 2018 via anterolateral thoracotomy with age ranges from 3 to 22 years (mean age 10.57 + 8.88 years). Mean body weight was 22.29 + 13.44 kg (range 10 to 48 kg). The VSD was perimembranous in 47 patients, subpulmonic in 2, muscular in 2, and inlet in 3 patients. RESULTS: There was no operative or late mortality. The mean incision length was 7.16  02.08 cm (range, 5 cm to 9 cm). Average duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was 61.72  14.20 min (range, 48C78 min), and aortic cross-clamp time was 38.51  13.08 min (range, 26C56 min).

Using a content analysis approach, nine experts participated in semistructured, in-depth interviews. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and analyzed using Lundman and Graneheim's method. The social impacts of COVID-19 can be summarized into six categories and 32 subcategories. Three positive-negative categories emerged from the data analysis: formation of new patterns of social communications; formation of new patterns of behavior; creation of economic changes. Three entirely negative categories included creating a climate of distrust; disruption of cultural, social, and religious values; psychosocial disorders. Overall, most findings (27 out of 32 subcategories) indicated the destructive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on social capital.

We have used a recombinant retroviral expression vector encoding anglerfish prepro-SRIF-I to infect rat pituitary GH(3) cells. The aim of these studies was to investigate the intracellular storage and secretion of the total pool of endogenous GH compared to that of SRIF. Several clonal lines of GH(3) cells expressing high or low levels of SRIF were treated with TRH, forskolin, or depolarizing concentrations of potassium, and the levels of intracellular and secreted GH or SRIF were determined using highly sensitive RIAs. Approximately 65% of the total GH was secreted basally, whereas less than 20% of the SRIF-immunoreactive material was basally secreted. Forskolin treatment or potassium depolarization stimulated GH release, but only about 50% above basal levels. In contrast, SRIF secretion was stimulated approximately 5-fold in response to these secretagogues. Based on its lower basal rate of secretion compared to GH and its enhanced release in response to a variety of secretagogues, we conclude that the heterologously expressed SRIF is preferentially targeted to the regulated pathway in GH(3) cells.","output":"Retrovirus-Mediated Expression of Preprosomatostatin in Rat Pituitary GH(3) Cells: Targeting of Somatostatin to the Regulated Secretory Pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Rapid, robust and continually updated evidence synthesis is required to inform management of COVID-19 in pregnant and postpartum women and to keep pace with the emerging evidence during the pandemic.

Governments and key institutions have had to implement decisive responses to the danger posed by the coronavirus pandemic. Imposed change will increase the likelihood that alternative explanations take hold. In a proportion of the general population there may be strong scepticism, fear of being misled, and false conspiracy theories. Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of conspiracy thinking about the pandemic and test associations with reduced adherence to government guidelines. METHODS: A non-probability online survey with 2501 adults in England, quota sampled to match the population for age, gender, income, and region. RESULTS: Approximately 50% of this population showed little evidence of conspiracy thinking, 25% showed a degree of endorsement, 15% showed a consistent pattern of endorsement, and 10% had very high levels of endorsement. Higher levels of coronavirus conspiracy thinking were associated with less adherence to all government guidelines and less willingness to take diagnostic or antibody tests or to be vaccinated. Such ideas were also associated with paranoia, general vaccination conspiracy beliefs, climate change conspiracy belief, a conspiracy mentality, and distrust in institutions and professions. Holding coronavirus conspiracy beliefs was also associated with being more likely to share opinions. CONCLUSIONS: In England there is appreciable endorsement of conspiracy beliefs about coronavirus.

FACT complex is profoundly regulated, and contributes to both gene activation and suppression. Here we reported that SUPT16H, a subunit of FACT, is acetylated at lysine 674 (K674) of middle domain (MD), which involves TIP60 histone acetyltransferase. Such acetylation of SUPT16H is recognized by bromodomain protein BRD4, which promotes protein stability of SUPT16H. We further demonstrated that SUPT16H-BRD4 associates with histone modification enzymes (EZH2, HDAC1) and affects histone marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H3ac). BRD4 is known to profoundly regulate interferon (IFN) signaling, while such function of SUPT16H has never been explored. Surprisingly, our results revealed that SUPT16H genetic knockdown via RNAi or pharmacological inhibition by using its inhibitor, curaxin 137 (CBL0137), results in the induction of IFNs and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Through this mechanism, CBL0137 is shown to efficiently inhibit infection of multiple viruses, including Zika, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CBL0137 also causes the remarkable activation of IFN signaling in natural killer (NK) cells, which promotes the NK-mediated killing of virus-infected cells in a co-culture system using human primary NK cells. Overall, our studies unraveled the previously un-appreciated role of FACT complex in regulating IFN signaling in both epithelial and NK cells, and also proposed the novel application of CBL0137 to treat viral infections.","output":"FACT subunit SUPT16H associates with BRD4 and contributes to silencing of antiviral interferon signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cardiac rehab nurse calls out each of our group's blood pressures and pulse rates.

Mismanagement of wastes that may lead to contamination and degradation of the recyclate feedstock constitutes one of the main barriers in the pathway to a circular economy. The sector has also repeatedly called upon manufacturers to collaborate in designing materials, components and products (MCPs) with properties that aid recovery, refurbishing, repair and recycling (e.g. separabilty of materials, clear labelling), as waste managers recognise the value of early engagement well before MCPs enter the supply chain (i.e. before MCPs are produced and distributed to the end user). Nonetheless, progress has been slow with regard to improved design for promoting components and products longevity and segregation at source when they reach their end-of-use or end-of-life stage in order to promote circularity. China's ban on imports of low quality recyclates at the end of 2017 marked the beginning of a new era in waste management. It drew attention to UK's dependence on export of low-value secondary resources, placing 'quality' in the spotlight. This article delves into the notion of quality; how quality is understood and assessed at different parts of the MCPs lifecycle, and how it might be systematically measured.

Combining big data from Baidu Population Migration with traditional meteorological data and census data for over 200 Chinese cities, we utilize an advanced quantitative approach, namely synthetic control modeling, to produce a counterfactual synthetic Hong Kong without a strict border restriction policy. We then simulate infection trends under the hypothetical scenarios and compare them to actual infection numbers. Our counterfactual synthetic control model demonstrates a lower number of COVID-19 infections than the actual scenario, where strict border restrictions with mainland China were implemented from February 8 to March 6, 2020. Moreover, the second synthetic control model, which assumes a border reopen on 7 May 2020 demonstrates nonpositive effects of extending the border restriction policy on preventing and controlling infections. We conclude that the border restriction policy and its further extension may not be useful in containing the spread of COVID-19 when the virus is already circulating in the local community.

To meet this challenge, new classes of antimicrobial agents and the redesign of existing ones will be required. This review summarizes some of the studies that have been carried out in my own laboratories involving membrane-disrupting agents. A major discovery that we made, using a Triton X-100 as a prototypical membrane-disrupting molecule and cholesterol-rich liposomes as model systems, was that membrane disruption can occur by two distinct processes, depending on the state of aggregation of the attacking agent. Specifically, we found that monomers induced leakage, while attack by aggregates resulted in a catastrophic rupture of the membrane. This discovery led us to design of a series of derivatives of the clinically important antifungal agent, Amphotericin B, where we demonstrated the feasibility of separating antifungal from hemolytic activity by decreasing the molecule's tendency to aggregate, i.e., by controlling its monomer concentration. Using an entirely different approach (i.e., a \\"taming\\" strategy), we found that by covalently attaching one or more facial amphiphiles (\\"floats\\") to Amphotericin B, its aggregate forms were much less active in lysing red blood cells while maintaining high antifungal activity. The possibility of applying such \\"monomer control\\" and \\"taming\\" strategies to other membrane-disrupting antimicrobial agents is briefly discussed.","output":"Improving the Cellular Selectivity of a Membrane-Disrupting Antimicrobial Agent by Monomer Control and by Taming"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Precarious employment is known to be detrimental to health, and some population subgroups (young individuals, migrant workers, and females) are at higher risk of precarious employment. However, it is not known if the risk to poor health outcomes is consistent across population subgroups. This scoping review explores differential impacts of precarious employment on health. METHODS: Relevant studies published between 2009 and February 2019 were identified across PubMed, OVID Medline, PsycINFO, and Scopus. Articles were included if (1) they presented original data, (2) examined precarious employment within one of the subpopulations of interest, and (3) examined health outcomes. RESULTS: Searches yielded 279 unique results, of which 14 met the eligibility criteria. Of the included studies, 12 studies examined differences between gender, 3 examined the health impacts on young individuals, and 3 examined the health of migrant workers. Mental health was explored in nine studies, general health in four studies, and mortality in two studies.

These CNS resident myeloid cells are assumed to help orchestrate the immune response against infections of the brain. However, their specific role in this process and their interactions with CNS infiltrating immune cells, such as blood-borne monocytes and T cells are only incompletely understood. The recent development of PLX5622, a specific inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor that depletes microglia, allows studying the role of microglia in conditions of brain injury such as viral encephalitis, the most common form of brain infection. Here we used this inhibitor in a model of viral infection-induced epilepsy, in which C57BL/6 mice are infected by a picornavirus (Theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus) and display seizures and hippocampal damage. Our results show that microglia are required early after infection to limit virus distribution and persistence, most likely by modulating T cell activation. Microglia depletion accelerated the occurrence of seizures, exacerbated hippocampal damage, and led to neurodegeneration in the spinal cord, which is normally not observed in this mouse strain. This study enhances our understanding of the role of microglia in viral encephalitis and adds to the concept of microglia-T cell crosstalk.","output":"Microglia have a protective role in viral encephalitis-induced seizure development and hippocampal damage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A sudden outbreak of diseases poses a serious threat to mental health. Relying on strengths might mitigate negative mental health outcomes and promote positive mental health. Prior research suggests a potential moderated mediation effect between fear of illness and subjective psychological well-being. Based on the Complete State Model and the Competence-Based Model of mental health, this study examined the relationship between fear of illness and subjective psychological well-being through perceived distress moderated by resilience in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey using questionnaires was employed. Data were collected online from 384 participants ( 270 females and 114 males, age range= 15 to 29 years). The participants had indirect exposure to COVID-19 through information from the media. Results demonstrated that fear of illness significantly predicts subjective psychological well-being both directly and indirectly. In addition, the moderated mediation effect of resilience was confirmed. Resilience moderated the indirect effect between fear of illness and subjective psychological well-being through perceived distress. The magnitude of the indirect effect was contingent on resilience. Further, the effect of perceived distress on subjective psychological well-being is weakened as the level of resilience increases. This study contributes theoretically to a better understanding of the salutogenic effect of resilience on positive mental health during a pandemic.

The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in infants remain unknown. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 have adverse brain development. METHODS: This multicenter observational study was conducted at two designated maternal and childrens hospitals in Hubei Province, mainland China from February 1, 2020 to May 15, 2020. Neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 were enrolled. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and volumes of grey and white matters, and physical growth parameters were observed at 44 weeks corrected gestational age. RESULTS: Of 72 neonates born to mothers with COVID-19, 8 (11%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, 8 (11%) were critically ill, and no deaths were reported. Among the eight neonates that underwent brain MRI at corrected gestational age of 44 weeks, five neonates were diagnosed with COVID-19. Among these five neonates, three presented abnormal MRI findings including abnormal signal in white matter and delayed myelination in newborn 2, delayed myelination and brain dysplasia in newborn 3, and abnormal signal in the bilateral periventricular in newborn 5. The other three neonates without COVID-19 presented no significantly changes of brain MRI findings and the volumes of grey matter and white matter compared to those of healthy newborns at the equivalent age (P > 0.05). Physical growth parameters for weight, length, and head circumference at gestational age of 44 weeks were all above the 3rd percentile for all neonates. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 had abnormal brain MRI findings but these neonates did not appear to have poor physical growth. These findings may provide the information on the follow-up schedule on the neonates exposed to SARS-CoV-2, but further study is required to evaluate the association between the abnormal MRI findings and the exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

To date, however, no study has assessed how provincial epidemics have unfolded in a comparative perspective. This is essential to calibrate projections of the future course of the epidemic and plan health care resources for the second wave of infections. Methods: Using newly released individual-level data collected by the Public Health Agency of Canada, we assess COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality across age and gender groups at the provincial level through a combination of demographic and survival analyses. Results: Quebec has the highest absolute and per capita number of COVID-19 confirmed positive cases, hospitalizations and fatalities in all age groups. In each province, a higher number of women than men test positive for the disease, especially above age 80. Yet consistently across age groups, infected men are more likely to be hospitalized and enter intensive care than women do. These gender differences in hospitalisation rates account for the higher case fatality risk due to COVID-19 among men compared to women. Interpretation: Although health care capacity across provinces has been sufficient to treat severe cases, we find that the main factor accounting for gender differences in COVID-19-related mortality is the need for hospitalization and intensive care, especially above age 80.

ObjectiveTo investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and COVID-19 mortality across different ethnic groups. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis is a retrospective cohort study using linked national Census, electronic health records and mortality data for English adults aged 40 years or older who were alive at the start of pandemic (24th January 2020). ExposuresBMI obtained from electronic health records. Self-reported ethnicity (white, black, South Asian, other) was the effect-modifying variable. Main Outcomes and MeasuresCOVID-19 related death identified by ICD-10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 mentioned on the death certificate from 24th January 2020 until December 28th 2020. ResultsThe analysis included white (n = 11,074,708; mean age 61.9 [{+/-}13.4] years; 54% women), black (n = 416,542; 56.4 [{+/-}11.7] years; 57% women), South Asian (621,691; 55.7 [{+/-}12.4] years; 51% women) and other (n = 478,196; 55.3 [{+/-}11.6] years; 55% women) ethnicities with linked BMI data. The association between BMI and COVID-19 mortality was stronger in ethnic minority groups. Compared to a BMI of 22.5 kg/m2 in white ethnicities, the adjusted HR for COVID-19 mortality at a BMI of 30 kg/m2 in white, black, South Asian and other ethnicities was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.87-1.03), 1.72 (1.52-1.94), 2.00 (1.78-2.25) and 1.39 (1.21-1.61), respectively. The estimated risk of COVID-19 mortality at a BMI of 40 kg/m2 in white ethnicities (HR = 1.73) was equivalent to the risk observed at a BMI of 30.1 kg/m2, 27.0 kg/m2, and 32.2 kg/m2 in black, South Asian and other ethnic groups, respectively. ConclusionsThis population-based study using linked Census and electronic health care records demonstrates that the risk of COVID-19 mortality associated with obesity is greater in ethnic minority groups compared to white populations. QuestionDoes the association between BMI and COVID-19 mortality vary by ethnicity? FindingsIn this study of 12.6 million adults, BMI was associated with COVID-19 in all ethnicities, but with stronger associations in ethnic minority populations such that the risk of COVID-19 mortality for a BMI of 40 kg/m2 in white ethnicities was observed at a BMI of 30.1 kg/m2, 27.0 kg/m2, and 32.2 kg/m2 in black, South Asian and other ethnicities, respectively. MeaningBMI is a stronger risk factor for COVID-19 mortality in ethnic minorities. Obesity management is therefore a priority in these populations.","output":"Obesity, Ethnicity, and Covid-19 Mortality: A population-based cohort study of 12.6 Million Adults in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults have been advised to stay-at-home to reduce the risk of infection. Social distancing and quarantine measures increase their vulnerability to adverse health outcomes like depression and cardiovascular disease. Technology is an effective tool to promote social connectedness among older adults affected by the pandemic; however, its role in reducing loneliness and health inequities is not well understood. The goal of this project was to construct a model for how technologies may be deployed to mitigate the impact of a pandemic on social isolation, loneliness, and health inequities for older adults. PubMed, SCOPUS, and PsychINFO were searched for the following keywords: social isolation, loneliness, social support, resilience, technology, pandemic, and health inequities. Articles selected for full analysis attempted to understand or observe how technology alleviates social isolation and/or loneliness among older adults. Research evidence indicates that using technology reduces loneliness directly and indirectly (by reducing social isolation) and can strengthen social support, which in turn promotes resilience among older adults. Video-based technologies encourage care-seeking behaviors in this population. There is insufficient evidence to determine technologys relationship to health inequities experienced by older adults. The model we have proposed should help advance research on the relationship between technology and health inequities among older adults that may be aggravated by pandemic-like situations. We hypothesize that technology interventions for social support and functional competence should be sequenced in order to have the best effects on reducing health disparities.","output":"Technology and Social Isolation, Loneliness, and Health Inequities Among Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in hospital visitor policies and little is known about the impact on patients and their families. This study evaluated families understanding of and reactions to COVID-19-related visitor restriction policy at an academic children's hospital. We conducted a cross-sectional study with families of patients admitted to the pediatric ICU and general pediatric wards from September 2020 to November 2020. Parents (n = 73) completed a survey assessing communication, understanding of and satisfaction with visitor policies, strategies of coping with illness, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores. Descriptive analyses were performed to summarize data. Associations between outcomes and participant characteristics were examined. A majority (88%) of respondents reported hospital visitor restrictions were explained, usually in-person (94%), and understood the policy very well (68%), but none correctly identified all reasons for visitation restrictions. Eighty-five percent reported other family/friends would have visited, however minority families were more likely to report they would have had fewer visitors if restrictions were not in place (P = 0.0385). A majority (69%) were satisfied with how the hospital handled visitor polices, and parents of older children were more satisfied (P < .0001). HADS scores were consistent with anxiety or depression in about half of respondents. Forty percent of respondents believed restrictions affected their own and their child's ability to cope during hospitalization. Parents expressed satisfaction with and understanding of visitor policies but did not understand the rationale for visitor restrictions.

Infants are born preterm at less than 37 weeks' gestational age after: (1) spontaneous labour with intact membranes, (2) preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM), and (3) labour induction or caesarean delivery for maternal or fetal indications. The frequency of preterm births is about 12C13% in the USA and 5C9% in many other developed countries; however, the rate of preterm birth has increased in many locations, predominantly because of increasing indicated preterm births and preterm delivery of artificially conceived multiple pregnancies. Common reasons for indicated preterm births include pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. Births that follow spontaneous preterm labour and PPROMtogether called spontaneous preterm birthsare regarded as a syndrome resulting from multiple causes, including infection or inflammation, vascular disease, and uterine overdistension. Risk factors for spontaneous preterm births include a previous preterm birth, black race, periodontal disease, and low maternal body-mass index.

Based on fragmented literature in philosophy and HRD disciplines, this theoretical manuscript has assembled and thoroughly reviewed the existing literature to propose new ways of theory building in HRD. The findings guide that despite the usefulness of positivism and interpretivism philosophical paradigms in knowledge generation, these philosophies lead to practically weak theories. Hence, theory building in HRD should be driven by a problem-solving approach rather than only relying on plausibility criteria. It further guides how multi-method and mixed-method research designs might help provide answers to complex and newly emerged challenges in HRD. Overall, this research adds value to a body of knowledge by proposing a unique five-stage framework to develop new theories in HRD using the pragmatism approach.

We review the lessons learned during the early response to the pandemic, placing these in the wider context of the responsibility radiology departments have to mitigate the impact of hospital-acquired infection on clinical care and staff wellbeing. The potential long-term implications for design and delivery of radiology services are considered. The need to achieve effective social distancing and ensure continuity of service during the pandemic has brought about a step change in the implementation of virtual clinical team working, off-site radiology reporting and postgraduate education in radiology.

Two rapid WHO pulse surveys studied disruptions in mental health services, but did not particularly focus on neurology. Here, a global survey was conducted and addresses the impact of the pandemic on neurology services. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in which 34 international neurological associations were asked to distribute the survey to national associations. The responses represented the national situation, in NovemberCDecember 2020, with regard to the main disrupted neurological services, reasons and the mitigation strategies implemented as well as the disruption on training of residents and on neurological research. A comparison with the situation in FebruaryCApril 2020, first pandemic wave, was also requested. FINDINGS: 54 completed surveys came from 43 countries covering all the 6 WHO regions. Overall, neurological services disruption was reported as mild by 26%, moderate by 30%, complete by 13% of associations. The most affected services were cross-sectoral neurological services (57%) and neurorehabilitation (56%). The second wave of the pandemic, however, was associated with the improvement of service provision for diagnostics services (44%) and for neurorehabilitation (41%). Governmental directives were the major cause of services disruption (56%). Mitigation strategies were mostly established through telemedicine (48%). Almost half of respondents reported a significant impact on neurological research (48%) and educational activities (60%). Most associations (67%) were not involved in decision making for neurological patients issues by their national government. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic affects neurological services and raises the universal need for the development of neurological health care at the policy, systems and services levels.

Its prevalence and impact on short- and long-term outcomes are not well described. This systematic review was undertaken to review the available evidence on dysglycemia (either hypo- or hyperglycemia) in hospitalized children with SAM. The 2 primary objectives of this systematic review were to understand the prevalence of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in children with SAM. A secondary objective was to understand the relation between dysglycemia and clinical outcomes like mortality in children with SAM. MEDLINE was searched with terms related to children, SAM, and dysglycemia. A meta-analysis of proportions was completed to determine the hypoglycemia prevalence and a standard meta-analysis was done to determine the relation between hypoglycemia and mortality. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. A total of 2148 articles were identified in the database search of which 16 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review based on screening done by multiple reviewers. The overall prevalence of hypoglycemia in SAM across studies based on the meta-analysis of proportions was 9% (95% CI: 7%, 12%; I2 = 92%). Meta-analysis results showed that hypoglycemia was associated with a higher chance of mortality during hospitalization in children with SAM (OR: 4.29; 95% CI: 3.04, 6.05; I2 = 0%). According to the GRADE evaluation, the certainty of the evidence for the prevalence of hypoglycemia was low and for hyperglycemia was very low. For the relation between hypoglycemia and mortality, the certainty of the evidence was moderate. A meta-analysis was not carried out for the prevalence of hyperglycemia due to the wide range of definitions used for across studies, but the prevalence ranged from 2% to 38% in the literature.

METODS: The analysis was performed through an exploratory and descriptive approach, with records from the outbreak module of the National System of Notifiable Diseases between January 2020 and June 2021. RESULTS: Outbreaks of influenza-like illness in this department represented 24.93% of all notifications. The highest concentration was seen in the state capital and metropolitan area. A total of 1 018 confirmed outbreaks were observed, involving 6 110 cases and 1 240 deaths among older people.

Research during SARS-CoV-2Crelated lockdowns revealed reductions in the more severe subtypes of preterm birth in some countries, suggesting the presence of preventable risk factors, such as infectious diseases or social behavior. Seasonality may provide a similar means of assessing natural changes in the daily life of pregnant individuals that were similar to those experienced during the COVID-19 lockdown period. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between seasonality and extremely preterm birth. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide cohort study included 1 136 143 pregnancies in Denmark with onset between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2016, in which the fetuses survived 21 completed weeks of gestation. Pregnancies were followed up until preterm birth, fetal death, or 37 completed weeks of gestation. Data were analyzed from September 2020 to September 2021. EXPOSURES: Season during gestation (primary exposure) and season of pregnancy onset. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome of extremely preterm birth was defined as a live birth occurring between 22 weeks, 0 days gestation and 27 weeks, 6 days gestation. Cox regression analyses were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for season during gestation and season of pregnancy onset, with adjustment for socioeconomic and demographic factors. RESULTS: Among 662 338 pregnant individuals, the median age at pregnancy onset was 30.0 years (IQR, 6.0 years). Of 1 136 143 pregnancies, 2009 extremely preterm births (cumulative incidence, 0.18%) were identified during follow-up. Season during gestation was associated with extremely preterm birth, with cumulative incidences of 0.17% (95% CI, 0.16%-0.19%) in spring, 0.18% (95% CI, 0.17%-0.20%) in summer, 0.20% (95% CI, 0.18%-0.21%) in autumn, and 0.16% (95% CI, 0.14%-0.17%) in winter. Compared with winter, the adjusted HRs (AHRs) for the risk of extremely preterm birth were 1.11 (95% CI, 0.97-1.26) for spring, 1.15 (95% CI, 1.02-1.31) for summer, and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.10-1.42) for autumn. The number of extremely preterm births associated with the increased risk in the spring, summer, and autumn was 56.1 (95% CI, 18.2-99.7), representing 2.8% (95% CI, 0.9%-5.0%) of all extremely preterm births in the study. Season of pregnancy onset was not associated with the risk of extremely preterm birth in spring (AHR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.95-1.01) or summer (AHR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.96-1.03) compared with winter, but a slight increase in risk was observed in autumn (AHR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09) compared with winter. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this large, national cohort study, seasonality was associated with 2.8% of all extremely preterm births. Season during gestation was associated with the rate of extremely preterm birth, suggesting the presence of potential risk factors associated with season that may be preventable. Further research to identify risk factors for extremely preterm birth associated with seasonality is warranted.","output":"Assessment of Seasonality and Extremely Preterm Birth in Denmark"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We exploit the provincial variability of COVID-19 cases registered in Italy to select the territorial predictors of the pandemic.

METHODS: Our study is a phase 1, randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial at a specialised clinical trials centre in Australia. We enrolled healthy adult volunteers in two age groups: younger adults (aged 18-54 years) and older adults (aged 55-75 years). Participants were randomly allocated either vaccine or placebo using a list prepared by the study funder. Participants were to receive two doses of SCB-2019 (either 3 g, 9 g, or 30 g) or a placebo (09% NaCl) 21 days apart. SCB-2019 either had no adjuvant (S-Trimer protein alone) or was adjuvanted with AS03 or CpG/Alum. The assigned treatment was administered in opaque syringes to maintain masking of assignments. Reactogenicity was assessed for 7 days after each vaccination. Humoral responses were measured as SCB-2019 binding IgG antibodies and ACE2-competitive blocking IgG antibodies by ELISA and as neutralising antibodies by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assay. Cellular responses to pooled S-protein peptides were measured by flow-cytometric intracellular cytokine staining. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04405908; this is an interim analysis and the study is continuing. FINDINGS: Between June 19 and Sept 23, 2020, 151 volunteers were enrolled; three people withdrew, two for personal reasons and one with an unrelated serious adverse event (pituitary adenoma). 148 participants had at least 4 weeks of follow-up after dose two and were included in this analysis (database lock, Oct 23, 2020). Vaccination was well tolerated, with two grade 3 solicited adverse events (pain in 9 g AS03-adjuvanted and 9 g CpG/Alum-adjuvanted groups). Most local adverse events were mild injection-site pain, and local events were more frequent with SCB-2019 formulations containing AS03 adjuvant (44-69%) than with those containing CpG/Alum adjuvant (6-44%) or no adjuvant (3-13%). Systemic adverse events were more frequent in younger adults (38%) than in older adults (17%) after the first dose but increased to similar levels in both age groups after the second dose (30% in older and 34% in younger adults). SCB-2019 with no adjuvant elicited minimal immune responses (three seroconversions by day 50), but SCB-2019 with fixed doses of either AS03 or CpG/Alum adjuvants induced high titres and seroconversion rates of binding and neutralising antibodies in both younger and older adults (anti-SCB-2019 IgG antibody geometric mean titres at day 36 were 1567-4452 with AS03 and 174-2440 with CpG/Alum). Titres in all AS03 dose groups and the CpG/Alum 30 g group were higher than were those recorded in a panel of convalescent serum samples from patients with COVID-19. Both adjuvanted SCB-2019 formulations elicited T-helper-1-biased CD4+ T-cell responses. INTERPRETATION: The SCB-2019 vaccine, comprising S-Trimer protein formulated with either AS03 or CpG/Alum adjuvants, elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, with high viral neutralising activity. Both adjuvanted vaccine formulations were well tolerated and are suitable for further clinical development.

Results: The results found that 63.5 percent of students and 53.9 percent of teachers believed that the synchronous online teaching model in the form of live video streaming was more conducive to students understanding of the course content than Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). Additionally, 64.1 percent of teachers believed that online teaching generally had a substantial impact on students learning effects compared with face-to-face lectures, and that this was mainly because students were less able to focus their attention online. Although teachers and students agree that the methods of individual teachers are the most important factor in determining the effect of online teaching, their opinions on the influence of other factors vary.

Replacement of the predicted catalytic amino acids, Cys-783 by Ser, or of His-869 by Glu, abolished cleavage of the 206K RP into a 150K NRP and a 78K C-terminal product in reticulocyte lysates, while other substitutions exerted no apparent influence on proteolysis. The proteinase-deficient mutant RPs could not be cleaved in trans by as much as an eight-fold molar excess of wild-type proteinase. Deletion experiments have excluded the possible influence on autoproteolysis of amino acid sequences 1C708 and 982C1204 flanking the proteinase domain. Thus, the proteinase of TYMV with a papain-like dyad of essential amino acids has been mapped just upstream from the putative NTPase domain. Statistically significant sequence similarities with the TYMV proteinase were found for the similarly located domains of the replicase polyproteins of carlaviruses, capilloviruses, apple stem pitting virus and apple chlorotic leaf spot virus as well as for those of other tymoviruses and for the domain located downstream from the putative NTPase domain of the large polyprotein of beet necrotic yellow vein furovirus. All these domains are not significantly similar to other known proteinases, although they conserve papain-like Cys- and His-containing motifs. Thus these domains constitute a compact group of related enzymes, the tymo-like proteinases, within the proposedpapainlike proteinase supergroup. The resulting alignment of 10 tymo-like proteinase sequences has revealed a third highly conserved residue  Gly (Gly821 in TYMV RP) followed by a hydrophobic residue. We speculate that all the tymo-like proteinase domains of the viral replicative proteins may share common biochemical and biological features.","output":"Papain-like proteinase of turnip yellow mosaic virus: a prototype of a new viral proteinase group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND During mechanical ventilation, the airway pressure (Paw) is usually monitored. However, Paw comprises the endotracheal tube (ETT)-related pressure drop (?PETT ) and thus does not reflect the pressure in the patients' lungs. Therefore, monitoring of mechanical ventilation should be based on the tracheal pressure (Ptrach ). We systematically investigated potential factors influencing ?PETT in pediatric ETTs. METHODS In this study, the flow-dependent pressure drop across pediatric ETTs from four manufacturers [2.0-4.5 mm inner diameter (ID)] was estimated in a physical model of the upper airways. Additionally, ?PETT was examined with the ETTs shortened to 75% of their original length and at different curvatures. In nine healthy mechanically ventilated children (aged between 9 days and 29 months), Ptrach was compared to Paw . RESULTS ?PETT was nonlinearly flow dependent. Low IDs corresponded to high ?PETT . Differences between ETTs from different manufacturers were identified. Shortening of the ETTs' length by 25% reduced ?PETT on average by 14% of the value at original length. Ventilation frequency and tube curvature did not influence ?PETT to a relevant extent. In the pediatric patients, the root mean square deviation between Paw and Ptrach was 2.3 cm H2O. CONCLUSION Paw and Ptrach differ considerably (by ?PETT ) during mechanical ventilation of pediatric patients. The ETTs' ID, tube length, and manufacturer type are significant factors for ?PETT and should be taken into account when Paw is valuated. For this purpose, Ptrach can be continuously calculated with good precision by means of the Rohrer approximation.","output":"The pressure drop across the endotracheal tube in mechanically ventilated pediatric patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present paper begins with the particulars of clinical practice in Ireland. Through clinical example, it examines the emotion of shame, widely paired with blame, as a socially acceptable admission of psychological functioning, both in exercising and in denying the communication of more profound feeling. As a necessary emotional outlet, shame authorizes aggressions both large and small. Shame demands that certain acts, often seemingly random and subjective, are to be judged disgraceful in others. Shame demands that someone, everyone, endures hurt, at least through social judgement. Passing through the armoring of shame as social defense, clinical examples focus on the defensive action of foreclosure as an interpersonal act of nihilation, reducing another to no-thing, while at the same time diminishing ones own sense of inadequacy.

Pharmacists are at the front line and have long been involved in combating this public health emergency. Therefore, the study was aimed to explore pharmacy preparedness and response to prevent and control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods A qualitative study was conducted in six pharmacies in Aksum, Ethiopia in May, 2020. We conducted six in-depth interviews with purposively selected key informants. Direct observation measures were made to assess the activities made in the medicine retail outlets for the prevention and control of the pandemic. Interview data were audio-recorded, translated and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the data and OpenCode version 4.02 software was used to facilitate the data analysis. Results The thematic analysis has resulted in seven major themes. Good preparedness measures were undertaken to control and prevent COVID-19. Participants had good knowledge about the pandemic disease and reported they had used different resource materials to update themselves. Preparing of alcohol-based hand-rub;availing finished sanitizers and alcohol;and advising clients to maintain physical distancing were the major counseling information being delivered to prevent the disease. Some tendencies of irrational drug use and false claims of COVID-19 were observed at the beginning of the pandemic. Interview informants had reported they were working with relevant stakeholders and appropriate patient education and support were given to combat the pandemic disease. Conclusion The study revealed necessary pharmacy services has been rendered to all clients. However, availability of drugs and medical supplies were scarce which negatively affected the optimal delivery of pharmacy services.

The present study aimed to determine older women's experiences in urinary incontinence management. METHODS: The present qualitative study employed a conventional content analysis approach and was conducted in Iran from 2019 to 2020. In this research, the data were collected through face-to-face unstructured in-depth interviews with 22 older women suffering from urinary incontinence selected via purposeful sampling. The interviews were continued until reaching the data saturation point. Data analysis was performed simultaneously with data collection. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed through Graneheim and Lundman style content analysis, and data management was done using the MAXQDA software. In order to achieve the accuracy and validity of the study, the Four-Dimensions Criteria (FDC) by Lincoln and Guba, namely credibility, dependability, conformability, and transformability, were considered and used. RESULTS: This study was conducted on 22 older women suffering from urinary incontinence with the mean age of 66.54  5.76 years. The acquired data were put in four main categories of \\"resilience\\" with three subcategories, \\"change in lifestyle\\" with six subcategories, \\"attempt for treatment of the condition\\" with three subcategories, and \\"receiving support\\" with two subcategories. CONCLUSION: The study results indicated that the older women suffering from urinary incontinence were resilient against the condition, had changed their lifestyles to manage the condition, and sought treatment. In addition, receiving support from the family and the society played a significant role in the follow-up and management of the condition. The present study findings can help healthcare team members focus on urinary incontinence, design care programs for older women with this condition, and improve their quality of life. Furthermore, focusing on young and middle-aged women's health, providing them with the necessary training for taking care of the genitourinary system, and raising their awareness for preventing urinary incontinence during old ages can be helpful.

Conventional protein delivery techniques fail to address this fundamental problem in that protein cargos are predominantly delivered inside cells via endocytosis, a remarkably effective cell defense mechanism developed by Mother Nature to prevent intact biomolecules from entering the cytoplasm.

However, due to racial biases and long-standing health inequities, the common method of ranking patients based on impersonal numeric representations of their morbidity is associated with disproportionately pronounced racial disparities. In response, policymakers have issued statements of solidarity. However, translating support into responsive COVID-19 policy is rife with complexity. Triage does not easily lend itself to race-based exceptions. Reordering triage queues based on an individual patient's racial affiliation has been considered but may be divisive and difficult to implement. And while COVID-19 hospital policies may be presented as rigidly focused on saving the most lives, many make exceptions for those deemed worthy by policymakers such as front-line healthcare workers, older physicians, pregnant women and patients with disabilities. These exceptions demonstrate creativity and ingenuity-hallmarks of policymakers' abilities to flexibly respond to urgent societal concerns-which should also be extended to patients of colour.

Around 20% of the familial ALS cases arise from dominant mutations in the sod1 gene encoding superoxide dismutase1 (SOD1) enzyme. Aggregation of mutant SOD1 in familial cases and of wild-type SOD1 in at least some sporadic ALS cases is one of the known causes of the disease. Riluzole, approved in 1995 and edaravone in 2017 remain the only drugs with limited therapeutic benefits. METHODS: We have utilised the ebselen template to develop novel compounds that redeem stability of mutant SOD1 dimer and prevent aggregation. Binding modes of compounds have been visualised by crystallography. In vitro neuroprotection and toxicity of lead compounds have been performed in mouse neuronal cells and disease onset delay of ebselen has been demonstrated in transgenic ALS mice model. FINDING: We have developed a number of ebselen-based compounds with improvements in A4V SOD1 stabilisation and in vitro therapeutic effects with significantly better potency than edaravone. Structure-activity relationship of hits has been guided by high resolution structures of ligand-bound A4V SOD1. We also show clear disease onset delay of ebselen in transgenic ALS mice model holding encouraging promise for potential therapeutic compounds. INTERPRETATION: Our finding established the new generation of organo-selenium compounds with better in vitro neuroprotective activity than edaravone. The potential of this class of compounds may offer an alternative therapeutic agent for ALS treatment. The ability of these compounds to target cysteine 111 in SOD may have wider therapeutic applications targeting cysteines of enzymes involved in pathogenic and viral diseases including main protease of SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19).

It is crucial to grasp the viral life cycle, replication and mutation policies and attack strategies. It is also absolute to fathom the cost-efficient antiviral remedies earliest possible. METHODS: We propose to use a lab-grown organ (re-cellularized scaffold of sheep kidney) for viral culture and understand its interaction with extra-cellular matrices of the host tissue. RESULTS: Our findings showed that the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) could be better replicated in tissue-engineered bio models than cell culture. A decrease in ds-DNA levels emphasized that CHIKV propagates within the re-cellularized and cell culture models. There was an increase in the viral titres (pfu/ml) in re-cellularized scaffolds and control groups. The lipid peroxidation levels were increased as the infection was progressed in cell culture as well as re-cellularized and control groups. The onset and progress of the CHIKV attacks (cellular infection) lead to transmembrane domain fatty acid peroxidation and DNA breakdown, landing in cellular apoptosis. Simultaneously cell viability was inversely proportional to non-viability, and it decreased as the infection progressed in all infected groups. Histological findings and extracellular matrix evaluation showed the impairment in medullary, cortex regions due to propagation of CHIKV and plaques generations. CONCLUSION: This method will be a breakthrough for future virus culture, drug interaction and to study its effect on extracellular matrix alterations. This study will also allow us to investigate the correct role of any vaccine or antiviral drugs and their effects on re-engineered organ matrices before moving towards the animal models.

The aims of this study were to identify key food system drivers influencing the Australian packaged food sector and analyse how these might impact the willingness of food companies to voluntarily reduce salt in packaged foods. METHODS Business methods formed the basis of this retrospective applied policy analysis of voluntary salt reduction for the period 2013-2016 where the focal policy was the Australian Food and Health Dialogue (2009-2015). The analytical framework included political-legal, economic, social, technological (PEST) external drivers of the food system, and Porter's Five Forces for the competitive drivers of the food system. Documentary data identifying food system drivers affecting the Australian packaged food sector (comprised of the food processing and supermarket industries) were identified through a comprehensive search of the grey and academic literatures. RESULTS The interplay between external and competitive food system drivers created an environment in which voluntary salt reduction was found to be an uneasy fit. A high cost of doing business, soft growth, intense competition, asymmetry of power in favour of supermarkets, and marginal consumer interest in less salty food were found likely to create commercial disincentives to invest in voluntary salt reduction above more pressing commercial imperatives. Analysis of food manufacturing industries highlighted the highly contextual nature of food system drivers. Opportunities for nutrition policy included: support for 'shared value' in economic discourse; and, leveraging investor, supermarket, and the largely unrealised bargaining power of consumers. CONCLUSION Business frameworks can provide meaningful insights for nutrition policy on how food system drivers can thwart policy goals. Our analysis highlighted areas to incentivise voluntary action and illustrated the importance of political-legal, economic and consumer strategies for salt reduction.","output":"Drawing on Strategic Management Approaches to Inform Nutrition Policy Design: An Applied Policy Analysis for Salt Reduction in Packaged Foods."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Im Folgenden werden die derzeit bekannten Transporterdefekte des Gastrointestinaltrakts beschrieben und in 2 Kategorien eingeteilt (Tab. 6.1): - solche, deren genetische Mutation bekannt ist, - jene, bei denen das verantwortliche Chromosom identifiziert wurde, das betroffene Gen aber noch nicht bekannt ist.

Sepsis is also associated with activation of coagulation that mainly presents as disseminated intravascular coagulation. Many studies have reported increased levels of plasma D-dimer in patients with COVID-19 that is associated with severity, thrombosis, and mortality. Objectives The aim of this study was to compare levels of circulating extracellular vesicle tissue factor (EVTF) activity and active plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) in plasma from patients with COVID-19 or sepsis. Methods We measured levels of D-dimer, EVTF activity, and active PAI-1 in plasma samples from patients with COVID-19 (intensive care unit [ICU], N = 15;and non-ICU, N = 20) and patients with sepsis (N = 35). Results Patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of D-dimer, EVTF activity, and active PAI-1 compared with healthy controls. Patients with sepsis had significantly higher levels of D-dimer and EVTF activity compared with healthy controls. Levels of D-dimer were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients with sepsis. Levels of EVTF activity were significantly higher in ICU patients with COVID-19 compared with patients with sepsis. Levels of active PAI-1 were significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients with sepsis. Conclusions High levels of both EVTF activity and active PAI-1 may promote thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 due to simultaneous activation of coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis. The high levels of active PAI-1 in patients with COVID-19 may limit plasmin degradation of crosslinked fibrin and the release of D-dimer. This may explain the lower levels of D-dimer in patients with COVID-19 compared with patients with sepsis.","output":"Comparison of the coagulopathies associated with COVID-19 and sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cell-surface receptors are the inviters of many potent pathogens that can adjust to any kind of circumstance for their existence.

Assimilation of meteorological observations from aircraft improves forecasts greatly. However, global lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic (March to May 2020) has eliminated 50-75% aircraft observations and imperiled weather forecasting. Here, we verify global forecasts against reanalysis to quantify the impact of the pandemic. We find a large deterioration in forecasts of surface meteorology over regions with busy air flights, such as North America, southeast China, and Australia. Forecasts over remote regions are also substantially worse during March to May 2020 than 2017C2019, and the deterioration increases for longer-term forecasts. This could handicap early warning of extreme weather and cause additional economic damage on the top of that from the pandemic.

China promotes telemedicine with great efforts, and its practices in the deployment of telemedicine platforms and delivery of services have become important references for the research and development in this field. OBJECTIVE: Our work described in this paper focuses on a regional telemedicine platform that was built in 2014. We analyzed the system design scheme and remote consultations that were conducted via the system to understand the deployment and service delivery processes of a representative telemedicine platform in China. METHODS: We collected information on remote consultations conducted from 2015 to 2020 via the regional telemedicine platform that employs a centralized architectural system model. We used graphs and statistical methods to describe the changing trends of service volume of remote consultation, geographical and demographic distribution of patients, and waiting time and duration of consultations. The factors that affect consultation duration and patient referral were analyzed by multivariable linear regression models and binary logistic regression models, respectively. The attitudes toward telemedicine of 225 medical practitioners and 225 patients were collected using the snowball sampling method. RESULTS: The regional telemedicine platform covers all levels of medical institutions and hospitals in all 18 cities of Henan Province as well as some interprovince hospitals. From 2015 to 2020, 103,957 remote medical consultations were conducted via the platform with an annual increasing rate of 0.64%. A total of 86.64% (90,069/103,957) of medical institutions (as clients) that applied for remote consultations were tier 1 or 2 and from less-developed regions; 65.65% (68,243/103,945) of patients who applied for remote consultations were aged over 50 years. The numbers of consultations were high for departments focusing in the treatment of chronic diseases such as neurology, respiratory medicine, and oncology. The invited experts were mainly experienced doctors with senior professional titles. Year of consultation, tier of hospital, consultation department, and necessity of patient referral were the main factors affecting the duration of consultations. In surveys, we found that 60.4% (136/225) of medical practitioners and 53.8% (121/225) of patients had high satisfaction and believed that telemedicine is of vital importance for the treatment of illness. CONCLUSIONS: The development of telemedicine in China shows a growing trend and provides great benefits especially to medical institutions located in less developed regions and senior citizens who have less mobility. Cases of remote consultations are mainly for chronic diseases. At present, the importance and necessity of telemedicine are well recognized by both patients and medical practitioners.

The proposed method uses a developed breath device composed of a nanomaterial-based hybrid sensor array with multiplexed detection capabilities that can detect disease-specific biomarkers from exhaled breath, thus enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis. An exploratory clinical study with this approach was examined in Wuhan, China, during March 2020. The study cohort included 49 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 58 healthy controls, and 33 non-COVID lung infection controls. When applicable, positive COVID-19 patients were sampled twice: during the active disease and after recovery. Discriminant analysis of the obtained signals from the nanomaterial-based sensors achieved very good test discriminations between the different groups. The training and test set data exhibited respectively 94% and 76% accuracy in differentiating patients from controls as well as 90% and 95% accuracy in differentiating between patients with COVID-19 and patients with other lung infections. While further validation studies are needed, the results may serve as a base for technology that would lead to a reduction in the number of unneeded confirmatory tests and lower the burden on hospitals, while allowing individuals a screening solution that can be performed in PoC facilities. The proposed method can be considered as a platform that could be applied for any other disease infection with proper modifications to the artificial intelligence and would therefore be available to serve as a diagnostic tool in case of a new disease outbreak.","output":"Multiplexed Nanomaterial-Based Sensor Array for Detection of COVID-19 in Exhaled Breath"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) levied on the Moroccan authorities to increase their mask production capacity, which reached up to 12 million facemask units produced per day. This increase in personal protective equipment (PPE) production and consumption is an efficient tool to address the spread of COVID-19. However, this results in more plastic and microplastic debris being added into the land and marine environments, which will harm the ecosystem, wildlife, and public health. Such a situation needs deep individual behavior observation and tracking, as well as an assessment of the potential environmental impact of this new type of waste. For this reason, we assessed the Moroccan population's behavior regarding the use and disposal of facemasks and gloves. An exploratory survey was prepared and shared via social media and email with the population of Rabat-Sal-Knitra and Casablanca-Settat regions. Additionally, we calculated the estimated number and weight of daily and weekly PPE used and generated by the studied regions. The survey showed that 70% of the respondents threw their discarded masks and gloves in house trash or trash bins after their first use, whereas nearly 30% of respondents admitted that they did not wear masks because they did not leave their homes during the lockdown, while from the 70% of facemask users, more than five million (equivalent to 40,000 kg) of facemasks would be generated and disposed of daily by the community of these regions, which presents 35% of the total engendered facemask waste in Morocco. Accordingly, the environment impact of facemasks showed that the greenhouse gas footprint is about 640 kT CO2 eq./year for the whole of Morocco, while the energy footprint is around 60,000 GWh/year. Furthermore, an urgent multidisciplinary environmental assessment of the potential impact of PPE must be conducted among the 12 Moroccan regions.

Stroke leadership identified select recipients of Alteplase to have care safely de-escalated from ICU to stepdown status earlier than the traditional protocol allowed. Per previous protocol, all stroke patients recovered in ICU for 24 hours post- Alteplase with 36 neurological and vital sign assessments completed. Acting upon the need to ensure patient safety and create inpatient ICU bed availability, the multidisciplinary stroke leadership team created the Fast Track Alteplase Protocol. Goals: Project goals included decreasing ICU utilization and minimizing nursing encounters at the patient bedside to decrease potential COVID-19 exposures. Methods: Protocol qualifications include both pre-Alteplase NIH Stroke Scale scores less than 10 and no large vessel occlusions or flow limiting stenosis present on imaging. Once in the protocol, to qualify for transfer out of ICU, an NIH Stroke Scale score less than 10 throughout ICU stay, noncontrast head CT or MRI to evaluate infarct burden, not require continuous anti-hypertensive medications to maintain systolic blood pressure cap, and not demonstrate hemodynamic or respiratory concerns must be achieved and completed. We developed education for nurses and physicians in ED, ICU, and stepdown patient care areas and tip sheets to guide nursing care and documentation associated with the new protocol. Electronic orders were quickly developed and integrated as a new subphase specific to the Fast Track Alteplase Protocol within an existing stroke order set. Results: The protocol decreased the number of encounters between nursing and patients from 36 to 12 interactions (66.7%) and planned time in the ICU from 24 to 12 hours (50%). The median time comparison of ICU length of stay for Fast Track vs. traditional protocol was 12 hours and 26 min vs35 hours and 15 minutes respectively.

Several reports have demonstrated that many viruses belonging to Flaviviridae may cause diseases in poultry species; however, the susceptibility of other avian species is variable and still unclear. In human and mice, the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) proteins are associated with resistance to the flavivirus infection as well as other virus infections. However, the avian OAS proteins are rarely studied. In our previous studies, we confirmed that the chicken OAS-like protein (chOASL) expressed OAS-enzymatic activity (the classical OAS/RNase L-dependent pathway) as well as the anti-flavivirus activity (the putative OAS/RNase L-independent pathway). Therefore, the current study aimed at functional analysis of avian OAS proteins from duck, goose, and ostrich. The duOASL, goOASL, and osOAS1 proteins expressed enzymatic activity as well as chOASL, whereas osOASL expressed little enzymatic activity. On the other hand, duOASL, goOASL, and osOASL possessed significant antiviral activity against West Nile virus (WNV)-replicon replication as well as chOASL, whereas osOAS1 did not. In addition, similar to chOASL, their antiviral activity was independent of RNase L activation. These results suggest that OASL is the only OAS protein in the duck and goose as well as chicken and possesses both OAS-enzymatic and anti-flavivirus activities, whereas the ostrich possesses both OAS1 and OASL proteins with sharing the functional activities, OAS-enzymatic and anti-flavivirus activities, respectively. It is of interest that the ostrich undergoes differential process in OAS gene evolution from other poultries and thus possesses different molecular mechanism in antiviral activity.","output":"Functional analysis of duck, goose, and ostrich 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Malnutrition has been linked to adverse health economic outcomes.

So far novel coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks were associated with SARS-CoV-2 (2019), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2012), and SARS-CoV-1 (2003) events. CoV relates to the enveloped family of Betacoronavirus (?CoV) with positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA). Knowing well the persistence, transmission, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 through proximity, the fecal-oral route is now emerging as a major environmental concern to community transmission. The replication and persistence of CoV in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and shedding through stools is indicating a potential transmission route to the environment settings. In spite of the evidence, based on fewer reports on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and persistence in wastewater/sewage/water, the transmission of the infective virus to the community is yet to be established. In this realm, this communication attempted to review the possible influx route of the enteric enveloped viral transmission in the environmental settings with reference to its occurrence, persistence, detection, and inactivation based on the published literature so far. The possibilities of airborne transmission through enteric virus-laden aerosols, environmental factors that may influence the viral transmission, and disinfection methods (convention and emerging) as well as the inactivation mechanism with reference to the enveloped virus were reviewed.

A model for dynamic intermittent straining (DIS) of ventral hernia repairs was developed. The influence of phospholipids, position, overlap, fixation and tissue quality of various meshes on the durability of hernia repair was studied. DIS comprises the repetition of submaximal impacts delivered via a hydraulically driven plastic containment. Pig tissues simulate a ventral hernia with a standardized 5cm defect. Commercially available meshes strengthened with tacks, glue and sutures were used to bridge this defect in an underlay (IPOM) or sublay (retromuscular) position starting with a 5cm overlap in all directions. We tested 35 different ways of ventral hernia repair with up to 425 submaximal intermittent dynamic impacts until mesh dislocation occurred 10 times or a maximum of 4000 impacts each were withstood. The likelihood of a failing repair was related to the mesh, the lubricants, the position, the overlap, the fixation and the tissue quality. Most meshes dislocated easily and required fixation. One of the meshes tested was stable without fixation with a 5cm overlap and failed after reducing the overlap. Phospholipids exerted a strong influence on the biomaterial tested. The sublay position was about 10% more durable in comparison to the IPOM position. DIS revealed distinct degrees of stability with primarily stable, intermediate and primarily unstable repairs.

Follow-up visits require access to specialty care and necessitate patients to take time off work, commute long distances, arrange for travel, and/or work with a caregivers schedule. Telemedicine was adopted for some patient management as a result of the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic; however, remote optimization for neuromodulation still required an in-person visit to adjust device parameters. An FDA-approved digital platform enables remote programming of an implanted neuromodulation device using a real-time audio-video link from the clinical programmer to the patient controller. The Remote Optimization, Adjustment, and Measurement for Chronic Pain Therapy (ROAM-CPT) is a multi-center, prospective study that is currently underway to access the effectiveness of the teleprogramming system in fulfilling patients clinical demands. METHODS: This pilot study surveyed 16 patients to determine the ability of the teleprogramming platform to provide a rapid solution safely and effectively for patients chronic pain.

Materials and methods. We retrospectively analyzed data from the registration cards of the first 500 voluntary vaccination recipients who received two vaccine doses in October-December 2020. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) M and G levels to SARS-CoV-2 were measured in 204 participants at baseline, at Day 21, and at Day 42 after the injection of component I of Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine. Test for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA in a nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal mucosa smear was performed before injection of component I of the vaccine using real-time PCR method on a DT-96 amplifier (DNA-Technology, Russia) using SARSCoV-2/SARS-CoV reagent kit (DNA-Technology, Russia). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM were measured using reagent kits for enzyme immunoassay (Vector-Best, Russia). Results. During the follow-up (42 days), none of the vaccine recipients experienced serious adverse events. During the first 14 days after receiving component I of the vaccine Gam-COVID-Vac, eight vaccine recipients got sick with COVID-19;the disease had a mild course and did not require hospital admission. On Day 21, no IgM antibodies were detected in any of the vaccine recipients, while the IgG level was detectable and the cutoff index (CI) was 11.3 [3.4;16.2]. On Day 42 after the injection of component I of the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine, there was an increase in IgG levels, and CI was 16.2 [16.0;16.4] in most subjects, while no IgM levels were detected in any of the vaccine recipients tested.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as a major treatment modality for lung cancer in the last decade. Additional research is needed to elucidate underlying mechanisms of resistance and to develop improved therapeutic strategies. Clinical progress relies on accurate preclinical modelling of human disease in order to yield clinically meaningful results; however, successful translation of pre-clinical research is still lagging behind. In this review, we summarize the major clinical developments of radiation therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and we discuss the pre-clinical research models at our disposal, highlighting ongoing translational challenges and future perspectives. ABSTRACT: Despite major research and clinical efforts, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death. While the delivery of conformal radiotherapy and image guidance of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) have revolutionized the treatment of early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), additional research is needed to elucidate underlying mechanisms of resistance and identify novel therapeutic combinations. Clinical progress relies on the successful translation of pre-clinical work, which so far has not always yielded expected results. Improved clinical modelling involves characterizing the preclinical models and selecting appropriate experimental designs that faithfully mimic precise clinical scenarios.

METHODS: This population-based cohort study used Taiwans National Health Insurance Administration data on FPICP (fiscal year 2015C2016, with follow-up duration of one year). Participants included diabetic patients aged 30 in primary care clinics. We used conditional logistic regression modeling of patient characteristics and annual diabetes examinations and compared FPICP participants with non-participating candidates. Main outcome measures included completion of annual diabetes examinations, including glycated hemoglobin (A1c), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), urine microalbumin (MAU), routine urinalysis (UR), and fundus examination (FE). RESULTS: The sample included 298,208 FPICP participants and 478,778 non-participating candidates. After 1:1 propensity score matching, the examination completion rates for FPICP participants and non-participants, respectively, were 94.4% versus 93.6% in A1c, 84.2% versus 83.8% in LDL, 61.9% versus 60.1% in MAU, 59.2% versus 58.0% in UR, and 30.1% versus 32.4% in FE.

We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in staff and students following the full reopening of all secondary schools in England. Methods: Public Health England (PHE) invited secondary schools in six regions (East and West London, Hertfordshire, Derbyshire, Manchester and Birmingham) to participate in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance during the 2020/21 academic year. Participants had nasal swabs for RT-PCR and blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the beginning (September 2020) and end (December 2020) of the autumn term. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent risk factors for seropositivity and seroconversion. Findings: Eighteen schools in six regions enrolled 2,209 participants, including 1,189 (53.8%) students and 1,020 (46.2%) staff. SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were not significantly different between students and staff in round one (5/948;[0.53%] vs. 2/876 [0.23%];p = 0.46) or round two (10/948 [1.05%] vs. 7/886 [0.79%];p = 0.63), and similar to national prevalence. None of four and 7/15 (47%) sequenced strains in rounds 1 and 2 were the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant. In round 1, antibody seropositivity was higher in students than staff (114/893 [12.8%] vs. 79/861 [9.2%];p = 0.016), but similar in round 2 (117/893 [13.1%] vs.117/872 [13.3%];p = 0.85), comparable to local community seroprevalence. Between the two rounds, 8.7% (57/652) staff and 6.6% (36/549) students seroconverted (p = 0.16). Interpretation: In secondary schools, SARS-CoV-2 infection, seropositivity and seroconversion rates were similar in staff and students, and comparable to local community rates.

Although conventional techniques, such as micromanipulation or cell sorting methods, are already used along with subsequent molecular examinations, it remains a big challenge to develop new approaches to manipulate and directly extract small quantities of cytosol from single living cells. In this sense, nanostructure or nanomaterial may play a critical role in overcoming these challenges in cellular manipulation and extraction of very small quantities of cells, and provide a powerful alternative to conventional techniques. Since the nanostructures or nanomaterial could build channels between intracellular and extracellular components across cell membrane, through which cytosol could be pumped out and transferred to downstream analyses. In this review, we will first brief the traditional methods for single cell analyses, and then shift our focus to some most promising methods for single-cell sampling with nanostructures, such as glass nanopipette, nanostraw, carbon nanotube probes and other nanomaterial. In this context, particular attentions will be paid to their principles, preparations, operations, superiorities and drawbacks, and meanwhile the great potential of nano-materials for single-cell sampling will also be highlighted and prospected.","output":"The Most Recent Advances in the Application of Nano-Structures/Nano-Materials for Single-Cell Sampling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public transport has been identified as high risk as the corona-virus carrying droplets generated by the infected passengers could be distributed to other passengers. Therefore, predicting the patterns of droplet spreading in public transport environment is of primary importance. This paper puts forward a novel computational and artificial intelligence (AI) framework for fast prediction of the spread of droplets produced by a sneezing passenger in a bus. The formation of droplets of salvia is numerically modelled using a volume of fluid methodology applied to the mouth and lips of an infected person during the sneezing process. This is followed by a large eddy simulation of the resultant two phase flow in the vicinity of the person while the effects of droplet evaporation and ventilation in the bus are considered. The results are subsequently fed to an AI tool that employs deep learning to predict the distribution of droplets in the entire volume of the bus. This combined framework is two orders of magnitude faster than the pure computational approach. It is shown that the droplets with diameters less than 250 micrometers are most responsible for the transmission of the virus, as they can travel the entire length of the bus.","output":"Prediction of the spread of Corona-virus carrying droplets in a bus - A computational based artificial intelligence approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In light of the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as other viral outbreaks in the 21st century, there is a dire need for new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to combat infectious diseases worldwide.

As an independent risk factor, obesity impairs the immune response to viral infections and decreases the effectiveness of immunizations. OBJECTIVES Using influenza as a proxy, we aimed to determine the impact of bariatric surgery (BaS) on the risk of hospitalization due to viral respiratory infections. SETTING Academic hospital, United States. METHODS National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample data collected from 2010 to 2015 were examined. Patients were classified as treatment and control groups. Treatment subjects were defined as patients with a history of BaS and control subjects as patients with a body mass index 35 kg/m2 and without a history of BaS. Any hospitalization with influenza as a primary diagnosis was identified. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression models were performed to assess the differences between groups. RESULTS A total of 2,300,845 subjects were reviewed, of which 2,004,804 were control subjects and 296,041 were treated patients. Univariate analysis showed that the hospitalization rate in the treatment group was significantly lower than in the control group (.007% versus .019%, P < .0001), which was confirmed after adjusting for covariables (control versus treatment: odds ratio = 2.21, P = .0010).

While a number of data-driven and experimental approaches have been suggested in the context of drug repurposing, a platform that systematically integrates available transcriptomic, proteomic and structural data is missing. More importantly, given that SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity is highly age-dependent, it is critical to integrate aging signatures into drug discovery platforms. We here take advantage of large-scale transcriptional drug screens combined with RNA-seq data of the lung epithelium with SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the aging lung. To identify robust druggable protein targets, we propose a principled causal framework that makes use of multiple data modalities. Our analysis highlights the importance of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases as potential targets that intersect the SARS-CoV-2 and aging pathways. By integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and structural data that is available for many diseases, our drug discovery platform is broadly applicable. Rigorous in vitro experiments as well as clinical trials are needed to validate the identified candidate drugs.","output":"Causal Network Models of SARS-CoV-2 Expression and Aging to Identify Candidates for Drug Repurposing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Normal haemostasis is an important physiological mechanism that prevents excessive bleeding during trauma, whereas the pathological thrombosis especially in diabetics leads to increased incidence of heart attacks and strokes as well as peripheral vascular events. In this work, we propose a new multiscale framework that integrates seamlessly four key components of blood clotting, namely transport of coagulation factors, coagulation kinetics, blood cell mechanics and platelet adhesive dynamics, to model the development of thrombi under physiological and pathological conditions. We implement this framework to simulate platelet adhesion due to the exposure of tissue factor in a three-dimensional microchannel. Our results show that our model can simulate thrombin-mediated platelet activation in the flowing blood, resulting in platelet adhesion to the injury site of the channel wall. Furthermore, we simulate platelet adhesion in diabetic blood, and our results show that both the pathological alterations in the biomechanics of blood cells and changes in the amount of coagulation factors contribute to the excessive platelet adhesion and aggregation in diabetic blood. Taken together, this new framework can be used to probe synergistic mechanisms of thrombus formation under physiological and pathological conditions, and open new directions in modelling complex biological problems that involve several multiscale processes.","output":"Integrating blood cell mechanics, platelet adhesive dynamics and coagulation cascade for modelling thrombus formation in normal and diabetic blood."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cardiac involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is known, manifested by troponin elevation, and these patients have a worse prognosis than patients without myocardial injury. METHODS: We analyzed COVID-19-positive patients who presented to the MedStar Health system (11 hospitals in Washington, DC, and Maryland) during the pandemic (March 1CSeptember 30, 2020). We compared renal function and subsequent in-hospital clinical outcomes based on the presence or absence of troponin elevation. The primary outcome was the incidence of acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients with troponin elevation. We also evaluated in-hospital mortality, overall and based on the presence and absence of both troponin elevation and renal dysfunction. RESULTS: The cohort included 3386 COVID-19-positive admitted patients for whom troponin was drawn. Of these patients, 195 had troponin elevation (defined as 1.0 ng/mL), mean age was 61  16 years, and 51% were men. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher (53.8%) in COVID-19-positive patients with concomitant troponin elevation than those without troponin elevation (14.5%; p < 0.001). COVID-19-positive patients with troponin elevation had a higher prevalence of renal dysfunction (58.5%) than those without troponin elevation (23.4%; p < 0.001). Further analysis demonstrated that having both troponin elevation and renal dysfunction carried the worst in-hospital prognosis (in-hospital mortality 57.9%; intensive-care-unit admission 76.8%; ventilation requirement 63.2%), as compared to the absence or presence of either. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with troponin elevation are at higher risk for worsening renal function, and these patients subsequently have worse in-hospital clinical outcomes.

As sleep disorders and low sleep quality in the general population are frequent ailments, it seems important to recognize them as serious public health problems. The exact relation between immunity and sleep remains elusive; however, it might be suspected that it is shaped by others stress and alterations of the circadian rhythm (commonly caused by for example shift work). As studies show, drugs used in the therapy of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as steroids or monoclonal antibodies, also influence sleep in more complex ways than those resulting from attenuation of the disease symptoms. Interestingly, the relation between sleep and immunity appears to be bidirectional; that is, sleep may influence the course of immune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, proper diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders are vital to the patients immune status and, in effect, health.

However, there is no current objective standard to assess the educational quality of these user-uploaded videos. A new approach was used to objectively validate these videos by comparing them to high quality educational sources for the seven most commonly used nerve blocks. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the educational quality of user-uploaded videos when compared to the highest quality anesthesia society websites (NYSORA, ACEP, USRA). METHODS: After reviewing the instructional material available for the seven most frequently conducted nerve blocks on high-quality reference websites, we documented the educational characteristics present including such things as indications, volume, anatomy, etc. Next we reviewed the five most popular videos on YouTube for each block (by views) and documented the presence or absence of these educational characteristics. RESULTS: Eighteen educational characteristics were documented in the high-quality anesthesia society reference material. Correlation was sought between this material and YouTube videos. Although there were varying degrees of correlation between the high quality sources and the videos, rarely did YouTube videos contain as high a percentage of these educational characteristics as the well-established sources. Some videos contained very few of these important educational characteristics.

COVID-19 has no vaccine or specific therapy; its mortality rate increases significantly once patients deteriorate. Furthermore, intensive monitoring of COVID-19 is limited by insufficient medical resources and increased risks of exposure to medical staff. We therefore aim to build an early warning and rapid response system (EWRRS) to address these problems. METHOD: The research is designed as a prospective cohort study, to verify a dynamic and interactive evaluation system; it includes patient self-reporting, active monitoring, early alarming and treatment recommendations. Adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 will be recruited from Sept 2020 to Aug 2021 at a tertiary contagious hospital. Patients with life expectancy <48a??hours, pregnant or lactating, in immunosuppression states or end-stage diseases will be excluded. The intervention is implementation of EWRRS to detect early signs of clinical deterioration of COVID-19 patients, to provide timely and efficient treatment suggestions by the system. EWRRS can determine the classification and interactive evaluation of patient information; the determination is based on the application of 3 different scenario modules, separately driven by patients, nurses, and physicians. The primary outcome is change in disease severity category after treatment. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with different disease severity types; critical deterioration events; patients who had unplanned transfers to an intensive care unit (ICU) and required critical care interventions; intervals from warning to implementation of clinical interventions; hospital mortality; length of ICU and hospital stay; workload of medical staff and risks of exposure to COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Our hypothesis is that EWRRS provides an example of an early identification, warning, and response system for COVID-19. In addition, EWRRS can potentially be extended to use as a grading metric for general critically ill patients in an ICU setting.","output":"Development of early warning and rapid response system for patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19): A research protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The excessive nitrogen and phosphorus discharged into the water environment will cause water eutrophication and thus disrupt the water ecosystem and even exert biological toxicities. In this study, the absorption removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from the anaerobic tank in an anaerobic-anoxic/nitrifying system using four different kinds of biowaste-reclaimed biochars were investigated and compared. The effects of temperature and pH on nutrient adsorption removal were further investigated. The four kinds of biochar were successfully prepared and well characterized using a scanning electron microscope, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Brunner-Emmet-Teller methods. Generally, there was no significant change in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH4+-N removal efficiencies when treated by the different biochars, while the activated sludge biochar (ASB) displayed the highest total phosphorus (TP) removal efficiency. The initial TP concentrations (<40 mg/L) displayed no remarkable effects on the TP adsorption removal, while the increase of temperature generally enhanced TP and NH4+-N adsorptions on the ASB. Besides, the increase of pH significantly promoted NH4+-N removal but depressed TP removal. Moreover, the adsorption process of TP by the ASB complies with the secondary kinetic model, suggesting the chemical precipitation and physical electrostatic interaction mechanisms of TP adsorption removal. However, the adsorption of NH4+-N conformed to the inner-particle diffusion model, indicating that the NH4+-N adsorption was mainly involved with pore diffusions in the particles.","output":"Enhanced Nutrient Removal in A2N Effluent by Reclaimed Biochar Adsorption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Various variants of the covid-19 have started to attract attention recently.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, patients with a diagnosis of classic covid-19 and patients with a diagnosis of variant covid-19 with mild and moderate symptoms followed in the clinical observatory of Ankara city hospital were included in the study group. The patients were divided into two groups according to the covid-19 type as variant and classic covid-19, and a healthy control group is added for comparison. A complete blood count and thiol analysis are performed from the venous blood samples. Obtained results were compared between groups, and the ROC analysis is performed. Results: Thiol levels were significantly lower in patients with a diagnosis of Covid-19 compared to the control group. In terms of WBC, lymphocyte, neutrophil, NLR, ferritin and thiol parameters, patients with variant covid-19 differed significantly from patients with a classic covid-19 diagnosis. Thiol levels cut-off values to distinguish between variant covid-19 patients and control group from classical covid-19 patients were almost identical (423 and 422 mol/L, respectively).

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the CT image data of COVID-19 patients diagnosed by nucleic acid test and CT examination in 57 patients in Zhuzhou Central Hospital and Zhuzhou First People's Hospital, and summarized the characteristics of CT imaging and the development of lesions. RESULTS Most of the cases were characterized by peripheral distribution of lesions. A total of 37 cases (64.91%) were purely peripherally distributed, 16 cases (28.07%) coexisted with peripheral and mid-internal distribution, and 4 cases (7.02%) had simple mid-inner band distribution. In peripherally distributed cases, the long axis of the lesion was mostly parallel to the pleura in 36 cases (63.16%). In the case of inner-middle zone distribution, the long axis of the lesion was mostly parallel and surrounded the bronchial vascular bundle, or distributed along the lung lobules (31.58%). All cases had ground-glass-density foci, 31 cases (54.38%) had fine grid shadows in the lesions, 46 cases (80.70%) had thick vascular shadows in the lesions, and 23 cases (40.35%) showed signs of bronchial inflation. Among the 10 cases of \\"wrinkling shape\\" lesions in the first CT examination, except for 1 case without reexamination, the remaining 9 cases had different degrees of absorption in the second CT examination. Among the 26 cases of \\"wrinkling shape\\" lesions in the second CT examination, except for 11 cases without reexamination, the other 15 patients had different degrees of absorption in the third CT examination. CONCLUSIONS The early CT manifestations of COVID-19 are mostly ground-glass-density foci distributed in the subpleural region, some of which are distributed near the bronchial blood vessel bundle and in the central area of the lobule. As the course of the disease progresses, there may be varying degrees of solid components in the lesion. When the lesions show a \\"wrinkling shape\\", it is often suggested that the lesions will evolve towards the direction of absorption.

Each of the proposed models demonstrated an increase in the normalized velocity, and a decrease in the deposition fraction by >29%. Diagonal cross linear and curved triangle configurations demonstrated an improved airflow momentum and turbulent flow, which decreased the droplets deposition fraction by 68%, thus providing an improved, healthier urban public seating option.","output":"COVID-19 and urban spaces: A new integrated CFD approach for public health opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with the acute onset of mental and behavioural symptoms and psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of the different neuropsychiatric diagnoses in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection assessed by Liaison Psychiatry.

We reviewed the electronic health records from all inpatients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test that were assessed by the Liaison Psychiatry Unit (LPU) between February and December 2020. We reviewed relevant sociodemographic and clinical data, including 15 neuropsychiatric symptoms. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders was our main outcome. We also explored differences between two groups: patients with delirium (delirium group) and patients without delirium (no delirium group). RESULTS: We included 46 cases [Age: median = 67 years; interquartile range (IQR) = 24)], with 60.9% male individuals. Delirium was the most frequent diagnosis in our sample (43.5%), followed by major depressive disorder (21.7%). Patients with delirium were more likely to suffer from COVID-19 symptoms (delirium: 19/20, 95%; no delirium: 14/26, 53.8%; p = 0.02), and to have a longer time interval between a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test and an evaluation by the LPU (delirium: median = 16.5 days, IQR = 16; no delirium: median = 8 days, IQR = 16.3; p = 0.045). Agitation (52.2%) and cognitive symptoms (47.8%) were the most reported neuropsychiatric symptoms. CONCLUSION: We found a high prevalence of delirium in our sample.

Methods: Single-center, observational prospective study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy, from October 1 to December 15, 2020. Mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, who had at least one episode of hypotension and received a passive leg raising (PLR) test, were included.

The primary outcome was to assess the early effects of PLR test and of FC and NE [when clinically indicated to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP)] on CA (CA index) measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD). Secondary outcomes were to evaluate the effects of PLR test, FC, and NE on systemic hemodynamic variables, cerebral oxygenation (rSo(2)), and non-invasive intracranial pressure (nICP). Results: Twenty-three patients were included and underwent PLR test. Of these, 22 patients received FC and 14 were treated with NE. The median age was 62 years (interquartile range = 57C68.5 years), and 78% were male. PLR test led to a low CA index [58% (44C76.3%)].

For double-layered cotton masks, which have considerable heat capacity, the temperature of inspired air rises above room temperature, and the effective increase in relative humidity can exceed 100%. We propose that the recently reported, disease-attenuating effect of generic facemasks is dominated by the strong humidity increase of inspired air. This elevated humidity promotes mucociliary clearance of pathogens from the lungs, both before and after an infection of the upper respiratory tract has occurred. Effective mucociliary clearance can delay and reduce infection of the lower respiratory tract, thus mitigating disease severity. This mode of action suggests that masks can benefit the wearer even after an infection in the upper respiratory tract has occurred, complementing the traditional function of masks to limit person-to-person disease transmission.

The participants were family members living with older people with dementia, care managers, and the medical and long-term care facility staff. Data were collected from 46 caregivers via face-to-face and semi-structured interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The interviews identified 22 themes related to the impact of COVID-19 on different positions of the caregivers involved in dementia care and their collaboration, and we categorized them into six categories. The core themes were re-acknowledgement of care priorities and rebuilding of relationships. When caregivers perceptions were aligned in the decision-making processes regarding care priorities, reaffirmation of trust and strengthening of intimate relationships emerged as positive changes in their relationships. Furthermore, the differences in the ability of each caregiver to access and select correct and appropriate information about COVID-19, and the extent of infection spread in the region were related to anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic and caused a gap in perception regarding infection control. CONCLUSIONS: The present study clarified that the process of aligning the perceptions of caregivers to the objectives and priorities of care for older people with dementia during COVID-19 pandemic strengthened the relationships among caregivers.

However, there is currently scant and inconsistent data regarding their proarrhythmic potential in these patients. Moreover, their risk profile in the setting of altered physiological states encountered in patients with COVID-19 (i.e. febrile state, electrolyte imbalances, and/or acidosis) is unknown. Experimental approach: Potency of hERG block was measured using high-throughput electrophysiology in the presence of variable environmental factors. These potencies informed simulations to predict population risk profiles. Effects on cardiac repolarisation were verified in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) from three separate individuals. Key Results: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine blocked hERG with IC50 of 1.470.07 M and 3.780.17 M respectively, indicating proarrhythmic risk at concentrations effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and proposed in COVID-19 clinical trials. Hypokalaemia and hypermagnesemia increased potency of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, indicating increased proarrhythmic risk. Acidosis significantly reduced potency of all drugs (i.e. reduced proarrhythmic risk), whereas increased temperature decreased potency of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine but increased potency for azithromycin. In silico simulations across genetically diverse populations predicted that 17% of individuals exhibit action potential durations >500 ms at the highest proposed therapeutic levels, equating to significant QT prolongation. Conclusion and Implications: Significant proarrhythmic risk is predicted for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at doses proposed to treat COVID-19.

Since December 2019, the SARS-COV-2 virus, which is the causative agent of COVID-19, has invaded the world causing high numbers of infections and deaths. The infection with SARS-COV-2 virus shows an abnormality in lung parenchyma that can be effectively detected using Computed Tomography (CT) imaging. In this paper, a novel computer aided framework (COV-CAF) is proposed for classifying the severity degree of the infection from 3D Chest Volumes. COV-CAF fuses traditional and deep learning approaches. The proposed COV-CAF consists of two phases: the preparatory phase and the feature analysis and classification phase. The preparatory phase handles 3D-CT volumes and presents an effective cut choice strategy for choosing informative CT slices. The feature analysis and classification phase incorporate fuzzy clustering for automatic Region of Interest (RoI) segmentation and feature fusion. In feature fusion, automatic features are extracted from a newly introduced Convolution Neural Network (Norm-VGG16) and are fused with spatial hand-crafted features extracted from segmented RoI. Experiments are conducted on MosMedData: Chest CT Scans with COVID-19 Related Findings with COVID-19 severity classes and SARS-COV-2 CT-Scan benchmark datasets.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we identify the RasCphosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway as a host-cell regulatory mechanism for influenza virus entry. The binding of Ras to PI3K is specifically involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis, endosomal maturation, and intracellular transport of viruses, which result in decreased infectious efficacy of different subtypes of influenza viruses in cells lacking the RasCPI3K interaction. Moreover, influenza virus infection indeed triggered Ras activation and subsequent PI3K activation in early endosomes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, these results demonstrate that the RasCPI3K signaling axis acts as a host-oriented mechanism for viral internalization. Given that virus incorporation is a process conserved among virus subtypes and species, this signaling pathway may provide a target for potent, well-tolerated prophylactics and therapeutics against a broad range of viruses.","output":"The RasCPI3K Signaling Pathway Is Involved in Clathrin-Independent Endocytosis and the Internalization of Influenza Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mathematical modeling of disease spreading plays a crucial role in understanding, controlling and preventing epidemic outbreaks. In a microscopic description of the propagation of a disease over the complex network of human contacts, the probability that an individual is in a given state (susceptible, infectious, recovered etc) depends on the state of its neighbors in the network. Thus it depends on the state of pairs of nodes, which in turns depends on triples, in a hierarchy of dynamical dependencies. In order to produce models that are at the same time reliable and manageable, one has to understand how to truncate such a hierarchy, and how the chosen order of approximation affects the ability of the model to forecast the real temporal evolution of an epidemics. In this paper we provide a systematic analysis of the reliability (under different hypotheses on the quantity and quality of available data) of the predictions obtained by truncating the hierarchy either at the level of individuals or at the level of pairs. We find that pair-based models are reliable tools both for estimating the epidemiological parameters and for forecasting the temporal evolution of the epidemics, under all conditions taken into account in our work. However, a pair-based approach provides a much better prediction of an individual-based one, only if better data, namely information on the state of node pairs, are available. Overall, our results suggest that more refined mathematical models need to be informed by improved contact tracing techniques to better support decision on policies and containment measures to adopt.","output":"Individual- and pair-based models of epidemic spreading: master equations and analysis of their forecasting capabilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in several countries of the world has created a state of public health emergency.

Of interest, a six-fold increase in the number of arrhythmic events was reported in patients with severe COVID-19. In this study, we reviewed (i) the pro-arrhythmic action of drugs given to patients with COVID-19 infection, and (ii) the effects of inflammatory cytokines on cardiac ion channels and possible generation of arrhythmias. Methods: We conducted a literature search on the drugs with purported or demonstrated efficacy against COVID-19 disease, emphasizing the mechanisms by which anti-COVID-19 drugs and inflammatory cytokines interfere with cardiac ion channels. Results:Antibiotics (azithromycin), antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine), antivirals (ritonavir/lopinavir, atazanavir), and some of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (vandetanib) could induce long QT and increase risk for ventricular arrhythmias. The pro-arrhythmic action results from drug-induced inhibition of Kv11.1 (hERG) channels interfering with the repolarizing potassium IKr currents, leading to long QT and increased risk of triggered arrhythmias. At higher concentrations, these drugs may interfere with IKs, IK1, and/or Ito potassium currents, and even inhibit sodium (INa) and calcium (ICa) currents, inducing additional cardiac toxicity. Ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Brutons TK, increased the incidence of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia associated with a short QT interval. Inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF- inhibit IKr and Ito repolarizing potassium currents. High levels of inflammatory cytokines could contribute to the arrhythmic events. For remdesivir, favipiravir, dexamethasone, tocilizumab, anakinra, baricitinib, and monoclonal antibodies (bamlanivimab, etesevimab, and casirivimab), no evidence supports significant effects on cardiac ion channels, changes in the QT interval, and increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias. Conclusion: This study supports the concept of hERG channel promiscuity. Different drug classes given to COVID-19 patients might delay repolarization, and increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. The presence of comorbid pro-arrhythmic disease states, and elevated levels of pro-arrhythmic cytokines, could increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Discontinuation of nonessential drugs and correction of electrolyte abnormalities could prevent severe ventricular arrhythmias. Altogether, the most effective therapies against COVID-19 (remdesivir, dexamethasone, monoclonal antibodies) lack pro-arrhythmic activity.","output":"Antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs to combat COVID-19: Effects on cardiac ion channels and risk of ventricular arrhythmias"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"United Nations and World Health Organization data show a positive correlation, r = .53, p < .0001, N = 189, between COVID\\\\19 infection rates and the human development index (HDI).

Health inequalities are those preventable differences in health status between groups that arise from the unequal opportunities and unequal distribution of resources related to health, which determine the risk of people getting ill, ability to prevent illness or opportunities to access medical care. Material and Methods: Literature search was done through relevant science databases. Available studies regarding health inequalities in context of COVID-19 pandemic were examined and presented in this review. Results and Conclusions: The higher risks of COVID-19 infection and mortality has been noticed for specific groups that are disproportionally affected by pandemic due to inequalities in the social determinants of health, such as living and working conditions, access to healthy food, opportunities for maintaining hygiene and access to healthcare. To understand why lower socioeconomic groups and minorities are more susceptible to infection, broader context of the pandemic has to be observed. Although the existence of virus is a key factor, differences in infection, prevalence, severity and mortality rates seem to be a result of a synergistic effect of the virus itself, social determinants of health and inequalities in pre-existing chronic diseases.

The introduction of multivalent vaccines has coincided with a dramatic decrease in the number of pneumococcal-related deaths. In spite of this, at a global level, pneumococcal infection remains an important cause of death among children under 5 years of age and in adults 65 years of age or older. In order to properly manage patients and control the spread of infection, a rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic method is needed for routine implementation, especially in resource-limited regions where pneumococcal disease is most prevalent. METHODS: Using the gene encoding leader peptidase A as a molecular diagnostics target, a real-time RPA assay was designed and optimised for the detection of S. pneumoniae in whole blood. The performance of the assay was compared to real-time PCR in terms of its analytical limit of detection and specificity. The inhibitory effect of human genomic DNA on amplification was investigated. The potential clinical utility of the assay was investigated using a small number of clinical samples. RESULTS: The RPA assay has a limit of detection equivalent to PCR (4.0 and 5.1 genome equivalents per reaction, respectively) and was capable of detecting the equivalent of <1 colony forming unit of S. pneumoniae when spiked into human whole blood. The RPA assay was 100 % inclusive (38/38 laboratory reference strains and 19/19 invasive clinical isolates) and 100 % exclusive; differentiating strains of S. pneumoniae species from other viridans group streptococci, including S. pseudopneumoniae. When applied to the analysis of a small number (n = 11) of clinical samples (blood culture positive for S. pneumoniae), the RPA assay was demonstrated to be both rapid and sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: The RPA assay developed in this work is shown to be as sensitive and as specific as PCR. In terms of reaction kinetics, the RPA assay is shown to exceed those of the PCR, with the RPA running to completion in 20 minutes and capable generating a positive signal in as little as 6 minutes.

(4) Communication issues: a need for clear, concise, understandable information readily accessible for young people was expressed. Up to now, they felt passive recipients rather than participants. CONCLUSION: Young people were concerned about their future, their family and broader society, consistent with a high level of moral development. They want to be active participants in social recovery, including concepts around return to school but require appropriate information and a means by which their voices can be heard. The alternative suggested roles as pawns or pathfinders were discounted.","output":"Young people's views on their role in the COVID-19 pandemic and society's recovery from it"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Changes in people's movement and travel behaviour have been apparent in many places during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, with differences seen at a range of spatial scales.

Among Western countries, Italy has been particularly hit at the beginning of the pandemic, immediately after China. In Italy and elsewhere, women seem to be less affected than men by severe/fatal COVID-19 infection, regardless of their age. Although women and men are affected differently by this infection, very few studies consider different therapeutic approaches for the two sexes. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these differences may help to find appropriate and sex specific therapies. Here, we consider that other mechanisms are involved to explain this difference, in addition to the protection attributable to oestrogens. Several X-linked genes (such as ACE2) and Y-linked genes (SRY and SOX9) may explain sex differences. Cardiovascular comorbidities are among the major enhancers of virus lethality. In addition, the number of sex-independent, non-genetic factors that can change susceptibility and mortality is enormous, and many other factors should be considered, including gender and cultural habits in different countries.","output":"Sex-related differences in COVID-19 lethality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last decades, interest toward athletes heart has progressively increased, leading to improve the knowledge on exercise-induced heart modifications.

Pathological alterations are often subtle at the initial stages; therefore, the challenge is to promptly identify athletes at risk of sudden cardiac death during the pre-participation screening protocols. Advanced imaging modalities such as coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can non-invasively depict coronary vessels and provide a deep morpho-functional and structural characterization of the myocardium, in order to rule out pathological life threatening alterations, which may overlap with athletes heart remodeling.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-two consecutive patients (15 SILS, 27 FPLC) undergoing elective cholecystectomy were included in the study. Peri-operative pain, well-being, body image and cosmesis were evaluated using validated assessment tools. RESULTS Significantly lower pain scores were reported one week post-operatively in the SILS group (5.6 vs 8.3; p = 0.035). No significant difference was found in analgesic requirements, physical or mental well-being at any time interval. Significantly higher (favourable) body image questionnaire scores were reported in the SILS group at one week (5.4 v 4.5; p < 0.01), two weeks (5.6 vs 4.8; p < 0.01) and one month (5.7 vs 5.0; p < 0.01) post-operatively. CONCLUSION SILS patients have significantly reduced one-week pain scores and there was no significant difference in well-being between the two groups.

These subjects develop local and systemic hyper-inflammation, which are associated with thrombotic complications and multi-organ failure. Therefore, understanding SARS-CoV-2 induced hyper-inflammation in elderly men is a pressing need. Here we focus on the role of extracellular DNA, mainly mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and telomeric DNA (telDNA) in the modulation of systemic inflammation in these subjects. In particular, extracellular mtDNA is regarded as a powerful trigger of the inflammatory response. On the contrary, extracellular telDNA pool is estimated to be capable of inhibiting a variety of inflammatory pathways. In turn, we underpin that telDNA reservoir is progressively depleted during aging, and that it is scarcer in men than in women. We propose that an increase in extracellular mtDNA, concomitant with the reduction of the anti-inflammatory telDNA reservoir may explain hyper-inflammation in elderly male affected by COVID-19.

A therapeutic drug that is effective against FIP has not yet been developed. Peptides based on viral protein amino acid sequences have recently been attracting attention as new antiviral drugs. In the present study, we synthesized 30 overlapping peptides based on the amino acid sequence of the S1 domain of the type I FIPV strain KU-2 S protein, and investigated their inhibitory effects on FIPV infection. To evaluate the inhibitory effects on type I FIPV infection of these peptides, we investigated a method to increase the infection efficiency of poorly replicative type I FIPV. The efficiency of type I FIPV infection was increased by diluting the virus with medium containing a polycation. Of the 30 peptides, I-S1-8 (S461-S480), I-S1-9 (S471-S490), I-S1-10 (S481-S500), I-S1-16 (S541-S560), and I-S1-22 (S601-S620) significantly decreased the infectivity of FIPV strain KU-2 while I-S1-9 and I-S1-16 exhibited marked inhibitory effects on FIPV infection. The inhibitory effects on FIPV infection of these 2 peptides on other type I and type II FIPV strains, feline herpesvirus (FHV), and feline calicivirus (FCV) were also examined. These 2 peptides specifically inhibited type I and type II FIPV, but did FHV or FCV infection. In conclusion, the possibility of peptides derived from the S protein of type I FIPV strain KU-2 as anti-FIPV agents effective not only for type I, but also type II FIPV was demonstrated in vitro.","output":"Identification of the peptide derived from S1 domain that inhibits type I and type II feline infectious peritonitis virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a pandemic with a novel disease, disease-specific prognosis models are available only with a delay.

To test the accuracy of such a knowledge transfer, we investigated how precise lethal courses in critically ill COVID-19 patients can be predicted by a model trained on critically ill non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia patients. We trained gradient boosted decision tree models on 718 (245 deceased) non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia patients to predict individual ICU mortality and applied it to 1054 (369 deceased) COVID-19 patients.

Blood 2020). Furthermore, venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been described as a common complication among patients with COVID-19 (Tang et al. J Thromb Haemost 2020). Patients with a history of HM who contract SARS-CoV-2 may be at an even higher risk for VTE, given their elevated baseline VTE risk; however, there is limited clinical data for this patient population. Therefore, we performed a retrospective chart review to evaluate clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and a history of HM. Methods: A REDCap database was created using all patients who were evaluated in the emergency department or admitted to MedStar Georgetown University Hospital/Washington Hospital Center with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test between March and May 2020. Data extraction was performed on all patients to identify demographic and clinical parameters. All data collected reflects clinical encounters related to COVID-19 infection. Our primary end-point was rate of VTE and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in patients with HM compared to the general population. Secondary outcomes assessed were COVID-19 related mortality, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rates, and length of ICU stay. Continuous variables were summarized by median quartiles (Q1 and Q3) and categorical variables were summarized by frequency counts and percentages for each category. The two-sample t-test for continuous variables and binomial exact test or Pearson chi square test for categorical variables were conducted to compare the means/distributions of each variable between HM patients and the general population, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to evaluate and compare the median overall survival (OS) between the two groups, exclusively for patients who died from COVID-19, censored at 28 days from admission. Results: As of July 1st, 2020, 737 pts with COVID-19 have been identified and included in this preliminary analysis. Twenty-two pts had a HM: plasma cell dyscrasia (n=7, 31.8%; multiple myeloma n=6, MGUS n=1), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=3, 13.6%), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n=2, 9.1%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=2, 9.1%), hodgkins lymphoma (n=2, 9.1%), and one patient (4.5%) with each of the following malignancies: acute promyelocytic leukemia, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma. With respect to HM treatment status, the majority of the patients were in surveillance (n=14, 63.6%); the other eight (36.4%) were on active treatment at time of COVID-19 infection. In patients who had a remission status documented, eight showed complete remission (36.4%), five with partial remission (22.7%), and one patient with progressive disease (4.5%). Six patients (27.3%) either did not yet have a remission status evaluated or were treatment na?ve. The HM cohort was found to be older (median age 72 vs. 55) and have a higher rate of historical VTE prior to COVID-19 infection (18.2% vs. 4.3%). Other demographic data for the HM cohort and the general population can be found in Table 1. CVA was more prevalent in the HM cohort compared to our general population cohort (11.1% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.048). Rates of VTE were not statistically different between the two groups (5.6% vs. 3.6%, p=0.494). A higher percentage of HM pts required ICU admission (40.9% vs. 19.2%, p = 0.0246). Our data suggested a trend towards higher rate of case fatality in the HM cohort (27.3% vs. 11.2%, p = 0.069) and a trend towards longer duration of ICU admission (9 days vs. 5 days, p=0.756). The median OS in fatal COVID-19 infection (Figure 1) was 9.5 days (95% CI, 7 to NA) in the HM cohort compared to 9 days (95% CI, 7 to 10, p=0.891) for the general population. Conclusion: Our preliminary findings suggest among patients with COVID-19, there is an increased incidence of CVA in HM patients, but similar rates of VTE when compared to the general population. Our HM cohort had higher rates of ICU admission, but did not have a statistically significant mortality difference at 28 days.

This study investigates the role of exogenous attention during VPL in adults with amblyopia, an ideal population given their asymmetrically developed, but highly plastic, visual cortex. Here we show that training on a discrimination task leads to improvements in foveal contrast sensitivity, acuity, and stereoacuity.

(18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]-FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) as a longitudinal noninvasive approach can be beneficial in providing biomarkers for host immune response. [(18)F]-FDG uptake is increased in activated immune cells in response to virus entry and can be localized by PET imaging. We used [(18)F]-FDG-PET/CT to investigate the host response developing in nonhuman primates after MERS-CoV exposure and applied kinetic modeling to monitor the influx rate constant (K(i)) in responsive lymphoid tissue. METHODS: Multiple [(18)F]-FDG-PET and CT images were acquired on a PET/CT clinical scanner modified to operate in a biosafety level 4 environment prior to and up to 29 days after MERS-CoV aerosol exposure. Time activity curves of various lymphoid tissues were reconstructed to follow the [(18)F]-FDG uptake for approximately 60 min (3,600 s). Image-derived input function was used to calculate K(i) for lymphoid tissues by Patlak plot. RESULTS: Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance revealed alterations in K(i) that was associated with the time point (p < 0.001) after virus exposure and the location of lymphoid tissue (p = 0.0004). As revealed by a statistically significant interaction (p < 0.0001) between these two factors, the pattern of K(i) changes over time differed between three locations but not between subjects. A distinguished pattern of statistically significant elevation in K(i) was observed in mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs) that correlated to K(i) changes in axillary LNs. Changes in LNs K(i) were concurrent with elevations of monocytes in peripheral blood. CONCLUSIONS: [(18)F]-FDG-PET is able to detect subtle changes in host immune response to contain a subclinical virus infection.

Methods: For identification of effective vaccine candidate against COVID-19, various immunoinformatics online tools and softwares were used to predict epitopes. Cytotoxic T cell epitopes, helper T cell epitopes, and B cell epitopes from three structural polyproteins (Spike, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid (SMN) based on the binding affinity towards MHC, antigenicity, non-allergenicity, and non-toxicity) were identified for vaccine development.

Here we characterized the DUB and IFN antagonism activities of the PLP domains of human coronavirus NL63 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus to determine if DUB activity mediates interferon antagonism. We found that NL63 PLP2 deconjugated ubiquitin (Ub) and the Ub-line molecule ISG15 from cellular substrates and processed both lysine-48- and lysine-63- linked polyubiquitin chains. This PLP2 DUB activity was dependent on an intact catalytic cysteine residue. We demonstrated that in contrast to PLP2 DUB activity, PLP2-mediated interferon antagonism did not require enzymatic activity. Furthermore, addition of an inhibitor that blocks coronavirus protease/DUB activity did not abrogate interferon antagonism. These results indicated that a component of coronavirus PLP-mediated interferon antagonism was independent of protease and DUB activity. Overall, these results demonstrate the multifunctional nature of the coronavirus PLP domain as a viral protease, DUB, and IFN antagonist and suggest that these independent activities may provide multiple targets for antiviral therapies.","output":"Deubiquitinating and interferon antagonism activities of coronavirus papain-like proteases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alcohol consumption and sleep disorders are both prevalent and relevant problems among college students, but the relationship between these conditions is unclear.

Treatment with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (aCD20) significantly reduced spike-specific and receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibody and memory B cell responses in most patients, an effect ameliorated with longer duration from last aCD20 treatment and extent of B cell reconstitution. By contrast, all patients with MS treated with aCD20 generated antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses after vaccination. Treatment with aCD20 skewed responses, compromising circulating follicular helper T (T(FH)) cell responses and augmenting CD8 T cell induction, while preserving type 1 helper T (T(H)1) cell priming.

Our aim was to examine the application of a patient-report measure of safety climate in an Irish population to understand patient perceptions of safety in general practice and identify potential areas for improvement. Specifically, our research questions were: 1. What are patients perceptions of SC in Irish general practice? 2. Do patient risk factors impact perceptions of SC? 3. Do patient responses to an open-ended question about safety enhance our understanding of patient safety beyond that obtained from a quantitative measure of SC? METHODS: The Patient Perspective of Safety in General Practice (PPS-GP) survey was distributed to primary care patients in Ireland. The survey consisted of both Likert-response items, and free-text entry questions in relation to the safety of care. A series of five separate hierarchical regressions were used to examine the relationship between a range of patient-related variables and each of the survey subscales. A deductive content analysis approach was used to code the free-text responses. RESULTS: A total of 584 completed online and paper surveys were received. Respondents generally had positive perceptions of safety across all five SC subscales of the PPS-GP. Regarding patient risk factors, younger age and being of non-Irish nationality were consistently associated with more negative SC perceptions. Analysis of the free-text responses revealed considerably poorer patient perceptions (n = 85, 65.4%) of the safety experience in primary care. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that despite being under-utilised, patients perceptions are a valuable source of information for measuring SC, with promising implications for safety improvement in general practice. Further consideration should be given to how best to utilise this data in order to improve safety in primary care.","output":"Patients perception of safety climate in Irish general practice: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in deaths in long-term care homes (LTCH).

This was a retrospective chart review of hip fracture patients from a suburban academic hospital on Long Island, New York, who presented from March 1 to May 30, 2020. Patient COVID-19 status, demographics, and hospital outcome measures were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using heteroscedastic t tests for quantitative variables and chi-square tests for qualitative variables. There were 82 patients in the 2020 cohort and 111 in the 2019 control group, representing a 29.9% decrease in cases. The 2020 cohort presented to the hospital an average of 2.77 days after injury compared with 1.15 days for the 2019 control group (P=.0976). Patients in the 2020 cohort were more likely to be discharged home than to rehabilitation (P<.0001) and tended to be discharged with oral anticoagulation (P=.0809). There was no increase in 1-, 3-, or 6-month complications or mortality. During the pandemic, fewer patients were admitted with hip fractures, and the time from injury to presentation doubled. Patients were significantly less likely to be discharged to rehabilitation and more were discharged with oral anticoagulants.

METHODS: Three primary databases were used, PubMed, LitCovid, and WHO. The final review articles reported acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in COVID-19-positive patients and were full-text, peer-reviewed articles. Articles which did not have patient data such as in vitro studies and articles with unclear inference were excluded. RESULTS: Out of 21 cases of ADEM, the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 was confirmed in 18 and suspected in 3. Among the neurological symptoms, altered consciousness was most common (7/21), followed by anosmia (3), paraplegia (3/21), brain stem involvement (3/21), sphincter involvement (2/21), and quadriplegia (1/21). Raised inflammatory markers were most commonly seen in 9/17. Central nervous system imaging was abnormal in 19 cases and unavailable in 2 cases. Fifteen patients were treated with corticosteroids, 11 patients received intravenous immunoglobulin, while 3 patients received convalescent plasma. Two patients needed surgical intervention. Complications included seizures (1), acute kidney injury and septicemic shock (1), raised intracranial pressure (1), and supraventricular tachycardia secondary to hydroxychloroquine (1). One patient recovered completely and one had good recovery with mild deficits. Thirteen patients had incomplete recovery with residual neurological deficit while three patients died as the consequence of the disease.

STUDY DESIGN: : A single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: : Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China, February 27 to March 27, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: : A total of 204 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were randomized into the treatment group and control group, consisting of 102 patients in each group. INTERVENTIONS: : In the treatment group, Q-14 was administered at 10 g (granules) twice daily for 14 days, plus standard care. In the control group, patients were provided standard care alone for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: : The primary outcome was the conversion time for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral assay. Adverse events were analyzed in the safety population. RESULTS: : Among the 204 patients, 195 were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. A totalof 149 patients (71 vs. 78 in the treatment and control groups, respectively) tested negative via the SARS-CoV-2 viral assay. There was no statistical significance in the conversion time between the treatment group and control group (full analysis set: median (interquartile range): 10.00 (9.00-11.00) vs. 10.00 (9.00-11.00); mean rank: 67.92 vs. 81.44; P=0.051.). The recovery time for fever was shorter in the treatment group than in the control group. The disappearance rate of symptomslike cough, fatigue, and chest discomfort was significantly higher in the treatment group. In chest computed tomography (CT) examinations, the overall evaluation of chest CT examination after treatment compared with baseline showed that more patients showed improvement in the treatment group.

In many of these studies of T\\\\cell memory, experimental viral immunologists go to great lengths to assure that their animal colonies are free of endogenous pathogens in order to design reproducible experiments. These experimental results are then thought to provide the basis for our understanding of human immune responses to viruses.

Prospective interviewees were identified through nonprobability and purposive sampling methods from May to July 2020. The primary outcomes were the critical considerations, as perceived by health system leaders, when redeploying health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic determined through thematic analysis of transcribed notes. Redeployment was defined as reassigning personnel to a different location or retraining personnel for a different task. RESULTS: Nine hospital leaders from 9 hospitals in 8 health systems located in 5 countries (United States, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea) were interviewed. Six hospitals in 5 health systems experienced a surge of critically ill patients with COVID-19, and the remaining 3 hospitals anticipated, but did not experience, a similar surge. Seven of 8 hospitals redeployed their health care workforce, and 1 had a redeployment plan in place but did not need to use it. Thematic analysis of the interview notes identified 3 themes representing effective practices and lessons learned when preparing and executing workforce redeployment: process, leadership, and communication. Critical considerations within each theme were identified. Because of the various expertise of redeployed personnel, retraining had to be customized and a decentralized flexible strategy was implemented. There were 3 concerns regarding redeployed personnel. These included the fear of becoming infected, the concern over their skills and patient safety, and concerns regarding professional loss (such as loss of education opportunities in their chosen profession). Transparency via multiple different types of communications is important to prevent the development of doubt and rumors.

We aimed to assess sequence variations that had evolved in virus genomes, giving greatest attention to the S gene. We also aimed to identify haplotypes that the variations may define and consider their geographic and chronologic distribution. Variations at 1930 positions that together cause 1203 amino acid changes were identified. The frequencies of changes normalized to lengths of genes and encoded proteins were relatively high in ORF3a and relatively low in M. A variation that causes an Asp614Gly near the receptor binding domain of S was found at high frequencies, and it was considered that this may contribute to the rapid spread of viruses with this variation. Our most important findings relate to haplotypes.

When compared to control sites, the number of teeth with a radicular groove that presented plaque and bleeding on probing was higher. The logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of radicular grooves was significantly associated with the presence of plaque (OR, 6.14, p < 0.001) and of bleeding on probing (OR, 2.91, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of radicular grooves increases the possibility of developing gingival inflammation by acting as a plaque retentive factor.","output":"Prevalence and Periodontal Conditions of Developmental Grooves in an Italian School of Dentistry and Dental Hygiene: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lipid droplets (LDs) contribute to key pathways important for the physiology and pathophysiology of cells. In a homeostatic view, LDs regulate the storage of neutral lipids, protein sequestration, removal of toxic lipids and cellular communication; however, recent advancements in the field show these organelles as essential for various cellular stress response mechanisms, including inflammation and immunity, with LDs acting as hubs that integrate metabolic and inflammatory processes. The accumulation of LDs has become a hallmark of infection, and is often thought to be virally driven; however, recent evidence is pointing to a role for the upregulation of LDs in the production of a successful immune response to viral infection. The fatty acids housed in LDs are also gaining interest due to the role that these lipid species play during viral infection, and their link to the synthesis of bioactive lipid mediators that have been found to have a very complex role in viral infection. This review explores the role of LDs and their subsequent lipid mediators during viral infections and poses a paradigm shift in thinking in the field, whereby LDs may play pivotal roles in protecting the host against viral infection.","output":"Lipid droplets and lipid mediators in viral infection and immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic that developed in late 2019 and early 2020 has caused thousands of deaths and has had an enormous impact on our health systems and economies.

These self-binding sequences represent opportunities for the development of biochemical tools and/or therapeutics. Here, we report on the identification of a putative self-binding -zipper-forming peptide within the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus spike (S) protein and its application in viral detection. Peptide array scanning of overlapping peptides covering the entire length of S protein identified 34 putative self-binding peptides of six clusters, five of which contained octapeptide core consensus sequences. The Cluster I consensus octapeptide sequence GINITNFR was predicted by the Eisenbergs 3D profile method to have high amyloid-like fibrillation potential through steric -zipper formation. Peptide C6 containing the Cluster I consensus sequence was shown to oligomerize and form amyloid-like fibrils. Taking advantage of this, C6 was further applied to detect the S protein expression in vitro by fluorescence staining. Meanwhile, the coiled-coil-forming Leu/Ile heptad repeat sequences within the S protein were under-represented during peptide array scanning, in agreement with that long peptide lengths were required to attain high helix-mediated interaction avidity. The data suggest that short -zipper-like self-binding peptides within the S protein could be identified through combining the peptide scanning and predictive methods, and could be exploited as biochemical detection reagents for viral infection.","output":"Identification and application of self-binding zipper-like sequences in SARS-CoV spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several determinants are suspected to be causal drivers for new cases of COVID-19 infection.

Based on this, we computed valid adjustment sets of the possible confounding factors. We collected data for Germany from publicly available sources (e.g. Robert Koch Institute, Germany's National Meteorological Service, Google) for 401 German districts over the period of 15 February to 8 July 2020, and estimated total causal effects based on our DAG analysis by negative binomial regression. Our analysis revealed favorable effects of increasing temperature, increased public mobility for essential shopping (grocery and pharmacy) or within residential areas, and awareness measured by COVID-19 burden, all of them reducing the outcome of newly reported COVID-19 cases. Conversely, we saw adverse effects leading to an increase in new COVID-19 cases for public mobility in retail and recreational areas or workplaces, awareness measured by searches for \\"corona\\" in Google, higher rainfall, and some socio-demographic factors. Non-pharmaceutical interventions were found to be effective in reducing case numbers.

However, the policy response to COVID-19 may rebound the emissions to their pre-pandemic levels. To design an efficient policy that considers both economic and environmental variables, this study uses a computable general equilibrium model that assesses how COVID-19 and its stimulus policy will affect the macroeconomic indicator, energy consumption, and emissions at the national and regional levels. The results show that macroeconomic indicators generally performed worse with the current stimulus policy in the short run than in the long run. Refined petroleum energy consumption took the highest hit, followed by coal-based energy consumption and overall electricity demand. The pattern in emissions reduction is similar to the pattern of gross domestic product declination as well. The Sulawesi region particularly experienced the largest decrease in refined petroleum energy consumption. In contrast, the Java-Bali and Sumatra regions experienced the most coal-based energy consumption reduction and the largest emissions reduction. Should COVID-19 provide the impetus to develop more environmentally sound economic development, we would need better policy to address the recovery. Returning to pre-pandemic development will not lead to long-term environmental gain. This study offers policy recommendations for economic recovery and environmental improvement.

Very little is known about the longitudinal change in these symptoms over time. Moreover, the effectiveness of clinical scales to detect early changes in PSP is still a matter of debate. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine longitudinal changes in PSP features using multiple closely spaced follow-up time points over a period of 2 years. Methods 28 healthy control and 28 PSP participants, with average time since onset of symptoms of 1.9 years, were prospectively studied every 3 months for up to 24 months. Changes from baseline scores were calculated at each follow-up time point using multiple clinical scales to identify longitudinal progression of motor and cognitive symptoms. RESULTS: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment, but not the Mini-Mental State Examination, detected cognitive decline at baseline. Both scales revealed poor longitudinal sensitivity to clinical change in global cognitive symptoms. Conversely, the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinsons disease Rating Scale C part III and the PSP Rating Scale (PSPRS) reliably detected motor decline less than 2 years after disease onset. The Gait/Midline PSPRS subscore consistently declined over time, with the earliest change being observed 6 months after baseline assessment. CONCLUSION: While better cognitive screening tools are still needed to monitor cognitive decline in PSP, motor decline is consistently captured by clinical rating scales.

Limits of quantitation (LoQs) of cabotegravir and rilpivirine are measured to be 750 ng/mL and 20 ng/mL, respectively. The assay turnaround time is < 4 min, and strong linear relationships are established between MS/MS responses and concentration, with percentage of relative standard deviations (RSDs) that are <15% at concentrations above the LoQs. The speed, portability, low power consumption, and specificity offered by the miniature instrument should make it an appropriate platform for measuring drug concentrations in a walk-in clinic using small volumes of patient blood.","output":"Miniature mass spectrometer-based point-of-care assay for cabotegravir and rilpivirine in whole blood"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]Adam-Bonci et al. found that vitamin D reduced the oxidative components and increased the antioxidant capacity of the serum and lung tissue in a mice model of induced acute asthmatic inflammation [8].

Additional information is needed to determine mental health status among school-aged children and adolescents during this public health crisis and the risk factors associated with psychological distress during the pandemic. Objective: To assess self-reported psychological distress among school-aged children and adolescents associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study using data from a survey on the mental health of school-aged children and adolescents in Guangdong province, China, conducted by using a stratified cluster random sampling method between March 8 to 30, 2020. To estimate outcomes associated with location of districts, only data from students with internet protocol addresses and current addresses in Guangdong were included. Data were analyzed from April 5 to July 20, 2020. Exposure: Home-based distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcome and Measures: The main outcome was self-reported psychological distress, measured using the total score on the 12-item General Health Questionnaire of 3 or greater. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors associated with mental health status. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to analyze the associations of factors with psychological distress. Results: Among 1a?310a?600 students who completed the survey, 1a?199a?320 students (mean [SD] age, 12.04 [3.01] years; 619a?144 [51.6%] boys) were included in the final analysis. A total of 126a?355 students (10.5%) self-reported psychological distress. Compared with students in primary school, high school students had increased risk of psychological distress (OR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.15-1.23]). Compared with students who wore a face mask frequently, students who never wore a face mask had increased risk of psychological distress (OR, 2.59 [95% CI, 2.41-2.79]). Additionally, students who spent less than 0.5 hours exercising had increased odds of self-reported psychological distress compared with students who spent more than 1 hour exercising (OR, 1.64 [95% CI, 1.61-1.67]). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that the prevalence of self-reported psychological distress among students during the COVID-19 pandemic was relatively high. Frequency of wearing a face mask and time spent exercising were factors associated with mental health. Therefore, it may be necessary for governments, schools, and families to pay attention to the mental health of school-aged children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic and take corresponding countermeasures to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students' mental health.","output":"Prevalence and Risk Factors Associated With Self-reported Psychological Distress Among Children and Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We investigated the holistic experiences of university students during the pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) on risk of contracting COVID-19 and subsequent adverse outcomes. METHODS: Rates of hospital-diagnosed COVID-19 were compared across strata of eGFR based on conditional logistic regression using a nested case-control framework with 1:4 matching of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with controls from the Danish general population on age, gender, diabetes and hypertension. Risk of subsequent severe COVID-19 or death was assessed in a cohort study with comparisons across strata of eGFR based on adjusted Cox regression models with G-computation of results to determine 60-day risk standardized to the distribution of risk factors in the sample. RESULTS: Estimated glomerular filtration rate was inversely associated with rate of hospital-diagnosed COVID-19: eGFR 61-90 mL/min/1.73m2 HR 1.13 (95% CI 1.03-1.25), P = 0.011; eGFR 46-60 mL/min/1.73m2 HR 1.26 (95% CI 1.06-1.50), P = 0.008; eGFR 31-45 mL/min/1.73m2 HR 1.68 (95% CI 1.34-2.11), P < 0.001; and eGFR &#8804; 30 mL/min/1.73m2 3.33 (95% CI 2.50-4.42), P < 0.001 (eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m2 as reference), and renal impairment was associated with progressive increase in standardized 60-day risk of death or severe COVID-19; eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73m2 13.9% (95% CI 9.7-15.0); eGFR 90-61 mL/min/1.73m2 16.1% (95% CI 14.5-17.7); eGFR 46-60 mL/min/1.73m2 17.8% (95% CI 14.7-21.2); eGFR 31-45 mL/min/1.73m2 22.6% (95% CI 18.2-26.2); and eGFR &#8804; 30 mL/min/1.73m2 23.6% (95% CI 18.1-29.1).

There is limited evidence evaluating patient experience of follow-ups and expectations into quality metrics. Our aim was to perform a service evaluation by prospectively evaluating the management and outcomes of plastic surgery patients. METHOD: Patients were consecutively assessed over the COVID-19 lockdown period, from March to May 2020. They ranged from urgent cancer cases to burns and trauma. We used a questionnaire to evaluate initial treatment, wound care, complications, and overall service. A validated health-related quality of life (HRQL) survey was used to assess the impact of injury or wound on lifestyle and we also assessed patient enablement. Correlation analysis determined relationships between outcomes, service evaluations and HRQL variables. RESULTS: 77 patients were consecutively treated in our unit, of which 46 completed the questionnaire. 42.2% used multimedia as mode of follow-up, including smart phones for messages and videocalls, and trust e-mails. There was a 3-fold increase in number of infections for non-face-to-face consultations, with a correlation significance of 0.043. We found no correlation between age and wound complication rates. 72.7% of patients found overall service very good or excellent. Although overall service satisfaction was similar for multimedia use and face-to-face consultations (p = 0.02), less patients were confident looking after their wound without face-to-face follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has brought upon an unprecedented change in practice in our department.

We further investigate the recovery duration for speech, swallowing, and hearing-related symptoms post-COVID. Design Survey study;E-survey. Methodology A total of 78 subjects (35.78 years  11.93) participated in the survey. All the participants were diagnosed with the RTPCR method. To understand the recovery duration for the speech, swallowing and hearing issues post-COVID-19, we conducted a three-phase study. Results In the first phase of the survey, 68 subjects reported symptoms related to speech, swallowing, and hearing issues 15 days of post-COVID recovery. A total of 76.4% of subjects reported only swallowing-related issues, 4.41% only speech-related issues, whereas 1.47% reported the problem in speech and hearing functions. The 2nd phase of the study was conducted after the first phase of the study. Only 22 subjects reported the presence of swallowing, speech and hearing-related issues from the 68 subjects. During the last phase, only 12 subjects reported speech, swallowing, and hearing issues. All subjects recovered from the olfaction and gustation impairment, whereas 50% of subjects reported the presence of xerostomia. Conclusion From the present study, we conclude that the SARC-CoV-2 virus directly affects the respiratory system and affects the aero-digestive system and laryngeal system physiology. Individuals with comorbid conditions admitted in ICU during COVID-19 treatment and prolonged hospital stay were at higher risk of developing speech, swallowing, and hearing-related issues post-COVID-19.

Supplemental oxygen (O2) can be added to most HMEs designed for spontaneously breathing tracheostomized patients. We tested the efficiency of 7 HMEs designed for spontaneously breathing tracheostomized patients, in a normothermic model, at different minute ventilations (VE) and supplemental O2 flows. METHODS HME efficiency was evaluated using an in vitro lung model at 2 VE (5 and 15 L/min) and 4 supplemental O2 flows (0, 3, 6, and 12 L/min). Wet and dry temperatures of the inspiratory flow were measured, and absolute humidity was calculated. In addition, HME efficiency at 0, 12, and 24 h use was evaluated, as well as resistance to flow at 0 and 24 h. RESULTS The progressive increase in O2 flow from 0 to 12 L/min was associated with a reduction in temperature and absolute humidity. Under the same conditions, this effect was greater at lower VE. The HME with the best performance provided an absolute humidity of 26 mg H2O/L and a temperature of 27.8 C. No significant changes in efficiency or resistance were detected during the 24 h evaluation.

This study aims to assess the frequency of infections, community and hospital-acquired infections, and risk factors for infections and mortality during severe COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective single-center study including consecutive patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for severe COVID-19. Competing-risk analyses were used to assess cumulative risk of infections. Time-dependent Cox and fine and gray models were used to assess risk factors for infections and mortality. Propensity score matching was performed to estimate the effect of dexamethasone. RESULTS: We included 100 patients including 34 patients with underlying malignancies or organ transplantation. First infectious event was bacterial for 35 patients, and fungal for one. Cumulative incidence of infectious events was 27% [18-35] at 10 ICU-days. Prevalence of community-acquired infections was 7% [2.8-13.9]. Incidence density of hospital-acquired infections was 125 [91-200] events per 1000 ICU-days. Risk factors independently associated with hospital-acquired infections included MV. Patient's severity and underlying malignancy were associated with mortality. Dexamethasone was associated with increased infections (36% [20-53] vs. 12% [4-20] cumulative incidence at day-10;p = 0.01). After matching, dexamethasone was associated with hospital-acquired infections (35% [18-52] vs. 13% [1-25] at 10 days, respectively, p = 0.03), except in the subset of patients requiring MV, and had no influence on mortality.

However, people with obesity regularly experience weight-related stigma and discrimination in sport and exercise settings. Research has indicated that they often cope with such experiences by simply excluding themselves from sport and exercise. Meanwhile, self-exclusion as a coping strategy has not been fully understood and it remains unclear to what extent self-exclusion from PA settings is accompanied by general inactivity among people with obesity. The goal of this interview study was to determine to what extent physical inactivity among adults with obesity is the result of weight stigma-induced self-exclusion in and from sport and PA settings. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with thirty adult men and women with obesity (average BMI: 40.64) and asked them about experiences with their body, weight stigma and coping behaviours in sport and exercise settings across their lifespans. Employing constant comparative analysis and a thematic network approach, we analysed the interview data to identify the most common reasons for and different strategies of self-exclusion. RESULTS: Participants reported that they excluded themselves from sport and exercise settings due to traumatic weight stigma experiences, self-discrimination and fear of stigma, using a variety of strategies. Exposure to discrimination was prevented by selectively avoiding certain settings or strategically frequenting them at certain times only, but also by exercising in safe spaces, e.g. at home. Furthermore, people with obesity reported strategically managing their social relations in order to avoid stigmatising reactions by others in exercise settings, for example by exercising individually and avoiding social PA. Most notably, our results strongly indicate that not all self-excluding coping strategies result in less exercising. CONCLUSIONS: In order to successfully promote physical activity among people with obesity, the various forms of self-exclusion should be taken into account as pathways of stigma regarding physical activity. People with obesity may exclude themselves from certain PA settings, yet could still be exercising on their own or in other ways. One focus of public health strategies should thus be directed at the potentially socially isolating effects.

The presence of antibodies against bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPI-3V) in the samples was detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Epidemiological data were obtained using a questionnaire administered to the owner or manager of each herd. RESULTS: The overall highest seroprevalence was observed for BHV-1 (94.7%), followed by BRSV (98.6%), BVDV (35.2%), and BPI-3V (47.1%). Regarding the seroprevalence by municipalities, there was a statistical association (p<0.05) for BVDV; however, for BRSV, BHV-1, and BPI-3V, no statistical association was found (p>0.05) between seropositive values and the municipalities, indicating that animal was seropositive in similar proportions in the three municipalities.

However, the role of host genetic polymorphisms in modulating maternal CMV status is inconclusive. This study investigated the possible association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in toll-like receptor (TLR) and cytokine genes with maternal plasma CMV DNA status in black Zimbabweans. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 110 women in late gestation who included 36 CMV infected cases and 74 CMV uninfected, age and HIV status matched controls were enrolled. Twenty single nucleotide polymorphisms in 10 genes which code for proteins involved in immunity against CMV were genotyped using Iplex GOLD SNP genotyping protocol on the Agena MassARRAY? system. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata SE and the Genetics and SNPassoc packages of the statistical package R. RESULTS: The TLR7 rs179008A > T (p < 0.001) polymorphism was associated while the TLR9 rs352139T > C (p = 0.049) polymorphism was on the borderline for association with CMV positive (CMV+) status. In contrast, the interleukin (IL)-6 rs10499563T > C (p < 0.001) and TLR2 rs1816702C > T (p = 0.001) polymorphisms were associated with CMV negative (CMV-) status. Furthermore, allele frequencies of SNPs in TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, TLR7, IL-6, IL-10, IL-28B, IL-1A and interferon AR1 (IFNAR1) genes are being reported here for the first time in a Zimbabwean population.

A wide variance in the access to kidney replacement therapies exists across the world with only 21% of low- and low-middle income countries (LLMIC) undertaking kidney transplantation. Pediatric kidney transplantation rates in these under-resourced regions are reported to be as low as < 4 pmcp [per million child population]. A robust kidney failure care program forms the cornerstone of a transplant program. Even the smallest transplant program entails a multidisciplinary workforce and expertise besides ensuring family commitment towards long-term care and economic burden. In general, the short-term graft survival rates from under-resourced regions are comparable to most high-income countries (HIC) and the challenge lies in the long-term outcomes. This review focuses on specific issues relevant to kidney transplants in children in under-resourced regions by highlighting limitations in the capacity and health workforce, regulatory norms, medical issues, economic burden, factors beyond financial hardship and ethical considerations relevant to these regions.

METHODS: An online survey was co\\\\developed with UK parents to understand the impact of the lockdown on parents' help\\\\seeking for, and care of, their sick/injured child(ren). The survey was advertised through social media and snowballing to parents whose children had been ill/injured during the lockdown. Analysis used descriptive statistics, SPSSv25 and thematic analysis. RESULTS: The survey was fully completed by 198 UK parents. The majority asked for help (144/198): from their family doctor (78), national helplines (48) or an Emergency Department (23). Most reported that their decision\\\\making had not changed, although how they sought help had changed. A few parents reported that the severity and duration of illness had increased because of uncertainty about and/or difficulty accessing services. Parents did not always report seeking help for symptoms rated red or amber by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Parents reported accessing information through the internet or using information that they already had. PARENT CONTRIBUTION: This was a collaboration with parents from survey development to dissemination, with two parents being integral members of our research team. CONCLUSIONS: Our questionnaire was completed by parents who were not deterred from seeking help for their sick or injured children.

For highly diverged sequences, such phylogenetic techniques sometimes estimate surprisingly recent divergence times. In the case of viruses, independent evidence indicates that the estimates of deep divergence times from molecular phylogenetics are sometimes too recent. This discrepancy is caused in part by inadequate models of purifying selection leading to branch-length underestimation. Here we examine the effect on branch-length estimation of using models that incorporate experimental measurements of purifying selection. We find that models informed by experimentally measured site-specific amino-acid preferences estimate longer deep branches on phylogenies of influenza virus hemagglutinin. This lengthening of branches is due to more realistic stationary states of the models, and is mostly independent of the branch-length extension from modeling site-to-site variation in amino-acid substitution rate. The branch-length extension from experimentally informed site-specific models is similar to that achieved by other approaches that allow the stationary state to vary across sites. However, the improvements from all of these site-specific but time homogeneous and site independent models are limited by the fact that a proteins amino-acid preferences gradually shift as it evolves. Overall, our work underscores the importance of modeling site-specific amino-acid preferences when estimating deep divergence timesbut also shows the inherent limitations of approaches that fail to account for how these preferences shift over time.","output":"Modeling site-specific amino-acid preferences deepens phylogenetic estimates of viral sequence divergence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is suggested to have a negative impact on mental health. To prevent the spread of Sars-CoV-2, governments worldwide have implemented different forms of public health measures ranging from physical distancing recommendations to stay-at-home orders, which have disrupted individuals' everyday life tremendously. However, evidence on the associations of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures with mental health are limited so far. In this study, we investigated the role of sociodemographic and COVID-19 related factors for immediate mental health consequences in a nationwide community sample of adults from Germany (N = 4335). Specifically, we examined the effects of different forms and levels of restriction resulting from public health measures (e.g. quarantine, stay-at-home order) on anxiety and depression symptomatology, health anxiety, loneliness, the occurrence of fearful spells, psychosocial distress and life-satisfaction. We found that higher restrictions due to lockdown measures, a greater reduction of social contacts and greater perceived changes in life were associated with higher mental health impairments. Importantly, a subjectively assumed but not an officially announced stay-at-home order was associated with poorer mental health.

In most models, $R$ is modeled as a universal constant for the virus across outbreak clusters and individuals -- effectively averaging out the inherent variability of the transmission process due to varying individual contact rates, population densities, demographics, or temporal factors amongst many. Yet, due to the exponential nature of epidemic growth, the error due to this simplification can be rapidly amplified and lead to inaccurate predictions and/or risk evaluation. From the statistical modeling perspective, the magnitude of the impact of this averaging remains an open question: how can this intrinsic variability be percolated into epidemic models, and how can its impact on uncertainty quantification and predictive scenarios be better quantified? In this paper, we propose to study this question through a Bayesian perspective, creating a bridge between the agent-based and compartmental approaches commonly used in the literature. After deriving a Bayesian model that captures at scale the heterogeneity of a population and environmental conditions, we simulate the spread of the epidemic as well as the impact of different social distancing strategies, and highlight the strong impact of this added variability on the reported results.

Measurement of this burden changed substantially over the first months, as surveillance was expanded to accommodate the escalating epidemic. Laboratory confirmation was initially restricted to clinical need (pillar 1) before expanding to community-wide symptomatics (pillar 2). This study aimed to ascertain whether biases in case data resulting from varying testing coverage could be addressed by drawing inference from COVID-19-related deaths. Methods: We fit a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to weekly COVID-19-related deaths per local authority (LTLA) throughout the first wave (1 January - 30 June 2020), with respect to the local epidemic timing and the age, deprivation and ethnic composition of its population. We drew predictions averaging these sources of case-fatality variation, and back-translated according to a population case fatality ratio estimated under community-wide testing. Results: A model including temporally- and spatially-correlated random effects best accommodated the observed variation in mortality, after accounting for local population characteristics. Final predictions suggest a total of 276,219-420,491 cases over the first wave - an increase of 19-81% from the reported. Conclusions: Limitations in testing capacity biased the observed trajectory of COVID-19 cases throughout the first wave. Basing inference on COVID-19-related mortality and higher-coverage testing later in the time period, we could explore the extent of this bias more explicitly.

Such models have the potential to be deployed on smartphones for fast, widespread, and low-resource testing.

Many studies revealed that laryngeal mask airway (LMA) might reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat. However, little is known about the use of a flexible reinforced LMA (FLMA) in thyroid surgery. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential benefits of FLMA compared with ETT on postoperative sore throat. METHODS In this prospective, single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, ninety-six patients aged 20-80 years, scheduled for elective radical thyroidectomy under general anesthesia were enrolled. They were randomly divided into ETT group and FLMA group. All the included patients received total intravenous anesthesia (with propofol, fentanyl and rocuronium) and controlled mechanical ventilation during the surgery. Cuff pressure of ETT and FLMA were strictly controlled. Incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat, numbness and hoarseness at 1, 24, and 48 h after surgery was evaluated and compared between the two groups. Incidence and severity of buckling during extubation and the hemodynamic profile during intubation were also recorded and compared. RESULTS The incidence of sore throat and hoarseness was significantly lower in FLMA group than those in ETT group at 1 h, 24 h and 48 h postoperatively, as well as the severity of sore throat. Compared to ETT group, there was a significantly lower incidence of buckling during extubation and less fluctuation of HR and BP at 1 min and 3 min after intubation in FLMA group.

We analyzed data from previous registries and studies to determine if there has been an improvement in times to reperfusion with increasing experience. METHODS We analyzed the pooled data from the Multi Mechanical Embolus Removal in Cerebral Ischemia (MERCI), MERCI Registry and Thrombectomy Revascularization of Large Vessel Occlusions (TREVO), and TREVO 2 trials and assessed times from last known normal to puncture, from hospital arrival to puncture, and procedure duration by year to determine if there has been a reduction in times. Demographic, radiographic, and clinical information were also assessed in a multivariate regression analysis to determine the predictors of good outcomes defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months. RESULTS 1248 patients of mean age 6814 years and median NIH Stroke Scale score 18 were analyzed from 2001 to 2011. Procedure times showed a significant improvement while last known normal to puncture times remained static. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, longer last known normal to puncture time and longer procedure duration were associated with a decreased chance of a good outcome (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.92, p=0.0004 and OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.91, p=0.0040, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Despite a reduction in procedure times, there has not been a corresponding improvement in overall last known normal to puncture times over a 10-year period.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an observational, prospective, single-center study of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized with moderate to severe ARDS, connected to mechanical ventilation in the ICU between March 17 and July 31, 2020. We examined their general and clinical characteristics. Time-to-intubation was the time from hospital admission to endotracheal intubation. RESULTS: We included 183 consecutive patients; 28% were female, and median age was 62 years old. Eighty-eight patients (48%) were intubated before 48 h (early) and ninety-five (52%) after 48 h (late). Patients intubated early had similar admission PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (123 vs 99; p = 0.179) but were younger (59 vs 64; p = 0.013) and had higher body mass index (30 vs 28; p = 0.006) compared to patients intubated late. Mortality was higher in patients intubated late (18% versus 43%), with admission PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio < 100 mmHg (OR 5.2; p = 0.011), of older age (OR 1.1; p = 0.001), and with previous use of ACE inhibitors (OR 4.8; p = 0.026).

In Candida albicans, the categorical agreement (CA) was 79.2%, 91.7%, 95.8%, and 95.8% for fluconazole, voriconazole, micafungin, and caspofungin, respectively. About 12.5% and 4.2% of very major errors were detected for fluconazole and voriconazole, respectively. C. glabrata showed excellent essential agreements (EAs) (>90%) for azoles but different MIC distributions for fluconazole and caspofungin. The CA between BMD fluconazole MICs and YS08 voriconazole MICs by the method-specific clinical breakpoint (CBP) was 90% in C. glabrata. Over 80% of C. glabrata and C. krusei isolates identified as micafunginCsusceptible were labeled intermediate or resistant to caspofungin in YS08. In C. parapsilosis, 5.3% of very major errors and 10.5% of minor errors were found, whereas 33.3% of minor errors were observed in C. tropicalis for fluconazole. For C. tropicalis, 13 (61.9%) non-wild type (WT) isolates of fluconazole and 7 (33.3%) non-WTs of voriconazole were classified in YS08 as WT. For C. auris, the EAs were 93.3%, 100%, 82.2%, 97.8%, and 97.8% for fluconazole, voriconazole, micafungin, caspofungin, and amphotericin B, respectively. YS08 showed comparable results to the BMD. However, considering the lower YS08 fluconazole MIC results compared with BMD in Candida species and YS08 caspofungin results in C. glabrata and C. krusei, improvements are needed. IMPORTANCE The new Vitek 2 ASTCYS08 (YS08) card has been updated to reflect the recently revised Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. In this study, antifungal drug susceptibility tests were performed using the YS08 card and compared with the CLSI broth microdilution (BMD) method. In conclusion, YS08 showed similar results to BMD, including with C. auris. However, about 12.5% and 4.2% of major errors were detected for fluconazole and voriconazole, respectively, in C. albicans. More than 80% of C. glabrata and C. krusei isolates identified as susceptible to micafungin were labeled moderate or resistant to caspofungin in YS08. The categorical agreement between BMD fluconazole MICs and YS08 voriconazole MICs was 90% by the method-specific CBP of voriconazole, 80% by the current epidemiological cutoff value (ECV) (0.25 g/mL) of voriconazole, and 85% by the previous ECV (0.5 g/mL) of voriconazole.

Pleural effusions continue to be a complication that affect many surgical patients and are associated with increased morbidity, many times requiring readmission and additional invasive procedures. The risks for development of pleural effusion after hospital discharge are ill-defined, which leads to uncertainty related to strategies for prevention. Our primary objective was to determine, in patients with CHD requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, the prevalence of post-surgical pleural effusions leading to readmission. The secondary objective was to identify risk factors associated with post-surgical pleural effusions requiring readmission. We identified 4417 citations; 10 full-text articles were included in the final review. Of the included studies, eight focused on single-ventricle palliation, one looked at Tetralogy of Fallot patients, and another on pleural effusion in the setting of post-pericardiotomy syndrome. Using a random-effect model, the overall prevalence of pleural effusion requiring readmission was 10.2% (95% CI 4.6; 17.6). Heterogeneity was high (I2 = 91%). In a subpopulation of patients after single-ventricle palliation, the prevalence was 13.0% (95% CI 6.0;21.0), whereas it was 3.0% (95% CI 0.4;6.75) in patients mostly with biventricular physiology. We were unable to accurately assess risk factors. A better understanding of this complication with a focus on single-ventricle physiology will allow for improved risk stratification, family counseling, and earlier recognition of pleural effusion in this patient population.","output":"Pleural Effusions After Congenital Cardiac Surgery Requiring Readmission: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oil and gas, in today's world of diminishing demand and price will not be able to save the finances of the state and, even worse, Sonatrach itself appears to be about to go through yet another corruption scandal, this time involving the appointment of Yamina Hakkar, the wife of the state company's chief executive officer, Toufik Hakkar, as head of the health, safety and environment department of the company Tunisia The role of the state in the other two major countries of the Maghrib has been rather more problematic than has been the case recently in Algeria and Morocco Since the beginning of 2021, the states of the Maghrib have sought to reassert themselves and to increasingly challenge popular resentment despite the severe challenges they face in doing so For the present, though, Morocco has intensified its campaign to win over other states to accept its sovereignty over the Western Sahara, especially now that the Trump administration, in its dying days, had endorsed its claim, apparently in return for Morocco's willingness to join the Abraham Accord and renew diplomatic relations with Israel - a development which the new Biden administration seems unlikely to reverse (Joff [3]) [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Journal of North African Studies is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Back to the future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has created a wave of uncertainty for nurses and healthcare practitioners, with new information on the virus being released constantly Paul Silverston discusses the assessment of patients with symptoms of COVID-19 and how to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis Errors in diagnosis are relatively common in primary care which often result in serious harm to patients The majority of these errors are preventable This article describes a diagnostic error checklist, SAFER PRACTICES, which can be used to help clinicians prepare themselves for consulting in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 disease so that they come to the consultation with the correct medical knowledge, clinical assessment plan and diagnostic reasoning required to reduce the risk of diagnostic error It can also be used during the consultation to deliver a systematic approach to the prevention and detection of diagnostic errors","output":"SAFER PRACTICES in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since its first isolation in 2005, Human Bocavirus (HBoV) has been repeatedly associated with acute respiratory tract infections, although its role in pathogenicity remains unclear due to high co-infection rates. OBJECTIVES: To assess HBoV prevalence and associated disease in a cohort of respiratory patients in the East Midlands, UK between 2015 and 2019. STUDY DESIGN: We initially investigated the undiagnosed burden of HBoV in a retrospective paediatric cohort sampled between 2015 and 2017 using an in-house PCR assay. HBoV was subsequently incorporated into the standard respiratory diagnostic pathway and we audited a calendar year of HBoV positive results between 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Our retrospective PCR screening of previously routine diagnostic-negative samples from juvenile patients identified a 9% (n = 30) prevalence of HBoV type 1. These apparentHBoV1 mono-infections were frequently associated with respiratory tract symptoms, often severe including ventilation, oxygen and steroid intervention with 31% (n = 9) of individuals requiring intensive care. When HBoV screening was subsequently adopted into the routine respiratory diagnostic pathway, year-round infections were observed in both children and adults peaking in February. 185 of 9098 (2.03%) individuals were found to be HBoV positive with children aged 12-24 months the principally infected group. However, HBoV infection was also observed in patients aged over 60, predominantly as a mono-infection. 23% of the 185 unique patients were HBoV monoinfectedand persistent low-level DNA positivity was observed in 15 individuals up to 6-months after initial presentation.

While subjective clinician assessment of functional capacity is poorly predictive of postoperative outcomes, other objective functional assessment measures may provide more useful information. RECENT FINDINGS: Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is generally accepted as the gold standard for functional capacity assessment. However, CPET is resource-intensive and not universally available. Simpler objective tests of functional capacity such as the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) and the 6-min walk test (6MWT) are cheap and efficient. In addition, they predict important postoperative outcomes including death, disability, and myocardial infarction.

A principal defence against uncontrolled inflammation, and against viral infection in general, is provided by T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs). Treg levels have been reported to be low in many COVID-19 patients and can be increased by vitamin D supplementation. Low vitamin D levels have been associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines and a significantly increased risk of pneumonia and viral upper respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase in thrombotic episodes, which are frequently observed in COVID-19. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to occur more frequently in patients with obesity and diabetes. These conditions are reported to carry a higher mortality in COVID-19.

Membrane transporters, both at the plasma and intracellular membranes, are key players in maintaining a finely tuned pH balance between intra- and extracellular spaces, and therefore in cellular homeostasis. V-ATPase is a housekeeping ATP-driven proton pump highly conserved among prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This proton pump, which exhibits a complex multisubunit structure based on cell type-specific isoforms, is essential for pH regulation and for a multitude of ubiquitous and specialized functions. Thus, it is not surprising that V-ATPase aberrant overexpression, mislocalization, and mutations in V-ATPase subunit-encoding genes have been associated with several human diseases. However, the ubiquitous expression of this transporter and the high toxicity driven by its off-target inhibition, renders V-ATPase-directed therapies very challenging and increases the need for selective strategies. Here we review emerging evidence linking V-ATPase and both inherited and acquired human diseases, explore the therapeutic challenges and opportunities envisaged from recent data, and advance future research avenues. We highlight the importance of V-ATPases with unique subunit isoform molecular signatures and disease-associated isoforms to design selective V-ATPase-directed therapies. We also discuss the rational design of drug development pipelines and cutting-edge methodological approaches toward V-ATPase-centered drug discovery. Diseases like cancer, osteoporosis, and even fungal infections can benefit from V-ATPase-directed therapies.","output":"Emerging insights on the role of V-ATPase in human diseases: Therapeutic challenges and opportunities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Walking activity in persons with Parkinson disease (PD) is important for preventing functional decline. The contribution of walking activity to home and community mobility in PD is poorly understood. METHODS Cross-sectional baseline data (N = 69) were analyzed from a randomized controlled PD trial. The Life-Space Assessment (LSA) quantified the extent, frequency, and independence across 5 expanding levels of home and community mobility, producing individual subscores and a total score. Two additional summed scores were used to represent mobility within (Levels 1-3) and beyond (Levels 4-5) neighborhood limits. An accelerometer measured walking activity for 7 days. Regression and correlation analyses evaluated relationships between daily steps and mobility scores. Mann-Whitney U tests secondarily compared differences in mobility scores between the active and sedentary groups. RESULTS Walking activity contributed significantly to the summed Level 1-3 score ( = 0.001, P = 0.004) but not to the summed Level 4-5 ( = 0.001, P = 0.33) or total ( = 0.002, P = 0.07) scores. Walking activity was significantly related to Level 1 ( = 0.336, P = 0.005), Level 2 ( = 0.307, P = 0.010), and Level 3 ( = 0.314, P = 0.009) subscores. Only the summed Level 1-3 score (P = 0.030) was significantly different between the active and sedentary groups. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Persons with PD who demonstrated greater mobility beyond the neighborhood were not necessarily more active; walking activity contributed more so to home and neighborhood mobility. Compared with LSA total score, the Level 1-3 summed score may be a more useful participation-level measure for assessing the impact of changes in walking activity.

Firms choose production levels and input combinations using prices that emerge from local interactions. Nothing forbids trade at out-of-equilibrium prices. In such a setting, disequilibrium spills over from one market to another due to their interconnections. These disequilibrium dynamics are capable of generating unemployment when labor released by contracting firms are not frictionlessly absorbed by expanding firms.

Intranasal infection of K18-hACE2 mice with 105 plaque-forming units of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 100% mortality by day 6 after infection.

Onset of severe disease in infected mice correlated with peak viral levels in the brain. SARS-CoV-2-infected mice exhibited encephalitis hallmarks characterized by production of cytokines and chemokines, leukocyte infiltration, hemorrhage and neuronal cell death. SARS-CoV-2 was also found to productively infect cells within the nasal turbinate, eye and olfactory bulb, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain by this route after intranasal infection.

Some of the viral diseases can be cured by approved antiviral drugs, but for others still do not have any vaccines or drugs available. Most of the approved antiviral drugs are somehow directly or indirectly associated with side effects, which eventually raise the need for the development of antivirals based on natural phytochemicals. Globally, the development of antivirals is shifting towards the plant-derived products as they are less toxic and has less chance to develop resistance. Phytochemicals have been exploited traditionally for the cure of many diseases, and also have been reported to inhibit viral replication/transcription. Most of them inhibit the viruses either during the viral entry inside the host cell or during their replication. Moreover, 50% of the drugs derived from plants are being used in the Western nations. Plants have a variety of phytochemicals like flavonoids, terpenoids, lignins, alkaloids, and coumarins that are having antioxidant activity, and help to inhibit viral genome. Various plant-derived products have been well studied against viruses like herpes virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, and hepatitis virus. More recently, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by a newly identified coronavirus has become pandemic, and affected worlds population severely.

Unintentional deaths due to opioid overdoses have continued to rise inexorably. While opioid overdose antidotes such as naloxone, and nalmefene are available, these must be administered within a critical time window to be effective. Unfortunately, opioid-overdoses may occur in the absence of antidote, or may be unwitnessed, and the rapid onset of cognitive impairment and unconsciousness, which frequently accompany an overdose may render self-administration of an antidote impossible. Thus, many lives are lost because: (1) an opioid overdose is not anticipated (i.e., monitored/detected), and (2) antidote is either not present, and/or not administered within the critical frame of effectiveness. Currently lacking is a non-invasive means of automatically detecting, reporting, and treating such overdoses. To address this problem, we have designed a wearable, on-demand system that comprises a safe, compact, non-invasive device which can monitor, and effectively deliver an antidote without human intervention, and report the opioid overdose event. A novel feature of our device is a needle-stow chamber that stores needles in a sterile state and inserts needles into tissue only when drug delivery is needed. The system uses a microcontroller which continuously monitors respiratory status as assessed by reflex pulse oximetry. When the oximeter detects the wearers percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen to be less than or equal to 90%, which is an indication of impending respiratory failure in otherwise healthy individuals, the microcontroller initiates a sequence of events that simultaneously results in the subcutaneous administration of opioid antidote, nalmefene, and transmission of a GPS-trackable 911 alert. The device is compact (4  3  3 cm), adhesively attaches to the skin, and can be conveniently worn on the arm. Furthermore, this device permits a centralized remotely accessible system for effective institutional, large-scale intervention.

An audiovisual online streaming system was tested, allowing a neurointerventional specialist located at a neurovascular center to supervise and instruct a thrombectomy performed at a distant hospital without being physically present (remote streaming support [RESS]). METHODS In total, 36 thrombectomy procedures were performed on a Mentice endovascular simulator by six radiologists not specialized in neurointerventions. Each radiologist was challenged with six different endovascular simulation scenarios under alternating conventional local support (specialist inside the room [LOS]) and RESS, which was performed using an advanced live streaming platform. RESULTS Both support modes led to a median of 2 attempts (interquartile range [IQR] 2.0-2.0 each) until successful recanalization. There was no statistically significant difference in time from first catheter insertion to recanalization between LOS (median 24.9 min, IQR 21.0-31.5 min) and RESS (23.9 min, IQR 21.7-28.7 min, p = 0.89). The percentage of thrombi covered by the stent-retriever and average speed when retrieving the stent-retriever (3.7 mm/s, IQR 3.25-5.35 mm/s vs. 3.6 mm/sec, IQR 2.5-4.7) were similar in both groups. Fluoroscopy time did not differ (19.0 min, IQR 16.9-23.5 min vs. 19.9 min, IQR 15.9-23.5 min) with a trend towards increased median amounts of contrast medium used under RESS (62.9 ml vs. 43.1 ml; p = 0.055). CONCLUSION This study confirmed the feasibility of RESS for thrombectomy procedures in a simulated environment. This serves as basis for future studies planned to analyze the effectiveness of RESS in a real-world environment and to test if it improves the learning curve of interventionalists with limited thrombectomy experience in remote areas.","output":"Training and Supervision of Thrombectomy by Remote Live Streaming Support (RESS) : Randomized Comparison Using Simulated Stroke Interventions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Liver injury has been noted during the disease course of the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) We evaluated for ethnic and racial disparities in COVID-19 patients presenting with liver injury METHODS: We reviewed 11,265 individual patient charts with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to our 12 hospitals in our health system between March 1 to April 30, 2020 Race and ethnicity data were collected by self-report in pre-specified categories Race categories included white, black, asian, other/multiracial and unknown, while ethnicity included non-Hispanic, Hispanic and unknown Baseline liver chemistries were collected within 24 hours of presentation Exclusion criteria included age less than 18 years and missing baseline data Patients were categorized as having liver injury if they had any elevation above the upper limit of normal set by American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases in alanine aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or bilirubin Multivariate analysis was performed after adjusting for covariates RESULTS: After exclusion,10,856 patients were included in our study Overall, there was a significant difference of the prevalence of liver injury amongst the various races and ethnicities (Table 1) On adjusted analysis, Asian (OR: 1 65 [95% CI: [1 37-2 02]) and multi-racial patients (OR: 1 65 [95% CI: 1 37-2 02]) were more likely to develop liver injury compared to white patients A non-Hispanic ethnicity had a lower association with sustaining liver injury (OR: 0 77 [95% CI: [0 75-1 03]) (Table 2) CONCLUSION: There are racial and ethnic disparities seen in patients with liver injury during COVID-19 infection Our data suggest that Asian patients are more likely compared to white patients to sustain liver injury Non-Hispanic ethnicity conferred protective effect against liver injury These results may implicate a component underlying genetic predisposition for liver injury during COVID- 19 infection (Table Presented)","output":"Racial/ethnic disparities of liver injury in COVID-19 infected patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians have a relatively high prevalence of multimorbidity requiring treatment with medications.

METHOD: This cross-sectional study involving five Aboriginal communities (two in metropolitan Sydney and three on the mid-north coast of New South Wales) used a structured interview process to assess cognition, depression, and activities of daily living for a cohort of older adults (aged 60 years and over). Participants also reported on their health status, medical history, and prescription medications during the interview. ACB was calculated, and its association with adverse health outcomes including cognitive impairment, falls, hospitalization, and depressive symptoms were examined. RESULTS: Most participants (95%) were taking at least one regular medication with polypharmacy (&#8805;5 medications) observed in 43% of participants; 12.2% had a significant ACB (&#8805;3) with antidepressants being a major contributor. Anticholinergic medication use was associated with cognitive impairment, recent hospitalization (past 12 months), and depressive symptoms. After controlling for age, sex, and comorbidity, only the presence of depressive symptoms remained significantly associated with the use of anticholinergic medication (odds ratio 2.86; 95% confidence interval 1.48-5.51).

However, a passage which described how mealworm flour is produced, did significantly reduce disgust. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that written passages can alter the disgust response, notably resulting in a maintenance of food intake. Interventions that increase the perception of familiarity of a novel food, but not logic-based arguments, may be a key driver of the amelioration of disgust.

Methods: In this study, we investigated the performance of key soluble endothelial injury biomarkers, including intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), von Willebrand Factor (vWF) antigen, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (vegfr1), angiopoietin 1 and 2 (Ang1, 2) as mortality predictors in liver cirrhosis patients with severe covid-19 or bacterial sepsis. Results: A total of 66 hospitalized patients [admitted in covid-19 ward or liver intensive care unit (ICU)] were included. 22 patients had covid-19 alone while 20 patients had cirrhosis plus covid-19. 24 patients had liver cirrhosis plus bacterial sepsis. Among cirrhosis patients, most common aetiology was alcohol. ICAM1 was increased (p=0.003) while vegfr1 (p<0.0001) and Ang1 (p<0.0001) were reduced in covid-19 patients with cirrhosis, as compared to covid-19 patients alone. Endothelial biomarkers between cirrhosis patients with severe covid-19 or with bacterial sepsis in the ICUs did not differ significantly. In these patients, ICAM1 levels significantly and independently predicted mortality (HR:3.24;1.19-8.86) along with MELD, renal and coagulation failures.

SFC is defined as a logically connected list of ordered Service Functions (SFs) that require high availability to maintain user experience. The SFC protection mechanism is one way to ensure high availability, and it is achieved by proactively deploying backup SFs and installing backup paths in the network. Recent studies focused on ensuring the availability of backup SFs, but overlooked SFC unavailability due to network failures. This paper extends our previous work to propose a Hybrid Protection mechanism for SFC (HP-SFC) that divides SFC into segments and combines the merits of local and global failure recovery approaches to define an installation policy for backup paths. A novel labeling technique labels SFs instead of SFC, and they are stacked as per the order of SFs in a particular SFC before being inserted into a packet header for traffic steering through segment routing. The emulation results showed that HP-SFC recovered SFC from failure within 20C25 ms depending on the topology and reduced backup paths flow entries by at least 8.9% and 64.5% at most. Moreover, the results confirmed that the segmentation approach made HP-SFC less susceptible to changes in network topology than other protection schemes.","output":"HP-SFC: Hybrid Protection Mechanism Using Source Routing for Service Function Chaining"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Damage in COVID-19 results from both the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its triggered overreactive host immune responses. Therapeutic agents that focus solely on reducing viral load or hyperinflammation fail to provide satisfying outcomes in all cases. Although viral and cellular factors have been extensively profiled to identify potential anti-COVID targets, new drugs with significant efficacy remain to be developed. Here, we report the potent preclinical efficacy of ALD-R491, a vimentin-targeting small molecule compound, in treating COVID-19 through its host-directed antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions. We found that by altering the physical properties of vimentin filaments, ALD-491 affected general cellular processes as well as specific cellular functions relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, ALD-R491 reduced endocytosis, endosomal trafficking, and exosomal release, thus impeding the entry and egress of the virus; increased the microcidal capacity of macrophages, thus facilitating the pathogen clearance; and enhanced the activity of regulatory T cells, therefore suppressing the overreactive immune responses. In cultured cells, ALD-R491 potently inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2-mediated pseudoviral infection. In aged mice with ongoing, productive SARS-CoV-2 infection, ALD-R491 reduced disease symptoms as well as lung damage. In rats, ALD-R491 also reduced bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis. Our results indicate a unique mechanism and significant therapeutic potential for ALD-R491 against COVID-19. We anticipate that ALD-R491, an oral, fast-acting, and non-toxic agent targeting the cellular protein with multipart actions, will be convenient, safe, and broadly effective, regardless of viral mutations, for patients with early- or late-stage disease, post-COVID complications and other related diseases. IMPORTANCE With the Delta variant currently fueling a resurgence of new infections in the fully-vaccinated population, developing an effective therapeutic drug is especially critical and urgent in fighting COVID-19. In contrast to the many efforts to repurpose existing drugs or address only one aspect of COVID-19, we are developing a novel agent with first-in-class mechanism-of-actions that address both the viral infection and the overactive immune system in the pathogenesis of the disease. Unlike virus-directed therapeutics that may lose efficacy due to viral mutations and immunosuppressants that require ideal timing to be effective, this agent, with its unique host-directed antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions, can work against all variants of the virus, be effective during all stages of the disease, and even resolve post-disease damage and complications. A further development of the compound will provide an important tool in the fight against COVID-19, its complications, as well as future outbreaks of new viruses.","output":"A vimentin-targeting oral compound with host-directed antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions addresses multiple features of COVID-19 and related diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To convert and store energy in the process of photosynthesis, plants primarily use quanta of the red and blue parts of the spectrum. At high latitudes, the average daily intensity of red and blue parts of the spectrum is not very high; for many crops cultivated under greenhouse conditions, it reaches the sufficient level only on clear summer days. The problem of insufficient illumination in greenhouses is usually solved with artificial light sources. This article describes a technology for the manufacture of photoconversion fluoropolymer films for greenhouses. The fluoropolymer films described in the paper make use of original gold nanoparticles and nanoparticles with fluorescence in the blue or red region of the spectrum. In the polymer film, nanoparticles aggregate in the form of \\"beads\\", which enhances the field of the optical wave. The film photoconverts UV and violet light into blue and red light. Gold nanoparticles also partially convert energy in the green region of the spectrum (not used by plants) into heat, which is also important for agriculture at high latitudes. In addition, impregnation of gold nanoparticles into fluoropolymer significantly increases the lifetime of the film. The films described in the paper can significantly increase the productivity of greenhouses located at high latitudes. Plants cultivated under the films have more chlorophyll and a higher intensity of photosynthesis - although their system of distance stress signals is, to a certain degree, suppressed.","output":"Development and application of photoconversion fluoropolymer films for greenhouses located at high or polar latitudes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical imaging methods are assuming a greater role in the workup of patients with COVID-19, mainly in relation to the primary manifestation of pulmonary disease and the tissue distribution of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor.

In order to support the demand for testing surgical masks in the Italian context, Universities provided their contribution by setting up laboratories for testing mask performance before releasing products into the national market. This paper reports the effort of seven Italian university laboratories who set up facilities for testing face masks during the emergency period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Measurement set-ups were built, adapting the methods specified in the EN 14683:2019+AC. Data on differential pressure (DP) and bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) of 120 masks, including different materials and designs, were collected over three months. More than 60% of the masks satisfied requirements for DP and BFE set by the standard. Masks made of nonwoven polypropylene with at least three layers (spunbondedCmeltblownCspunbonded) showed the best results, ensuring both good breathability and high filtration efficiency. The majority of the masks created with alternative materials and designs did not comply with both standard requirements, resulting in suitability only as community masks.

Clinical and laboratory data from hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections during the period October 2016CMarch 2019 were analysed. The retrospective analysis included 17 viral agents detected by FilmArray test and clinical data from medical records and hospital discharge sheets. Models were adjusted for relevant confounders such as clinical severity and risk of death, socio-demographic characteristics and surgical procedures. From a total of 539 specimens analysed, 180 (33.39%) were positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Among them, 83 (46.1 %) were positive for influenza viruses (FLU), 36 (20%) rhino/enteroviruses (RHV/EV), 17 (9.44%) human coronaviruses (HCOV-229E, -HKU1, -NL63, and -OC43), 17 (9.44%) respiratory syncytial virus, 15 (8.33%) human metapneumovirus (HMPV), 8 (4.44%) parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and 4 (2.22%) adenoviruses (ADV). The distribution of viral agents varied across age groups and month of detection. The positive specimens were from 168 patients [102 M, 66 F; median age (range): 64 years (19?93)]. Overall, 40% of them had a high-grade clinical severity and a 27% risk of death; 27 patients died and 22 of them (81.5%) had received a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia.

This study sought to (1) identify cancer screening barriers and facilitators during the pandemic in rural and urban primary care practices, (2) describe implementation strategies to support cancer screening, and (3) provide recommendations. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted (N = 42) with primary care staff across 20 sites. Individual interviews were conducted through videoconference from August 2020 to April 2021 and recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using deductive and inductive coding (hybrid approach) in NVivo 12 Plus. Practices included federally qualified health centers, tribal health centers, rural health clinics, hospital/health system-owned clinics, and academic medical centers across 10 states including urban (55%) and rural (45%) sites. Staff included individuals serving in the dual role of health care provider and administrator (21.4%), health care administrator (23.8%), physician (19.0%), advanced practice provider (11.9%), or resident (23.8%). The interviews assessed perceptions about cancer screening barriers and facilitators, implementation strategies, and future recommendations. RESULTS: Participants reported multilevel barriers to cancer screening including policy-level (eg, elective procedure delays), organizational (eg, backlogs), and individual (eg, patient cancellation). Several facilitators to screening were noted, such as home-based testing, using telehealth, and strong partnerships with referral sites. Practices used strategies to encourage screening, such as incentivizing patients and providers and expanding outreach. Rural clinics reported challenges with backlogs, staffing, telehealth implementation, and patient outreach. CONCLUSION: Primary care staff used innovative strategies during the pandemic to promote cancer screening.

However, there is no evidence-based medicine to confirm the relationship between hyperglycemia and the infection of COVID-19 in diabetic patients. Therefore, we will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the existing clinical evidence. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will retrieve each database from December 2019 to July 2020.

Associations with region of training were probed using Chi square tests, with significance set at p < 0.0008 following a Bonferroni correction. Results were compared to trainee views on available opportunities for development. RESULTS: 139 responses were received (32% response rate, demographics representative of the UK nephrology trainee cohort). Procedural independence varied from 98% for temporary femoral vascular catheters to 5% for peritoneal dialysis catheters (PDIs). Independence with inserting tunnelled vascular catheters varied with region (p < 0.0001). Trainees expressed a desire for formal training in kidney ultrasound scanning and PDIs, corresponding with procedures they had least opportunity to become independent with. Trainees felt least confident managing kidney disease in pregnancy. Suggestions for improving training included protected time for garnering sub-speciality knowledge, developing procedural skills and for experiencing practice in other nephrology units. CONCLUSIONS: A mismatch between trainee interests and professional development opportunities exists, which may threaten trainee autonomy and impact patient care particularly with regards to peritoneal dialysis.

The advantages of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), gamification, and telerehabilitation have been demonstrated in several medical fields. In this review, we searched the literature for studies using these technologies for orthopedic rehabilitation and analyzed studies quality, type and field of rehabilitation, patients characteristics, and outcomes to describe the state of the art of VR, AR, gamification, and telerehabilitation for orthopedic rehabilitation. Methods: A comprehensive search on PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Embase databases was conducted. This review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Studies published between 2015 and 2020 about remote virtual rehabilitations for orthopedic patients were selected. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) and Cochrane Risk-of-Bias assessment tool were used for quality assessment. Results: 24 studies (9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 15 non-randomized studies) and 2472 patients were included. Studies mainly concern telerehabilitation (56%), and to a lesser extent VR (28%), AR (28%), and gamification (16%). Remote virtual technologies were used following knee and hip arthroplasty. The majority of included patients were between 40 and 60 years old and had a university degree. Remote virtual rehabilitation was not inferior to face-to-face therapy, and physical improvements were demonstrated by increased clinical scores. Orthopedic virtual remote rehabilitation decreased costs related to transports, hospitalizations, and readmissions. Conclusion: The heterogeneity of included studies prevented a meta-analysis of their results. Age and social context influence adaptability to technology, and this can modify compliance to treatment and outcomes. A good relationship between patient and physiotherapist is essential for treatment compliance and new technologies are useful to maintain clinical interactions remotely. Remote virtual technologies allow the delivery of high-quality care at reduced costs. This is a necessity given the growing demand for orthopedic rehabilitation and increasing costs related to it.

To this end we depart from using the classic bilinear infection process, but remain within the framework of the mass-action assumption. From the mathematical point of view, the model we propose is interesting due to the lack of continuous differentiability at disease-free steady states, which implies that the basic reproductive number cannot be computed following established mathematical approaches for certain parameter values. However, we parametrise our mathematical model using published values from the COVID-19 literature, and analyse the model simulations. We also contrast model simulations against publicly available COVID-19 test data, focusing on the first wave of the pandemic during MarchCJuly 2020 in the UK. Our simulations indicate that actual peak case numbers might have been as much as 200 times higher than the reported positive test cases during the first wave in the UK. We find that very strong adherence to self-quarantine rules yields (only) a reduction of 22% of peak numbers and delays the onset of the peak by approximately 30C35 days. However, during the early phase of the outbreak, the impact of (self)-quarantine is much more significant. We also take into account the effect of a national lockdown in a simplistic way by reducing the effective susceptible population size.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of tobacco smoke exposure with nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) test results for SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity accounting for possible confounders. METHODS: The nationwide, self-administered, cross-sectional web-based Italian National Epidemiological Survey on COVID-19 (EPICOVID19) was administered to an Italian population of 198,822 adult volunteers who filled in an online questionnaire between April 13 and June 2, 2020. For this study, we analyzed 6857 individuals with known NPS test results. The associations of smoking status and the dose-response relationship with a positive NPS test result and infection severity were calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs by means of logistic and multinomial regression models adjusting for sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics. RESULTS: Out of the 6857 individuals (mean age 47.9 years, SD 14.1; 4516/6857, 65.9% female), 63.2% (4334/6857) had never smoked, 21.3% (1463/6857) were former smokers, and 15.5% (1060/6857) were current smokers. Compared to nonsmokers, current smokers were younger, were more educated, were less affected by chronic diseases, reported COVID-19-like symptoms less frequently, were less frequently hospitalized, and less frequently tested positive for COVID-19. In multivariate analysis, current smokers had almost half the odds of a positive NPS test result (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.45-0.65) compared to nonsmokers. We also found a dose-dependent relationship with tobacco smoke: mild smokers (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.55-1.05), moderate smokers (aOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.73), and heavy smokers (aOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27-0.53). This inverse association also persisted when considering the severity of the infection. Current smokers had a statistically significantly lower probability of having asymptomatic (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.92), mild (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.81), and severe infections (aOR 0.27, 95% CI 0.17-0.42) compared to those who never smoked. CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking was negatively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection with a dose-dependent relationship. Ad hoc experimental studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this association.

The prevalence of COVID-19 in orthopaedic populations will vary depending on the time and place where the sampling is performed. The idea that asymptomatic carriers play a role is generalizable but has not been studied in large populations of patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery. We therefore evaluated this topic in one large, metropolitan city in a state that had the ninth-most infections in the United States at the time this study was completed (June 2020). This work was based on a screening and testing protocol that required all patients to be tested for COVID-19 preoperatively. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What is the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in patients planning to undergo orthopaedic surgery in one major city, in order to provide other surgeons with a framework for assessing COVID-19 rates in their healthcare system? (2) How did patients with positive test results for COVID-19 differ in terms of age, sex, and orthopaedic conditions? (3) What proportion of patients had complications treated, and how many patients had a symptomatic COVID-19 infection within 30 days of surgery (recognizing that some may have been missed and so our estimates of event rates will necessarily underestimate the frequency of this event)? METHODS: All adult patients scheduled for surgery at four facilities (two tertiary care hospitals, one orthopaedic specialty hospital, and one ambulatory surgery center) at a single institution in the Philadelphia metropolitan area from April 27, 2020 to June 12, 2020 were included in this study. A total of 1295 patients were screened for symptoms, exposure, temperature, and oxygen saturation via a standardized protocol before surgical scheduling; 1.5% (19 of 1295) were excluded because they had COVID-19 symptoms, exposure, or recent travel based on the initial screening questionnaire, leaving 98.5% (1276 of 1295) who underwent testing for COVID-19 preoperatively. All 1276 patients who passed the initial screening test underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing for COVID-19 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction before surgery. The mean age at the time of testing was 56  16 years, and 53% (672 of 1276) were men. Eighty-seven percent (1106), 8% (103), and 5% (67) were tested via the Roche, Abbott, and Cepheid assays, respectively. All patients undergoing elective surgery were tested via the Roche assay, while those undergoing nonelective surgery received either the Abbott or Cepheid assay, based on availability. Patients with positive test results undergoing elective surgery had their procedures rescheduled, while patients scheduled for nonelective surgery underwent surgery regardless of their test results. Additionally, we reviewed the records of all patients at 30 days postoperatively for emergency room visits, readmissions, and COVID-19-related complications via electronic medical records and surgeon-reported complications. However, we had no method for definitively determining how many patients had complications, emergency department visits, or readmissions outside our system, so our event rate estimates for these endpoints are necessarily best-case estimates. RESULTS: A total of 0.5% (7 of 1276) of the patients tested positive for COVID-19: five via the Roche assay and two via the Abbott assay. Patients with positive test results were younger than those with negative results (39  12 years versus 56  16 years; p = 0.01). With the numbers available, we found no difference in the proportion of patients with positive test results for COVID-19 based on subspecialty area (examining the lowest and highest point estimates, respectively, we observed: trauma surgery [3%; 2 of 68 patients] versus hip and knee [0.3%; 1 of 401 patients], OR 12 [95% CI 1-135]; p = 0.06). No patients with negative preoperative test results for COVID-19 developed a symptomatic COVID-19 infection within 30 days postoperatively. Within 30 days of surgery, 0.9% (11 of 1276) of the patients presented to the emergency room, and 1.3% (16 of 1276) were readmitted for non-COVID-19-related complications. None of the patients with positive test results for COVID-19 preoperatively experienced complications. However, because some were likely treated outside our healthcare system, the actual percentages may be higher. CONCLUSION: Because younger patients are more likely to be asymptomatic carriers of disease, surgeons should emphasize the importance of taking proper precautions to prevent virus exposure preoperatively. Because the rates of COVID-19 infection differ based on city and time, surgeons should monitor the local prevalence of disease to properly advise patients on the risk of COVID-19 exposure. Further investigation is required to assess the prevalence in the orthopaedic population in cities with larger COVID-19 burdens.

This study analyzes the volume and tenor of the GMO conversation as it played out on social and traditional media between 2018 and 2020, looking at 103,084 online and print articles published in English-language media around the world as well as 1,716,071 social media posts. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first comprehensive survey of the shifting traditional and online media discourse on this issue during this time period. While the volume of traditional media coverage of GMOs increased significantly during the period, this was combined with a dramatic drop in the volume of social media posts of over 80%. Traditional media tended to be somewhat more positive in their coverage than social media in 2018 and 2019, but that gap disappeared in 2020. Both traditional and social media saw trends toward increasing favorability, with the positive trend especially robust in social media. The large decline in volume of social media posts, combined with a strong trend toward greater favorability, may indicate a drop in the salience of the GMO debate among the wider population even while the volume of coverage in traditional media increased. Overall, our results suggest that both social and traditional media may be moving toward a more favorable and less polarized conversation on ag-biotech overall.","output":"The state of the GMO debate - toward an increasingly favorable and less polarized media conversation on ag-biotech?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, deep learning is employed to propose an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based online incremental learning technique for developing an adaptive and non-intrusive analytical model of Covid-19 pandemic to analyze the temporal dynamics of the disease spread.

This cross yields a decreased number of cleistothecia, including few ascospores. The sexual reproductive organ-specific transcriptional analysis using RNAs from the cleistothecia (sexual fruiting bodies) indicated that the CpcB is essential for the completion of sexual development by regulating the transcription of sexual genes, such as veA, steA, and vosA. The AfcpcB strain revealed increased resistance to oxidative stress by regulating genes for catalase, peroxiredoxin, and ergosterol biosynthesis. The AfcpcB strain showed decreased uptake by alveolar macrophages in vitro, decreased sensitivity to Congo red, decreased expression of cell wall genes, and increased expression of the hydrophobin genes.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 disease on urological activity in Tunisia. To assess the differences in the management of urological conditions between the private and the public field. METHODS: a survey was addressed to all certified urologists working in Tunisia in both the public and private sectors (n=194) using the national database of active urologists available and updated. We either called them or looked them up through email or social media. The form was open from March the 28(th) to April the 3(rd). Results were obtained via spreadsheet and analysed using SPSS 23.0. RESULTS: one hundred and twenty urologists have filled in the form. Consultations at the outpatient office were restricted to urgent cases in 66% (n=79). Telemedicine was more used by urologists in private than in public fields p=0.03. Urologists in private sector followed more the sterilization protocol of the hospital/clinic and used more disposable materials whenever possible p=0.011. Elective surgical activity has completely stopped in 85% of the responders (n=102).

In this study, we relax the assumption of the static geography and present a computationally tractable framework for dynamic spin-orbit tomography applicable to the time-varying geography. First, a Bayesian framework of static spin-orbit tomography is revisited using analytic expressions of the Bayesian inverse problem with a Gaussian prior. We then extend this analytic framework to a time-varying one through a Gaussian process in time domain, and present analytic expressions that enable efficient sampling from a full joint posterior distribution of geography, axial tilt, spin rotation period, and hyperparameters in the Gaussian-process priors. Consequently, it only takes 0.3 s for a laptop computer to sample one posterior dynamic map conditioned on the other parameters with 3,072 pixels and 1,024 time grids, for a total of $\\\\sim 3 \\\\times 10^6$ parameters. We applied our dynamic mapping method on a toy model and found that the time-varying geography was accurately retrieved along with the axial-tilt and spin rotation period. In addition, we demonstrated the use of dynamic spin-orbit tomography with a real multi-color light curve of the Earth as observed by the Deep Space Climate Observatory. We found that the resultant snapshots from the dominant component of a principle component analysis roughly captured the large-scale, seasonal variations of the clear-sky and cloudy areas on the Earth.","output":"Bayesian Dynamic Mapping of an Exo-Earth from Photometric Variability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Internet companies derive value from users by recording and influencing their behavior.

In particular, the S protein was found to be the key determinant of evolution, transmission, and virulence of SARS-CoV-2, and could be a potential target for vaccine development. Additionally, RdRp could be a major target in the development of antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19. Conclusion: Given the critical importance of mutations in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and in the development of sero-diagnostics, antivirals, and vaccines, this study recommends continuous molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2.

Through interviews with service providers, this article explores how these recent wildfires have impacted surrounding communities and the role various recovery resources have played in responding to the short- and long-term health and social needs of survivors. METHODS: Using a purposive sampling methodology, we interviewed 21 health and social service personnel who assisted in wildfire recovery efforts in California in 2017 and 2018. The study participants worked or volunteered in medical facilities, social services agencies and philanthropy/nonprofit organizations located in communities affected by wildfires. Participants were asked about three common, overarching themes that fire-impacted communities navigate post-disaster: health issues, social issues, and response and recovery resources. Inductive coding was used to identify common subthemes. RESULTS: The two most frequently discussed social issues during interviews were housing and employment access. Mental and emotional well-being and access to health resources were identified as being the most challenging health concerns that survivors face post-disaster. Participants also identified the following private and public recovery resources that survivors use to attempt to restabilize following the fire: community support, county agencies, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA,) insurance companies and philanthropic organizations. However, participants noted that the cumulative impacts of these efforts still leave many of their patients and clients without the resources needed to restabilize emotionally, financially and physically. Finally, participants spoke about the community-wide, downstream impacts of wildfires, noting that \\"survivors\\" are not only those whose health is immediately compromised by the disaster. CONCLUSION: Given the worsening wildfire seasons in California, we must increase our understanding of both the scope of the health and social issues that survivors navigate following a disaster, as well as the effectiveness and sustainability of recovery resources available to survivors. We must also understand the \\"ripple effect\\" that wildfires have on surrounding communalities, impacting housing access, social services, and health care access.

The segregation and use of waste plastics from medical waste as a source of fuel for syngas production are highly beneficial. In packaging plastics, high density polyethylene (HDPE) occupies 20% of the total waste plastics. Hence, the conversion of HDPE into syngas is essential for waste reduction and energy production. Further, Indian coals possess high ash content (20C40%) and hence they produce a low calorific value gas on gasification. Hence, the co-gasification of these coals with suitable fuels such as HDPE can raise the heating value of syngas. In this context, HDPE is co-gasified with a high ash Indian coal using CO2 as the gasification agent for syngas production. Co-pyrolysis and co-gasification behavior of HDPE with high ash coal (HAC) under CO2 atmosphere are analyzed by using a fixed bed reactor and a thermogravimetric analyzer. Unlike reported in the recent literature, the present study showed that a high quality syngas can be obtained from the co-gasification process (1000 C) with the heating value of 22 MJ/m3 using CO2 as the gasification agent. The chemical reactivity between CO2 gas, coal volatiles, and ethylene molecules significantly altered the surface morphology of char, which becomes highly porous making suitable for Boudouard reaction.

For this reason, the use of gene networks may well encourage therapy-associated research in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, orchestrating experimental scrutiny and reducing costs. In this work, gene co-expression networks were reconstructed from RNA-Seq expression data with the aim of analyzing the time-resolved effects of gene Ly6E in the immune response against the coronavirus responsible for murine hepatitis (MHV). Through the integration of differential expression analyses and reconstructed networks exploration, significant differences in the immune response to virus were observed in Ly6E [Formula: see text] compared to wild type animals. Results show that Ly6E ablation at hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) leads to a progressive impaired immune response in both liver and spleen. Specifically, depletion of the normal leukocyte mediated immunity and chemokine signaling is observed in the liver of Ly6E [Formula: see text] mice. On the other hand, the immune response in the spleen, which seemed to be mediated by an intense chromatin activity in the normal situation, is replaced by ECM remodeling in Ly6E [Formula: see text] mice.

Objectives Use mixed methods to explore the impact of the pandemic on cancer and palliative care delivery among cancer patients, family caregivers, and cancer and palliative care clinicians. Methods Quality-of-life and COVID-specific surveys were distributed to cancer patients and family caregivers in four US geographic areas. In-depth interviews were conducted with cancer patients, family caregivers, and cancer and palliative care clinicians. Results From August 2020 through July 2021, data were collected in Baltimore, MD; Boston, MA; Albuquerque, NM; and Stanford, CA and include 499 surveys from 188 cancer patients and 26 family caregivers and 71 interviews from 48 cancer patients, 4 family caregivers, and 19 cancer and palliative care clinicians. Participants included patients who were recently diagnosed, those who were undergoing active anticancer treatment or had completed treatment, and those receiving end-of-life care. Three patients contracted COVID, with all having mild disease. There were no associations between quality-of-life and/or mood scores and regional COVID surges. Both cancer patients and family caregivers reported good COVID and cancer coping and noted more concern about cancer. Telehealth was widely used and well received. 58% of surveys documented the respondent receiving a recent cancer treatment, but only 5.3% reported knowledge of any COVID-related treatment change. These data contrast with reports from cancer and palliative care clinicians who noted widespread pandemic-related changes in treatment and experienced severe personal anxiety, fatigue, burnout, and moral distress. Conclusions In a large and geographically diverse sample, cancer patients and family caregivers coped well with the pandemic and were generally unaware of pandemic-related cancer care changes.

Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were extracted from the electronic patient files. RESULTS Patients reported fever (61%), cough (43%), diarrhea (31%), and upper respiratory symptoms (29%). The median age was 56 years, and 57% were male. According to severity, 55% had mild, 13% had moderate, 19% had severe, and 13% had critical disease. Thirty-seven patients (70%) were hospitalized, with 8 requiring intensive care. Thirteen of the 37 patients were initially managed as outpatients but later hospitalized. One patient received hydroxychloroquine, and no patients received antivirals. Antimetabolites and calcineurin inhibitors were held or reduced in two thirds. Twenty-seven out of 37 hospitalized patients (73%) received low molecular weight heparin. Five (13,5%) hospitalized patients died. Overall survival for the entire cohort was 94%.

Many research groups have focused their attention on inhibiting viral proteases or human proteases such as cathepsin L (hCatL). The inhibition of these critical enzymes may impair viral replication. However, molecular modeling of covalent ligands is challenging since covalent and noncovalent ligand-bound states must be considered in the binding process. In this work, we evaluated the suitability of free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations as a tool for predicting the binding affinity of reversible covalent inhibitors of hCatL. Our strategy relies on the relative free energy calculated for both covalent and noncovalent complexes and the free energy changes have been compared with experimental data for eight nitrile-based inhibitors, including three new inhibitors of hCatL. Our results demonstrate that the covalent complex can be employed to properly rank the inhibitors. Nevertheless, a comparison of the free energy changes in both noncovalent and covalent states is valuable to interpret the effect triggered by the formation of the covalent bond on the interactions played by functional groups distant from the warhead.

The necessity for rapid testing combined with the limitations of other diagnostic tests has led to the proposal of various potential roles for LUS during the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review and meta-analysis focused specifically on the diagnostic accuracy of LUS in adult patients presenting with suspected COVID-19. MethodsTraditional and grey-literature searches were performed on June 1st 2021. Two authors independently carried out the searches, selected studies and completed the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). Meta-analysis was carried out using established open-source packages in R. We report overall sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve for LUS. Heterogeneity was determined using the I2 statistic. ResultsTwenty studies were included, providing data from a total of 4,314 patients. The prevalence and admission rates were generally high across all studies. Overall LUS was found to be 87.2% sensitive (95% CI 83.6-90.2) and 69.5% specific (95% CI 62.2-72.5) and demonstrated overall positive and negative predictive values of 3.0 (95% 2.3-4.1) and 0.16 (95% 0.12-0.22) respectively. Separate analyses for each reference standard revealed similar sensitivities and specificities for LUS. Heterogeneity between studies was found to be high, and QUADAS-2 assessment identified risks of bias in many studies. ConclusionDuring a period of high prevalence, LUS is a highly sensitive diagnostic test for COVID-19.

Four major protein species were resolved by electrophoresis and many of their properties were deduced from digestion studies using proteolytic enzymes. The four proteins are: (1) A 190 kDa protein, the presumed peplomeric protein, that was glycosylated and proteolytically cleavable by trypsin into subunits of 110 and 90 kDa. The subunits each represent a different amino acid sequence on the basis of peptide mapping; (2) a 130 kDa protein that was glycosylated and behaved as a disulfide-linked dimer of 65 kDa molecules. It is the apparent virion hemagglutinin on the basis of digestion studies with trypsin, bromelain and pronase; (3) a 55 kDa nucleocapsid protein that was phosphorylated; (4) a 26 kDa matrix protein that was glycosylated. The 190, 130, 55 and 26 kDa species can therefore be designated P, H, N and M, respectively.

On the surface, they seem to offer similar-sized stomachs after the procedures are performed. We chose to perform a randomized double-blinded trial to see if similar-sized pouches result in similar types of weight loss. Our belief was that sleeve gastrectomy would offer at least a 10% better weight loss over a 3-year period. METHODS Thirty patients were randomized to one of two arms. The patients and the third party administrator following the patients were blinded as to which procedure was chosen. The surgeon had full knowledge of the patients' surgery throughout the treatment. The decision of which arm to place them was made by a single employee of the third party administrator and not shared with the employees following the patients. Patients were then followed for 3 years. RESULTS There were no differences in weight, age, or BMI preoperatively. There were no differences between the two groups at any follow-up time point from 6 months to 3 years. Follow-up was 100%.

A retrospective chart review was undertaken for 90 patients examining investigations, in particular CT, used to clarify the diagnosis. RESULTS: Ninety patients underwent additional investigation. Seventy-five per cent adherence to WHO recommendations was observed. Fifty-two men (57.78%) and 38 (42.22%) women were investigated, with a median age of 69 years (range 20-96 years). Seventy-nine chest CT examinations demonstrated positive, indeterminate, and negative rates for COVID-19 of 3.79%, 24.1%, and 72.15% respectively. Three patients had discordant swab results with initially negative and subsequently positive results for SARS-CoV-2, resulting in false-negative rates of 5.1% for those retested. Combining discordant RT-PCR swab results, positive radiology, and patients treated as COVID-19-positive due to indeterminate radiology and highly consistent symptoms, resulted in a false-negative rate for initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swabs of 16.67%. CONCLUSION: Seventy-five per cent compliance with relevant WHO guidance and a false-negative rate for initial swabs of 16.67% was demonstrated.

Feminist collectives in these contexts support people through self-managed medical abortion outside the healthcare system. The model of in-person abortion accompaniment represents an opportunity to examine a self-care practice that challenges and reimagines abortion provision. We formed a collaborative partnership built on a commitment to shared power and decision-making between researchers and partners. We conducted 28 key informant interviews with accompaniers in Argentina, Chile and Ecuador in 2019 about their model of in-person abortion accompaniment at later durations of pregnancy. We iteratively coded transcripts using a thematic analysis approach. Accompaniers premised their work in a feminist activist framework that understands accompaniment as addressing inequalities and expanding rights, especially for the historically marginalised. Through a detailed description of the process of in-person accompaniment, we show that the model, including the logistical considerations and security mechanisms put in place to ensure favourable abortion outcomes, emphasises peer-to-peer provision of supportive physical and emotional care of the accompanied person. In this way, it represents supported self-care through which individuals are centred as the protagonists of their own abortion, while being accompanied by feminist peers. This model of supported self-care challenges the idea that self-care necessarily means solo care, or care that happens alone. The models focus on peer-to-peer transfer of knowledge, providing emotional support, and centring the accompanied person not only expands access to abortion, but represents person-centred practices that could be scaled and replicated across contexts.","output":"In-person later abortion accompaniment: a feminist collective-facilitated self-care practice in Latin America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Sino-US trade war, this study proposes a grey sharing decision-making evaluation model for production base movement and the sustainable operation of enterprises in the footwear industry.

The goal of this study was to report clinical data as well as incidence of vertical transmission in pregnant patients with COVID-19. This retrospective chart review was performed on pregnant women admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in China with confirmed COVID-19 between January 20 through January 31, 2020. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic records were reviewed by two investigators. Additionally, analyses from amniotic fluid, cord blood samples, and neonatal throat samples from the time of delivery were included. Vertical transmission was defined as positive testing for COVID-19 in these samples. Descriptive statistics were used. There were nine patients included in the analysis. All were in the third trimester on admission, the earliest presenting at 36 weeks, 2 days and all had a known source of exposure to COVID-19. None of the patients had baseline comorbidities, but one patient had gestational hypertension and another developed pre-eclampsia. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever on admission (78%), postpartum fever (67%), cough (44%), myalgia (33%), and sore throat (22%). Most had low or normal leukocyte count (78%) and 5 (56%) had lymphopenia. C-reactive protein was greater than 10mg/L in 75% of patients. One was found to be co-infected with influenza, and all were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and required oxygen therapy and antibiotics. Many (67%) also received antivirals. Regarding delivery, all nine were live births delivered via cesarean section with 1-min Apgar scores of 8-9 and 5-min Apgar scores of 9-10. Four of the 9 were delivered prematurely at 36 weeks (44%) for a variety of reasons including premature rupture of membranes, pre-eclampsia, or pneumonia. None of the fluid samples at birth were positive for COVID-19. Additionally, all of the mothers and babies were discharged from the hospital. Limitations discussed include the retrospective nature of data abstraction and small sample size. Additionally all patients enrolled were in the third trimester. The authors concluded that pregnant patients with COVID-19 present with similar symptoms as nonpregnant patients. Also, based on this limited sample, the mothers had a low risk of complications and all of the infants tested negative for COVID-19 after birth, suggesting that vertical transmission is unlikely. Comment: There are still many uncertainties about the disease course of COVID-19 in pregnant patients. This review is reassuring, however this is a very small sample size so caution should be used in applying these results to our day to day patients, especially those at earlier gestational ages.

Hosts have developed an array of antiviral mechanisms aimed at inhibiting replication and spread of viruses, reducing their fitness, and ultimately minimising pathogenic effects. In turn, viruses have evolved sophisticated counter-measures that mediate evasion of host defence mechanisms. A key aspect of host defences is the ability to differentiate between self and non-self. Previous studies have demonstrated significant suppression of CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies in the coding regions of RNA and small DNA viruses. Artificially increasing these dinucleotide frequencies results in a substantial attenuation of virus replication, suggesting dinucleotide bias could facilitate recognition of non-self RNA. The interferon-inducible gene, zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is the host factor responsible for sensing CpG dinucleotides in viral RNA and restricting RNA viruses through direct binding and degradation of the target RNA. Herpesviruses are large DNA viruses that comprise three subfamilies, alpha, beta and gamma, which display divergent CpG dinucleotide patterns within their genomes. ZAP has recently been shown to act as a host restriction factor against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a beta-herpesvirus, which in turn evades ZAP detection by suppressing CpG levels in the major immediate-early transcript IE1, one of the first genes expressed by the virus. While suppression of CpG dinucleotides allows evasion of ZAP targeting, synonymous changes in nucleotide composition that cause genome biases, such as low GC content, can cause inefficient gene expression, especially in unspliced transcripts. To maintain compact genomes, the majority of herpesvirus transcripts are unspliced. Here we discuss how the conflicting pressures of ZAP evasion, the need to maintain compact genomes through the use of unspliced transcripts and maintaining efficient gene expression may have shaped the evolution of herpesvirus genomes, leading to characteristic CpG dinucleotide patterns.","output":"Does the Zinc Finger Antiviral Protein (ZAP) Shape the Evolution of Herpesvirus Genomes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the present study was to identify differentially expressed B?cell?associated genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and investigate the gene expression characteristics of the different stages of B?cell activation.

Of 166 nasopharyngeal samples collected from 39 asymptomatic carriers every 48 h until two consecutive negative PCR test results were obtained, SARS-CoV-2 was successfully isolated from 9 PCR-positive samples which were obtained from 7 persons (18%; 7/39). Viable viruses were isolated predominantly within 7 days after the initial positive PCR test, except for one person who shed viable virus until day 15. The median crossing point (Cp) value of RT-PCR of culture-positive samples was 24.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 20.4 to 25.8; range, 17.9 to 30.3), and Cp values were significantly associated with isolation of viable virus (odds ratio, 0.496; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.329 to 0.747; P value, 0.001), which was consistent with existing data for symptomatic patients. Genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 samples consecutively obtained from a person who shed viable virus for 15 days identified the emergence of two novel single nucleotide variants (C8626T transition and C18452T transition) in the sample collected on day 15, with the latter corresponding to an amino acid substitution in nonstructural protein 14. The impact of these mutations on prolonged viable-virus shedding is unclear. These findings underscore the potential role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission. IMPORTANCE A growing number of studies suggest the potential role of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers as a major driver of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, virological assessment of asymptomatic infection has largely been limited to reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), which can be persistently positive without necessarily indicating the presence of viable virus (e.g., replication-competent virus). Here, we evaluated the infectivity of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers by detecting SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effects on Vero cells using longitudinally obtained nasopharyngeal samples from asymptomatic carriers. We show that asymptomatic carriers can shed viable virus until 7 days after the initial positive PCR test, with one outlier shedding until day 15. The crossing point (Cp) value of RT-PCR was the leading predictive factor for virus viability. These findings provide additional insights into the role of asymptomatic carriers as a source of transmission and highlight the importance of universal source control measures, along with isolation policy for asymptomatic carriers.","output":"Shedding of Viable Virus in Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Carriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent pandemic caused by the 2019 outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or COVID-19) has affected more than 3.0 million people resulting ~ 212,000 deaths across 215 countries/territories as on 28th April 2020. The importation of the cases owing to enormous international travels from the affected countries is the foremost reason for local cycle of transmission. For a country like India, the second most populous country in the world with ~ 1.35 billion population, the management and control of 2019-nCoV domestic spread heavily relied on effective screening and strict quarantine of passengers arriving at various international airports in India from affected countries. Here, by extracting the data from FLIRT, an online airline database for more than 800 airlines, and scanning more than 180,000 flights and 39.9 million corresponding passenger seats during 4th C 25th March, we show that India experienced the highest risk index of importing the passengers from middle eastern airports. Contrary to perception, travelers from China imposed lowest risk of importing the infected cases in India. This is clearly evident form the fact that while the number of infected cases were on the peak in China India was one of the least affected countries. The number of cases in India started exhibiting a sharp increase in the infected cases only after the European countries and USA recorded large number of infected cases. We further argue that while the number of cases in middle eastern countries may still be very low, the airports in middle eastern countries, particularly Dubai, being one of the largest transit hubs for international passengers, including arriving in India, might have posed a higher risk of getting infected with 2019-nCoV.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: RNA was extracted from cardiac tissue flash frozen at therapeutic surgical septal myectomy for 106 patients with HCM and 39 healthy donor hearts. Expression profiling of 37,846 genes was performed using the Illumina Human HT-12v3 Expression BeadChip. All patients with HCM were genotyped for pathogenic variants causing HCM. Technical validation was performed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. This study was started on January 1, 1999, and final analysis was completed on April 20, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 22% of the transcriptome (8443 of 37,846 genes) was expressed differentially between HCM and control tissues. Analysis by genotype revealed that gene expression changes were similar among genotypic subgroups of HCM, with only 4% (1502 of 37,846) to 6% (2336 of 37,846) of the transcriptome exhibiting differential expression between genotypic subgroups. The qRT-PCR confirmed differential expression in 92% (11 of 12 genes) of tested transcripts. Notably, in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the transcript for angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a negative regulator of the angiotensin system, was the single most up-regulated gene in HCM (fold-change, 3.53; q-value =1.3010-23), which was confirmed by qRT-PCR in triplicate (fold change, 3.78; P=5.2210-4), and Western blot confirmed greater than 5-fold overexpression of ACE2 protein (fold change, 5.34; P=1.6610-6). CONCLUSION: More than 20% of the transcriptome is expressed differentially between HCM and control tissues. Importantly, ACE2 was the most up-regulated gene in HCM, indicating perhaps the heart's compensatory effort to mount an antihypertrophic, antifibrotic response. However, given that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses ACE2 for viral entry, this 5-fold increase in ACE2 protein may confer increased risk for COVID-19 manifestations and outcomes in patients with increased ACE2 transcript expression and protein levels in the heart.","output":"Marked Up-Regulation of ACE2 in Hearts of Patients With Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: Implications for SARS-CoV-2-Mediated COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El mundo vive una pandemia por un Coronavirus, llamado SARS-COV-2, que produce la COVID-19 (acrnimo del ingles coronavirus disease 2019), la cual ha generado un colapso en los sistemas de salud, haciendo que el manejo de otras enfermedades se convierta en un reto De igual forma para los grupos oncolgicos, la presencia de esta enfermedad, genera muchas dudas en la aplicacin de los tratamientos estndares, los cuales se deben realizar lo antes posible, con el fin de ofrecer mejores resultados oncolgicos Se propone la creacin de un ndice ( COVID-19 Cncer Index) , teniendo en cuenta variables clnicas, epidemiolgicas y la disponibilidad de los recursos hospitalarios, til para la toma de decisiones y el establecimiento del mejor tratamiento para una paciente con confirmacin o alta sospecha de neoplasia ginecolgica The world is experiencing a coronavirus pandemic called SARS-COV-2 which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) This has led to a collapse in health systems, making the management of other diseases a challenge Similarly, the presence of this disease generates many doubts for oncological groups regarding the provision of standard treatments, which should be carried out as soon as possible, in order to ensure better oncological outcomes We propose the creation of an index (COVID 19 Cancer Index) taking into account clinical and epidemiological variables and the availability of hospital resources, which are useful for decision making and determining the best treatment for a patient with confirmed or strongly suspected gynecological neoplasia","output":"ndice de manejo quirrgico en pacientes con cncer ginecolgico durante la pandemia por Covid-19: propuesta para instituciones y profesionales en ginecologa oncolgica"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Uncertainty around economic recovery from a pandemic, in addition to restrictions on mobility and socializing, can be isolating and stressful. While preventive measures, such as mask mandates, are expected to mitigate spread of the disease and lower concerns of future job loss, state- and local-level mandates could signal that infection rates are worse in the mandated areas and decrease consumer confidence and mobility. Thus, the association between mask mandates and psychological well-being is unclear. AIMS OF THE STUDY Twenty-five states in the United States implemented statewide mask mandates early in the pandemic. This study seeks to examine the effect of mask mandates on self-reported job loss expectation and mental health. METHODS This study analyzes U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey data, collected between April 23rd and July 21st, 2020. Using a panel subset of the data, fixed effects models are estimated to understand statewide mask mandate's effect on psychological well-being over a twelve-week period while controlling for individual-level unobserved heterogeneity. All data are then state-aggregated, and fixed effects models are estimated to examine average differences in job loss expectation and mental health between mandate and non-mandate states. RESULTS In the individual-level panel data, job loss expectation was lower by 1.1 percentage point by the second week of a statewide mask mandate and by 1.6 percentage point by the third week, compared to average job loss expectation in states without a mask mandate and to the mandate states before the policy implementation. Average job loss expectation was 6.5 percentage point lower by the twelfth week in the five states that were the first to implement statewide mask mandates. Mental health status improved steadily from the fourth week on in states with a mask mandate. Analysis of state-aggregated data indicates considerable variability and lack of uniformity in mask mandates' impact on job loss expectation and mental health status. DISCUSSION Local-level mandates, such as those at the county-level, could not be identified in these data. The impact of a mask mandate could be underestimated when only state-level mandates are considered, and local regulations are excluded. This is a limitation of this study. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVISION The staggered state-by-state approach to implementing mask mandates and the considerable variability in enforcement of mask rules has possibly contributed to lack of uniformity and consistency in how mask mandates impact subjective psychological well-being. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICIES The lack of statistically significant impact of statewide mask mandates on the two outcome variables in the state-aggregated data, and on long-run job loss expectation in the individual-level panel data, could be indicative of the complexities of effective science communication regarding behavioral recommendations to promote overall well-being. IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH Multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has emerged around the world. Further research could more clearly assess the degree to which communicating public health implications of these variants has evolved, and whether it has elicited behavior change and affected psychological well-being.","output":"Mask Mandate's Effect on Job Loss Expectation and Mental Health in the United States during the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the causes of the diverse outcome of COVID-19 pandemic in different geographical locations is important for the worldwide vaccine implementation and pandemic control responses.

We want to assess whether increased symptom interval (SI) is associated with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma. METHODS We analyzed prospectively collected data of 220 patients younger than 40 years who had osteosarcoma around the knee. Symptom interval was analyzed to evaluate its impact on metastases at diagnosis, tumor volume, chemotherapy response and overall survival. RESULTS The median of SI was 64.5 (Q1-Q3: 42-88) days. The 5-year overall survival rate for patients with different length of symptom interval (<42 days, 42-64 days, 65-87 days, > = 88 days) were 0.78 (95 %CI: 0.67-0.89), 0.49 (95 %CI: 0.35-0.63), 0.52 (95 %CI:0.39-0.65), and 0.65 (95 %CI:0.53-0.77) respectively(p = 0.013). Nonparametric test showed increased SI was associated with metastases at diagnosis (p = 0.008), but not associated with large tumor volume or poor chemotherapy response. Cox regression mode test showed that patient with increased SI had higher hazard ratio (42-64 days HR: 2.586 (95 %CI:1.360-4.915); 65-87 days, HR: 2.225 (95 %CI:1.170-4.233)) for poor outcomes compared to short SI (<42 days), though it was not significant in multivariate analysis (p = 0.182). CONCLUSION Increased SI but not the longest SI is associated with higher incidence of metastases at diagnosis; patients can benefit from an earlier diagnosis in terms of survival.","output":"Is increased symptom interval associated with advanced stage and poorer outcome?

Although WHO mentioned there is not any effective treatments for COVID-19, but there is some reporting about the use of some antiviral drugs. The aim of current study is to determine the effect of Arbidol (ARB) on COVID-19 disease. Methods: Using an open label randomized controlled trial, effectiveness of ARB on COVID-19 disease was conducted in a teaching hospital. One hundred eligible patients with diagnosis of Covid-19 recruited in the study and assigned randomly to two groups of either Hydroxychloroquine followed by Kaletra (Lopinavir-ritonavir) or Hydroxychloroquine followed by ARB. The primary outcome was hospitalization duration and clinical improvement 7 days after admission. The criteria of improvement were relief of cough, dyspnea and fever. Time to relieving fever was assessed across two groups too. Without any drop out, 100 patients were entered to final analysis with significant level of 0.05. Results: The mean age of the patients was 56.6 (17.8) and 56.2 (14.8) in ARB and Kaletra groups respectively. Majority of patients were male across two groups (66% and 54%). The duration of hospitalization in ARB group was less than Kaletra arm significantly (7.2 versus 9.6 days;P=0.02). Time to relief fever was almost similar across two groups (2.7 versus 3.1 days in ARB and Kaletra arms respectively). Peripheral oxygen saturation rate was different after seven days of admission across two groups significantly (94% versus 92% in ARB and Kaletra groups respectively) (P=0.02). Based on multiple linear regression analysis, IHD, Na level and oxygen saturation at the time of admission and type of therapy were the independent adjusted variables that determined the duration of hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: Our findings showed that Arbidol, compared to Kaletra, significantly contributes to clinical and laboratory improvements, including peripheral oxygen saturation, requiring ICU admissions, duration of hospitalization, chest CT involvements, WBC, and ESR.

Therapeutic development has resulted in clinically available therapies to increase SMN protein levels in patients and improve muscle function. Here we aimed to investigate the effect of SMN restoration (via nusinersen) on NMJ transmission in adults with SMA. METHODS: Participants undergoing nusinersen treatment underwent 3 Hz repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) of the spinal accessory nerve to assess compound muscle action potential amplitude decrement. Maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVICT), Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), and 6 min walk test (6MWT) were assessed for correlations with decrement. RESULTS: Data from 13 ambulatory (7 men/6 women, mean age 4011 years) and 11 non-ambulatory (3 men/8 women, mean age 3812 years) participants were analysed. Cross-sectional analyses of RNS decrement were similar at 14 months of nusinersen (?14.2%11.5%, n=17) vs baseline (?11.9%8.3%, n=15) (unpaired t-test, p=0.5202).

This study investigated risk factors and estimated rates of acute insomnia disorder in health care workers at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A Qualtrics survey of more than 2300 health care providers was conducted in a single academic health system on May 15th 2020, comprised of practicing attending physicians, residents and fellows in training, advanced practice providers, and nurses. Six hundred and sixty eight responded (29% response rate). The Research Diagnostic Criteria for Insomnia Disorder was used to diagnose Acute Insomnia Disorder. RESULTS: 573 respondent had no missing data pertaining to sleep, with a mean age of 43.4 + 12.5 years and 72% women. The rate of Insomnia Disorder before COVID-19 was 44.5%, while after COVID-19 it was 64.0% - a statistically significant increase. 10.2% of persons with Insomnia Disorder before COVID-19 stated it had resolved during COVID-19, while 43.4% of persons who did not have Insomnia Disorder before COVID-19 developed Acute Insomnia Disorder during COVID-19 (2=145.2; df=1; P<0.0001).

Also, appraisal of an MP needs cross-stakeholder communication and engagement. Both aspects may benefit from extended use of modeling and simulation. Modeling is used in HTA for data-synthesis and health-economic projections.

The mice were sacrificed 10 days after the induction of C. rodentium infection. The DSS-CT group displayed significantly shorter colon length, higher spleen to body weight ratio, and higher histopathological score compared to the other three groups. The mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interferon (INF)- were significantly upregulated; however, those of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 were significantly downregulated in the DSS-CT group than in the control group. These results demonstrated that a combination of low DSS concentration (1%) and C. rodentium infection could effectively induce inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice. This may potentially be used as a novel IBD model, in which colitis is induced in mice by the combination of a chemical and a pathogen.

Here, we launched a follow-up analysis of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 of 192 COVID-19 patients, aiming to depict a kinetics profile of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and explore the related factors of antibodies expression against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patient. Methods: A total of 192 COVID-19 patients enrolled in the designated hospital of Guangzhou , Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, from January to February 2020 were selected as the study cohort. A cohort of 130 COVID-19 suspects who had been excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infected by negative RT-PCR result and 209 healthy people were enrolled in this study. Detection of IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 were performed by Chemiluminescence immunoassay in different groups . Results: It has been found that the seroconversion time of IgM against SARS-CoV-2 in most patients was 5-10 days after the symptoms onset , and then rose rapidly, reaching a peak around 2 to 3 weeks, and the median peak concentration was 2.705 AU / mL. The peak of IgM maintained within one week, and then enters the descending channel. IgG seroconverted later than or synchronously with IgM, reaching peaks around 3 to 4 weeks.The median peak concentration was 33.998AU / ml,which was higher than that of IgM . IgM titers begins to gradually decrease after reaching the peak in the 4th week, after the 8th week, a majority of IgM in patient's serum started to turn negative. On the contrary, titers of IgG began to decline slightly after the fifth week, and more than 90% of results of patients were positive after 8 weeks. Additionally, the concentration of antibodies positively correlated with the severity of the disease and the duration of virus exist in host.

This course relied on asynchronous narrated presentations for content delivery. This method of delivery predated the pandemic and was used throughout the course. Academic performance and patterns of access to materials in the online course was compared with the access patterns and performance of students given classroom-based synchronous teaching in Spring 2019.

Lack of instructor interaction was an important perceived barrier in the asynchronous course. Asynchronous course materials were uniformly accessed across all days of the week, while supplemental materials for the face-to-face course showed a weekly pattern. Moving from letter grades to pass/fail did not change access frequency to supplemental course materials but led to decreased video usage in the asynchronous course.

Recently, biological network-based approaches have been proven to be effective in predicting chemical-gene interactions. RESULTS We present CGINet, a graph convolutional network-based method for identifying chemical-gene interactions in an integrated multi-relational graph containing three types of nodes: chemicals, genes, and pathways. We investigate two different perspectives on learning node embeddings. One is to view the graph as a whole, and the other is to adopt a subgraph view that initial node embeddings are learned from the binary association subgraphs and then transferred to the multi-interaction subgraph for more focused learning of higher-level target node representations. Besides, we reconstruct the topological structures of target nodes with the latent links captured by the designed substructures. CGINet adopts an end-to-end way that the encoder and the decoder are trained jointly with known chemical-gene interactions. We aim to predict unknown but potential associations between chemicals and genes as well as their interaction types. CONCLUSIONS We study three model implementations CGINet-1/2/3 with various components and compare them with baseline approaches. As the experimental results suggest, our models exhibit competitive performances on identifying chemical-gene interactions. Besides, the subgraph perspective and the latent link both play positive roles in learning much more informative node embeddings and can lead to improved prediction.","output":"CGINet: graph convolutional network-based model for identifying chemical-gene interaction in an integrated multi-relational graph."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ninguna organizacin estaba preparada para afrontar una situacin de crisis generada por la pandemia del coronavirus, pero una caracterstica de un buen lder es ser capaz de reaccionar frente a la incertidumbre y lo inesperado.

The mutations are deletions in the FIPVs and not insertions in the FECVs since similar sequences are present in other strains that have segregated earlier from a common ancestor. Therefore, the order of descent is from FECV to FIPV. Mutations unique to FIPVs were found in open reading frames (ORFs) 3c in 4 of 6 isolates and/or 7b in 3 of 6 isolates.

Our aim was to develop a capnography-based, point-of-care tool that can estimate the level of obstruction in patients with asthma and COPD. METHODS: Two prospective observational studies conducted between September 2016 and May 2018 at Rabin Medical Center, Israel, included healthy, asthma and COPD patient groups. Each patient underwent spirometry test and continuous capnography, as part of, either methacholine challenge test for asthma diagnosis or bronchodilator reversibility test for asthma and COPD routine evaluation. Continuous capnography signal, divided into single breaths waveforms, were analyzed to identify waveform features, to create a predictive model for FEV1 using an artificial neural network. The gold standard for comparison was FEV1 measured with spirometry. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Overall 160 patients analyzed. Model prediction included 32/88 waveform features and three demographic features (age, gender and height). The model showed excellent correlation with FEV1 (R=0.84), R(2) achieved was 0.7 with mean square error of 0.13.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of tocilizumab on the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia by using propensity-score-matching (PSM) analysis. METHODS: A retrospective observational analysis of hospitalized COVID-19 adult patients admitted to the Vall dHebron Hospital was performed between March and April 2020. We used the logistic regression to analyze the effect of tocilizumab on mortality, as main outcome, and PSM analysis to further validate their effect. Secondary outcomes were length-of-stay (LOS) and intensive-care-unit (ICU) stay. Same outcomes were also assessed for early tocilizumab administration, within 72 h after admission. Patients were selected by matching their individual propensity for receiving therapy with tocilizumab, conditional on their demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: A total of 544 COVID-19 patients were included, 197 (36.2%) were treated with tocilizumab of whom 147 were treated within the first 72 h after admission; and 347 were included in the control group.

What has not yet been examined is the extent to which healthy living initiatives implemented under these new policy frameworks successfully engage with and change the social determinants of health. METHODS: Initiatives active between January 1, 2006 and September 1, 2011 were found using provincial policy documents, web searches, health organization and government websites, and databases of initiatives that attempted to influence to nutrition and physical activity in order to prevent chronic diseases or improve overall health. Initiatives were reviewed, analyzed and grouped using the descriptive codes: lifestyle-based, environment-based or structure-based. Initiatives were also classified according to the mechanism by which they were administered: as direct programs (e.g. directly delivered), blueprints (or frameworks to tailor developed programs), and building blocks (resources to develop programs). RESULTS: 60 initiatives were identified in Ontario and 61 were identified in British Columbia. In British Columbia, 11.5% of initiatives were structure-based. In Ontario, of 60 provincial initiatives identified, 15% were structure-based. Ontario had a higher proportion of direct interventions than British Columbia for all intervention types. However, in both provinces, as the intervention became more upstream and attempted to target the social determinants of health more directly, the level of direct support for the intervention lessened. CONCLUSIONS: The paucity of initiatives in British Columbia and Ontario that address healthy eating and active living through action on the social determinants of health is problematic. In the context of Canada's increasingly neoliberal political and economic policy, the public health sector may face significant barriers to addressing upstream determinants in a meaningful way. If public health cannot directly affect broader societal conditions, interventions should be focused around advocacy and education about the social determinants of health. It is necessary that health be seen for what it is: a political matter. As such, the health sector needs to take a more political approach in finding solutions for health inequities.","output":"Social determinants of health in Canada: Are healthy living initiatives there yet?

The COVID-19 pandemic has no contrast from previous outbreaks like SARS and MERS regarding their ensuing worries and boosted anxiety levels. This article seeks to examine the unique psychological changes that occur in students who have been quarantined inside a university campus and assess sociodemographic factors associated with certain psychological factors. Methodology: The data was collected from students in an Agricultural Campus. In the first phase, the factor structure of the modified National Index Psychological Wellness (NIPW) was acceptable, and to establish statistical parameters for validation an exploratory factor analysis was done. In the second phase, Independent T-tests, ANOVA, and Hierarchical Multiple regression were performed. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0. Result/Discussion: A total of 46 male and 76 female students enrolled in this study. The Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant (p < 0.001) and the KaiserCMayerCOlkin measure of sampling adequacy for the AUDIT-M was 0.901. The Cronbach's alpha of the entire modified NIPW was 0.657 which suggests reasonable internal consistency and subscales between 0.913 and 0.924. Raw scores of 12 positive items were higher for the quarantined group except for I can do daily routines, I understand what happens, and I understand the action that is performed is fair. Raw mean scores of eight negative scoring items were higher in the quarantined group, except for I feel angry (2.88 vs. 2.89 for non-quarantined group). There were statistically significant differences between year groups for the questions I understand what happens, I understand the action that is performed is fair, and I think everyone is good. Conclusion: Movement control orders or compulsory quarantine orders can be distressing and may cause understandable psychological sequelae. Holistic management of a quarantine center that addresses the needs and health of an individual student will give a positive impact on psychological wellness.

CASE REPORT: We report a case of dual congenital internal hernias of the small bowel in a patient who presented with symptoms and signs of SBO. He had no history of abdominal trauma, surgery, or comorbid conditions. His abdomen was mildly distended with minimal tenderness in the upper left quadrant but there was no guarding or rebound tenderness. Abdominal X-rays confirmed the SBO. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the patients abdomen revealed SBO with transition at 2 points, suggestive of a closed-loop obstruction. However, the exact cause of the SBO was confirmed at laparotomy, which revealed dual internal hernias (intramesosigmoid and paraduodenal). The hernias were managed individually and the patient had a successful outcome after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Although the present report is of a rare presentation of internal small bowel hernia, the case underscores that patients with this condition may present with SBO. Successful surgical management requires knowledge of the intra-abdominal peritoneal spaces and management of the hernia sac.","output":"Congenital Dual Internal Hernias Causing Small Bowel Obstruction in a Man with no Prior Surgical History: A Report of a Very Rare Case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: To assess the use of a three-dimensional (3D) printed, multilayer facial flap model for use in trainee education as an alternative method of teaching surgical techniques of facial reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: A 3D printed facial flap simulator was designed from a computed tomography scan and manufactured out of silicone for low-cost, high-fidelity simulation. This simulator was tested by a group of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery trainees at a single institution. The simulator group was compared to a control group who completed an exercise on a traditional paper facial flap exercise. Both groups underwent didactic lectures prior to completing their respective exercises. Pre- and post-exercise Likert scale surveys measuring experience, understanding, effectiveness, and realism were completed by both groups. Central tendency, variability, and confidence intervals were measured to evaluate the outcomes. RESULTS: Trainees completing the facial flap simulator reported a statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvement in overall expertise in facial flap procedures, design of facial flaps, and excision of standing cutaneous deformities. No statistically significant improvement was seen in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Trainees found the facial flap simulator to be an effective and useful training tool with a high level of realism in surgical education of facial reconstruction. Surgical simulators can serve as an adjunct to trainee education, especially during extraordinary times such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which significantly impacted surgical training.

These entail, among other things, more time at home, digital forms of communication, school closures, and reduced support and intervention. Aim: Here we aim to systematically assess the effects of the pandemic on autistic and neurotypical (NT) children, and pursue a pre-registered hypothesis suggested by initial observations that some children with autism might respond comparatively well to a situation of constrained, predictable, and digital social communication during the pandemic. Methods: We provide a systematic review of current relevant work, including 76 papers selected from a database search until February 1, 2021. We then report survey data from several countries assessing activities, well-being (PedsQLTM), and social life in families with autism, and their respective change at various stages of the pandemic. We focus on differences between children with and without autism from within the same families, and on different outcomes for children with high- or low-functioning autism. Results: While children with autism scored lower in emotional and social functioning than their NT siblings, comparable decreases in well-being and increases in anxiety were seen for both groups, compared to before the pandemic. By contrast, decreases in adaptability were significantly more pronounced in autistic than NT children. Preliminary results suggest that changes were comparable for children with high- and low-functional autism overall, but individual differences prevail. Conclusions: Overall, although individual families do report some positive effects of pandemic restrictions, our data give no clear evidence that these generalize across children with autism, or even just to children with high-functioning autism. We discuss significant challenges for children with and without autism that need to be addressed to protect childrens well-being under pandemic conditions but also point to potential in the present situation that could be used towards social participation and success in older children and young adults with autism.","output":"Psychosocial and Behavioural Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children with Autism and their Families: A Systematic Review and Initial Data from a Multinational Online Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article looks at the relationship between conflicts of sovereignty and patterns of national party competition, by focusing on the electoral support for two Italian populist radical right parties (PRRPs), the Lega (the League, Lega) and Fratelli dItalia (Brothers of Italy, FdI).

The majority of causal viruses are never identified in low-resource clinical settings as such testing is either not part of routine screening or available diagnostic tools have limited ability to detect new/unexpected viral variants. An in-depth exploration of the blood virome is therefore necessary to clarify the potential viral origin of fever in children. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing is a powerful tool for such broad investigations, allowing the detection of RNA and DNA viral genomes. Here, we describe the blood virome of 816 febrile children (<5 years) presenting at outpatient departments in Dar es Salaam over one-year. We show that half of the patients (394/816) had at least one detected virus recognized as causes of human infection/disease (13.8% enteroviruses (enterovirus A, B, C, and rhinovirus A and C), 12% rotaviruses, 11% human herpesvirus type 6). Additionally, we report the detection of a large number of viruses (related to arthropod, vertebrate or mammalian viral species) not yet known to cause human infection/disease, highlighting those who should be on the radar, deserve specific attention in the febrile paediatric population and, more broadly, for surveillance of emerging pathogens.

Molecular beacons are dual-labeled, hairpin oligonucleotide probes with a reporter fluorophore at one end and a quencher at the other; they are designed to fluoresce only when hybridizing to a complementary target. By imaging the fluorescence signal of molecular beacons, the spread of bRSV was monitored for 7 days with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 to 200, and the measured time course of infection was quantified with a mathematical model for viral growth. We found that molecular beacon signal could be detected in single living cells infected with a viral titer of 2 x 10(3.6) 50% tissue culture infective doses/ml diluted 1,000 fold, demonstrating high detection sensitivity. Low background in uninfected cells and simultaneous staining of fixed cells with molecular beacons and antibodies showed high detection specificity. Furthermore, using confocal microscopy to image the viral genome in live, infected cells, we observed a connected, highly three-dimensional, amorphous inclusion body structure not seen in fixed cells.

Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors have excellent safety and immunogenicity records, but their behavior in human cell cultures remains only partly characterized. We studied here various virological and immunological aspects of the interactions of MVA-HIV, a vaccine candidate developed by the French National Agency for AIDS Research (ANRS), with primary human cells. We report that MVA-HIV infects and drives Gag expression in primary macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and epithelial and muscle cells. MVA-HIV-infected DCs matured, efficiently presented Gag, Pol, and Nef antigens, and activated HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). As expected with this type of vector, infection was cytopathic and led to DC apoptosis. Coculture of MVA-HIV-infected epithelial cells or myotubes with DCs promoted efficient Gag antigen major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) cross-presentation without inducing direct infection and death of DCs. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) infected with MVA-HIV also activated HIV-specific CD4(+) T cells. Moreover, exposure of DCs to MVA-HIV or to MVA-HIV-infected myotubes induced type I interferon (IFN) production and inhibited subsequent HIV replication and transfer to lymphocytes. Altogether, these results show that MVA-HIV promotes efficient MHC-I and MHC-II presentation of HIV antigens by APCs without facilitating HIV replication.

At the same time, differences in socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with health outcomes and access to care, including waiting times for surgery. In public systems where both high- and low-SES patients use the same resources, low-SES patients may be adversely impacted in surgical waiting times. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a publicly-funded health system can provide equitable access to surgical care across socioeconomic status. METHODS: Patient-level records were obtained from a comprehensive provincially-administered surgical wait time database, encompassing years 2006C2015 and 98% of Ontario hospitals. Patient SES was determined by linking postal code with the Material and Social Deprivation Index. Surgical waiting times (time in days between decision to treat and surgery) accounted for patient-initiated delays in treatment, and regression analysis considered age, SES, rurality, sex, priority level for surgical urgency (assigned by surgeons), surgical subspecialty, number of visits, and procedure year. RESULTS: For the 4,253,305 surgical episodes, the mean wait time was 62.3 (SD 75.4) days. Repeated measures least squares regression analysis showed the least deprived SES quintile waited 3 days longer than the most deprived quintile. Wait times dropped in the initial study period but then increased. The proportion of procedures exceeding wait time access targets remained low at 11C13%.

In particular, since from the beginning of the pandemic it has been clear that people from Black and African American backgrounds seem to be hit especially hard by the virus, creating a substantial infection gap. The observed abnormal impact on these ethnic groups could probably be due to the co-occurrence of other known risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation and response to cures, although those factors do not seem able to explain fully and in depth the excess incidence of infections and deaths among African Americans. Here, we introduce the concept of diffusion segregation, that is the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census and mobility data on major US cities, we found that the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in African American communities at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly associated with their level of diffusion segregation. The results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they live, is potentially much more important to contain and curb the spreading of infectious diseases.","output":"Diffusion segregation and the disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 in African American communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Olfactory and taste disorders (OTD) are commonly found as presenting symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with clinically mild COVID-19.

We evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses to four different peptide megapools covering all SARS-CoV-2 proteins during the acute phase of the disease in 33 individuals with mild or no other symptom beside OTD and in 22 age-matched patients with severe infection. A control group of 15 outpatients with OTD and consistently negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA swabs and virus-specific IgG serology was included in the study. Increased frequencies of virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were found in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with OTD compared with those with severe COVID-19 and with SARS-CoV-2 negative OTD individuals.

However, these were never made to be re-used. Although the modes of transmission of COVID-19 are not fully understood, based on what we know about severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), droplets and aerosolized droplets contribute to the spread of this virus. More evidence from Wuhan, China, has demonstrated that COVID-19 viral particles are aerosolized and found in higher concentrations in rooms where PPE is being removed. Thus, it is best for all healthcare providers to have full aerosol protection.

Here, we describe an HTR method called High-throughput CellulAr RNA Sequencing (HiCAR-Seq). HiCAR-Seq was optimized to work directly on cultured cells (as little as 1,000 cells) or 10 ng of total RNA. HiCAR-Seq involves reverse transcription from cultured cells or total RNA using oligo-dT primers followed by the PCR amplification of full-length cDNAs using sample-specific barcode primers in individual plate wells. Amplification of cDNA from every sample can be verified using Bioanalyzer. This step not only reveals cDNA amplification but also provides greater precision for pooling equal concentrations of cDNA from different samples. A single pooled cDNA library is made suitable for sequencing on Illumina sequencers using a tagmentation kit. Because HiCAR-Seq targets a small region at the 3' of the mRNAs, as little as 3 to 4 million reads/sample are enough to infer changes in gene expression in human or mouse cells.

This analysis quantifies the frequency of emergency vitrectomies for retinal detachment and investigates underlying factors. Methods Retrospective identification of patients who underwent primary emergency vitrectomies for retinal detachment at the Cantonal Hospital of Lucerne between 01.01.2018 C 31.12.2020. Parameters were collected, including demographics, date of hospitalisation, reported onset of symptoms, pre-operative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), involvement of the macula, and canton of residence. Results Overall, a total of 665 patients with 683 eyes underwent emergency surgery for primary retinal detachment in the time span of 01.01.2018 C 31.12.2020. Median monthly number of surgeries was 20. During the first Swiss national lockdown (16.03.2020 C 19.04.2020), a minimum of 9 vitrectomies was recorded in March 2020. A maximum of 36 vitrectomies was conducted in August 2020. The mean age of patients was 61.5 years. Of the 665 patients, 133 (20.0%) were residents of the canton of Ticino. Median pre-operative BCVA was 0.25 over all three years, and no significant reduction in pre-operative BCVA was observed during or after the lockdown. The proportion of eyes with involvement of the macula was 52.2%. In 2018, this proportion (47.6%) was significantly lower than in 2019 and 2020 (Chi (2) test, p < 0.001). However, cases with macular involvement in post lockdown months were not more frequent. Median time in days from reported symptom onset to hospitalisation was 5 days. In April 2020, the proportion of patients with > 14 days symptom duration was significantly higher (Chi (2) test, p < 0.001). During the lockdown, there was a significant reduction in cases from Ticino. Also, patients from Ticino showed proportionally longer symptom duration after the lockdown. Conclusion A significant reduction in the number of emergency vitrectomies was observed for the initial period of the coronavirus pandemic. Delayed emergency presentation is not assumed, since there was no increase in severity (i.e. macular involvement) or prolonged symptoms in the months following the lockdown. More protracted symptoms were only observed in patients from Ticino. The initial low numbers were generally made good later in the year.","output":"Emergency Vitrectomies for Retinal Detachment Before and During the Coronavirus Pandemic C A Retrospective Single Centre Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus is a novel human pathogen causing fulminant respiratory syndrome (COVID-19).

The synthesised metabolites were subsequently analysed by qTOF LC-MS/MS, and some were matched to a human blood sample obtained after the consumption of 43 mg of micellarised xanthohumol. Additionally, isomers of the reference standards were identified due to their having the same mass fragmentation pattern and different retention times. Overall, the methods unequivocally identified the metabolites of xanthohumol that are present in the blood circulatory system.

In this study, we investigated the antiviral activity and mechanism of AR-12 against ZIKV. We evaluated the in vitro anti-ZIKV activity of AR-12, using cell protection and virus yield reduction assays, in multiple clinically relevant cell lines, and the in vivo treatment effects of AR-12 in a lethal mouse model using type I interferon receptor-deficient A129 mice. AR-12 inhibited ZIKV strains belonging to both the African and Asian/American lineages in Huh-7 and/or neuronal cells. AR12's IC(50) against ZIKV was consistently <2 M in these cells. ZIKV-infected A129 mice treated with intraperitoneally or orally administered AR-12 had significantly higher survival rate (50.0%C83.3% vs 0%, P < 0.05), less body weight loss, and lower blood and tissue ZIKV RNA loads than untreated control A129 mice. These anti-ZIKV effects were likely the results of down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by AR-12.

Aims This study was designed to appraise the burden of asymptomatic individuals and estimate their occurrence among different age groups and gender by reviewing the existing published data on asymptomatic people with COVID-19. Methods Three electronic databases: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science (WoS) were used to search studies as per the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and the search was limited to English language. The study population of this review includes asymptomatic individuals infected by COVID-19. All original articles which have reported cases of the COVID-19 patients with no symptoms until 31 April 2020 were included in the study. Random effects model was applied to analyze pooled data on the prevalence of symptomless cases among total COVID-19 infected patients and also on different age groups and gender. Results In the meta-analysis of 16 studies, comprising 2,788 COVID-19 infected patients, the pooled prevalence of asymptomatic cases was 48.2% (95% CI, 30%-67%). Among the asymptomatic patients, 55.5% (95% CI, 43.6%-66.8%) were female and 49.6% (95% CI, 20.5%-79.1%) were children. Conclusion About half of the COVID-19 infected patients were asymptomatic cases. Children and females were more apparent to be asymptomatic patient of COVID-19 and could act as unseen carrier of SARS-CoV-2. Symptom based screening only, might fail to identify all SARS-CoV-2 infections escalating the threat of global spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Understanding the underlying reasons why women join trials and their barriers to product use can support identification of ways to improve adherence and its reporting. Eight focus group discussion workshops were conducted with 46 former microbicide trial participants in Durban, South Africa and Mwanza, Tanzania. Participants provided feedback on why women join trials, the barriers to using study gel and reporting adherence accurately, and how clinical trial design can be improved to support better adherence and its reporting. Women join microbicide trials for a number of important reasons such as healthcare and financial reimbursement. Fear of adverse effects from the investigational product was the most important reason why participants reported not using the gel. The key reason for inaccurate reporting of gel use was fear of removal from the trial. Participants made concrete suggestions for improving microbicide trial design such as applicator use testing and real time feedback, improving education to participants about how trials answer their research questions, and improving transparency and clarity about study procedures. Participants also gave feedback on an innovative trial design with a non-randomised arm.

Also, to investigate the risk factors and predictors of these complications to better understand the disease pathogenesis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis enrolled all adult COVID-19 patients admitted through the period from October 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. All patients who received any form of PPV were included. Patients were then divided into two groups based on PBT development, including subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum. Medical records of all patients were reviewed. Patients demographics, laboratory data on admission, respiratory support modes, surgical interventions, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: In the specified period, 1095 patients were hospitalized due to COVID-19 illness. A total of 239 (21.8%) of all admitted patients received PPV. PBT accounted for 21.3% (51/239) of the study cohort. While both groups were equally exposed to the same modes of PPV, receiving invasive ventilation significantly correlated with decreased PBT odds (OR = 0.891; 95% CI, 0.803C0.988; p=0.029). PBT patients were significantly younger (p<0.001). Diabetes mellitus was found to have a protective effect on developing PBT (OR = 0.867; 95% CI, 0.782C0.962), while PO(2)/FIO(2) ratio was inversely associated with higher odds of developing PBT in both univariate and multivariate analyses (p=0.03 and p=0.019, respectively). CONCLUSION: COVID-19-infected patients are at a higher risk of developing PBT.

Self-evaluation is one way of measuring professional behaviour amongst nursing students. However, studies on self-reported professional behaviour of nursing students are limited in Namibia. AIM: This study aimed to investigate nursing students self-reported professional behaviour at the University of Namibia. SETTING: The setting was a university campus offering a Bachelor of Nursing Science degree in Namibia. METHODS: A quantitative descriptive contextual design was used with 100 nursing students. Data were analysed descriptively using a non-parametric KruskalCWallis and ANOVA tests of variance and statistical significance. RESULTS: High mean scores were found in the areas of utilising evidence-based solutions (4.78  0.58), promoting clinical teaching (4.46  0.94), willingness to implement quality improvement initiatives (4.34  0.518), and protecting health, safety and patients rights (4.28  0.55).

The identification of regions with significant additive and non-additive genetic effects was performed using a two-step mixed model-based approach. Genomic scans were followed by gene-set analyses in order to reveal the genetic mechanisms controlling abdominal obesity. The association mapping revealed four regions located on BTA19, BTA20 and BTA24 with significant additive effects. These regions harbor genes, such as SMAD7, ANKRD55, and the HOXB family, that are implicated in lipolysis and insulin tolerance. Three regions located on BTA1, BTA13, and BTA24 showed marked non-additive effects. These regions harbor genes MRAP, MIS18A, PRNP and TSHZ1, that are directly implicated in adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. The gene-set analysis revealed functional terms related to cell arrangement, cell metabolism, cell proliferation, cell signaling, immune response, lipid metabolism, and membrane permeability, among other functions. We further evaluated the genetic link between visceral fat and two metabolic disorders, ketosis, and displaced abomasum. For this, we analyzed 28k records of incidence of metabolic disorders from 14k cows across lactations using a single-step genomic BLUP approach. Notably, the region on BTA20 significantly associated with visceral fat deposition was also associated with the incidence of displaced abomasum. Overall, our findings suggest that visceral fat deposition in dairy cows is controlled by both additive and non-additive effects.

As of April 14, there have been 93 873 confirmed patients of COVID-19 in the UK and 12 107 deaths with confirmed infection. On April 14, it was reported that COVID-19 was the cause of more than half of the deaths in London. METHODS: The present paper addresses the modeling and forecasting of the outbreak of COVID-19 in the UK. This modeling must be accomplished through a 2-part time series model to study the number of confirmed cases and deaths. The period we aimed at a forecast was 46 days from April 15 to May 30, 2020. All the computations and simulations were conducted on Matlab R2015b, and the average curves and confidence intervals were calculated based on 100 simulations of the fitted models. RESULTS: According to the obtained model, we expect that the cumulative number of confirmed cases will reach 282 000 with an 80% confidence interval (242 000 to 316 500) on May 30, from 93 873 on April 14. In addition, it is expected that, over this period, the number of daily new confirmed cases will fall to the interval 1330 to 6450 with the probability of 0.80 by the point estimation around 3100. Regarding death, our model establishes that the real case fatality rate of the pandemic in the UK approaches 11% (80% confidence interval: 8%-15%). Accordingly, we forecast that the total death in the UK will rise to 35 000 (28 000-50 000 with the probability of 80%). CONCLUSIONS: The drawback of this study is the shortage of observations. Also, to conduct a more exact study, it is possible to take the number of the tests into account as an explanatory variable besides time.","output":"Modeling the Number of Confirmed Cases and Deaths from the COVID-19 Pandemic in the UK and Forecasting from April 15 to May 30, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the association between nurses' practice environment (NPE), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and intent to leave among nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A total of 816 newly reported people with HIV in Hefei from 2017 to 2020 were recruited as subjects. HIV subtypes were identified by a phylogenetic tree. The most prevalent subtypes were CRF07_BC (41.4%), CRF01_AE (38.1%) and CRF55_01B (6.3%). Molecular networks were inferred using HIV-TRACE. The largest and most active transmission cluster was CRF55_01B in Hefeis network. A Chinese national database (50,798 sequences) was also subjected to molecular network analysis to study the relationship between patients in Hefei and other provinces. CRF55_01B and CRF07_BC-N had higher clustered and interprovincial transmission rates in the national molecular network. People with HIV in Hefei mainly transmitted the disease within the province.

METHODS This retrospective study included 254 patients with small liver cancer (tumor of 5 cm in diameter and nodule of 3 cm) who had been treated with RFA. Baseline serum GGT was examined before therapy, and overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to analyze the significance of GGT and other serum markers as prognostic factors. RESULTS After a median follow-up of 27 months, 51 patients had died and 123 had hepatic recurrence. After treatment with RFA, HCC patients with elevated GGT had a shorter OS versus those with normal GGT level (p = 0.001); they also had higher recurrence (p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, albumin (p = 0.003), GGT (p = 0.035), and tumor size (p = 0.027) were independent risk factors for survival, and GGT (p = 0.010) and tumor size (p = 0.026) were significant risk factors for recurrence.

DESIGN: In this cohort study, we used a controlled interrupted time series design in which the interruption was the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States on March 13, 2020. The 300-day monitoring period, which evenly bracketed this declaration, started on October 16, 2019, and ended on August 10, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with primary open-angle glaucoma enrolled in an ongoing longitudinal NIH-funded study initiated prior to the onset of the pandemic were selected if they were prescribed ocular hypotensive medication and had adherence data spanning the 300-day period. METHODS: We applied segmented regression analysis using a slope change following a lag impact model to obtain the adherence slopes in the periods preceding and following the segmentation. We compared the two slopes using the Davies test. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The main outcome measure was daily adherence to ocular hypotensive medicationdefined as the number of doses taken divided by the number of doses prescribed, expressed in percent. Adherence was measured objectively using Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) caps. We assessed the associations between change in adherence and demographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors. RESULTS: The sample included 79 patients (mean age, 71 years [SD, 8 years]). Segmented regression identified a breakpoint at day 28 following the declaration of the pandemic. The slope in the post-breakpoint period (-0.04%/day) was significantly different from zero (P < 0.001) and from the slope in the period preceding the breakpoint (0.006%/day) (P < 0.001). A significant positive association was observed between the Connor-Davidson Resilience score and the change in slope between the pre- and post-breakpoint periods (P = 0.002).

To resolve this, we here present the MHCMotifDecon that benefits from state-of-the-art HLA class-I and class-II predictions to accurately deconvolute immunopeptidome datasets and assign individual ligands to the most likely HLA molecule, allowing to identify and characterize HLA binding motifs while discarding co-purified contaminants. We have benchmarked the tool against other state-of-the-art methods and illustrated its application on experimental datasets for HLA-DR demonstrating a previously underappreciated role for HLA-DRB3/4/5 molecules in defining HLA class II immune repertoires. With its ease of use, MHCMotifDecon can efficiently guide interpretation of immunopeptidome datasets, serving the discovery of novel T cell targets. MHCMotifDecon is available at https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?MHCMotifDecon-1.0.","output":"Accurate MHC Motif Deconvolution of Immunopeptidomics Data Reveals a Significant Contribution of DRB3, 4 and 5 to the Total DR Immunopeptidome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARYIt is highly likely that a psychiatrist will be called to an inquest at some point in their career.

We report the first pediatric case of PD-related peritonitis caused by Gordonia bronchialis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old girl with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5D, on continuous cycling PD (CCPD) for 8 years, presented with cloudy PD effluent, with no abdominal discomfort or fever. Intra-peritoneal (IP) loading doses of vancomycin and ceftazidime were started at home after obtaining a PD effluent sample, which showed WBC 2,340  10 /L (59% neutrophils) and Gram-positive bacilli. On admission, she was clinically well and afebrile, with no history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, so vancomycin was discontinued, and IP ceftazidime and cefazolin were started, following a loading dose of intravenous cefazolin. Gordonia species grew after 5 days of incubation and later identified as Gordonia bronchialis. IP vancomycin was restarted as monotherapy, empirically for a total of 3 weeks therapy. A 2-week course of oral ciprofloxacin was added, based on susceptibility testing. PD catheter replacement was advised due to the risk of recurrence but was refused. A relapse occurred 16 days after discontinuing antibiotics, successfully treated with a 2-week course of IP ceftazidime and vancomycin. The PD catheter was removed and hemodialysis initiated. She received a further 2-week course of oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate post PD catheter removal. CONCLUSIONS: Gordonia bronchialis is an emerging pathogen in PD peritonitis and appears to be associated with a high risk of relapse. PD catheter replacement is strongly suggested.","output":"Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis caused by Gordonia bronchialis: first pediatric report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), radiological imaging modalities, such as X-ray and computed tomography (CT), have been identified as effective diagnostic tools. However, the subjective assessment of radiographic examination is a time-consuming task and demands expert radiologists. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have enhanced the diagnostic power of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools and assisted medical specialists in making efficient diagnostic decisions. In this work, we propose an optimal multilevel deep-aggregated boosted network to recognize COVID-19 infection from heterogeneous radiographic data, including X-ray and CT images. Our method leverages multilevel deep-aggregated features and multistage training via a mutually beneficial approach to maximize the overall CAD performance. To improve the interpretation of CAD predictions, these multilevel deep features are visualized as additional outputs that can assist radiologists in validating the CAD results. A total of six publicly available datasets were fused to build a single large-scale heterogeneous radiographic collection that was used to analyze the performance of the proposed technique and other baseline methods. To preserve generality of our method, we selected different patient data for training, validation, and testing, and consequently, the data of same patient were not included in training, validation, and testing subsets. In addition, fivefold cross-validation was performed in all the experiments for a fair evaluation. Our method exhibits promising performance values of 95.38%, 95.57%, 92.53%, 98.14%, 93.16%, and 98.55% in terms of average accuracy, F-measure, specificity, sensitivity, precision, and area under the curve, respectively and outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.","output":"Multilevel Deep-Aggregated Boosted Network to Recognize COVID-19 Infection from Large-Scale Heterogeneous Radiographic Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A COVID-19  uma doen?a recente, com novas manifesta??es descritas a cada dia, o termo \\"Long Covid\\"  utilizado para descrever altera??es que persistem aps um tempo prolongado da remiss?o da doen?a, ou em situa??es que a manifesta??o inicia aps a remiss?o completa do quadro gripal.

Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 68 hospitalized children with bronchiolitis and 85 children with recurrent wheezing were obtained. Eleven common respiratory viruses were sought by PCR and/or direct fluorescence assay. Bacteria were isolated from NPAs by routine culture methods. Cell numbers and concentrations of cytokines/chemokines in the NPAs were measured, and nucleated cells were characterized. The frequency of bacterial colonization in children with recurrent wheezing was significantly higher than in children with an initial attack of bronchiolitis. Bacterial colonization accompanying virus infection had no effect on clinical manifestations, duration of hospitalization, concentrations of cytokines/chemokines (except interleukin-10 (IL-10)) or cellularity in the children with bronchiolitis; however, among the children with recurrent wheezing, those who had coexistent non-invasive bacterial colonization and virus infection presented more frequent cyanosis, longer duration of hospitalization, a higher concentration of IL-10 and a higher percentage of neutrophils in NPAs than those with virus infection but without bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization was common in children with virus-induced wheezing, particularly in the situation of recurrent wheezing.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we wanted to see if there was an association between perceived stress and insomnia symptoms, as well as the moderating impact of resilience for Chinese pregnant women. METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined 2115 pregnant women from central and western China using multi-stage sampling methodologies. A systematic questionnaire was used to collect information on sleep quality, perceived stress, and resilience using the Insomnia Severity Index, Perceptual Stress Scale, and Connor and Davidson Resilience Scale. To assess the moderating influence of resilience, hierarchical regressions were used. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 18.53% of respondents (N = 2115) reported experiencing sleeplessness. In pregnant women, perceived stress was positively linked with insomnia symptoms (p < 0.001). Furthermore, resilience significantly attenuated the influence of perceived stress on insomnia symptoms in Chinese expectant mother ((interaction) = ?0.0126, p < 0.001).

They are powerful because there are consequences associated with breaking laws. The intention of legislation is to create societies where all people are compelled to do what is good. The assumption inherent in legislation is that laws serve the common good. This however, is not always the case in reality. There are good and bad laws. This chapter analyses Zimbabwes regulatory framework to assess its impact of the urban food system. The data was collected by reviewing the relevant laws, by-laws, policies and plans used in the regulation of the urban food system. The examination reveals that most Zimbabwean laws are very old and have not been regularly reviewed to reflect contemporary challenges and the socio-economic reality. They are not responsive and cannot respond to pandemics, such as the COVID-19. They have not been adapted to meet the objectives of the New Urban Agenda (NUA). Some of the most frequently used laws were enacted for a different era and no longer effectively serve under the current circumstances. The study also reveals that the laws are negative and aim to control and stop rather than facilitate innovation and encourage compliance. It concludes that Zimbabwean authorities must consider a new innovative people-centred approach to enacting legislation to govern livelihoods in general and the food system in particular. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Urban Food: An Examination of the Policy and Legislative Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This contribution deals with the impact of digitisation on what it means to educate and to he educated, especially in the wake of the massive switch to on-screen learning during the COVID-19 crisis.

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, before-and-after, cross-sectional study to compare the rates of colonization and infection with CPE and/or CR-Ab in 2 study periods, period 1 (JanuaryCApril 2019) and period 2 (JanuaryCApril 2020). Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of weekly colonization and infection rates for each period were compared for the 2 study periods using Poisson regression. Weekly trends in the incidence of colonization or infection for each study period were summarized using local weighted (Loess) regression. RESULTS: We detected no significant change in either IRR and weekly trend in CPE colonization and infection during the 2 study periods. A shift from KPC to other CPE mechanisms (OXA-48 and VIM) was observed during period 2. Compared to period 1, during period 2 the IRR of colonization and infection with CR-Ab increased 7.5- and 5.5-fold, respectively. Genome sequencing showed that all CR-Ab strains belonged to the CC92/IC2 clonal lineage. Clinical strains clustered closely into a single monophyletic group in 1 of the 3 centers, whereas they segregated in 2 different clusters in the other 2 centers, which strongly indicates horizontal transmission.

Hesitant adopters are individuals who express some level of hesitancy about the vaccine but have also received at least one dose of the vaccine. Using a qualitative descriptive design, three loci for motivation emerged during analysis: extrinsic motivators, intrinsic motivators, and structural motivators. Extrinsic motivations, such as protecting ones community, family, and friends, were reported as driving vaccination behavior. Among intrinsic motivators, the desire to protect themselves from COVID-19 was the most frequently reported. Structural motivators were also identified, indicating that vaccine mandates also serve to motivate hesitant adopters of the COVID-19 vaccine. These findings have important implications in ongoing efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake in the US and highlight the multi-dimensional motivations for vaccination among hesitant adopters.

Also, we discuss the first subacute thyroiditis in the context of SARS-CoV2 vaccination with the Modernas vaccine. Finally, we provide another case to be added to existing evidence on Graves disease occurring post-vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. DISCUSSION: Adjuvants play an important role in vaccines. Their ability to increase the immunogenicity of the active ingredient is necessary to achieve the desired immune response. Both the Moderna and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines use mRNA coding for the SARS-CoV2 S protein enhanced by adjuvants. In addition, the cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV2 and thyroid antigens has been reported. This would explain, at least, some of the autoimmune/inflammatory reactions produced during and after SARS-CoV2 infection and vaccination.

The major functions of HSP27 include chaperoning misfolded or unfolded polypeptides and protecting cells from toxic stress. Dysregulation of stress proteins is associated with many human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinsons disease (PD). PD is characterized by the presence of aggregates of -synuclein in the central and peripheral nervous system, which induces the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and in the autonomic nervous system. Autonomic dysfunction is an important non-motor phenotype of PD, which includes cardiovascular dysregulation, among others. Nowadays, the therapies for PD focus on dopamine (DA) replacement. However, certain non-motor symptoms with a great impact on quality of life do not respond to dopaminergic drugs; therefore, the development and testing of new treatments for non-motor symptoms of PD remain a priority. Since small HSP27 was shown to prevent -synuclein aggregation and cytotoxicity, this protein might constitute a suitable target to prevent or delay the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. In the first part of our review, we focus on the cardiovascular dysregulation observed in PD patients. In the second part, we present data on the possible role of HSP27 in preventing the accumulation of amyloid fibrils and aggregated forms of -synuclein.

However, reliable estimates of the contribution of obesity to mortality in the U.S. are lacking, because of inconsistent coding of obesity-related causes of death. Methods We compare five International Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10) coding schemes for obesity-related mortality used in the literature and examine how the magnitude of obesity-related mortality burdens varies across different schemes. We use U.S. multiple cause of death data and population estimates for the Black, white, and Latino population in the years 2010, 2015, and 2020. In sex- and race/ethnic-stratified analyses, we estimate the potential years of life expectancy gained if obesity-related mortality had not occurred as measured by each coding scheme. Results We estimate that obesity-related mortality contributes to up to 78 months (6.5 years) of lost U.S. life expectancy, though estimates range from as low as 0 months, with a median contribution across ICD-10 coding schemes of about 20 months (1.7 years). Despite substantial variation across coding schemes, obesity-related mortality consistently contributes more to life expectancy deficits for Black Americans compared to white and Latino Americans. Across all ICD-10 coding schemes, the age pattern of obesity follows a J-shaped curve, suggesting exponential increases in obesity-related mortality after age 25. Conclusions The estimation of the burden of obesity-related mortality on life expectancy in the United States varies widely depending on the causes of death used in analyses. This inconsistency may obscure our understanding of the contribution of obesity-related mortality to trends in life expectancy.

This study explores what clinicians know about diagnostic and/or therapeutic aspects of autistic older adults and how aging plays a role in the course of ASD. METHODS: A Delphi study outlines the point of view of 11 clinical experts in the Netherlands and Belgium (Flanders). RESULTS: Regarding diagnostics, age-specific aspects need to be considered. Age-related characteristics (cognitive differences, life events, co-occurring conditions) influence detecting autistic features in older adults. Regarding treatment, counseling methods need to be adapted. Psychoeducation, family therapy, couples therapy, behavioral counseling and psychopharmaca can be helpful in meeting the needs of autistic older adults. There was no consensus on the effects of aging on autistic older adults. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis and treatment of ASD need adaptation for autistic older adults. Further research is needed on the validation of measurement tools, recorded treatment, therapy, psychoeducation, and the effects of aging among people on the autism spectrum.

Customers buy subscriptions, not individual pieces of content, and once subscribed they may consume many pieces of content in addition to the one(s) that drew them to the service. In this paper, we propose a scalable methodology to estimate the incremental acquisition impact of content launches in a subscription business model when randomized experimentation is not feasible. Our approach uses simple assumptions to transform the problem into an equivalent question: what is the expected consumption rate for new subscribers who did not join due to the content launch? We estimate this counterfactual rate using the consumption rate of new subscribers who joined just prior to launch, while making adjustments for variation related to subscriber attributes, the in-product experience, and seasonality. We then compare our counterfactual consumption to the actual rate in order to back out an acquisition estimate. Our methodology provides top-line impact estimates at the content / day / region grain. Additionally, to enable subscriber-level attribution, we present an algorithm that assigns specific individual accounts to add up to the top-line estimate. Subscriber-level attribution is derived by solving an optimization problem to minimize the number of subscribers attributed to more than one piece of content, while maximizing the average propensity to be incremental for subscribers attributed to each piece of content. Finally, in the absence of definitive ground truth, we present several validation methods which can be used to assess the plausibility of impact estimates generated by these methods.","output":"Estimating Incremental Acquisition of Content Launches in a Subscription Service"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coastal ports play a pivotal role in ensuring the healthy development of China's national economy and society and the smooth flow of global supply chain. The novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic is impacting the global supply chain system. In this context, China's coastal port throughput prediction has become the focus of attention. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a model to accurately predict the throughput of coastal ports in China. This paper constructs the economy-industry bi-directional prediction model. It also provides a possibility for forecasting the throughput of China's coastal ports during the 14th Five-Year Plan period. On the one hand, build a model to measure the relationship between economic growth and coastal port throughput growth. On the other hand, the model is constructed to measure the correlation between major goods such as coal, iron ore and crude oil. Thus, another result of coastal port throughput is obtained. Given the corresponding weights of the two results, the final prediction results are obtained. It is concluded that on the basis of 2020, China's coastal port throughput will reach 10.7 billion tons by 2025, with an average annual increase of 2.5% during the 14th Five-Year Plan period. China's coastal port throughput growth rate will slow down.

In Nigeria, as of 21(st) April 2020, 668 confirmed cases, 22 deaths and 188 recoveries have been reported. Police officers are at the forefront of enforcing advisories to ensure public compliance. However, there is a paucity of data on knowledge, risk perception, and adherence to COVID-19 advisories issued by the Health authorities particularly among the police officers. We, therefore, assessed the knowledge, risk perceptions and adherence to NCDC recommended advisory on COVID-19. METHODS: we conducted a two-stage sampling cross-sectional study among different cadres of police officers in Benue State, Nigeria using a pretested, semi-structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire. The results of the study were presented in frequencies and proportions. Chi-square test was used for an association between variables at p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: the mean age of the 305 participants was 39.1  8.4 years and most, 124 (40.7%) of the participants were within age-group 30-39 years, 19 (64.3%.8) were male, 250 (82.0%) were married and 160 (52.5%) had secondary education as the highest qualification.

Although remarkable progress in SEs has been achieved and has resulted in high ionic conductivity, which now reaches values comparable to those of liquid electrolytes, the typical use of a slurry process for the fabrication of conventional ASSBs inevitably causes harmful reactions between sulfide materials and polar solvents. Here, we studied the efficient infiltration process of SE slurry into conventional composite LIB electrodes (NCM622) for achieving high-energy-density ASSBs via a scalable solution-based fabrication process. Two methods are proposed to ensure that SE materials are evenly distributed and sufficiently infiltrated into the porous structures of LIB electrodes. The LPSCl SE solutions were effectively infiltrated into the electrodes at higher processing temperatures and the temperature was subsequently optimized at above the boiling point of the ethanol solvent due to the dynamic motion of SE molecules via a convective flow during solvent vaporization. Moreover, the porous LIB composite electrodes with a mixture of active materials of different particle sizes formed and filled capillary pores resulting in a high electrode density. The LPSCl SE-infiltrated NCM622 electrodes that used this strategy could remarkably improve the initial discharge capacity of ASSBs to as high as 177 mAh/g. These ASSBs also showed excellent performance even at high loading values (about 17 mg/cm2), making them competitive with LIBs using conventional liquid electrolytes.","output":"Facile fabrication of solution-processed solid-electrolytes for high-energy-density all-solid-state-batteries by enhanced interfacial contact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Limited knowledge exists on immune markers associated with disease severity or recovery in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

COVID-19-associated AIS results in higher mortality and worse functional outcome. Predictors of functional outcome in COVID-19-associated AIS are required. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of patients with AIS hospitalised in seven neurological wards in Malopolska Voivodship (Poland) between August and December 2020. We gathered data concerning the patients' age, sex, presence of cardiovascular risk factors, type of treatment received, and the presence of stroke-associated infections (including pneumonia, urinary tract infection and infection of unknown source). We calculated 4C Mortality Score at stroke onset, and investigated whether there was a correlation with neurological deficit measured using the National Health Institute Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and functional outcome assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at discharge. RESULTS: The study included 52 patients with COVID-19-associated AIS. The 4C Mortality Score at stroke onset correlated with mRS (rs = 0.565, p < 0.01) at discharge. There was also a statistically significant difference in the mean 4C Mortality Score between patients who died and patients who survived the stroke (13.08  2.71 vs. 9.85  3.47, p = 0.04).

It is unknown whether this practice variation contributed to outcome differences. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of all adult patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 admitted between March 11 and May 31, 2020 to a medical or surgical ICU at three Massachusetts hospitals. Medical charts were manually reviewed by physicians and abstracted into a standardized REDCap database. Chi-square test for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables were performed using R version 4.0.2. Results: Data from 429 patients were analyzed. Among the three institutions, there were significant differences in race, prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, duration of COVID-19 symptoms on presentation, and days between admission and intubation. Significant differences were observed in presentation acuity by sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score but not simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) or PaO2:FiO2 ratios. Hospital A intubated more patients on the day of admission and utilized more inhaled nitric oxide and less immunosuppression (steroids, anti-IL6 agents). Hospital B treated more patients with remdesivir, other experimental antivirals, and early paralysis (within 48 hours of intubation) but less awake prone positioning. Hospital C utilized more non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and high flow oxygen in lieu of intubation;it also administered more statins and steroids for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and used less early proning within 48 hours of intubation. No difference in hydroxychloroquine use was seen across institutions. There were no statistical differences across hospitals in reintubation, ventilator-free days at 28 days, or in-hospital mortality. Transition to comfort measures was more common at hospital C. There was a trend at hospital A toward lower 30-day (A=25.3%, B=32.1%, C=39.4%;p=0.054) and 90-day (A=28.5%, B=36.1%, C=41.4%;p=0.085) mortality. At hospital A there was significantly longer hospital length-of-stay (A=25.0, B=19.0, C=15.0;p=0.004) and ICU length-of-stay (A=18.0, B=15.0, C=12.0;p=0.001). Conclusions: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic in Massachusetts, there were significant differences in patient characteristics and treatments administered across three institutions. One institution demonstrated a trend toward lower 30-day and 90-day mortality despite later presentation from symptom onset, higher admission acuity, and less utilization of remdesivir or steroids.

Results: : A total of 12 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection from 6 hospitals were enrolled in the study;6 were boys. The mean age was 9.8  4.7 years, with a minimum age of 2 years and 10 months. The mean body weight was 37.3  23.6 kg, with a minimum body weight of 13.0 kg. There were no severe cases or critical severe cases. There were 2 cases of mild pneumonia (16.7%), 7 cases of acute upper respiratory tract infection (58.3%), and 3 cases of latent infection (25.0%). In terms of symptoms, there were 7 cases of fever (58.3%), 5 cases of cough (41.7%), 3 cases of runny nose (25.0%), 2 cases of systemic fatigue and soreness (16.7%), and 4 cases of no symptoms (33.3%). Three patients (75.0%) showed decreased white blood cell (WBC) counts for their first complete blood count (CBC) after admission, and one patient (8.3%) had a low lymphocyte count. There were no obvious abnormalities in C-reactive protein (CRP, 1.53  2.28 mg/l), procalcitonin (PCT, 0.21  0.13 ng/ml), or coagulation function. No abnormalities were detected for creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CKMB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr). Six cases (50.0%) were positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibodies. 2 cases showed pulmonary exudative lesions on chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT). All children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptionCpolymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays of throat swabs. 9 patients received antiviral treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. All patients received symptomatic supportive treatment and were quarantined, and their conditions improved. There was no respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock complications, or death observed for any case. All patients recovered and were discharged, with an average length of hospital stay of 14 days. Conclusions: : This study with a small sample size suggests that all SARS-CoV-2-infected children had normal or reduced WBCs;however, fever was not as common as expected, and a decrease in lymphocyte count was rare.

Additionally, the fear of COVID-19 contagion delays the consultation of patients, resulting in the deterioration of their acute diseases by the time of consultation.

Main working hypothesis: infection by COVID-19 increases postoperative 30-day-mortality for any cause in patients submitted to emergency/urgent general or gastrointestinal surgery. Likewise, hospital collapse during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic increased 30-day-mortality for any cause. Hence, the main objective of this study is to estimate the cumulative incidence of mortality at 30-days-after-surgery.

It is of importance to reveal if these patients develop an antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 and to define which antibodies confer virus neutralization. We conducted a comprehensive serological survey of 49 patients with a mild course of disease and quantified neutralizing antibody responses against a clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolate employing human cells as targets. Four patients (8%), even though symptomatic, did not develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and two other patients (4%) were positive in only one of the six serological assays employed. For the remaining 88%, antibody response against the S protein correlated with serum neutralization whereas antibodies against the nucleocapsid were poor predictors of virus neutralization. None of the sera enhanced infection of human cells with SARS-CoV-2 at any dilution, arguing against antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in our system. Regarding neutralization, only six patients (12%) could be classified as high neutralizers. Furthermore, sera from several individuals with fairly high antibody levels had only poor neutralizing activity. In addition, employing a novel serological Western blot system to characterize antibody responses against seasonal coronaviruses, we found that antibodies against the seasonal coronavirus 229E might contribute to SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Altogether, we show that there is a wide breadth of antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in patients that differentially correlate with virus neutralization. This highlights the difficulty to define reliable surrogate markers for immunity against SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE There is strong interest in the nature of the neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 in infected individuals. For vaccine development, it is especially important which antibodies confer protection against SARS-CoV-2, if there is a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, and if there is cross-protection by antibodies directed against seasonal coronaviruses. We addressed these questions and found in accordance with other studies that neutralization is mediated mainly by antibodies directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in general and the receptor binding site in particular. In our test system, utilizing human cells for infection experiments, we did not detect ADE. However, using a novel diagnostic test we found that antibodies against the coronavirus 229E might be involved in cross-protection to SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Antibody Response against SARS-CoV-2 and Seasonal Coronaviruses in Nonhospitalized COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The gaming industry is rapidly expanding.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of pre-existing filarial infection on concurrent infection with influenza A virus. A murine model of co-infection was established using the filarial helminth Litomosoides sigmodontis and the H1N1 (A/WSN/33) influenza A virus (IAV). Co-infection was performed at 3 different stages of L. sigmodontis infection (larval, juvenile adult, and patency), and the impact of co-infection was determined by IAV induced weight loss and clinical signs, quantification of viral titres, and helminth counts. Significant alterations of IAV pathogenesis, dependent upon stage of infection, was observed on co-infection with L. sigmodontis. Larval stage L. sigmodontis infection alleviated clinical signs of IAV co-infection, whilst more established juvenile adult infection also significantly delayed weight loss. Viral titres remained unaltered at either infection stage. In contrast, patent L. sigmdodontis infection led to a reversal of age-related resistance to IAV infection, significantly increasing weight loss and clinical signs of infection as well as increasing IAV titre.

Despite the favorable high level of consensus regarding the PANOS concept and despite its potential to become a balanced integrated care concept according to the DMIC, its full implementation remains a considerable challenge.","output":"Parkinson Network Eastern Saxony (PANOS): Reaching Consensus for a Regional Intersectoral Integrated Care Concept for Patients with Parkinsons Disease in the Region of Eastern Saxony, Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An excessive inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be a major cause of disease severity in COVID-19. The aim herein was to determine the prognostic value of IL-6, and demonstrate the comparison between IL-6 and related parameters in COVID-19. Data were collected from 115 COVID-19 patients. The median age was 46.04 years in the mild group, 56.42 years in the moderate group, and 62.92 years in the severe group (p=0.001). There was a significant difference in the hospitalized clinic to intensive care unit ratio among the patients (p<0.001). The IL-6 values were significantly higher in the severe group than those in the mild (p=0.04) and moderate groups (p=0.043). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for IL-6, as predictor of severe clinical condition, was 0.864 (95% CI 0.765C0.963 p=0.000). The longitudinal analyses showed that the severe group presented with significantly increased IL-6 levels during hospitalization. IL\\\\6 seemed to be a guide in the early diagnosis of severe COVID-19 and an ideal marker for monitoring negative outcome.

The current study aimed to use deep learning methods to detect caries lesions, classify different radiographic extensions on panoramic films, and compare the classification results with those of expert dentists. Methods: A total of 1160 dental panoramic films were evaluated by three expert dentists. All caries lesions in the films were marked with circles, whose combination was defined as the reference dataset. A training and validation dataset (1071) and a test dataset (89) were then established from the reference dataset. A convolutional neural network, called nnU-Net, was applied to detect caries lesions, and DenseNet121 was applied to classify the lesions according to their depths (dentin lesions in the outer, middle, or inner third D1/2/3 of dentin). The performance of the test dataset in the trained nnU-Net and DenseNet121 models was compared with the results of six expert dentists in terms of the intersection over union (IoU), Dice coefficient, accuracy, precision, recall, negative predictive value (NPV), and F1-score metrics. Results: nnU-Net yielded caries lesion segmentation IoU and Dice coefficient values of 0.785 and 0.663, respectively, and the accuracy and recall rate of nnU-Net were 0.986 and 0.821, respectively. The results of the expert dentists and the neural network were shown to be no different in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, NPV, and F1-score. For caries depth classification, DenseNet121 showed an overall accuracy of 0.957 for D1 lesions, 0.832 for D2 lesions, and 0.863 for D3 lesions. The recall results of the D1/D2/D3 lesions were 0.765, 0.652, and 0.918, respectively. All metric values, including accuracy, precision, recall, NPV, and F1-score values, were proven to be no different from those of the experienced dentists. Conclusion: In detecting and classifying caries lesions on dental panoramic radiographs, the performance of deep learning methods was similar to that of expert dentists. The impact of applying these well-trained neural networks for disease diagnosis and treatment decision making should be explored.","output":"Deep Learning for Caries Detection and Classification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hispanics are among the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. workforce. In 2006, an estimated 19.6 million workers in the United States were Hispanic, 56% of whom were foreign born. To characterize work-related injury deaths among Hispanic workers in the United States, CDC, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and certain state agencies analyzed data from 1992-2006. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, during 1992-2006, a total of 11,303 Hispanic workers died from work-related injuries. The death rate for Hispanic workers decreased during this period; however, the rate was consistently higher than the rate for all U.S. workers, and the proportion of deaths among foreign-born Hispanic workers increased over time. During 2003-2006, 34% of Hispanic worker deaths occurred in the construction industry. Additional efforts are needed to reduce the risk for death among Hispanic workers because of projected increases in their employment, involvement in work with high risk for injury, susceptibility to miscommunication caused by language differences, and other potential risks associated with culture and economic status.","output":"Work-related injury deaths among hispanics--United States, 1992-2006."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells, unique to initiate and coordinate the adaptive immune response. In pigs, conventional DCs (cDCs), plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) have been described in blood and tissues. Different pathogens, such as viruses, could infect these cells, and in some cases, compromise their response. The understanding of the interaction between DCs and viruses is critical to comprehend viral immunopathological responses. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the most important respiratory pathogen in the global pig population. Different reports support the notion that PRRSV modulates pig immune response in addition to their genetic and antigenic variability. The interaction of PRRSV with DCs is a mostly unexplored area with conflicting results and lots of uncertainties. Among the scarce certainties, cDCs and pDCs are refractory to PRRSV infection in contrast to moDCs. Additionally, response of DCs to PRRSV can be different depending on the type of DCs and maybe is related to the virulence of the viral isolate. The precise impact of this virus-DC interaction upon the development of the specific immune response is not fully elucidated. The present review briefly summarizes and discusses the previous studies on the interaction of in vitro derived bone marrow (bm)- and moDCs, and in vivo isolated cDCs, pDCs, and moDCs with PRRSV1 and 2.","output":"Swine Dendritic Cell Response to Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus: An Update"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID 19 pandemic has created difficulties for children registered under Children's Palliative Care in Mumbai. 2 hospitals who have started Services last year would like to share their experiences on difficulties faced by Children and their families and unique ways in which solutions were found to help them surmount all odds.

Objectives: This review aimed to identify which clinical dental procedures do generate droplets and aerosols with subsequent contamination, and for these, characterise their pattern, spread and settle. Materials and Method: Six databases were searched and citation chasing undertaken (to 11/08/20). Screening stages were undertaken in duplicate, independently, by two researchers. Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Results: Eighty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and covered: Ultrasonic scaling (USS, n=44), high speed air-rotor (HSAR, n=31); oral surgery (n=11), slow-speed handpiece (n=4); air-water (triple) syringe (n=4), air-polishing (n=4), prophylaxis (n=2) and hand-scaling (n=2). Although no studies investigated respiratory viruses, those on bacteria, blood splatter and aerosol showed activities using powered devices produced the greatest contamination. Contamination was found for all activities, and at the furthest points studied. The operator torso operator arm, and patient body were especially affected. Heterogeneity precluded significant inter-study comparisons but intra-study comparisons allowed construction of a proposed hierarchy of procedure contamination risk: higher risk (USS, HSAR, air-water syringe [air only or air/water together], air polishing, extractions using motorised hand-pieces); moderate (slow-speed handpieces, prophylaxis with pumice, extractions) and lower (air-water syringe [water only] and hand scaling. Conclusion: Significant gaps in the evidence, low sensitivity of measures and variable quality limit firm conclusions around contamination for different procedures. However, a hierarchy of contamination from procedures can be proposed for challenge/verification by future research which should consider standardised methodologies to facilitate research synthesis. Clinical significance (49 words): This manuscript addresses uncertainty around aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) in dentistry. Findings indicate a continuum of procedure-related aerosol generation rather than the current binary AGP or non-AGP perspective.

Understanding the dysregulated human immune responses in the fatal subjects is critical for management of COVID-19 patients and the pandemic. In this study, we examined the immune cell compositions in the lung tissues and hilar lymph nodes using immunohistochemistry on 6 deceased COVID-19 patients and 4 focal organizing pneumonia (FOP) patients who underwent lung surgery and served as controls. We found a dominant presence of macrophages and a general deficiency of T cells and B cells in the lung tissues from deceased COVID-19 patients. In contrast to the FOP patients, Tfh cells and germinal center formation were largely absent in the draining hilar lymph nodes in the deceased COVID-19 patients. This was correlated with reduced IgM and IgG levels compared to convalescent COVID-19 patients. In summary, our data highlight a defect of germinal center structure in deceased COVID-19 patients leading to an impaired humoral immunity.

Understanding the causes of poor food safety practices is key to preventing food-borne diseases. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of food safety practices and associated factors among health extension model and non-model households in Kombolcha, Ethiopia. METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among 327 model households and 329 non-model households in Kombolcha. Four kebeles were selected randomly from a total of 12 kebeles, followed by a systematic random sampling method to select a total of 656 households. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews with household heads and observations from April 15 to May 15, 2021. Data were entered into EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 25.0. Determinants of food safety practices were determined by using multivariable logistic regression model at a p-value <0.05. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of food safety practices was 44.7% (95% CI: 40.5C48.4%), of which 57.8% (95% CI: 53.0C63.1%) were model and 31.6% (95% CI: 26.5C36.7%) were non-model households, with significant variation among household types. Being a model household (AOR=2.99; 95% CI: 1.98C4.52), having a female household head (AOR=3.13; 95% CI: 2.13C4.59), proper solid waste management (AOR=2.32; 95% CI: 1.54C3.48), good knowledge of food safety (AOR=2.05; 95% CI: 1.43C3.03), and good attitude (AOR=1.74; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.49) were significant predictors of good food safety practices. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of good food safety practices was not satisfactory. Being a model household, having a female household head, proper solid waste management, good knowledge, and good attitude were significantly associated with good food safety practices. Therefore, the identified modifiable factors are potential areas of intervention to enhance good food safety practices.","output":"Self-Reported Food Safety Practices and Associated Factors Among Health Extension Model and Non-Model Households in Northeastern Ethiopia: A Comparative Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research on the effectiveness of mental health and psychosocial support interventions for common mental disorders in global mental health provides controversial results.

Some pairs were the same as those initially learned, for which we expected facilitation relative to previously unencountered pairs. Other pairs were made up of previously learned elements in different combinations, for which we might expect interference. Younger and older participants showed similar levels of facilitation from previously learned associations relative to new pairs. In addition, older participants exhibited proactive interference from long-term to working memory, whereas younger participants exhibited facilitation, even for pairings that conflicted with those learned earlier in the experiment. These findings confirm older adults greater susceptibility to proactive interference and we discuss the theoretical implications of younger adults apparent immunity to interference.

While all prices spiked initially in April, they recovered relatively quickly, underscoring the importance of time duration for analysis. Wheat prices were anchored in large part by the minimum support price, while tomato prices were lower in some months. Supply constraints began easing in May with greater market arrivals perhaps reflecting distress sales. Market reform measures did help in insulating farmers from lower prices, but these effects are salient for the perishable goods, and not so much for wheat where the government remained the dominant market player.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed medical records of consecutive patients who had undergone mechanical thrombectomy for intravenous tissue plasminogen activator-failed/ineligible acute intracranial major vessel occlusion between October 2010 and April 2013 at our institution. MRA follow-up was performed at baseline and at 24  6 hours and 3 months after mechanical thrombectomy. RESULTS Forty-nine patients underwent mechanical thrombectomy for acute intracranial major vessel occlusion. Mean age was 69.7  11.5 years, and baseline median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score was 15 (range, 8-24). Occlusion was found in the internal carotid artery in 18 patients (36.7%), middle cerebral artery in 26 patients (53%), and vertebral-basilar arteries in 5 patients (10.2%). Successful recanalization, as defined by a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction flow grade of 2b or 3, was achieved in 40 patients (81.6%). MRA follow-up at 24 hours after the treatment revealed that reocclusion of recanalized vessels was observed in 3 of 38 patients (7.9%). Long-term MRA follow-up showed that 2 of 27 patients (8.3%) developed diffuse severe stenosis of treated vessels.

However, understanding the patterns of risk perception could also facilitate effective risk communication to minimize the impacts of disease spread during this crisis. OBJECTIVE: We attempt to explore patterns of community health risk perceptions of COVID-19 in South Korea using internet search data. METHODS: Google Trends (GT) and NAVER relative search volumes (RSVs) data were collected using COVID-19-related terms in the Korean language and were retrieved according to time, gender, age groups, types of device, and location. Online queries were compared to the number of daily new COVID-19 cases and tests reported in the Kaggle open-access data set for the time period of December 5, 2019, to May 31, 2020. Time-lag correlations calculated by Spearman rank correlation coefficients were employed to assess whether correlations between new COVID-19 cases and internet searches were affected by time. We also constructed a prediction model of new COVID-19 cases using the number of COVID-19 cases, tests, and GT and NAVER RSVs in lag periods (of 1-3 days). Single and multiple regressions were employed using backward elimination and a variance inflation factor of <5. RESULTS: The numbers of COVID-19-related queries in South Korea increased during local events including local transmission, approval of coronavirus test kits, implementation of coronavirus drive-through tests, a face mask shortage, and a widespread campaign for social distancing as well as during international events such as the announcement of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization. Online queries were also stronger in women (r=0.763-0.823; P<.001) and age groups &#8804;29 years (r=0.726-0.821; P<.001), 30-44 years (r=0.701-0.826; P<.001), and &#8805;50 years (r=0.706-0.725; P<.001). In terms of spatial distribution, internet search data were higher in affected areas. Moreover, greater correlations were found in mobile searches (r=0.704-0.804; P<.001) compared to those of desktop searches (r=0.705-0.717; P<.001), indicating changing behaviors in searching for online health information during the outbreak. These varied internet searches related to COVID-19 represented community health risk perceptions. In addition, as a country with a high number of coronavirus tests, results showed that adults perceived coronavirus test-related information as being more important than disease-related knowledge. Meanwhile, younger, and older age groups had different perceptions. Moreover, NAVER RSVs can potentially be used for health risk perception assessments and disease predictions. Adding COVID-19-related searches provided by NAVER could increase the performance of the model compared to that of the COVID-19 case-based model and potentially be used to predict epidemic curves.

CYP72A154 expressed in an engineered yeast strain that endogenously produces 11-oxo--amyrin (a possible biosynthetic intermediate between -amyrin and glycyrrhizin) catalyzed three sequential oxidation steps at C-30 of 11-oxo--amyrin supplied in situ to produce glycyrrhetinic acid, a glycyrrhizin aglycone. Furthermore, CYP72A63 of Medicago truncatula, which has high sequence similarity to CYP72A154, was able to catalyze C-30 oxidation of -amyrin.

This study evaluated access to health care services among selected essential workers. METHODS: We used the most recent data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2017-2018, to estimate the prevalence of 4 measures of health care access (having health insurance, being able to afford to see a doctor when needed, having a personal health care provider, and having a routine checkup in the past year) by broad and detailed occupation group among 189 208 adults aged 18-64. RESULTS: Of all occupations studied, workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations were most likely to have no health insurance (46.4%). Personal care aides were most likely to have been unable to see a doctor when needed because of cost (29.3%). Construction laborers were most likely to lack a personal health care provider (51.1%) and to have not had a routine physical checkup in the past year (50.6%). Compared with workers in general, workers in 3 broad occupation groups-food preparation and serving; building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; and construction trades-had significantly lower levels of health care access for all 4 measures. CONCLUSION: Lack of health insurance and underinsurance were common among subsets of essential workers. Limited access to health care might decrease essential workers' access to medical testing and needed care and hinder their ability to address underlying conditions, thereby increasing their risk of severe outcomes from some infectious diseases, such as COVID-19.

For example, messenger RNAs, transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs are involved in protein synthesis, whereas noncoding RNAs have numerous regulatory roles. Ribonucleases (RNases) are the enzymes responsible for the processing and degradation of all types of RNAs, having multiple roles in every aspect of RNA metabolism. However, the involvement of RNases in disease is still not well understood. This review focuses on the involvement of the RNase II/RNB family of 3'-5' exoribonucleases in human disease. This can be attributed to direct effects, whereby mutations in the eukaryotic enzymes of this family [defective in sister chromatid joining (Dis3; or Rrp44), Dis3-like exonuclease 1 (Dis3L1; or Dis3L) and Dis3-like exonuclease 2 (Dis3L2)] are associated with a disease, or indirect effects, whereby mutations in the prokaryotic counterparts of RNase II/RNB family (RNase II and/or RNase R) affect the physiology and virulence of several human pathogens. In this review, we compare the structural and biochemical characteristics of the members of the RNase II/RNB family of enzymes. The outcomes of mutations impacting enzymatic function are revisited, in terms of both the direct and indirect effects on disease. Furthermore, we also describe the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral exoribonuclease and its importance to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

We obtained most of the data from the Ministry of Public Health. Deterministic system dynamics and compartmental models were utilized. The reproduction number (R) between Thais and migrants was estimated at 1.25 and 2.5, respectively. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) to prevent infection was assumed at 50%.

Different policy scenarios were analyzed. The migrant-centric vaccination policy scenario received the lowest incremental cost per one case or one death averted compared with the other scenarios. The Thai-centric policy scenario yielded an incremental cost of 27,191 Baht per one life saved, while the migrant-centric policy scenario produced a comparable incremental cost of 3782 Baht. Sensitivity analysis also demonstrated that the migrant-centric scenario presented the most cost-effective outcome even when VE diminished to 20%.

A non-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCCMS)-based metabolomics analysis was used to identify metabolic changes associated with NAFLD in humans upon exercise intervention (without diet change) across four different sample typesadipose tissue (AT), plasma, urine, and stool. Altogether, 46 subjects with NAFLD participated in this randomized controlled intervention study. The intervention group (n = 21) performed high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for 12 weeks while the control group (n = 25) kept their sedentary lifestyle. The participants' clinical parameters and metabolic profiles were compared between baseline and endpoint. HIIT significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose concentration (p = 0.027) and waist circumference (p = 0.028); and increased maximum oxygen consumption rate and maximum achieved workload (p < 0.001). HIIT resulted in sample-type-specific metabolite changes, including accumulation of amino acids and their derivatives in AT and plasma, while decreasing in urine and stool. Moreover, many of the metabolite level changes especially in the AT were correlated with the clinical parameters monitored during the intervention. In addition, certain lipids increased in plasma and decreased in the stool. Glyco-conjugated bile acids decreased in AT and urine. The 12-week HIIT exercise intervention has beneficial ameliorating effects in NAFLD subjects on a whole-body level, even without dietary changes and weight loss. The metabolomics analysis applied to the four different sample matrices provided an overall view on several metabolic pathways that had tissue-type specific changes after HIIT intervention in subjects with NAFLD. The results highlight especially the role of AT in responding to the HIIT challenge, and suggest that altered amino acid metabolism in AT might play a critical role in e.g. improving fasting plasma glucose concentration.

Early infarct volumes were analyzed in monoenergetic images (MonoIm) and wMDIm at 60 keV and compared with the fiV in SECT 4.9 days ( 4) after thrombectomy. Association between infarct volume and functional outcome was tested by linear regression analysis. RESULTS wMDIm shows a prior visible infarct demarcation (60.7 ml,  74.9 ml) compared with the MonoIm (37.57 ml,  76.7 ml). Linear regression analysis, Bland-Altman plots and Pearson correlation coefficients show a close correlation of infarct volume in wMDIm to the fiV in SECT (r = 0.86; 95% CI 0.76-0.92), compared with MonoIm and SECT (r = 0.81; 95% CI 0.69-0.89). The agreement with SECT is substantially higher in patients with infarct volumes < 70 ml (n = 33; 66%). Coefficients were smaller with r = 0.59 (95% CI 0.31; 0.78) for MonoIm and SECT compared with r = 0.77 (95% CI 0.57; 0.88) for wMDIm and SECT.

Although some argue that the media have exaggerated the threat, the warnings of an impending pandemic are not without foundation given the history of past influenza pandemics [7], incidence of H5N1 infections among humans [8], and the potential impact of a pandemic. Reports of the 1918 pandemic vary, but most suggested that approximately one third of the worlds population was infected with 50 to 100 million deaths [9]. Computer modeling of a moderate pandemic, less severe then in 1918, in the province of Ontario, Canada predicts 73,252 admissions of influenza patients to hospitals over a 6-week period utilizing 72% of the hospital capacity, 171% of intensive care unit (ICU) capacity, and 118% of current ventilator capacity. Pandemic modeling by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society also showed that critical care resources would be overwhelmed by even a moderate pandemic [10].

While infection numbers are monitored and measures adjusted, a systematic strategy for balancing contact restrictions and socioeconomic life in the absence of a vaccine is currently lacking. METHODS: In a mathematical model, we determine the efficacy of regional containment strategies, where contact restrictions are triggered locally in individual regions upon crossing critical infection number thresholds. Our stochastic meta-population model distinguishes between contacts within a region and cross-regional contacts. We use current data on the spread of COVID-19 in Germany, Italy, England, New York State and Florida, including the effects of their individual national lockdowns, and county population sizes obtained from census data to define individual regions. As a performance measure, we determine the number of days citizens will experience contact restrictions over the next 5 years (restriction time) and compare it to an equivalent national lockdown strategy. To extract crucial parameters, we vary the proportion of cross-regional contacts (between 0% and 100%), the thresholds for initiating local measures (between 5 and 20 active infections per 100,000 inhabitants) as well as their duration after infection numbers have returned below the threshold (between 7 and 28 days). We compare performance across the five different countries and test how further subdivision of large counties into independently controlled regions of up to 100,000 or 200,000 inhabitants affects the results. FINDINGS: Our numerical simulations show a substantially reduced restriction time for regional containment, if the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 without restrictions, R(0), is only slightly larger than 1 and the proportion of cross-regional contacts (the so-called leakiness) is low. In Germany, specifically, for R(0)=1.14, a leakiness of 1% is sufficiently low to reduce the mean restriction time from 468 days (s.d. 3 days) for the national containment strategy to 43 days (s.d. 3 days across simulations) for the regional strategy, when local measures are initiated at 10 infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the past 7 days. For R(0)=1.28, the allowed leakiness for minimal restriction time reduces to approximately 0.3%. The dependence of the restriction time on the leakiness is threshold-like only for regional containment, due to cooperative effects. It rises to levels similar to the national containment strategy for a leakiness > 10% (517 days national vs. 486 days regional for leakiness 32% and R(0)=1.14). We find a strong correlation between the population size of each region and the experienced restriction time. For countries with large counties, this can result in only a mild reduction in restriction time for regional containment, which can only be partly compensated by lower thresholds for initiating local measures and increasing their duration. In contrast, further subdividing large counties into smaller units can ensure a strong reduction of the restriction time for the regional strategy. INTERPRETATION: The leakiness, i.e. the proportion of cross-regional contacts, and the regional structure itself were crucial parameters for the performance of the regional strategy. Therefore, regional strategies could offer an adaptive way to contain the epidemic with fewer overall restrictions, if cross-regional infections can be kept below the critical level, which could be achieved without affecting local socioeconomic freedom. Maintaining general hygiene and contact tracing, testing should be intensified to ensure regional measures can be initiated at low infection thresholds, preventing the spread of the disease to other regions before local elimination. While such tight control could lead to more restrictions in the short run, restrictions necessary for long-term containment could be reduced by up to a factor of 10. Our open-source simulation code is freely available and can be readily adapted to other countries.

However, there is little known about the psychological mechanisms that give rise to beliefs such as certainty of being infected by COVID-19, and this was investigated in the present study. Objective: Using the same data from the previous online survey with the same research team, we further investigated whether certainty of being infected by COVID-19 is associated with age, sex, health anxiety, and/or personality traits. Methods: Respondents (N = 375) filled out an online survey with 57 questions about symptoms similar to COVID-19, certainty of being infected by COVID-19, anxiety, stress, health anxiety, and personality dimensions (based on the five-factor model of personality). Results: Higher levels of conscientiousness and health anxiety were independently associated with certainty of being infected by COVID-19. The model predicted 29% of the variance in certainty of being infected by COVID-19. Conclusion: Being conscientious and worried about health issues were associated with the belief of being infected by COVID-19. Such finding may have implications for health care personnel who provide COVID-19 testing or consulting services to general population, as individuals high in these traits may over-report COVID-like symptoms. Theoretically, these findings point to psychological factors that may increase nocebo and possibly placebo effects.

METHODS: The primary objective of this research study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a graded exercise protocol and biweekly monitoring on increasing the duration of aerobic exercise to 150 min per week in a population of elderly individuals with chronic disease. Secondarily, we evaluated for improvement in resting heart rate, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and cardiorespiratory fitness. The overall study design was a randomized, prospective cohort study with assessor blinding. Forty-five patients aged 60 years with multiple comorbidities were recruited from the Internal Medicine Clinic at Wright-Patterson AFB. Participants were randomized into a treatment or control arm and observed over a period of 34 weeks. Those in the treatment arm were given a graded walking protocol and received biweekly phone calls to evaluate compliance. Those in the control arm did not receive an intervention or biweekly monitoring. Measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, and BMI were taken quarterly in both groups. At the beginning and conclusion of the study, each participant completed a modified Balke treadmill test and Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). Continuous variables were evaluated with the independent samples t-test, whereas categorical variables were evaluated with the chi-squared test.

RESULTS Totally 9,760 ARI cases (9760/22680, 43.03%) were detected as positive for the 7 common respiratory viruses. The most detected virus was Flu (14.15%), followed by RSV (10.33%) and PIV (5.43%). Flu-A, PIV3 and HCoV-OC43 were the predominant subtypes. Although most of the viruses were more easily detected in inpatients and males, Flu was more likely detected in outpatient and females. Flu infection was more likely to cause URTI (upper respiratory tract infection), whereas RSV infection was more likely to cause pneumonia and bronchitis. The prevalence of Flu was particularly high in 2009.

DESIGN/METHOD: An online survey designed in collaboration with Joint Advisory Committee training committee and trainee representatives was distributed from January 2020 but was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and hence terminated early. RESULTS: There were 129 responses, including trainees from all disciplines and regions, of which 86/129 (66.7%) rated the culture in their endoscopy units favourablyeither good or excellent. 65/129 (50.4%) trainees reported having one or more training lists allocated per week, with 41/129 (31.8%) reporting only ad hoc lists. 100/129 (77.5%) respondents were given feedback and 97/129 (75.2%) were provided with learning points from the list. 65/129 (50.4%) respondents reported their trainer completed a direct observation of procedure or direct observation of polypectomies. 73/129 (56.6%) respondents reported that they felt able to give feedback to their trainer, with 88/129 (68.2%) feeling they could do this accurately. Barriers to trainer feedback cited included time constraints, lack of anonymity and concerns about affecting the trainerCtrainee relationship. CONCLUSION: Overall, the training environment has improved since previous surveys. There are still issues around interdisciplinary differences with some surgical trainees finding the training environment less welcoming, and trainee perceptions of hierarchical barriers and trainer responsiveness to feedback limiting the accuracy of their feedback.","output":"Endoscopy training in the UK pre-COVIDC19 environment: a multidisciplinary survey of endoscopy training and the experience of reciprocal feedback"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The second coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic wave in the UK progressed aggressively and was characterised by the emergence and circulation of variant of concern alpha (VOC 202012/01). The impact of this variant on in-hospital COVID-19-specific mortality has not been widely studied. We aimed to compare mortality, clinical characteristics, and management of COVID-19 patients across epidemic waves to better understand the progression of the epidemic at a hospital level and support resource planning. METHODS: We conducted an analytical, dynamic cohort study in a large hospital in South London. We included all adults ( 18 years) with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who required hospital admission to COVID-19-specific wards between January 2020 and March 2021 (n = 2701). Outcome was COVID-19-specific in-hospital mortality ascertained through Medical Certificate Cause of Death. RESULTS: In the second wave, the number of COVID-19 admissions doubled, and the crude mortality rate dropped 25% (1.66 versus 2.23 per 100 person-days in second and first wave, respectively). After accounting for age, sex, dexamethasone, oxygen requirements, symptoms at admission and Charlson Comorbidity Index, mortality hazard ratio associated with COVID-19 admissions was 1.62 (95% CI 1.26, 2.08) times higher in the second wave. CONCLUSIONS: Although crude mortality rates dropped during the second wave, the multivariable analysis suggests a higher underlying risk of death for COVID-19 admissions in the second wave. These findings are ecologically correlated with an increased circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/1 (alpha). Availability of improved management, particularly dexamethasone, was important in reducing risk of death.

They belong to at least five antigenic groups. CV cause localized infections of the respiratory and/or intestinal tracts, with the exception of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIVP) and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis (HEV) which cause systemic infections. The enteropathogenic CV infect the villous enterocytes resulting in villous atrophy leading to malabsorptive diarrhea. Several CV (bovine CV-BCV, porcine respiratory CV-PRCV, infectious bronchitis virus-IBV) cause respiratory disease. Current evidence indicates that protection against enteric and respiratory CV infections is mediated by passive or active immunity at the primary site of CV replication. Maternal vaccination approaches to induce passive immunity include the use of inactivated and modified live viral vaccines. Modified live viruses and a Ts mutant CV (FIPV) are also used as oral or intranasal vaccines to induce active mucosal immunity. The success of these vaccines in the field is often compromised by a number of potential problems. Coronaviruses are spherical, enveloped viruses, ranging from 80C160 nm in diameter and containing a positive-stranded RNA genome. They possess prominent surface spikes and some species display a fringe of smaller surface projections believed to be the hemagglutinin (HE). Coronaviruses possess 3 to 4 structural proteins: the spike (S) glycoprotein (150C200 kDa), the integral membrane glycoprotein (M; 20C30 kDa) and the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N; 43C50 kDa). A subset of CV (BCV, HEV, turkey CV) possess a third glycoprotein on the virion surface, the HE (60C65 kDa). These proteins can be quantitated using pooled monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to distinct epitopes of each protein in ELISA. Most research has focused on the S protein as a candidate antigen for CV vaccines since it induces virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies. However the HE protein stimulates the production of VN and HE inhibiting antibodies and the M protein induces antibodies that neutralize virus in the presence of complement. Attempts to correlate in vitro VN antibody activity with in vivo protection have shown that the passive transfer of VN mAb to the S or HE protein conferred passive protection against CV challenge in some studies, but not others. Additional research has implicated a possible role for other CV proteins in immunity. Studies of mAb to the M protein of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) have provided evidence for a direct role of the M protein in the induction of IFN by porcine blood leukocytes. The potential significance of this phenomenon to immunity to TGEV is unclear. Similarly, studies of IBV have suggested that determinants recognized by T cells reside on the N protein and these determinants may be shared among heterologous strains of IBV, resulting in the induction of cross-protection. Thus epitopes on the N protein may be important for induction of cell mediated immunity (CMI). CMI may play an important role in protection of cats against FIPV, since induction of circulating antibodies to the S protein of FIPV contributes to disease pathogenesis by the induction of immune complexes and antibody dependent enhancement of the infectivity of FIPV for macrophages. An increased understanding of antibody and CMI responses following natural CV infections in animals is needed to identify the antigens and epitopes that induce protective immune responses. The expression of CV structural protein genes in various vectors will provide the recombinant proteins needed for future immunogenicity studies in the host species. Furthermore, live rDNA vectors that replicate in the gut and express coronavirus genes may provide a new generation of coronavirus vaccines.","output":"Coronavirus immunogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose We aimed to describe the demographics, cancer subtypes, comorbidities and outcomes of patients with a history of cancer with COVID-19 from March to June 2020. Secondly, we compared patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and patients hospitalized with influenza. Methods We conducted a cohort study using eight routinely-collected healthcare databases from Spain and the US, standardized to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership common data model. Three cohorts of patients with a history of cancer were included: i) diagnosed with COVID-19, ii) hospitalized with COVID-19, and iii) hospitalized with influenza in 2017-2018. Patients were followed from index date to 30 days or death. We reported demographics, cancer subtypes, comorbidities, and 30-day outcomes. Results We included 118,155 patients with a cancer history in the COVID-19 diagnosed and 41,939 in the COVID-19 hospitalized cohorts. The most frequent cancer subtypes were prostate and breast cancer (range: 5-19% and 1-14% in the diagnosed cohort, respectively). Hematological malignancies were also frequent, with non-Hodgkin lymphoma being among the 5 most common cancer subtypes in the diagnosed cohort. Overall, patients were more frequently aged above 65 years and had multiple comorbidities. Occurrence of death ranged from 8% to 14% and from 18% to 26% in the diagnosed and hospitalized COVID-19 cohorts, respectively. Patients hospitalized with influenza (n=242,960) had a similar distribution of cancer subtypes, sex, age and comorbidities but lower occurrence of adverse events.

Establishing an early diagnosis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may have important therapeutic implications. METHODS: We describe diagnosis and management of M. pneumoniae pneumonia induced ARDS in a case series of adults and youth hospitalized with radiographically confirmed CAP prospectively enrolled in an observational cohort study in two university teaching hospitals, from November 2017 to October 2019. RESULTS: In all 10 patients, early and rapid diagnosis for severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia with ARDS was achieved with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) testing of samples from the lower respiratory tract or pleural effusion. The average PaO(2)/FiO(2) of all patients was 180 mmHg. Of the 10 cases, 4 cases had moderate ARDS (100 mmHg  PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 200 mmHg) and 3 cases had severe ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 100 mmHg). High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) was applied in all patients, though only two patients were sufficiently supported with HFNC. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was required in 5 patients. High resistance (median 15 L/cmH(2)O/s) and low compliance (median 38 ml/cmH(2)O) was observed in 4 cases. In these 4 cases, recruitment maneuvers (RM) were applied, with 1 patient demonstrating no response to RM. Prone positioning were applied in 4 cases. Two cases needed ECMO support with median support duration of 5.5 days. No patient in our case series received corticosteroid therapy. All patients were survived and were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Early and rapid diagnosis of severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia with ARDS can be achieved with PCR/mNGS tests in samples from the lower respiratory tract or pleural effusion. In our case series, half of M. pneumoniae pneumonia induced ARDS cases were adequately supported with HFNC or NIV, while half of cases required intubation. RM and prone position were effective in 30% of intubated cases, and 20% needed ECMO support.

A study of the effects of these interventions can help shape public health decisions. The efficacy of nonpharmaceutical interventions can be affected by public behaviors in events, such as protests. We examined mask use and mask fit in the United States, from social media images, especially during the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests, representing the first large-scale public gatherings in the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the use and fit of face masks and social distancing in the United States and events of large physical gatherings through public social media images from 6 cities and BLM protests. METHODS: We collected and analyzed 2.04 million public social media images from New York City, Dallas, Seattle, New Orleans, Boston, and Minneapolis between February 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020. We evaluated correlations between online mask usage trends and COVID-19 cases. We looked for significant changes in mask use patterns and group posting around important policy decisions. For BLM protests, we analyzed 195,452 posts from New York and Minneapolis from May 25, 2020, to July 15, 2020. We looked at differences in adopting the preventive measures in the BLM protests through the mask fit score. RESULTS: The average percentage of group pictures dropped from 8.05% to 4.65% after the lockdown week. New York City, Dallas, Seattle, New Orleans, Boston, and Minneapolis observed increases of 5.0%, 7.4%, 7.4%, 6.5%, 5.6%, and 7.1%, respectively, in mask use between February 2020 and May 2020. Boston and Minneapolis observed significant increases of 3.0% and 7.4%, respectively, in mask use after the mask mandates. Differences of 6.2% and 8.3% were found in group pictures between BLM posts and non-BLM posts for New York City and Minneapolis, respectively. In contrast, the differences in the percentage of masked faces in group pictures between BLM and non-BLM posts were 29.0% and 20.1% for New York City and Minneapolis, respectively. Across protests, 35% of individuals wore a mask with a fit score greater than 80%. CONCLUSIONS: The study found a significant drop in group posting when the stay-at-home laws were applied and a significant increase in mask use for 2 of 3 cities where masks were mandated. Although a positive trend toward mask use and social distancing was observed, a high percentage of posts showed disregard for the guidelines. BLM-related posts captured the lack of seriousness to safety measures, with a high percentage of group pictures and low mask fit scores. Thus, the methodology provides a directional indication of how government policies can be indirectly monitored through social media.","output":"COVID-19 Mask Usage and Social Distancing in Social Media Images: Large-scale Deep Learning Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory at Public Health England, Porton Down, was tasked by the Department of Health and Social Care with setting up a national surveillance laboratory facility to study SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses and population-level sero-surveillance in response to the growing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

METHODS: In this descriptive study, we conducted contact tracing, quarantine, and mass testing of the potentially exposed contacts with the index case. Epidemiological investigation and phylogeographic analysis were performed. FINDINGS: Among 11,818 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 diagnosed till 13(th) May 2021 in Hong Kong, SARS-CoV-2 VOCs were found in 271 (2.3%) cases. Except for 10 locally acquired secondary cases, all SARS-CoV-2 VOCs were imported or acquired in quarantine hotels. The index case of this SARS-CoV-2 VOC B.1.351 epidemic, an inbound traveler with asymptomatic infection, was diagnosed 9 days after completing 21 days of quarantine. Contact tracing of 163 contacts in household, hotel, and residential building only revealed 1 (0.6%) secondary case. A symptomatic foreign domestic helper (FDH) without apparent epidemiological link but infected by virus with identical genome sequence was subsequently confirmed. Mass testing of 0.34 million FDHs identified two more cases which were phylogenetically linked. A total of 10 secondary cases were identified that were related to two household gatherings.

For the identification of the spatial risk clusters, the Kernel density estimator and the Getis-Ord Gi* technique were performed. Generalized additive models were used to verify the association between areas with social vulnerability and the occurrence of childhood pneumonia. RESULTS: The study included 265 children under the age of five, hospitalized due to community-acquired pneumonia. A concentration of cases was identified in the regions with greater social vulnerability (low income, poor housing conditions and homelessness), as well as a lower occurrence of cases in the most developed and economically privileged area of the city. The majority of the children lived in territories served by traditional primary healthcare units, in which the health surveillance and family and community focus are limited. It is important to highlight that the tracts with the highest degrees of vulnerability, such as those identified as high vulnerability (urban) and very high vulnerability (subnormal urban clusters). CONCLUSIONS: The results contribute to the comprehension of the social factors involved in child hospitalization due to pneumonia, based on the analysis of the spatial distribution. This approach revealed a strategic tool for diagnosing the disparities as well presenting evidences for the planning in health and strength health care system in achieving equity, welfare and social protection of children.

Following the shelter\\\\in\\\\place orders in March 2020, we implemented Tele(oral)medicine practices for the diagnosis and management of some oral medicine conditions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the role of telemedicine visits with respect to managing pain among patients affected by oral diseases. METHODS: A retrospective chart review for all the new patients seen at their first visit via telemedicine between April 2020 and December 2020. The patient-reported pain score was recorded at each visit using a 0C10 scale. Differences in oral pain from the first fist to the follow-up visit of the patients were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: A total of 137 new patients were included with a median age of 56 years. If seen in person, patients would have travelled a median distance of 65 miles. The most common oral conditions seen were reactive/inflammatory lesions. There was a 3-point median pain reduction from the first video visit to the first follow-up (p < 0.05) and a self-reported 65% median improvement of oral symptoms. CONCLUSION: Tele(oral)medicine was an effective method for symptoms management of oral medicine conditions.","output":"The role of telemedicine for symptoms management in oral medicine: a retrospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory diseases caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have caused infections around the world, and this disease has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 has severely impacted the world economy, and as it has multiple unnoticeable transmission routes, it can derail the health care system for a long time. Most states in India are affected by the COVID pandemic. As India is known for its seasonal infections such as dengue, leptospirosis, influenza, malaria, and enteric fever, it is expected that these infections may co-exist. Coinfection of these two viral infections causes challenges in diagnosis and treatment, especially in places with limited resources. Antibody-mediated enhancement of the immune response is a cause for concern in co-infection of COVID-19 and dengue.

Meanwhile, user-generated content is critical in P2P accommodations, because they contain a wealth of information about the opinions and experiences of users, which helps understand consumer decisions and improve products and services better. However, the huge volume of reviews makes it difficult for potential customers to gain useful insights and for managers to track customer opinions. In this paper, we propose a complete pipeline for recommending personalized accommodations for consumers, while also providing insights for managers. First, we use topic modeling techniques to mining opinions from review. Second, we build a deep learning network for review sentiment analysis. Third, we perform sentiment analysis of the reviews at the aspect level to obtain the sentiment vector representation of the accommodation. Finally, we propose a personalized accommodation recommendation method based on the above work. Moreover, we design a visual analytic system with a user-friendly interface to facilitate interactive analysis. Evaluation including user and case studies demonstrates the usefulness and effectiveness of our method and system.

The downstaging subgroups include 1 lesion >5 and 8 cm (n = 43), 2 or 3 lesions at least one >3 and 5 cm with total tumor diameter 8 cm (n = 61), or 4-5 lesions each 3 cm with total tumor diameter 8 cm (n = 14). In the downstaging group, 64 patients (54.2%) had received LT and 5 (7.5%) developed HCC recurrence. Two of the five patients with HCC recurrence had 4-5 tumors at presentation. The 1- and 2-year cumulative probabilities for dropout (competing risk) were 24.1% and 34.2% in the downstaging group versus 20.3% and 25.6% in the T2 group (P = 0.04). Kaplan-Meier's 5-year post-transplant survival and recurrence-free probabilities were 77.8% and 90.8%, respectively, in the downstaging group versus 81% and 88%, respectively, in the T2 group (P = 0.69 and P = 0.66, respectively).

We included the period of March 5 to April 17, 2021, as the period affected by the Friday lockdown, which was applied to seven consecutive Fridays with a total of 168 hours. We used R version 4.0.5 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) for our analysis. We used Poisson model regression analysis, where the number of positive cases was used as the outcome variable, while the total number of tests, time, and lockdown were used as the predictor variables.

One such therapeutic strategy may be cognitive training (CT), which involves the repetition of standardized tasks with the aim of improving specific aspects of cognition. Several studies have examined the effects of CT in individuals with PD and have shown benefits in a variety of cognitive domains, but the widespread use of CT in these individuals may be limited by motor impairments and other concerns in study design.

The lack of an in-person interview experience, the inability to conduct department visits, and the limitations imposed on pursuing away rotations have restricted applicants. This change has placed more emphasis on the online presence of residency programs and exposed several deficits pertaining to virtual content available to applicants. Many residency program websites are inadequate and unable to meet these new demands. The purpose of this study was to collect and organize potential areas for improvementas proposed by studentsregarding the available website information put forth by interventional radiology residency programs. Materials and Methods: Medical students were invited to attend a virtual webinar with multiple residency program directors to discuss the application process. After the webinar discussion, attendees were asked to submit topics and information they deemed to be important when applying to residency programs. These submissions were then organized according to certain themes and quantified. Results: Seventy-eight submitted responses to the following question: When visiting an IR/DR Programs website, what important pieces of information are you looking for? Many responses consisted of multiple components and thus are encompassed within several themes. The major themes and their corresponding response percentages are as follows: advice regarding application (21%), case types and volume (14%), advice regarding rotations (13%), Step exam averages (9%), curriculum schedule (8%), unique traits and program diversity (8%), insights from current residents (6%), and research opportunities (6%). Other minor themes include mentorship opportunities, resident support services, video profiles of faculty, and patient population demographics. Conclusions: Analysis of these responses revealed certain consistent topics of information that are considered by students when applying to the NRMP. These can be potential objectives for residency programs to pursue in order to optimize their appeal to applicants. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly restructured medical education and the residency application process.

Chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-dependent monocyte trafficking plays an essential role in the establishment of CD8 TRMs in lungs of IAV-infected mice. Here, we used a combination adjuvant-based subunit vaccine strategy that evokes multifaceted (TC1/TC17/TH1/TH17) IAV nucleoprotein-specific lung TRMs, to determine whether CCR2 and monocyte infiltration are essential for vaccine-induced TRM development and protective immunity to IAV in lungs. Following intranasal vaccination, neutrophils, monocytes, conventional DCs and monocyte-derived dendritic cells internalized and processed vaccine antigen in lungs. We found that Basic Leucine Zipper ATF-Like Transcription Factor 3 (BATF-3)-dependent DCs were essential for eliciting T cell responses, but CCR2 deficiency enhanced the differentiation of CD127HI/KLRG-1LO, OX40+veCD62L+ve and mucosally imprinted CD69+veCD103+ve effector and memory CD8 T cells in lungs and airways of vaccinated mice. Mechanistically, increased development of lung TRMs, induced by CCR2 deficiency was linked to dampened expression of T-bet, but not altered TCF-1 levels or T cell receptor signaling in CD8 T cells. T1/T17 functional programming, parenchymal localization of CD8/CD4 effector and memory T cells, recall T cell responses and protective immunity to a lethal IAV infection were unaffected in CCR2-deficient mice. Taken together, we identified a negative regulatory role for CCR2 and monocyte trafficking in mucosal imprinting and differentiation of vaccine-induced TRMs. Mechanistic insights from this study may aid the development of T-cell-based vaccines against respiratory viral pathogens including IAV and SARS-CoV-2.ImportanceWhile antibody-based immunity to influenza A virus (IAV) is type and sub-type specific, lung and airway-resident memory T cells that recognize conserved epitopes in the internal viral proteins are known to provide heterosubtypic immunity. Hence, broadly protective IAV vaccines need to elicit robust T-cell memory in the respiratory tract. We have developed a combination adjuvant-based IAV nucleoprotein vaccine that elicits strong CD4 and CD8 T cell memory in lungs and protects against H1N1 and H5N1 strains of IAV. In this study, we examined the mechanisms that control vaccine-induced protective memory T cells in the respiratory tract. We found that trafficking of monocytes into lungs might limit the development of anti-viral lung-resident memory T cells, following intranasal vaccination. These findings suggested that strategies that limit monocyte infiltration can potentiate vaccine-induced frontline T-cell immunity to respiratory viruses, such as IAV and SARS-CoV-2.","output":"CCR2 Regulates Vaccine-Induced Mucosal T-Cell Memory to Influenza A Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aquatic macroinvertebrates (AMI) play an important role in the ecology of wetlands, either by their job as regulators of the cycles of matter, as for their energy storage function represented in their biomass, which is transferred to higher trophic levels. To answer the question of how biomass of different AMI trophic guilds is related with physicochemical variables in the wetland Jaboque (Bogot, Colombia), four samplings were achieved between April 2009 and January 2010, according to periods of rain and drought in the region. The AMI biomass values obtained were rated as of intermediate rank. No temporal but spatial significant differences were found. Apparently these spatial differences appear to be associated with variations in anthropogenic pressure, which differs in each area of the wetland. In dry months (January and August), biomass was greater and dominated by detritivores. We observed a positive relationship between the specific conductance of water and the biomass of predators and detritivores and between water temperature and the biomass of detritivores and shredders. These relationships suggest that the physical and chemical variables influence the distribution, abundance, and biomass of functional groups.

Improvements in app security and IT infrastructure mean that high-quality anterior segment photographs can be routinely collected with smartphones alone. The lid oncology team relied on pre-operative formal slit-lamp imaging in the one-stop biopsy clinic, a lengthy process with capacity limitations, that risked delays to care. METHODS: A Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) photography service was developed through a series of iterations and collaborations. Healthcare Assistants took photographs on iPhone SE with Quikvue lens attachments in Pando app. Lesions requiring a slit lamp were photographed by the doctor. Images were uploaded to the patient record twice weekly. The service was evaluated using timeCmotion studies, imaging quality and utility grading, and patient feedback. RESULTS: BYOD photography saved lid oncology patients 41 min (one-third of total appointment time) and reduced delays to treatment to zero. A patient survey reflected the acceptability of the service, with 100% feeling photography was important at every visit. In terms of utility, 97.5% of smartphone images were suitable for monitoring lesions and making management decisions. The management plan based on the smartphone photographs was consistent with the management plan formulated face-to-face in clinic in 92.5% images. CONCLUSION: BYOD photography has replaced formal slit-lamp imaging in the lid oncology service.

It has been reported that Indonesia's coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) mortality rate is the second-highest among Southeast Asian Nations, which may be associated with several health determinants, including biochemical factors and health comorbidity [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7].

No sooner had humanity recovered from its consequences than a new attack camethe COVID-19 pandemic. What happens to other respiratory infectious diseases during a global disaster such as the COVID-19 pandemic? The pandemic brought about by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has disrupted many well-established epidemiological and pathogenetic relationships, as well as mechanisms affecting infections with other respiratory viruses. The level of circulation of many respiratory pathogens has changed significantly. For instance, global influenza activity is at much lower levels than expected. In many regions, the influenza season has not started. Intriguingly, the COVID-19 pandemic did not substantially affect the spread of human rhinoviruses. In this review, the main properties of epidemiologically significant respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, and human rhinovirus are described. ABSTRACT: It is well known that rhinoviruses are distributed across the globe and are the most common cause of the common cold in all age groups. Rhinoviruses are widely considered to be harmless because they are generally perceived as respiratory viruses only capable of causing mild disease. However, they may also infect the lower respiratory tract, inducing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and exacerbations of asthma, bronchiolitis, etc. The role of rhinoviruses in pathogenesis and the epidemiological process is underestimated, and they need to be intensively studied. In the light of recent data, it is now known that rhinoviruses could be one of the key epidemiological barriers that may influence the spread of influenza and novel coronaviruses. It has been reported that endemic human rhinoviruses delayed the development of the H1N1pdm09 influenza pandemic through viral interference. Moreover, human rhinoviruses have been suggested to block SARS-CoV-2 replication in the airways by triggering an interferon response. In this review, we summarized the main biological characteristics of genetically distinct viruses such as rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 in an attempt to illuminate their main discrepancies and similarities. We hope that this comparative analysis will help us to better understand in which direction research in this area should move.","output":"COVID-19 Shuts Doors to Flu but Keeps Them Open to Rhinoviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Soon after the outbreak of the pandemic, uncontrolled hypertension was recognized as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 while concerns were raised that RAAS-i may increase the susceptibility and the severity of disease. The study aims to assess patients' perception on risks associated with hypertension. Design and method: Hypertension patients visiting the emergency (non-COVID) department or the outpatient clinics of a tertiary hospital in Northern Greece were invited to participate by completing a short questionnaire. This observational study was conducted during the first and the much more forceful ongoing second wave. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were used to measure the frequency and severity of depression and anxiety. Results: 373 hypertensive patients (205 women, 55.0%) participated (mean age 63.69.4 years), with 341 (91.4%) taking RAAS-i. About half (191, 51.2%) were taking RAAS-i for hypertension, while the rest for other indications. The vast majority (364, 97.6%) were alert that hypertension was a risk factor for COVID-19, although only 1 in 8 were informed that it mainly implied uncontrolled/untreated hypertension. Most of the patients (347, 93.0%) had heard that antihypertensive drugs might be harmful (mainly from TV reports), though only 199 (58.4%) of the patients taking RAAS-i knew they were taking such drugs. Moreover, 176 patients (47.2%), mostly during second wave, conducted their doctor and eventually 17 altered therapy. Participants during second wave reported higher chances of getting COVID-19, with the majority believing they are more susceptible and expecting more severe disease. The mean Beck's anxiety and depression score was 10.7  7.1 and 12.2  9.3 respectively, with the prevalence of significant anxiety (BAI&gt;=10) or depression (BDI&gt;=17) reaching 11% (41 patients) and 6.2% (23 patients), with as expected, higher scores for second wave patients. Disturbingly, only 20 patients (5.4%) had been informed of the position of major scientific. Conclusions: Greek patients are concerned of hypertension association with COVID-19 although not properly informed that it implies mainly uncontrolled/ untreated hypertension. Hypertensive patients seem worried about the pandemic which is mirrored into anxiety and depression scores.

One of the most important measures in this regard is social distancing. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of social distancing on COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Thus, the current study aimed to assess the effectiveness of social distancing measures on the COVID-19 incidence and mortality in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the current quasi-experimental study, we evaluated the daily incidence cases and the number of deaths of COVID-19 in Iran before and after the implementation of social distancing measures. The segmented regression model was used to analyze the data. We also performed the interrupted time series (ITS) analysis using Newey ordinary least squares (OLS) regression-based methods. RESULTS: After the implementation of social distancing, the trend of both daily new cases and deaths due to COVID-19 was decreasing [(? = ?1.70 (95% CI = [?2.30 C ?1.10; P < 0.001])) and (? = ?0.07 (95% CI = [?0.10 ? ?0.05; P < 0.001], respectively))].

METHODS The present study analyzed 183 cases of small bowel capsule endoscope (SBCE) insertion performed using the AdvanCE in 154 patients aged less than 18 years at participating institutions between 2013 and 2017. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify factors contributing to the completion rate for the entire small intestine examination, small intestine transit time, adverse events and technical issues. RESULTS The commonest reason for using the AdvanCE was the patient's inability to swallow the SBCE, which was attributed to young age. SBCE was successfully delivered into the stomach or duodenum in 180 cases and was placed in the duodenum in 90% patients. In 89% patients, the entire small intestine was completely examined, and in 63% patients, findings leading to a new diagnosis or involving changing or maintaining the treatment strategy were obtained. No severe adverse events were observed; however, mild adverse events were observed in 35% patients. No factors considerably contributed to the completion rate for the entire small intestine examination or small intestine transit time and onset of technical issues. The factors that contributed to mild adverse events included intravenous anesthesia, technical issue, and absence of prior insertion of a patency capsule using the AdvanCE.

During the past few years, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods have been developed for many pathogens causing respiratory tract infections. The aim of this study was to determine the etiology of CAP among adultsespecially the occurrence of mixed infections among patients with CAPby implementing a new diagnostic PCR platform combined with conventional methods. METHODS: Adults admitted to Karolinska University Hospital were studied prospectively during a 12-month period. Microbiological testing methods included culture from blood, sputum, and nasopharyngeal secretion samples; sputum samples analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis; nasopharyngeal specimens analyzed by use of PCR; serological testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and viruses common in the respiratory tract; and urine antigen assays for detection of pneumococcal and Legionella pneumophila antigens. RESULTS: A microbial etiology could be identified for 67% of the patients (n = 124). For patients with complete sampling, a microbiological agent was identified for 89% of the cases. The most frequently detected pathogens were S. pneumoniae (70 patients [38]) and respiratory virus (53 patients [29]).

The first macrodomain, Mac1, is conserved throughout CoVs, and binds to and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) from target proteins. Mac1 likely counters host-mediated anti-viral ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that is part of the host response to viral infections. Mac1 is essential for pathogenesis in multiple animal models of CoV infection, implicating it as a virulence factor and potential therapeutic target. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 exhibit similar structural folds and all 3 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with low M affinities. Importantly, using ADP-ribose detecting binding reagents in both a gel-based assay and novel ELISA assays, we demonstrated de-MARylating activity for all 3 CoV Mac1 proteins, with the SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 protein leading to a more rapid loss of substrate compared to the others. In addition, none of these enzymes could hydrolyze poly-ADP-ribose. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV Mac1 proteins are MAR-hydrolases with similar functions, indicating that compounds targeting CoV Mac1 proteins may have broad anti-CoV activity. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged into the human population and has led to a worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 that has caused greater than 900 thousand deaths worldwide. With, no currently approved treatments, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. All coronaviruses encode for a highly conserved macrodomain (Mac1) that binds to and removes ADP-ribose adducts from proteins in a dynamic post-translational process increasingly recognized as an important factor that regulates viral infection. The macrodomain is essential for CoV pathogenesis and may be a novel therapeutic target. Thus, understanding its biochemistry and enzyme activity are critical first steps for these efforts. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose, and describe its ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis activities in direct comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins. These results are an important first step for the design and testing of potential therapies targeting this unique protein domain.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 conserved macrodomain is a mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Declaration de liens d'interets: Les auteurs declarent ne pas avoir de liens d'interets Copyright ? 2020","output":"Facteurs associes a la survenue d'une embolie pulmonaire au cours du COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The bacterial vaginosis syndrome has significant adverse effects for women and babies, including preterm birth and increased risk of acquisition of sexually transmitted infections and HIV.

We then measured the in vivo frequencies of select resistance mutations in intact sputum samples with resistance-targeted deep amplicon sequencing (RETRA-Seq), which revealed that rare resistance mutations not detected by clinically used culture-based methods can increase by nearly 40-fold over 5C12 days in response to antibiotic changes. Conversely, mutations conferring resistance to antibiotics not administered diminish and even go to extinction. Our results underscore how therapy choice shapes the dynamics of low-frequency resistance mutations at short time scales, and the findings provide a possibility for driving resistance mutations to extinction during early stages of infection by designing patient-specific antibiotic cycling strategies informed by deep genomic surveillance.","output":"Rapid expansion and extinction of antibiotic resistance mutations during treatment of acute bacterial respiratory infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dwindling Economy is otherwise known as depression economy or economy depression interchangeably and/or recess economy.

That has conjointly led to the decline in the GDP growth per capital of a country;which forces degradation in the performances of economic sectors, retrenchment of staff and wrapping-up of industries. It is a lot worse than a recession, with GDP falling significantly, and lasts for periods of time. Pen ultimately, Nigeria has been in deteriorating financial state for years;her economy in the last few years has been going through some turbulence.

METHODS: The study was based on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 10 Israeli MWPWS who regularly visit various prostitution venues. The interviews were conducted between April and July 2020, between the first and the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Israel. RESULTS: The findings focus on four major aspects of the participants experiences: the participants inability to pay for sex, the difficulties imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic to participants sex-for-pay experiences, the positive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their sex-for-pay experiences, and the insignificance of COVID-19 pandemic to their sex-for-pay experiences. CONCLUSIONS: I conclude that COVID-19 pandemic triggers various sexual, emotional, and gendered experiences for MWPWS. Accordingly, MWPWS may reevaluate their engagement in sex-for-pay, and their experiences of it may be reshaped in light of the pandemic. I discuss the findings contribution to sexuality and masculinity studies, and the methodological possibilities that they raise for qualitative scholars studying social phenomena during the COVID-19 pandemic. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: The study highlights the significance of developing ad hoc prostitution policy that supports the individuals involved in the sex industryboth MWPWS and the women who are paid for sexduring the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, it suggests that prostitution policy should address the diverse experiences of MWPWS, beyond viewing them as merely offenders who should be punished, or re-educated.","output":"Paying for Sex During COVID-19 Pandemic: The Experiences of Israeli Men"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

We examine this information alongside the data provided by Education for Nature Vietnam in a recent report on macaque possession cases. We also present insights from two key Animals Asia (a non-governmental organization) colleagues who work on the front lines of the macaque issue in Vietnam. ABSTRACT: In this article, we attempt to characterize the widespread trade in pet macaques in Vietnam. Data on confiscations as well as surrenders, releases, and individuals housed at rescue centers across Vietnam for 2015C2019 were opportunistically recorded. Data comparisons between Education for Nature Vietnam and three government-run wildlife rescue centers show that at least 1254 cases of macaque keeping occurred during the study period, including a minimum of 32 Assamese macaques (Macaca assamensis), 158 long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis), 291 Northern pig-tailed macaques (Macaca leonina), 65 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), and 110 stump-tailed macaques (Macaca arctoides). A minimum of 423 individuals were confiscated, and at least 490 individual macaques were released. Three semi-structured interviews were conducted with two key Animals Asia (a non-governmental organization) colleagues and their insights are presented. Although we recognize that the data included are limited and can serve only as a baseline for the scale of the macaque pet trade in Vietnam, we believe that they support our concern that the problem is significant and must be addressed.

We aim to determine the urologists functional urology practice during the pandemic by an online questionnaire. METHODS: An online questionnaire was conducted to assess the functional urology practice of Turkish urologists during the pandemic. The workplace, positioning as a pandemic hospital, involvement in pandemic clinics, and the relevance to functional urology were questioned. We also inquired about outpatient services, diagnostic tests, and elective surgeries during the pandemic compared with their routine practice. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-two participants completed the questionnaire. Of these, 32.2% replied that more than half of their daily practice was related to diagnosing and treating incontinence, prolapse, and neurourology. According to 123 participants (80.9%), there was a decrease in outpatient clinics. Diagnostic tests were also reduced, such as uroflowmetry (68.4%) and urodynamics (81.3%). The majority of respondents declared a decrease in elective surgeries as Botox injection (92.1%), surgery for urinary incontinence (93.4%), and surgery for prolapse (85%). Nearly one-quarter of respondents (28.9%) stated that their diagnostic methods for neurourology patients did not differ.

Cohort 1 was assayed in a 320-analyte Luminex library. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric and parametric methods (Kruskal-Wallis, principal component analysis, partial least squares and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and univariate ANCOVAs). Bioinformatic analysis was conducted and identified connections to the amyloid pathway. Statistically significant biomarkers identified in Cohort 1 were then re-evaluated in Cohort 2 using individual ELISA and multiplexing. Of 320 analytes in Cohort 1, 273 were rendered measurable, of which 56 were identified as changing. Among these markers, 40 were identified in univariate ANCOVAs. Serum amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) was analyzed by a separate ELISA and included in further analyses. The 40 biomarkers, sAPP and amyloid-? (A?)

Sirtuin6 (SIRT6) and Krppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) have been reported to regulate the inflammatory response and play an important role in the development of periodontitis. LPS was adopted to induce periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) to construct a periodontitis cell model. SIRT6 expression was assayed through RT-qPCR and Western blot. Subsequently, after SIRT6 was overexpressed, CCK8 was to appraise cell viability. ELISA analysis was used to estimate inflammatory response. ALP staining, ARS staining, and Western blot were used to detect osteogenic differentiation. The JASPAR website then predicts the binding of transcription factor KLF5 to SIRT6 promoter. The interaction between KLF5 and SIRT6 was verified by a luciferase reporter and ChIP assays. Additionally, the osteogenic differentiation and inflammation in LPS-induced PDLSCs transfected with Ov-SIRT6 and si-KIF5 were also explored. Finally, the protein levels of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-B) pathway-related factors were detected by Western blot to further explore the mechanism. There was a marked decrease in SIRT6 expression in LPS-induced PDLSCs. SITR6 overexpression prevented LPS-induced cell viability loss and inflammation, while promoting osteogenic differentiation. In addition, KLF5 could transcriptionally activate SIRT6. Further, KLF5 knockdown reversed the impacts of SIRT6 on the proliferation, inflammation, and osteogenic differentiation of LPS-induced PDLSCs via mediating NF-B pathway. Overall, KLF5-mediated SIRT6 promoted the viability and osteogenic differentiation, while inhibiting the inflammatory response of LPS-induced PDLSCs by inhibiting NF-B pathway.","output":"Krppel-like factor 5 -mediated Sirtuin6 promotes osteogenic differentiation and inhibits inflammatory injury of lipopolysaccharide-induced periodontal membrane stem cells by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa-B pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea However, digestive symptoms have also been reportedAt first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect more than half of patients The symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology unrelated to coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images suggestive of COVID-19 infection No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms Moreover, the endoscopists may themselves be at significant risk of contamination Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient's persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff Resumption of medico-surgical activity should be guided by dedicated strategy preceding deconfinement","output":"[What do surgeons need to know about the digestive disorders and paraclinical abnormalities induced by COVID-19?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A fully integrated paper microfluidic electrochemical device equipped with three different cation permeable films is developed to determine blood ions (Cl(?), Na(+), K(+), and Ca(2+)) at a time.

METHODS Children requiring hospitalization for CAP were prospectively enrolled. The following indices were determined: antibodies against pneumococcal surface proteins (anti-PLY, pneumococcal histidine triad D, pneumococcal histidine triad E, LytB and pneumococcal choline-binding protein A), viral serology, nasopharyngeal cultures and polymerase chain reaction for 13 respiratory viruses, blood pneumococcal polymerase chain reaction, pneumococcal urinary antigen, PCT and CRP. Presumed pneumococcal CAP (P-CAP) was defined as a positive blood culture or polymerase chain reaction for Streptococcus pneumoniae or as a pneumococcal surface protein seroresponse (2-fold increase). RESULTS Seventy-five patients were included from which 37 (49%) met the criteria of P-CAP. Elevated PCT and CRP values were strongly associated with P-CAP with odds ratios of 23 (95% confidence interval: 5-117) for PCT and 19 (95% confidence interval: 5-75) for CRP in multivariate analysis. The sensitivity was 94.4% for PCT (cutoff: 1.5 ng/mL) and 91.9% for CRP (cutoff: 100 mg/L). A value0.5 ng/mL of PCT ruled out P-CAP in >90% of cases (negative likelihood ratio: 0.08). Conversely, a PCT value1.5 ng/mL associated with a positive pneumococcal urinary antigen had a diagnostic probability for P-CAP of almost 80% (positive likelihood ratio: 4.59). CONCLUSIONS PCT and CRP are reliable predictors of P-CAP. Low cutoff values of PCT allow identification of children at low risk of P-CAP.

METHODS We collected data from 400 toilet facilities that were open to the public: all those in three contiguous city council territories (228) and a further convenience sample of 172 around other parts of New Zealand. Comparisons were made with the data on the same facilities included in a 2012/2013 survey. RESULTS Of the toilets in this survey, 2.5% had no water for handwashing and 14.8% had no soap. There was COVID-19-related health messaging signage in 19.5% of toilets, with posters of the COVID-19 QR code used for contact tracing in 12.3%, and generic handwashing signage in 1.8%. The handwashing water had 'no-touch' activation at 28.0% of toilets, and 18.5% of toilets had no-touch bowl flushing. Toilet bowl lids were not present at 32.8%, and 2.3% of toilets had damage that would impair their functionality (eg, broken toilet seats). This new survey found significantly increased provision of soap (risk ratio = 1.47; 95%CI: 1.25 to 1.72), but no increased provision of water, at the 128 sites that had also been examined in the previous survey.

Trained immunity explains the heterologous effects of vaccines, which result in increased protection against secondary infections. However, in chronic inflammatory conditions, trained immunity can induce maladaptive effects and contribute to hyperinflammation and progression of cardiovascular disease, autoinflammatory syndromes, and neuroinflammation.

The association between diabetes and mental health disorders could be exacerbated in a stressful environment, and psychological distress could increase depressive symptoms and cause adverse diabetes outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of mental health disorders in patients with diabetes during the social distancing period due to COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study developed to assess the impact of social distancing on a cohort of adults with type 1 (n = 52) and type 2 diabetes (n = 68) in Brazil. Inclusion criteria involved having an HbA1c test collected in the past 3 months and having a valid telephone number in electronic medical records. The primary outcome was the prevalence of minor psychiatric disorders, assessed by survey (SRQ-20). Secondary outcomes included the prevalence of diabetes related emotional distress, eating and sleeping disorders, all assessed by validated surveys at the moment of the study. Statistical analyses included unpaired t-test for continuous variables and (2) test for categorical variables. RESULTS: Overall (n = 120), participants had a mean age of 54.8  14.4 years-old, and HbA1c of 9.0  1.6% (75  17.5 mmol/mol); 93% of patients showed signs of current mental suffering based on the surveys measured.

An essential step of drug development is the careful evaluation of toxicity, which has a range of associated financial, temporal and ethical limitations. In this study, a number of in silico tools were used to predict the toxicity of 19 experimental compounds. A range of web-based servers and applications were used to predict hepatotoxicity, mutagenicity, acute oral toxicity, carcinogenicity, cardiotoxicity, and other potential adverse effects. The compounds were assessed based on the consensus of results, and were labelled as positive or negative for a particular toxicity endpoint. The compounds were then categorised into three classes, according to their predicted toxicity. Ten compounds (52.6%) were predicted to be non-mutagenic and non-hERG inhibitors, and exhibited zero or low level hepatotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Furthermore, from the consensus of results, all 19 compounds were predicted to be non-mutagenic and negative for acute oral toxicity.

Biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress and lipid mediators may help identify e-cigarette users with EVALI. Methods We collected plasma and urine along with demographic and vaping-related data of EVALI subjects (age 18-35 years) and non-users matched for sex and age in a pilot study. Biomarkers were assessed by ELISA/EIA and Luminex-based assays. Results Elevated levels of THC metabolite (11-nor-9-carboxy-9-THC) were found in plasma from EVALI subjects compared to non-users. Levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), an oxidative DNA damage biomarker, and 8-isoprostane, an oxidative stress marker, were slightly increased in urine samples from EVALI subjects compared to non-users. Conversely, plasma levels of lipid mediators, including resolvin D1 (RvD1) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), were significantly lower in EVALI subjects compared to non-users. Both pro-inflammatory biomarkers, such as tumour necrosis factor-, macrophage inflammatory protein-1, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, as well as anti-inflammatory biomarkers, such as interleukin-9 and CC10/16, were decreased in plasma from EVALI subjects compared to non-users, supportive of a possible dysregulated inflammatory response in EVALI subjects. Conclusions Significant elevations in urine and plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress, as well as reductions in lipid mediators, were shown in EVALI subjects.

METHODS: We identified 60,926 retired blood donors age 70 years or older in the rosters of three region-wide Danish blood banks and invited them to fill in a questionnaire on COVID-19 related symptoms and behaviours. Among 24,861 (40.8%) responders, we invited a random sample of 3,200 individuals for blood testing.

Seroprevalence 95% confidence intervals (CI) were adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Among retired (age 70 years or older) and active (age 17-69 years) blood donors, adjusted seroprevalences were 1.4% (95% CI: 0.3%-2.5%) and 2.5% (95% CI: 1.3%-3.8%), respectively.

Few studies provide more complex analysis on this issue, and there has been no research on the cumulative burden of perceived stress that people belonging to both minorities experience in the current epidemiological situation. The aim of this study was to assess the ability to deal with an external situation during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland in the following groups with different stress levels (total sample n = 370): Polish heterosexual men (n = 202), heterosexual men from Ukraine (n = 131) and homo- and bisexual men (men who have sex with menMSM) from Ukraine (n = 37). A Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) was used. The analysis of the survey did not show statistically significant differences between the three study groups in the general level of perceived stress (24.71, 24.77 and 26.49 points, respectively, p = 0.551), but it revealed numerous differences in coping with various aspects of everyday functioning between these groups. Negative assessment of ones own health proved to be the main factor negatively affecting the level of perceived stress, however specific health risks, medical history or the participants previous experience have not been taken into account in the study. Our research shows differences in the needs, resources and methods of coping with stress between men who are Polish citizens and migrants from Ukraine, both heterosexual and belonging to the MSM group. Proper identification and addressing of these needs, taking into account different availability of health services, could be the responsibility of NGOs or insurance providers. This should result in the reduction of mental health burdens and the risk of developing serious mental disorders, and consequently in better functioning of persons belonging to minorities and in a reduced burden on the health care system.","output":"Perceived Stress Levels among Ukrainian Migrant and LGBT+ Minorities in Poland during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In rural, remote, and northern parts of Canada, the pre-existing vulnerability and risk for intimate partner violence has been exacerbated by COVID-19.

This is because of many reasons which include the atypical presentation in the geriatric population which might have led to diagnostic delay. As per the WHO guidelines to perform RT-PCR only on the symptomatic individuals, a very small portion of individuals were tested, leaving a fraction of population undiagnosed. Therefore, there remained a chance that many asymptomatic individuals such caregivers, healthcare professionals, family members were undiagnosed and might have carried this virus to the geriatric patients. Also, many countries were not prepared to handle the burden on their healthcare system which included sudden increased demand of ICU beds, mechanical ventilation etc. As a result, they had to make decision on who to be admitted. Atypical presentation in geriatric population may include afebrile or low-grade fever, absence of cough, malaise, muscle pains, dyspnoea etc. Geriatric population shows a more severe type of pneumonia, significantly higher number of neutrophils and C-reactive protein, less lymphocytes and a higher proportion of multiple lobe involvement.

We aim to present the clinical and imaging findings in adolescents with pulmonary symptoms from suspected EVALI. METHODS Chest radiographs and CTs of adolescents (< 19 years) with acute pulmonary symptoms and history of vaping were reviewed by two radiologists in consensus. Clinical presentation and laboratory data were derived from the electronic medical records including pulmonary function tests (PFTs). RESULTS Eleven patients were identified (9 male, mean 16.6 years). The most common presentation was progressive, subacute respiratory distress with abdominal pain. All but one of the patients tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol. Chest radiograph features were notable for interstitial pattern of opacities (91%) and basilar abnormalities (82%). CT features were notable for ground-glass opacities (89%), interstitial opacities (78%), and subpleural sparing (67%). Eight patients underwent PFTs. Six had diffusing capacity measurement, which demonstrated impaired diffusion in 3 (50%). All patients received supportive treatment with supplemental oxygen and corticosteroids. CONCLUSION Adolescents with suspected EVALI commonly present with subacute respiratory distress with abdominal pain. Imaging findings include ground-glass opacities, subpleural sparing, and basilar opacities, most consistent with organizing pneumonia or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Recognition of the common imaging findings may have significant patient management implications, especially if the diagnosis is not suspected clinically.

This study aimed to assess the influence of COVID-19 pandemic on referrals of patients with liver disease to a LT Center.Materials and methods: An integrated referral program was developed since 10.2017 at Multivisceral Transplant Unit, PadovaUniversity. All consecutive adult patients with liver disease referred for the first time using this program from 10.2017 to 12.2020 were prospectively collected.

METHODS Thirty-two elite and 31 recreationally competitive triathletes and cyclists, and 20 sedentary controls (age range 18.0-34.1 yr) participated in a prospective surveillance study. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs were collected from subjects presenting with two or more defined upper respiratory symptoms. Swabs were analyzed using microscopy, culture, and PCR testing for typical and atypical respiratory pathogens. The Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-44) was used to assess symptomatology and functional impairment. RESULTS Thirty-seven URI episodes were reported in 28 subjects. Incidence rate ratios for illness were higher in both the control subjects (1.93, 95% CI: 0.72-5.18) and elite athletes (4.50, 1.91-10.59) than in the recreationally competitive athletes.

Symptom and functional impairment severity scores were higher in subjects with an infectious pathogen episode, particularly on illness days 3-4. CONCLUSION The results confirm a higher rate of URI among elite athletes than recreationally competitive athletes during this training and competition season.

METHODS In this mixed methods study, semi-structured interviews were performed with parents whose infants were enrolled in an existing longitudinal cohort study of therapeutic hypothermia between 2011 and 2014. RESULTS Thematic saturation was achieved after 20 interviews. Parental experience of communicating with clinicians was characterized by 3 principle themes. Theme 1 highlighted that a fragmented communication process mirrored the chaotic maternal and neonatal course. Parents often received key information about neonatal encephalopathy and therapeutic hypothermia from maternal clinicians. Infant medical information was often given to 1 family member (60%), who felt burdened by the responsibility to relay that information to others. Families universally valued the role of the bedside nurse, who was perceived as the primary source of communication for most (75%) families. Theme 2 encompassed the challenges of discussing the complex therapy of therapeutic hypothermia: families appreciated clinicians who used lay language and provided written material, and they often felt overwhelmed by technical information that made it hard to understand the \\"big picture\\" of their infant's medical course. Theme 3 involved the uncertain prognosis after neonatal encephalopathy. Parents appreciated specific expectations about their infant's long-term development, and experienced long-term distress about prognostic uncertainty.

The objective of the study is to comprehensively compare the immunological characteristics of non-responders to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the 18-59 years with that in the 60 years and older using internationally recognized cutoff values. Participants included 627 individuals who received physical examinations and volunteered to participate in COVID-19 vaccination from the general population. The main outcome was an effective seroconversion characterized by anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG level of at least 4-fold increase from baseline. Profiling of naive immune cells was analyzed prior to vaccination to demonstrate baseline immunity. Outcomes of effective seroconversion in the 18-59 years with that in the 60 years and older were compared. The quantitative level of the anti-spike IgG was significantly lower in the 60 years and older and in men among the 18-59 years. There were 7.5% of non-responders among the 18-59 years and 11.7% of non-responders in the 60 years and older using the 4-fold increase parameter.

Soluble PDGFR potently neutralizes HCMV in tissue culture, and its potential use as an antiviral therapeutic has the benefit that any escape mutants will likely be attenuated. However, PDGFR binds multiple PDGF ligands in the human body as part of developmental programs in embryogenesis and continuing through adulthood. Any therapies with soluble receptor therefore come with serious efficacy and safety concerns, especially for the treatment of congenital HCMV. Soluble virus receptors that are orthogonal to human biology might resolve these concerns. This engineering problem is solved by deep mutational scanning on the D2-D3 domains of PDGFR to identify variants that maintain interactions with the HCMV glycoprotein trimer in the presence of competing PDGF ligands. Competition by PDGFs is conformation-dependent, whereas HCMV trimer binding is independent of proper D2-D3 conformation, and many mutations at the receptor-PDGF interface are suitable for functionally separating trimer from PDGF interactions. Purified soluble PDGFR carrying a targeted mutation succeeded in displaying wild type affinity for HCMV trimer with a simultaneous loss of PDGF binding, and neutralizes trimer-only and trimer/pentamer-expressing HCMV strains infecting fibroblasts or epithelial cells.

Paired t-test, univariate ANOVA, chi-squared test, receiver operating characteristic curves, and logistic regression analysis were used for the statistical analysis. RESULTS: There was statistical significance in the time spent in the diagnosis of different groups (P<0.05). For the group with the optimal diagnostic results, univariate and multivariate analyses both suggested no significant correlation for all variables, and thus it might be the assistance of the AI system, the epidemiological history and other factors that played an important role. CONCLUSION: The AI system developed by us, which was created due to COVID-19, had certain clinical practicability and was worth popularizing.","output":"Helping Roles of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Screening and Evaluation of COVID-19 Based on the CT Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has gripped the world and is evolving day by day with deaths every hour.

No prospective epidemiological study has been published previously. METHODS We selected a cohort of 152 transplant recipients (cardiac, hepatic and renal transplant recipients). Median time from transplantation was 17 months (range 1-50). They were prospectively followed-up for RVI during 7 months (October to April). Clinical and microbiological evaluation (cell culture, shell vial and polymerase chain reaction technique) of each RVI episode was made. RESULTS We detected 81 RVI (0.91 episodes/patient/year). Complications were detected in 15/81 episodes (18.5%): acute bronchitis (10 cases), pneumonia (three cases; 3.7% of RVI episodes) and bacterial sinusitis (2 cases). In 4 of 81 episodes (5%), patients needed hospitalization. A respiratory virus was isolated in 17 of 68 nasopharyngeal samples (six respiratory syncytial virus, six influenza, four picornavirus, one adenovirus). Fever presented an 83% positive predictive value for the diagnosis of influenza virus infection among those with a positive microbiological isolation. There were no episodes of acute rejection coincidentally with RVI. Only 54% of the subjects had been previously vaccinated against influenza. CONCLUSIONS Incidence of RVI among solid organ transplant recipients is similar to general population but complications are higher. A relationship between RVI and rejection was not detected. The rate of influenza vaccination was lower than expected. The presence of fever in a transplant recipient with RVI strongly suggests influenza infection.","output":"Clinical implications of respiratory virus infections in solid organ transplant recipients: a prospective study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Self-sovereign Identity promises to give users control of their own data, and has the potential to foster advancements in terms of personal data privacy.

Therefore, objectives of this study included (1) describing Canadian youth rugby coach injury prevention beliefs and attitudes and current warm-up practices and (2) evaluating intention to use a rugby-specific NMT warm-up. Methods: High school rugby coaches completed a questionnaire before and after a rugby-specific NMT warm-up workshop. The pre-workshop questionnaire captured demographics, current warm-up practice, and NMT warm-up knowledge and use. Both questionnaires captured injury prevention beliefs, attitudes and behavioral intention. Results: Forty-eight coaches participated in the workshops. Pre-workshop, 27% of coaches were aware of NMT warm-ups. Coaches primarily included aerobic and stretching components, while balance components were not common in their warm-ups over the past year. Additionally, 92% of coaches agreed to some extent they would complete a rugby-specific warm-up program prior to every game and training session this season. Post-workshop, 86% of coaches agreed to some extent that they would use the program in every rugby session. No differences were observed between pre- and post-workshop intention to implement the warm-up (p = 0.10). Interpretation: This is the first study to examine current Canadian youth rugby coach warm-up practices and intention to use NMT warm-ups.

In contrast, spatial layout does not matter in the perception of \\"texture,\\" which is known to be represented as spatially global image statistics in the visual cortex. This property of \\"texture\\" enables us to reconstruct the perceived image from EEG signals, which have a low spatial resolution.

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is considered the reference standard test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, its limitations are a prompt for a more accurate assay to detect SARS-CoV-2, quantify its levels, and assess the prognosis. This article aimed to systematically review the literature and assess the diagnostic performance of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), also to evaluate its potential role in prognosis and management of COVID-19 patients. PubMed and Scopus databases were searched to identify relevant articles published until 13 July 2021. An additional PubMed search was performed on 21 October 2021.

Most studies reported ddPCR was more accurate than RT-qPCR in detecting and quantifying SARS-CoV-2 levels, especially in patients with low viral loads. ddPCR was also found highly effective in quantifying SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia levels in hospitalized patients, monitoring their disease course, and predicting their response to therapy. These findings suggest ddPCR could serve as a complement or alternative SARS-CoV-2 tool with emerging diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic value, especially in hospital settings.

As data on COVID-19 has grown, it has become clear that older adults have a disproportionately high rate of death from COVID-19. This study describes the early clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with more than 80 years of age. METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data from 17 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 20 and February 20, 2020 were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Treatment outcomes among subgroups of patients with non-severe and severe symptoms of COVID-19 were compared. RESULTS: Of the 17 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 88.0 years (interquartile range, 86.6-90.0 years; range, 80.0-100.0 years) and 12 (70.6%) were men. The age distribution of patients was not significantly different between non-severe group and severe group. All patients had chronic pre-existing conditions. Hypertension and cardiovascular diseases were the most common chronic conditions in both subgroups. The most common symptoms at the onset of COVID-19 were fever (n = 13; 76.5%), fatigue (n = 11; 64.7%), and cough (n = 5; 29.4%). Lymphopenia was observed in all patients, and lymphopenia was significantly more severe in the severe group than that in non-severe group (0.4  109/L vs 1.2  109/L, P = 0.014). The level of serum creatinine was higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group (99.0 mol/L vs 62.5 mol/L, P = 0.038). The most common features of chest computed tomography images were nodular foci in 10 (58.8%) patients and pleural thickening in 7 (41.2%) patients. All patients received antiviral therapy, while some patients also received intravenous antibiotics therapy (76.5%), Chinese medicinal preparation therapy (Lianhuaqingwen capsule, 64.7%), corticosteroids (35.3%) or immunoglobin (29.4%). Eight patients (47.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit because of complications. Ten patients (58.8%) received intranasal oxygen, while 3 (17.6%) received non-invasive mechanical ventilation, and 4 (23.5%) received high-flow oxygen. As of June 20, 7 (41.2%) patients had been discharged and 10 (58.8% of this cohort, 77.8% of severe patients) had died. CONCLUSION: The mortality of patients aged 80 years and older with severe COVID-19 symptoms was high. Lymphopenia was a characteristic laboratory result in these patients, and the severity of lymphopenia was indicative of the severity of COVID-19.

The B.1.1.519 variant was predominant between November 2020 and May 2021, reaching 90% of all cases sequenced in February 2021. It is characterized by three amino acid changes in the spike protein: T478K, P681H, and T732A. Its Rt varies between 0.5 and 2.9. Its geographical origin remain to be investigated. Patients infected with variant B.1.1.519 showed a highly significant adjusted odds ratio (aOR) increase of 1.85 over non-B.1.1.519 patients for developing a severe/critical outcome (p = 0.000296, 1.33C2.6 95% CI) and a 2.35-fold increase for hospitalization (p = 0.005, 1.32C4.34 95% CI).

Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism contributing to the efficacy of DHODH inhibition has been only partially elucidated. Here, we aimed to determine the impact of teriflunomide on the immune compartment in a longitudinal high-dimensional follow-up of patients with relapse-remitting MS (RRMS) treated with teriflunomide. METHODS: High-dimensional spectral flow cytometry was used to analyze the phenotype and the function of innate and adaptive immune system of patients with RRMS before and 12 months after teriflunomide treatment. In addition, we assessed the impact of teriflunomide on the migration of memory CD8 T cells in patients with RRMS, and we defined patient immune metabolic profiles. RESULTS: We found that 12 months of treatment with teriflunomide in patients with RRMS does not affect the B cell or CD4 T cell compartments, including regulatory T(REG) follicular helper T(FH) cell and helper T(H) cell subsets. In contrast, we observed a specific impact of teriflunomide on the CD8 T cell compartment, which was characterized by decreased homeostatic proliferation and reduced production of TNF and IFN. Furthermore, we showed that DHODH inhibition also had a negative impact on the migratory velocity of memory CD8 T cells in patients with RRMS. Finally, we showed that the susceptibility of memory CD8 T cells to DHODH inhibition was not related to impaired metabolism. DISCUSSION: Overall, these findings demonstrate that the clinical efficacy of teriflunomide results partially in the specific susceptibility of memory CD8 T cells to DHODH inhibition in patients with RRMS and strengthens active roles for these T cells in the pathophysiological process of MS.","output":"Teriflunomide Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis Selectively Modulates CD8 Memory T Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Guaranteeing the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of populations living in fragile and humanitarian settings is essential and constitutes a basic human right. Compounded by the inherent vulnerabilities of women in crises, substantial complications are directly associated with increased risks of poor SRHR outcomes for displaced populations. The migration of Venezuelans, displaced due to current economic circumstances, is one of the largest in Latin America's history. This study aims to provide an overview of the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues affecting migrant Venezuelan women in the state of Roraima, Brazil. METHODS: Face-to-face interviews were conducted from 24 to 30 November 2019. Data collection covered various issues involving access to and use of SRH services by 405 migrant Venezuelan women aged 18-49 years. The Minimum Initial Service Package readiness assessment tools, available from the Inter-Agency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crises, were used in the data collection. RESULTS: Most commonly, the women reported unmet family planning needs. Of these, a significant proportion reported being unable to obtain contraceptive methods, particularly long-acting reversible contraceptives, either due to the woman's inability to access them or their unavailability at healthcare centres. Although a significant proportion of women were largely satisfied with the attention received at the maternity hospital, both before and during childbirth, 24.0% of pregnant or postpartum women failed to receive any prenatal or postnatal care. CONCLUSION: Meeting the essential SRHR needs of migrant Venezuelan women in Roraima, Brazil is a challenge that has yet to be fully addressed. Given the size of this migrant population, the Brazilian healthcare system has failed to adapt sufficiently to meet their needs; however, problems with healthcare provision are similar for migrants and Brazilian citizens. Efforts need to be encouraged not only in governmental health sectors, but also with academic, non-governmental and international organisations, including a coordinated approach to ensure a comprehensive SRHR response. Given the current high risks associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, meeting the SRHR needs of migrant populations has become more critical than ever.","output":"Maternal health among Venezuelan women migrants at the border of Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recognition and management of the socio-emotional pain facing the COVID-19 pandemic refer to different, but interdependent, clues regarding cognitive and emotional aspects of the pandemic threat, considering the need of social distancing as a prophylactic procedure to avoid spreading the pathogen.

Intersectionality, a term coined by legal scholar and activist Kimberl Crenshaw, is a framework to consider race and other social identities as overlapping, dynamic, and interdependent identities. Since its inception, intersectionality has made significant in-roads to inform the conceptualization and empirical investigations of race, gender, and other social identities in sociology, critical race theory, anthropology, feminist theory, and other disciplines. However, to date, cost effectiveness research has not systematically examined race intersecting with other social identities in the valuation of medicines using social theory, such as intersectionality. Consequently, cost effectiveness analysis, which is a method to study the value of medicines in diverse populations, has not been subject to sufficient examination through an intersectionality framework. In the US context, the racial injustices experienced and documented within diverse communities highlight that health outcomes cannot be examined in a vacuum; overlapping social identities such as race and class in relation to context have real effects on health behaviors, measured preferences, and economic costs. Failure to examine the effects of overlapping social identities on heterogeneity in benefits and costs can result in inadequate information for decision makers to evaluate the value of treatments. Without consideration of the overlapping social identities in diverse populations, there is a risk that cost effectiveness analysis results will not accurately reflect the value of treatments in socially disadvantaged populations.

The subject is extremely visual and has therefore previously been a target for the development of technology enhanced learning initiatives over the last ten years. Today's students have come to expect the integration of technology in the classroom and remotely. They adjust quickly to the innovative use of new applications and software and have begun to integrate it within their own workflow for note taking and study aids. Given the intense drive towards blended deliveries of anatomy as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is easy to picture how the benefits of working in partnership with students (in order to achieve many of these aims) would be possible, particularly in difficult subjects like neuroanatomy. In doing so, it provides anatomists with new opportunities to engage students in a way that aligns well with best practice frameworks for engaging students through partnership. The current United Kingdom guidelines set out by Advance HE (a professional membership scheme for promoting excellence in higher education) strongly encourages the higher education community to seek out appropriate academic contexts where a balance of power can be struck between staff and student to create a community of practice.

METHODS: We examined characteristics of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong, assessed associations between incidence and population-level characteristics at the level of small geographic areas, and evaluated relations between socioeconomics and work-from-home (WFH) arrangements. RESULTS: The largest source of COVID-19 importations switched from students studying overseas in the second wave to foreign domestic helpers in the third. The local cases were mostly individuals not in formal employment (retirees and homemakers) and production workers who were unable to WFH. For every 10% increase in the proportion of population employed as executives or professionals in a given geographic region, there was an 84% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1% to 97%) reduction in the incidence of COVID-19 during the third wave. In contrast, in the first two waves, the same was associated with 3.69 times (95% CI: 1.02 to 13.33) higher incidence. Executives and professionals were more likely to implement WFH and experienced frequent changes in WFH practice, compared to production workers. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent findings on the reversed socioeconomic patterning of COVID-19 burden between infection waves in Hong Kong at both individual and population level analyses indicated that risks of infections may be related to occupations involving high exposure frequency and WFH flexibility.

Here, we show that degrading the temporal continuity of visual experience during early postnatal life leads to a sizable reduction of the number of complex cells and to an impairment of their functional properties while fully sparing the development of simple cells.

Mobility statistics are a relatively new data source created by compiling smartphone location data; they can be effectively used for understanding pandemics if integrated with epidemiological findings and other economic data sets. Based on data for the first wave of infections in Japan, we found that reductions targeting the hospitality industry were slightly more effective than restrictions on general business activities. Specifically, we found that to hold back the pandemic (that is, to reduce the effective reproduction number to one or less for all days), a 20%-35% reduction in weekly mobility is required, depending on the region. A lesser goal, 80% of days with one or less observed transmission, can be achieved with a 6%-30% reduction in weekly mobility.

Concerns regarding the consequences of infection, as well as the general uncertainty and governmental regulations have resulted in increased psychological distress among many populations and cultures. In this regard, research has shown that the manner by which individuals perceive such large-scale threats and appraise them significantly contributes to the psychological consequences of such events. According to the Hostile-World Scenario (HWS) model, negative engagement (NE) with such threats weakens one's competence and coping abilities, whereas positive engagement (PE) facilitates resilience and enhances psychological adjustment. Accordingly, the current study examines the moderating role of both NE and PE in the connections of two main features of the current pandemic, COVID-19-related worries and loneliness, with anxiety. Data were collected between March 16 and April 14, 2020, from 1,112 Israelis (age range 17C92, M = 46.90, SD = 16.46), who provided information regarding COVID-19 health worries, loneliness, and anxiety. A special measure assembled items pertinent to the HWS-NE and HWS-PE throughout the survey. Results demonstrated that both HWS-NE and HWS-PE were significant moderators. COVID-19-related health worries/loneliness were linked with anxiety only among individuals with high HWS-NE, and were non-significant among those with low HWS-NE. Moreover, the positive association between loneliness and anxiety was significantly mitigated by high HWS-PE. The discussion highlights the importance of the HWS for understanding the psychological consequences of COVID-19 and offers practical suggestions, which may aid mental health practitioners in providing assistance and support to the general population.","output":"The Moderating Role of the Hostile-World Scenario in the Connections Between COVID-19 Worries, Loneliness, and Anxiety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic period presents a unique context for the investigation of anxiety symptoms among adolescents and their parents.

Hypothetically this has been ascribed to restricted exposure to microbial diversity due to advanced hygienic practices accompanying modernization, and increasing prosperity in urban versus rural habitats. The autoimmune animal model of T1D, inhibited by Bacillus Calmette Guerine (BCG), motivated testing the impact of BCG on T1D incidence in humans. Several epidemiological analyses, short of one, failed to demonstrate a protective effect of BCG against T1D. The present retrospective analysis of two data sets reevaluates the hypothetic inhibitory effect of BCG on human T1D. Reassessment of data from a Swedish study reveals that a single BCG vaccination provided a small but significant protection against T1D. A second data set of T1D prevalence/1000 Israeli military conscripts, from a doctoral thesis presenting 17 birth cohorts at age 17 is evaluated against the national schedule of vaccination related to years of birth. To correct for the annual increasing T1D trend the mean urbanization (census) rate was set as an annual moving average and factored into the prevalence (T1D/1000) of respective birth cohorts. Three groups of cohorts corresponding to BCG vaccination are presently identified; Group A corresponds to the years in which newborns were vaccinated and boosted if necessary, at age 12. Group B corresponds to the period when boosting was discontinued. Group C corresponds to years when newborn BCG vaccination was discontinued. T1D (only in females) was slightly but significantly lower in group B (n = 5 cohorts) versus C (n = 8 cohorts, p = 0.0475, by Mann Whitney U test). T1D in group A (n = 4 cohorts) was lower than in group B (p = 0.02). This analysis supports the hypothesis that in human females postnatal BCG vaccination, reinforced by boosting, has a protective impact on T1D being superior to omitted boosting, which in its turn is still better than stopping vaccination altogether. This analysis further suggests that upon advanced modernization the BCG vaccine compensates for reduced exposure to microbial diversity early in life.","output":"Newborn BCG vaccination complemented by boosting correlates better with reduced juvenile diabetes in females, than vaccination alone."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Caffeine is widely accepted as an endurance-performance enhancing supplement.

A greater proportion of men (31.7%) used caffeine supplements compared with women (17.2%; p = 0.007). Caffeine use was also more prevalent among professional (45.5%) and recreational athletes (25.1%) than in collegiate athletes (9.4%). Type of sport (p = 0.641), household income (p = 0.263), education (p = 0.570) or working with a coach (p = 0.612) did not have an impact on caffeine supplementation prevalence.

After adjustment for sex, age, indexes of liver and renal function, C-reactive protein, and current smoking status, PNI scores remained independently and inversely associated with the severity of COVID-19 (odd ratio: 0.797; P = .030). A receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that PNI scores had a similar accuracy to predict severe forms of COVID-19 compared with its combination with sex, age, and BMI (P = .402). PNI < 49 was defined as the cutoff value to predict the severe form of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Poorer nutritional status predisposed patients infected with COVID-19 to its severe form. Independently associated with the severity of COVID-19, PNI score could serve as a simple, fast, and effective predictor among patients with different sex, age, and BMI.","output":"Predictive value of the prognostic nutritional index for the severity of coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La Covid-19 ha provocado una situacin completamente extraordinaria y anmala El nuevo coronavirus se ha convertido en un fenmeno global tras la declaracin de un estado pandmico que afecta a todos los campos: sanitario, econmico, social, cientfico, medioambiental, etc Esta emergencia sanitaria afecta tambin a distintos niveles y actores, entre ellos los medios y el periodismo En lo que a cobertura informativa se refiere, la portada de prensa representa un objeto de estudio relevante desde el punto de vista periodstico, pero tambin sociolgico e historiogrfico La pgina principal juega un importante papel temporal explicativo, especialmente durante un evento tan disruptivo como la pandemia Ofrece la posibilidad de \\"fotografiar\\" la cobertura de un acontecimiento en curso El objetivo de esta investigacin es analizar la cobertura del nuevo coronavirus y su evolucin a lo largo del primer trimestre de 2020 Para responder a estas cuestiones, se realiza un anlisis de contenido temtico de 630 portadas de siete peridicos generalistas espa?oles de alcance nacional: El pas, El mundo, ABC, La razn, La vanguardia, El peridico y El correo Los resultados indican que la informacin sobre el virus ha ido aumentando progresivamente segn la epidemia se haca ms prxima hasta estar dentro de las fronteras espa?olas Tambin que la cobertura fue muy homognea en los diarios espa?oles, aunque se localizan algunas diferencias sobre todo por tendencias editoriales y por perspectiva regional o nacional Asimismo, el patrn de los encuadres analizados se caracteriza por el diagnstico actual de la pandemia muy enfocado en la definicin del problema y la propuesta de soluciones sanitarias","output":"Radiografa de la pandemia: anlisis de la cobertura periodstica de la Covid-19 en portadas de peridicos"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemi COVID-19 adalah krisis kesehatan yang sedang menjadi perhatian negara-negara di dunia saat ini.

The public health response to the pandemic was rapid too. Completion of COVID-19 vaccine development was achieved in under a year. The USA and the UK were the first countries to rollout COVID-19 vaccines to contain the pandemic. Successful rollout of the vaccines hinges on many factors, among which is public trust. Aim: To investigate the sentiments towards COVID-19 vaccines in the USA and UK prior to vaccination rollout. Methods: Neuro-linguistic programming with human validation was used to analyse a sample of 243,883 COVID-19 vaccine related social media posts from the USA and the UK in the period 28 July to 28 August 2020. The sentiment analysis measured polarity (positive, neutral, negative), and the themes present in negative comments. Results: In the sample of 243,883 social media posts, both the USA and the UK had a net sentiment profile of approximately 28% positive, 8% negative and 63% neutral sentiment. On further analysis, there were distinct differences between the two countrys social media sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccines. The differences were seen in the themes behind the negative sentiment. In the USA, the negative sentiments were mainly due to health and safety concerns, the fear of making a vaccine mandatory, and the role that pharmaceutical companies would play with the release of vaccines. In the UK the main driver of negative sentiment was the fear of making the vaccine mandatory (almost double the size of the sentiment in the USA). Conclusions: Negative sentiments towards COVID-19 vaccines were prevalent in the third quarter of 2020 in the USA and the UK. Reasons behind the negative sentiments can be used by authorities in the two countries to design evidence-based interventions to address the refusal of vaccination against COVID-19.","output":"Negative sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccines: A comparative study of USA and UK social media posts before vaccination rollout"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With an ageing population, mounting pressure on the healthcare dollar, significant advances in medical technology, and now in the context of coronavirus disease 2019, the traditional paradigm in which operative procedures are undertaken is changing. Increasingly, procedures are performed in more distant, isolated and less familiar locations, challenging anaesthesiologists and requiring well developed situational awareness. This review looks at implications for the practitioner and patient safety, outlining considerations and steps involved in translation of systems and processes well established in the operating room to more unfamiliar environments. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite limited nonoperating room anaesthesia outcome data, analysis of malpractice claims, anaesthesia-related medical disputes and clinical outcome registries have suggested higher morbidity and mortality. Complications were often associated with suboptimal monitoring, nonadherence to recommended guidelines and sedationist or nonanaesthesiologist caregivers. More recently, clear monitoring guidelines, global patient safety initiatives and widespread implementation of cognitive aids may have contributed to nonoperating room anaesthesia (NORA) outcomes approaching that of traditional operating rooms. SUMMARY: As NORA caseloads increase, understanding structural and anaesthetic requirements is essential to patient safety. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has provided an opportunity for anaesthesiologists to implement lessons learned from previous analyses, share expertise as patient safety leaders and provide valuable input into protecting patients and caregivers.","output":"Nonoperating room anaesthesia: safety, monitoring, cognitive aids and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The deteriorating political and economic situation in Venezuela has ramifications far beyond the Latin American countrys borders as almost five million Venezuelans fled and migrated into countries in the region due to the crisis at home.

The need for accurate data is especially dire given the current COVID-19 pandemic and evolving movement of refugees. While countries and international organizations came together to form a coordinated response to Venezuelas political and humanitarian crisis, this geopolitical progress is threatened by the rapid spread of COVID-19, and the instinct for countries to focus inwards on domestic response priorities, rather than engage in regional cooperation.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study involving a case series of loxoscelism. Only cases of dermonecrosis with photodocumentation of lesion evolution (from admission until complete or almost complete healing) were included. RESULTS: Eight patients (six men, two women; median age, 38 years) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The bite sites included the thigh (n = 4), forearm (n = 2), abdomen (n = 1), and trunk (n = 1). Time interval between the bite and first contact with our service ranged from 15 to 216 h (median = 29 h). The main clinical manifestations included local erythematous and ischemic violaceous lesions overlying a base of indurated edema (livedoid plaque, 8), local pain (8), exanthema (6), serohemorrhagic vesicles/blisters (5), fever (5), and jaundice (1). Based on a previously established classification, the cases were classified as probable cutaneous-necrotic loxoscelism (CNL, n = 4), presumptive CNL (n = 3), and presumptive cutaneous-hemolytic loxoscelism (n = 1). Seven patients were treated with anti-arachnidic antivenom (AV; median time post-bite = 46 h). Complete lesion healing ranged from 34 to 98 days post-bite (median, 68 days; six patients). None of the patients required reconstructive plastic surgery.

The objectives of this study are to (1) determine the frequency of pediatric subjects diagnosed with febrile seizures and COVID-19, (2) evaluate patient characteristics, and (3) describe the treatments (medications and need for invasive mechanical ventilation) applied. METHODS: This was a retrospective study utilizing TriNetX electronic health record data. We included subjects ranging from 0 to 5 years of age with a diagnosis of febrile seizures (R56.00, R56.01) and COVID-19 (U07.1). We extracted the following data: age, race, ethnicity, diagnostic codes, medications, laboratory results, and procedures. RESULTS: During this study period, 8854 pediatric subjects aged 0-5 years were diagnosed with COVID-19 among 34 health care organizations and 44 (0.5%) were also diagnosed with febrile seizures (simple, 30 [68.2%]; complex, 14 [31.8%]).

Moreover, since they can evolve fast and cross the species barrier, some of these viruses, such as influenza A and coronaviruses, have sometimes caused epidemics or pandemics and were associated with more serious clinical diseases and even mortality. The recently identified Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a Public Health Emergency of International concern and has been associated with rapidly progressive pneumonia. To ensure protection against emerging respiratory tract infections, the development of new strategies based on modulating the immune responses is essential. The use of probiotic components has substantially increased due to their effects on immune responses, in particular on those that occur in the upper/lower respiratory tract. Superinduction of inflammatory reaction, known as a cytokine storm, has been correlated directly with viral pneumonia and serious complications of respiratory infections. In this review, probiotics, as potential immunomodulatory agents, have been proposed to improve the host's response to respiratory viral infections. In addition, the effects of probiotics on different aspects of immune responses and their antiviral properties in both pre-clinical and clinical contexts have been described in detail.","output":"The immunomodulatory effects of probiotics on respiratory viral infections: A hint for COVID-19 treatment?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 primarily affecting the respiratory system which can damage vessels walls virtually in any body district.

Fifty-nine eyes from 32 COVID-19 patients and 80 eyes from 53 unexposed subjects were included. Mean arteries diameter (MAD) and mean veins diameter (MVD) were assessed through semi-automatic analysis on fundus color photos at baseline and 6 months later in patients and subjects unexposed to the virus.

These multiple abrupt adjustment demands in work may be a source of intense stress for office workers with consequences on wellbeing and the quality of life. This long-term prospective study aimed at investigating the effect of adaptation demands on a broad population of employees of a large Italian banking group in the job-related stress framework.

We assessed workaholism by using the Dutch Work Addiction Scale (DUWAS-10), work-family conflicting overlap by using the Work and Family Conflict Scale (WAFCS), and concern for back to work (BW) and for HW by specific questions. Higher WAFCS scores characterized Reopening and Vaccination Round while Second Wave had the highest level of concern for HW. Women and younger individuals showed the highest concern for BW, WAFCS, and DUWAS-10 scores regardless of the pandemic stage. HW days per week were related to more heightened concern for BW and lower concern for HW, DUWAS, and WAFCS scores. The number of children was related to lower Concern for BW and higher WAFCS scores in Reopening and Second Wave.

Several techniques of such an inspiration have recently shown promising results in automatically designing neural network architectures. However, apart from back-propagation, only a few applications of other learning techniques are used for these purposes. The back-propagation process takes advantage of specific optimization techniques that are best suited to specific application domains (e.g., Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing). Hence, the need for a more general learning approach, namely, a basic algorithm able to make inference in different contexts with distinct properties. In this paper, we deal with the problem from a scientific and epistemological point of view. We believe that this is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and dynamics underlying human learning. To this aim, we define some elementary inference operations and show how modern architectures can be built by a combination of those elementary methods. We analyze each method in different settings and find the best-suited application context for each learning algorithm. Furthermore, we discuss experimental findings and compare them with human learning. The discrepancy is particularly evident between supervised and unsupervised learning. Then, we determine which elementary learning rules are best suited for unsupervised systems, and, finally, we propose some improvements in reinforcement learning architectures.","output":"Automated Machine Learning: Prospects and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El presente estudio tuvo como propsito analizar la actitud hacia la vacunacin contra el COVID-19, en relacin con la preocupacin por el virus, el sentido de pertenencia comunitaria, y variables demogrficas.

Fluids pressurize the Campi Flegrei hydrothermal system, migrate, and increase stress before earthquakes. The loss of polarization (depolarization) of the transfer and extensional structures maps pressurized fluids, detecting fluid migrations after seismic sequences.

Although kimchi, a major fermented food, is an important part of the traditional diet in Korea, only a few studies have investigated the relationship between AD and kimchi. This study aimed to examine the association between the risk of AD and kimchi intake among Korean adults aged 19 to 49 years. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional study among a total of 7,222 adults who participated in the 2010-2012 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. We defined AD based on responses to a health interview and assessed kimchi intake using a 24-hour recall method administered by well-trained interviewers. RESULTS In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, we observed a significantly decreased odds ratio (OR) of having AD according to kimchi consumption after adjustment for confounding factors. In particular, subjects in the third quartile of kimchi consumption (85.0-158 g) had a 32% lower presence of AD than those in the first quartile of kimchi consumption (0-36.0 g) (Odds ratio: 0.68, 95% confidence interval: 0.50-0.92). CONCLUSIONS We found that consuming 85.0-158 g/day of kimchi was significantly associated with a lower presence of AD. Considering that one serving size of kimchi is 40 g, this corresponds to about 2-4 servings per day. This finding suggests that adequate amount of kimchi intake might have a protective effect against AD.","output":"Kimchi intake and atopic dermatitis in Korean aged 19-49 years: The Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010-2012."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global economy was stagnant and even regressed since the outbreak of COVID-19.

Correct interpretation of WBC scans in FRI is important since a false positive or false negative diagnosis has major consequences for the patient in terms of clinical decision-making. The European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) guideline for correct analysis and interpretation of WBC scans recommends semiquantitative analysis of visually equivocal scans. Therefore, this study aims to assess the diagnostic accuracy of semiquantitative analysis of visually equivocal WBC scans for diagnosing FRI. METHODS: A retrospective single-center study was performed in consecutive patients who received WBC scintigraphy in the diagnostic work-up for FRI between February 2012 and January 2017. All the visually equivocal scans were analysed using semiquantitative analysis by comparing leukocyte uptake in the manually selected suspected infection focus with the contralateral bone marrow (L/R ratio). Cut-off points for a 'positive' scan result of >0%, >10% and >20% leukocyte increase between the early and late scans were used in separate analyses. The discriminative ability was quantified by calculating the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: In total, 153 WBC scans were eligible for inclusion. After visual assessment of all the scans, 28 visually equivocal scans were included. Dichotomization of the ratios using the cut-off of >0% resulted in a sensitivity of 30%, a specificity of 45% and a diagnostic accuracy of 40%. The >10% cut-off point resulted in a sensitivity of 18%, a specificity of 82% and a diagnostic accuracy of 66%.

A recent direction in drug development is the utilization of nucleic acidbased therapeutic molecules, such as antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, short interfering RNA (siRNA), and microRNA (miRNA). miRNAs are endogenous, short, non-coding RNA molecules. Some viruses encode their own miRNAs, which play pivotal roles in viral replication and immune evasion strategies. Conversely, viruses that do not encode miRNAs may manipulate host cell miRNAs for the benefits of their replication. miRNAs have therefore become attractive tools for the study of viral pathogenesis. Lately, novel therapeutic strategies based on miRNA technology for the treatment of viral diseases have been progressing rapidly. Although this new generation of molecular therapy is promising, there are still several challenges to face, such as targeting delivery to specific tissues, avoiding off-target effects of miRNAs, reducing the toxicity of the drugs, and overcoming mutations and drug resistance.

Xpress Strep A positive and 38/205 (18.5%) BioGX positive. Compared to culture, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the Xpert? Xpress Strep A molecular test were 100%, 90.4%, 62.2% and 100%, respectively. Compared to the composite gold-standard, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV and were 100%, 95.8%, 84.4% and 100% respectively. 17 samples were Xpert? Xpress positive but culture-negative; 6 of these 17 swabs represent true positives with evidence of recent GAS infection. Ten samples were culture negative but both Xpert? Xpress and BioGX positive. Conclusion: The Xpert? Xpress Strep A molecular test is highly sensitive with a strong negative predictive value and rapid turnaround time. It can be safely introduced as a first line test for throat swabs in a high-incidence ARF population.","output":"The utility of rapid Group A streptococcus molecular testing compared with throat culture for the diagnosis of Group A streptococcal pharyngitis in a high-incidence rheumatic fever population."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research aims at analyzing the experience carried out in the Schools of Economics of the University of Parma and the University of Bologna with a business simulation, specifically with practice enterprises (PE).

The current COVID-19 pandemic is strongly affecting the mental health of the general population. We aimed to assess the incidence of BO among medical oncologists and determine factors associated with burnout levels during the current pandemic. METHODS: A digital survey was created for this study. The Spanish-validated version of Maslach BO Inventory was incorporated to define BO. Social and demographic information was analysed to remove duplicated answers. RESULTS: A total of 188 Argentinian medical oncologists from 16 cities participated in the survey. The median age of the participants was 43 years (IQR 38-50) and a similar distribution between male and female was observed. At the time of the survey, Argentina was in the third month of strict lockdown. Most of the participants practiced in both public and private practice facilities (55.3%) and the majority reported more than 10 years of experience (53.2%). Twenty-five percent (43) of subjects reported high levels of DP, 39.9% (75) reported high levels of EE and 53.7% (101) reported low levels of PA. BO Maslach criteria were fulfilled by 14.9% (28). We compared this result with other burnout assessment tools. Using the Gil-Monte and Neira tool, BO-associated domains were altered in 77.1%, 42% and 42% for EE, DP, and PA domains, respectively. Concomitantly, under Neira assessment a domain impairment was appreciated in 77.1%, 76% and 54% respectively. BO criteria were met by 30.3% (57) according to Gil-Monte and 47.9% (90) to Neira. CONCLUSION: BO is a multifaceted issue with a negative impact on physicians, patients, and institutions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, BO criteria was met in a considerable proportion of survey respondents using MBI, and Peiro and Neiro tools and younger age, use of antidepressants and psychological medications and income reduction arose as statistically significant factors after multivariate analysis.","output":"Burnout syndrome in medical oncologists during the COVID-19 pandemic: Argentinian national survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced changes in production and especially in human interaction, with \\"social distancing\\" a standard prescription for slowing transmission of the disease.

More research is needed to understand how OHI and online social support may influence illness experiences and patient-practitioner relationships in people with arthritis-related fatigue. The present study aimed to explore how OHI and social media shape these experiences by using an inductive qualitative analysis. METHOD: Seven focus groups were conducted with 21 participants aged 28-77 diagnosed with a range of rheumatic diseases. Within the focus groups, participants were asked questions about OHI, online social support and the role of OHI in their health care. The focus groups were recorded, transcribed and analysed using a combination of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) and thematic analysis. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in three themes: (a) how online social support changes illness experiences, (b) communicating fatigue to health professionals using OHI and (c) health care experiences online. These themes provide insight into the ways people with arthritis-related fatigue benefit from online social support, use OHI to support communication with health professionals and how they share health care for arthritis in online spaces. CONCLUSION: This research expanded on previous literature addressing the role of OHI and social media in the illness experience of arthritis-related fatigue. As technology use is increasing, particularly in the current extraordinary environment of social distancing, it is critical to address the role of OHI and social media in health care.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data of patients 90 years in whom endovascular stroke treatment was performed between January 2011 and January 2016. Recanalization was assessed according to the TICI score. The clinical condition was evaluated on admission (NIHSS, prestroke mRS), at discharge (NIHSS), and after 3 months (mRS). RESULTS Twenty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria for this analysis. The median prestroke mRS was 2. Successful recanalization (TICI  2b) was achieved in 22 patients (75.9%). In 9 patients, an NIHSS improvement  10 points was noted between admission and discharge. After 3 months, 17.2% of the patients had an mRS of 0-2 or exhibited prestroke mRS, and 24.1% achieved mRS 0-3. Mortality rate was 44.8%. There was only 1 minor procedure-related complication (small SAH without clinical sequelae).

However, the risk of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in DLBCL survivors with different primary extranodal sites are unknown. METHODS: A total of 40,714 patients diagnosed with stage I/II DLBCL were included from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 1983 to 2015.The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and absolute excess risk (AER) were used to assess the risk of SMNs. RESULTS: The results show that the risk of SMN was significantly higher in extranodal DLBCL than in the US general population (SIR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.26), and the risk of developing SMN remains significantly elevated with increased latency. Moreover, there were multiple site-specific risk patterns. There was a 22%, 44%, 66%, 123% and 151% increased risk of SMN 10 years after primary gastrointestinal tract, head/neck, skeletal, lung and liver/pancreas DLBCL diagnosis, respectively. There was a significant decrease risk of SMN with increasing age at diagnosis for primary gastrointestinal tract and skeletal DLBCL. In addition, DLBCL patients with primary sites in the gastrointestinal tract, thyroid and liver/pancreas had the highest incidences of secondary stomach cancer, second thyroid cancer, and second hepatobiliary cancer, respectively, which indicated that the initial site of DLBCL may predict the type of SMN.

Methods: Attendees will learn about telepsychiatry services developed and utilized at Childrens Hospital Colorado (CHCO) prior to the initiation of the COVID-19 pandemic. A brief description and timeline of the systems of care issues initially identified will be shared as well as a description of the initial model of telepsychiatry services implemented at CHCO. The initial goals of telepsychiatry utilization were to decrease the number of transports from urgent cares and from satellite emergency rooms to the main emergency room located on Anschutz Medical Campus for mental health evaluation, and to decrease the overall wait times for evaluation. Attendees will then learn about how this model of telepsychiatry was enhanced at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic by the utilization of home telepsychiatry and onsite telepsychiatry, allowing decreased exposure risk to COVID-19 and having substantial positive impact on the health of the workforce to continue to care for high volumes of patients. Results: This presenter will share data showing the initial success in accomplishing goals of decreasing transfers and length of stay with the telepsychiatry model prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This presenter will then: 1) share data encompassing the total number of consults conducted using telecommunication in the different elements/models described above;and 2) review feedback from onsite staff, clinicians working in the tele model, and some patient/family experiences.

The exact proportion and degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals remains unclear. Studies however indicate that their management is crucial for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODOLOGY: We developed a simplified deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical model to assess the effect of active isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected but asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing for control of the outbreak in Lusaka Province of Zambia. Here we modelled two scenarios; (1) assuming asymptomatic individuals comprised 70% of all COVID-19 cases and (2) asymptomatic individuals comprised only 50% of the cases. For contrast, the model was assessed first under the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are equally as infectious as symptomatic individuals and then secondly, and more likely, assuming asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious as symptomatic individuals. RESULTS: For the model assuming 70% asymptomatic cases, a minimum sustained daily blanket testing rate of  7911 tests/100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak if asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious while if equal infectiousness was assumed then a testing rate of  10028 tests/ 100000 population would be required. For 50% asymptomatic, minimum blanket testing rates of  4540 tests/ 100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak at both assumed levels of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our model predicts that active isolation of COVID-19 cases, including asymptomatic individuals, through blanket testing can be used as a possible measure for the control of the SARS-Cov-2 transmission in Lusaka, Zambia, but it would come at a high cost.","output":"Assessing required SARS-CoV-2 blanket testing rates for possible control of the outbreak in the epicentre Lusaka province of Zambia with consideration for asymptomatic individuals: A simple mathematical modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, there have been major advances in deep learning algorithms for image recognition in traumatic brain injury (TBI).

First evidence from China suggests that HCWs are at risk for anxiety and depression. However, generalizability to western countries is limited. The current study aimed at exploring HCWs mental health during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Switzerland. In addition, we conducted a network analysis to investigate the independent effect of risk and protective factors on HCWs mental health and their interplay. Methods: In an exploratory, cross-sectional, nation-wide online survey, we assessed demographics, work characteristics, COVID-19 exposure, and anxiety, depression, and burnout in 857 physicians and 553 nurses during the pandemic in Switzerland. At the time of data collection, Switzerland had among the highest per capita rate of COVID-19 cases in the world. Results: Overall symptom levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout were elevated. Women, nurses, frontline staff and HCWs exposed to COVID-19 patients reported more symptoms than their peers. However, these effects were all small and, in the network analysis, most of them did not remain significant after controlling for the other factors. Whereas COVID-19 exposure was only partially associated with mental health, perceived support by the employer independently predicted anxiety and burnout. Conclusions: Our finding that HCWs had elevated levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout underscores the importance to systematically monitor HCWs mental health during this ongoing pandemic. Because perceived support and mental health impairments were negatively related, we encourage the implementation of supportive measures for HCWs well-being during this crisis.","output":"Health Care WorkersMental Health During the First Weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in Switzerland: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dyslipidemia, characterized by a high level of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, or both), can increase the risk of developing and progressing atherosclerosis. As atherosclerosis progresses, the number and severity of aterial plagues increases with greater risk of myocardial infarction, a major contributor to cardiovascular mortality. Atherosclerosis progresses in four phases, namely endothelial dysfunction, fatty streak formation, lesion progression and plaque rupture, and eventually thrombosis and arterial obstruction. With greater understanding of the pathological processes underlying atherosclerosis, researchers have identified that lipoproteins play a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis. In particular, apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins have been shown to associate with atherosclerosis. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDLs) also contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis whereas high-density lipoproteins (HDL) contribute to the removal of cholesterol from macrophages thereby inhibiting the formation of foam cells. Given these known associations, lipoproteins may have potential as biomarkers for predicting risk associated with atherosclerotic plaques or may be targets as novel therapeutic agents. As such, the rapid development of drugs targeting lipoprotein metabolism may lead to novel treatments for atherosclerosis. A comprehensive review of lipoprotein function and their role in atherosclerosis, along with the latest development of lipoprotein targeted treatment, is timely.

In the setting of pandemic disease, investigations such as arterial blood gases are difficult to obtain on admission. This retrospective study evaluated the ability of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA), and national early warning signs (NEWS) scores to predict in-hospital mortality. These scoring systems require limited data and may offer utility with regard to predicting outcomes on admission. METHODS Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were analyzed in 520 patients admitted for COVID-19 between March 20, 2020 and May 5, 2020. SIRS, qSOFA, and NEWS scoring was applied to each patient based on their admission characteristics. Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) analyses were completed to assess the predictive accuracy for in-hospital mortality. The need for ICU level of care was evaluated as a secondary composite outcome. Univariate regression analyses were completed to assess the predictive function of each scoring threshold. RESULTS Of 520 patients enrolled, 57.5% were male. Of the cohort, 53.8% were Hispanic, 33.3% were African American, 5.8% were Asian, and 7.3% were Caucasian. Mean age was 61.6 years of age. A total of 182 patients (35%) died in hospital. 179 patients (34.4%) required ICU level of care. NEWS demonstrated the greatest discrimination for in-hospital mortality (AUC 0.716 [95% CI, 0.671-0.762]) and ICU admission (AUC 0.641 [95% CI, 0.591-0.691]). The predictive ability of SIRS criteria was more modest for in-hospital mortality (AUC 0.611 [95% CI, 0.560-0.662]) and ICU admission (AUC 0.571 [95% CI, 0.520-0.622]). qSOFA demonstrated the least discrimination for in-hospital mortality (AUC 0.534 [95% CI, 0.479-0.588]) and ICU admission (AUC 0.545 [95% CI, 0.491-0.599]). A mortality rate of 59.76% was observed in patients with a NEWS score  5 (OR 3.354 [95% CI, 2.213-5.083]). Likewise, a mortality rate of 56.48% was observed in patients with a SIRS score  2 (OR 1.77 [95% CI, 1.21-2.59]), while a mortality rate of 30.33% was observed in patients with a qSOFA score  2 (OR 2.124 [95% CI, 1.442-3.129]).

METHODS A diverse multidisciplinary research team conducted this qualitative study with 3 focus groups, including 17 rural medical educators recruited nationwide, 10 African American alumni of a rural medical education pipeline in Alabama, and 5 community and institutional associates of this pipeline. Analysis of recorded transcripts generated themes fitting an ecological model suggesting concerns and intervention foci at individual, community, and institutional levels. FINDINGS Three major themes operating at all ecological levels were: (1) How \\"rural minority student\\" is defined, with \\"rural\\" often supplanting race to indicate minority status; (2) Multiple factors relate to rural racial minority student recruitment and success, including personal relationships with peers, mentors, and role models and supportive institutional policies and culturally competent faculty; and (3) Challenges to recruitment and retention of rural minority students, especially financial concerns and preparation for medical education. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that individuals, communities, and institutions provide intervention points for planning medical education specific to southern rural African Americans. These spheres of influence project a need for partnership among communities and rural medical educators to affect broad programmatic and policy changes that address the dire shortage of rural African American health professionals to help ameliorate health inequities experienced in their home communities.

CO2 absorbents efficiency was tested by flowing 160 mL/min CO2 into the tip of a 2 L balloon that was ventilated with an ADU anesthesia machine (GE, Madison, WI, USA) with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 10/min while running an O2/air FGF of 300 mL/min. After the 1020 mL refillable container was filled with a known volume of CO2 absorbent (derived from weighing the initial canister content and the product's density), the time for the inspired CO2 concentration (FICO2) to rise to 0.5% was measured. This test was repeated 4 times for each product. Because the two SpiraLith Ca? products (one with and one without indicator) are delivered as a cartridge, they had to be tested using their proprietary canister. The time (min) for FICO2 to reach 0.5% was normalized to 100 mL of product, and defined as the efficiency, which was compared amongst the different brands using ANOVA. Efficiency ranged from 50 to 100 min per 100 mL of product, and increased with increasing NaOH content (a catalyst), the exception being SpiraLith Ca? cartridge with color indicator (performing as well as the most efficient granular products) and the SpiraLith Ca? cartridge without color indicator (outperforming all others). Results indicated a spherical or bullet shape is less efficient in absorbing CO2 than broken fragments or cylinders, which in turn is less efficient than a hemispherical (disc) shape, which is in turn less efficient than a solid cartridge with a molded channel geometry. The efficiency of Ca(OH)2 based CO2 absorbent differs up to 100% on a volume basis. Macroscopic arrangement (cylindrical wrap with preformed channels versus granules), chemical composition (NaOH content), and granular shape all affect efficiency per volume of product.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to introduce the application of a comprehensive high-stakes online exam to final-year dental students during the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate its effectiveness. DESIGN: A high-stakes exam was introduced and implemented online to the final-year dental students prior to their graduation. The exam consisted of four components: MEQs, MCQs, OSCE and an oral exam. The exam and invigilation were conducted using Blackboard and MS Teams programs. Stakeholders views of the exam were obtained using two tailored surveys, one for students and another for faculty; both included closed- and open-ended questions. RESULTS: The exam was run successfully without untoward events. Both students and staff were satisfied with the online exam with the latter being more satisfied than the former. Students with previous experience in online learning system were more satisfied with the online exam compared with those with less experience (p < 0.05). The main issues raised by students satisfaction with the exam were: inadequacy of time for the MEQ part, prevention of back tracking in the MCQ part and minor technological issues, whereas those raised by faculty members were increased time required to complete the exam setup and grading compared to the paper-based exam and minor technological issues. CONCLUSIONS: A newly introduced, multi-format, online high-stakes exam was implemented successfully to final-year dental students with minor technological issues and good satisfaction by students and staff alike.","output":"Introducing a comprehensive high-stake online exam to final-year dental students during the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluation of its effectiveness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Propofol has been widely used in the ICU for sedation and refractory status epilepticus. PRIS is a serious and potentially fatal condition that is characterized by a spectrum of clinical symptoms and abnormalities. Literature suggests that a longer duration of propofol  48 hours or a dose  83 mcg/kg/min is associated with a higher risk of PRIS. Many of the critically ill patients in our health system required a larger dose of propofol and prolonged duration of infusion for sedation in the ICU, especially during Covid-19. Delayed treatment of PRIS can lead to death. It is very likely that patients who develop PRIS may often go unrecognized as the manifestations of PRIS can overlap with common ICU conditions. The current prevalence of PRIS is unknown, however, a prospective study has reported a prevalence of 1.1% in critically ill patients. METHODS: Patients were identified by querying the NYU Langone Health COVID clinical data mart from March 2020 till February 2021. The inclusion criteria included patients receiving propofol infusion for  48 hours or receiving a dose  60 mcg/kg/min for more than 24 hours. Pregnant patients, children, and patients with rhabdomyolysis prior to the start of infusion were excluded. PRIS was defined by the development of metabolic acidosis and cardiac dysfunction with 2 or more minor criteria (rhabdomyolysis, hypertriglyceridemia, renal failure, and hepatic transaminitis) or developing 3 or more minor criteria. RESULTS: 424 patients were included in our study. Of the 424 patients, 21 patients were found to have developed PRIS. The occurrence of PRIS was observed at the median infusion rate of 36.1 mcg/kg/min and a median duration of infusion of 147 hours. The prevalence of PRIS was found to be 4.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PRIS in our study was found to be 4.9%. The occurrence of PRIS was observed at the median infusion rate of 36.1 mcg/kg/min suggesting that PRIS can be developed at a lower rate of infusion than previously reported. We suggest that patients - especially those receiving a duration  48 hours and a higher dose of 60 mcg/kg/min - should be monitored for signs and symptoms of PRIS during propofol infusion as it may be underrecognized because PRIS is characterized by multiple clinical manifestations that overlap with critical illness.","output":"Prevalence of propofol infusion syndrome in critically ill patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To-date, COVID-19 pandemic affected >85 million persons worldwide with 14% severe and 5% critical, and a general population case-fatality rate of 1%.

The surge in cases and deaths clearly shows that the preventive and management measures are ineffective and that policy makers lack a complete understanding of the dynamics of the disease. Most of the deaths in Ghana are due to lack of adequate health equipment and facilities for managing the disease. Knowledge of the number of cases in advance would aid policy makers in allocating sufficient resources for the effective management of the cases. Methods: A predictive tool is necessary for the effective management and prevention of cases. This study presents a predictive tool that has the ability to accurately forecast the number of cumulative cases. The study applied polynomial and spline models on the COVID-19 data for Ghana, to develop a generalized additive model (GAM) that accurately captures the growth pattern of the cumulative cases. Results: : The spline model and the GAM provide accurate forecast values.

A totally laparoscopic procedure with intracorporeal anastomosis may improve cosmesis because midline- or paraumbilical incisions can be avoided. Here, we investigate the safety of an intracorporeal anastomosis from a technical and oncological perspective. METHODS All patients who underwent right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis between 2003-2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Parameters were duration of surgery, intraoperative blood loss, mortality and morbidity. Adequacy of oncologic resections was scored by resectional margins and number of harvested lymph nodes. RESULTS A total of 162 patients were included with a median age of 69 years (IQR60-76). The duration of surgery was 100 minutes (80-120) and intraoperative blood loss was 30 mL (10-100). Hundred-twenty patients (74%) underwent an oncologic resection. Number of harvested lymph nodes was 12 (9-18). RO-resection was achieved in 100%. Four patients died (2.5%). Postoperative complications were: anastomotic leakage (3.1%; n = 5), ileus (4.9%; n = 8), abscesses (2.5% ; n = 4), wound infection (3.1% ; n = 5) and cardiopulmonary complications (10.5% ; n = 17). Duration of oncological follow-up was 2.5 years (1.3-4.6). Local recurrence and overall survival rates at two years were 0.8% and 85.4%, respectively.

In recent times, a new vein of economic research dealing with the interplay between communicable diseases and economic development has grown. However, pioneering previous research has analysed this issue in a framework where prevention decisions were the outcome of private individual rational choices. This assumption neither seems to hold for least-developed countries, primarily due to a lack of resources, nor for developed countries, where prevention policies are mostly planned by the public authority through its (public) health system, as also well documented by the current COVID-19 crisis. Our aim in this article is twofold. First, we pinpoint the properties of Chakraborty et al.'s (2010, 2016) basic epidemiological equation to fully enlighten its usability in economic-epidemiology modelling. Second, we apply this framework to analyse prevention activities against a range of infectious diseases by endogenous public (rather than private) health expenditures. Our results identify the relationships governing the interplay between-on the one hand-typical epidemiological phenomena, namely invasion (i.e., the tendency of infection to establish in a population) versus endemicity (i.e., the tendency of infection to persist in the long term) and-on the other hand-economic variables, such as capital accumulation, GDP, and taxation. This is done by identifying threshold quantities, depending on both epidemiological and economic parameters, and by bifurcation analysis showing the effects that public intervention can have on previously uncontrolled infectious diseases. Both direct and indirect, that is, partial and general equilibrium, effects of control interventions are identified.","output":"Economic development with deadly communicable diseases and public prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 has undoubtedly impacted the health care system while causing lasting and profound implications for medical education.

DesignUsing a cross-sectional study design, we used shotgun next-generation sequencing (NGS) to evaluate microbiome composition and diversity in both patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed infections presenting to Ventura Clinical Trials for care from March 2020 through January 2021 and SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative exposed controls. Patients were classified as being asymptomatic or having mild, moderate, or severe symptoms based on NIH criteria.1 Exposed controls were individuals with prolonged or repeated close contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection or their samples, e.g. household members of patients or frontline healthcare workers. Microbiome diversity and composition were compared between patients and exposed controls and across patient subgroups at all taxonomic levels. ResultsThere were 52 patients and 20 controls. Compared with controls, patients had significantly less bacterial diversity, a lower abundance of Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium as well as some other bacteria, and a higher abundance of Bacteroides at the genus level. Additionally, there was an inverse association between disease severity and both bacterial diversity and Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium abundance. ConclusionWe hypothesize that low bacterial diversity and depletion of Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium genera either before or after infection led to reduced pro-immune function, thereby allowing SARS-CoV-2 infection to become symptomatic.

Thus, it is critical to understand factors that promote or prevent RDV resistance. We passaged SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of GS-441524, the parent nucleoside of RDV. After 13 passages, we isolated three viral lineages with phenotypic resistance as defined by increases in half-maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) from 2.7-to 10.4-fold. Sequence analysis identified non-synonymous mutations in nonstructural protein 12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp): V166A, N198S, S759A, V792I and C799F/R. Two lineages encoded the S759A substitution at the RdRp Ser(759)-Asp-Asp active motif. In one lineage, the V792I substitution emerged first, then combined with S759A. Introduction of S759A and V792I substitutions at homologous nsp12 positions in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) demonstrated transferability across betacoronaviruses; introduction of these substitutions resulted in up to 38-fold RDV resistance and a replication defect. Biochemical analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp encoding S759A demonstrated a roughly 10-fold decreased preference for RDV-triphosphate (RDV-TP) as a substrate, whereas nsp12-V792I diminished the uridine-triphosphate (UTP) concentration needed to overcome template-dependent inhibition associated with RDV. The in vitro-selected substitutions identified in this study were rare or not detected in the greater than 6 million publicly available nsp12-RdRp consensus sequences in the absence of RDV selection. The results define genetic and biochemical pathways to RDV resistance and emphasize the need for additional studies to define the potential for emergence of these or other RDV resistance mutations in clinical settings.","output":"Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase confer resistance to remdesivir by distinct mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objectives were to identify conditions under which mothers may be willing to use telelactation and explore associations between participant characteristics, willingness, and beliefs regarding telelactation use.

In comparison to the existing local weather models that typically provide weather forecasts for limited geographic areas (e.g., within one country but they are more accurate), ECMWF offers a prediction of the weather phenomena across the world. Another significant benefit of this global NWP model includes the fact, that by using it in several well-known online applications, forecasts are freely available while local models outputs are often paid. Our proposed ECMWF-enhancing model uses a combination of raw ECMWF data and additional input parameters we have identified as useful for ECMWF error estimation and its subsequent correction. The ground truth data used for the training phase of our model consists of real observations from weather stations located in 10 cities across two European countries.

The lateral flow based antigen tests provide fast turnaround of results within minutes, but it's open -faced assay format means that the test operators are more prone to accidental exposure to pathogen-containing samples. The viral inactivation transport media (ITMs) provide much needed protection against exposure to highly transmissive live viruses during sample collection, transport, and storage. However, the current ITMs were designed for PCR tests and share a harsh chemical formulation that denatures protein analytes, making them incompatible with antigen tests. We developed an innovative viral transport media that is designed for a variety of tests, such as antigen testing and PCR. The new formulation can be used to safely inactivate SARS-CoV-2 virus while maintaining compatibility with many different formats beyond rt-PCR. DESIGN To evaluate the viral inactivation performance of the novel inactivation transport media formulation, a cytopathic effect assay was conducted using VERO E6 cells in presence of SARS-CoV-2 samples incubated in our novel formulation and log reduction were reported. To assess its compatibility with different SARS-CoV-2 related assays, the novel formulation was used as inactivation transport media in antigen, PCR, and NGS based Swab-Seq tests with known controls. RESULTS The results for the inactivation study confirmed > 3.0 log reduction in viral titer after 30 min exposure in novel transport media formulation and demonstrated 99.5% effectiveness in SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. The results for the PCR and antigen test compatibility studies showed comparable and/or superior performance in detection limits for the novel formulation when compared to other sample media. The Swab-Seq result offers preliminary support on the novel formulation's compatibility with NGS based assays. CONCLUSION Using a novel viral transport medium, we were able to completely inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The new formulation was compatible with both nucleic acid and protein assays while protecting cells from infection. This viral transport media could allow more test types to be done from a single specimen, resulting in safer and reliable outcomes.

This study was aimed to assess the magnitude of cultural malpractice and associated factors during childbirth and postpartum among women who gave birth within one year in Gozamen district, Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from November 1st to December 30th, 2019. A two-stage sampling technique was used to get a total of 600 women who gave birth within the last one year. Data were collected by using a semi-structured and pretested questionnaire. Then, data were entered into Epi info version 7.0 and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Both bivariate analysis and a multivariable logistic regression model were fitted. The level of significance was declared based on the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) and a p-value of 0.05. RESULT: The Overall magnitude of cultural malpractices during childbirth and postpartum was found to be 31.2% (95%CI: 27.8, 34.7).

RESULTS: Our model predicts that after 180 days, with a transmission constant of 1.219e-4 new infections/person2, weekly COVID-19 testing of health care workers would reduce new health care worker and patient infections by approximately 3%-5.9%, and biweekly testing would reduce infections in both by 1%-2.1%. At a transmission constant of 3.660e-4 new infections/person2, weekly testing would reduce infections by 11%-23% and biweekly testing would reduce infections by 5.5%-13%. At a lower transmission constant of 4.067e-5 new infections/person2, weekly and biweekly COVID-19 testing for health care workers would result in an approximately 1% and 0.5%-0.8% reduction in infections, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Periodic COVID-19 testing for emergency department staff in regions that are heavily affected by COVID-19 or are facing resource constraints may significantly reduce COVID-19 transmission among health care workers and previously uninfected patients.","output":"Evaluating the Need for Routine COVID-19 Testing of Emergency Department Staff: Quantitative Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Staple line leakage and bleeding are worrisome complications of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG).

Because the use of fibrin sealant has shown a possible benefit in reducing the reoperation rate due to early complication in patients (pts) undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP), this solution has been tested in 100 consecutive pts undergoing LSG. A clinical trial has been performed on 100 consecutive pts. Exclusion criteria from the study were considered ASA IV pts, treated or untreated malignancies at any stage, steroids or FANS assumption, previous sovramesocolic surgery and conversion to open surgery. All pts were randomized to receive (group A, 50 pts) or to not receive (group B, 50 pts) 4 ml of human fibrin sealant (Tisseel?, Baxter(?) Deerfield, IL, USA) sprayed along the suture line. Primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative complications: leaks, bleeding of the staple line or stenosis of the gastric remnant. Significance was assigned at a p level <0.05. By considering pts in group A vs. pts in group B our results shown no significant difference in fistulas or strictures occurrence (p = 0.2). Bleeding was significantly higher in patients not sprayed with sealant (group A vs. group B, 1/7, p = 0.03). This randomized trial has so far shown the use of fibrin sealant in LSG to significantly reduce postoperative bleeding.

METHODS: In this prospective observational study, a trained research team observed the dispensary teams of 12 community pharmacies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), 6 of which were operating virtual pharmacy care. A standardized data collection form was used to include information about dispensing of OTC medicines and pharmacist interventions on those with abuse/misuse potential. The clinical significance of the interventions was evaluated by a multidisciplinary committee. RESULTS: The frequency of pharmacist interventions on OTC medicines with abuse potential across pharmacies with and without virtual services was 83.2% versus 91.0%, respectively, whereas the frequency of pharmacist interventions on OTC medicines with misuse potential across pharmacies with and without virtual services was 79.8% versus 41.2%, respectively. The proportions of clinically significant interventions across pharmacies with and without virtual services were 19.7% versus 10.5%, respectively. Cough medicines were dispensed significantly more across pharmacies with virtual care than across pharmacies without virtual care (25.6% vs. 9.7%, respectively; P = 0.04). Asking the patient to seek the advice of an addiction specialist (adjusted odds ratio = 4.11; P = 0.001) versus refusing to sell the drug was more likely to be associated with pharmacies with virtual services than with pharmacies operating traditional pharmacy services. CONCLUSION: Virtual pharmaceutical care is a potential approach to reduce the abuse/misuse of OTC medicines but needs some improvements regarding detection of these cases.

METHODS: Rapid review, drawing on the World Health Organization's (WHO) methodology for developing interim guidelines during health emergencies. PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central and Campbell Collaboration searched up to mid-April 2020. Searches were supplemented by reference-searching and expert recommendations. Searches were designed to identify: (1) systematic reviews (<10 years), or (2) primary intervention studies (no date limit) reporting evidence on anti-stigma interventions (in relation to COVID-19 or other infectious/stigmatised conditions) or (3) additional relevant materials. Data were extracted on population, intervention, outcome and results. These data were compiled into evidence summary tables and narrative overviews. Recommendations on strategies for COVID-19 stigma-reduction were developed using the WHO 'Evidence to Decision' framework approach. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (registration ID: CRD42020177677). RESULTS: The searches identified a total of 4150 potentially relevant records, from which 12 systematic reviews and 29 additional articles were included. Overarching considerations and specific recommendations focus on: (1) language/words used in relation to COVID-19 and affected people; (2) media/journalistic practices; (3) public health interventions; (4) targeted public health interventions for key groups and (5) involving communities and key stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations represent the first consolidated evidence-based guidance on stigma and discrimination reduction in relation to COVID-19. Mitigating the impact of stigma is critical in reducing distress and negative experiences, and strengthening communities' resolve to work together during exceptional circumstances. Ultimately, reducing stigma helps addressing structural inequalities that drive marginalisation and exacerbate both health risks and the impact of stigma.

While public health interventions and provincially regulated health insurance coverage have been credited with minimizing transmission rates in Canada relative to neighboring countries, disease presentation has been presumed to be the same. Aim: We sought to determine factors associated with differences in gastrointestinal outcomes in COVID-19 patients at a Canadian hospital. Methods: We collected data from 192 hospital records of COVID-19 patients across seven Hamilton Health Sciences hospitals, a network of academic health centers located in Hamilton, Ontario serving one of the largest metropolitan areas in Canada. Statistical and correlative analysis of symptoms, comorbidities, and mortality were performed. Results: There were 192 patients. The mean age was 57.6 years (SD=21.0). For patients who died (n=27, 14%), mean age was 79.2 years old (SD=10.6) versus 54 years for survivors (SD=20.1). There was a higher mortality among patients with older age (p=0.000), long hospital stay (p=0.004), male patients (p=0.032), and patients in nursing homes (p=0.000). Patients with dyspnea (p=0.028) and hypertension (p=0.004) were more likely to have a poor outcome. Laboratory test values that were significant in determining outcomes were an elevated INR (p=0.007) and elevated creatinine (p=0.000). Cough and hypertension were the most common symptom and comorbidity, respectively. Diarrhea was the most prevalent (14.5%) gastrointestinal symptom. Impaired liver function was related to negative outcome (LR 5.6; p=0.018).

To address this, the present meta-analysis examined the predictive validity of Harkin and Kessler's (2011b) executive function, binding complexity, and memory load (EBL) Classification System concerning affected versus unaffected memory performance in OCD. We employed a multilevel meta-analytic approach (Viechtbauer, 2010) to accommodate the interdependent nature of the EBL model and interdependency of effect sizes (305 effect sizes from 144 studies, including 4,424 OCD patients). Results revealed that the EBL model predicted memory performance; that is, as EBL demand increases, those with OCD performed progressively worse on memory tasks. Executive function was the driving mechanism behind the EBL's impact on OCD memory performance, as it negated binding complexity, memory load, and visual or verbal task differences. Comparisons of subtask effect sizes were also generally in accord with the cognitive parameters of the EBL taxonomy.

Functional assays with both reporter transfections as well as with SARS-CoV-2 infections revealed that specific segments of the SARS-CoV-2 5-untranslated region can be efficiently accessed by specific antisense-circRNAs, resulting in up to 90% reduction of virus proliferation in cell culture, and with a durability of at least 48 h. Presenting the antisense sequence within a circRNA clearly proved more efficient than in the corresponding linear configuration and is superior to modified antisense oligonucleotides.

METHODS: This ecological study concerns the raw number of deaths reported from February 1 to April 30, 2020 and the mean number of deaths occurred during the same months from 2015 to 2019, per province. Information on socioeconomic factors and healthcare settings was extracted from updated databases on the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) website. A multivariate model and four multilevel models were constructed to test the association between excess mortality and the analysed indicators across 107 Italian provinces. RESULTS: The hospitalization rate in long-term care wards and the cardiovascular disease mortality rate correlate positively with excess mortality (p <0.05), while higher densities of licensed physicians and of general practitioners are associated with lower excess mortality (p <0.05). After controlling for the COVID-19 cumulative incidence in each province, only the density of licensed physicians remains negatively associated with excess mortality (p <0.01). CONCLUSION: Some health and healthcare variables (in particular, the density of physicians) are strongly associated with excess mortality during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and should be targeted to increase the resilience of health systems.","output":"Health and healthcare variables associated with Italy's excess mortality during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: An ecological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to describe the use of masks among health care personnel (HCP) exposed to index cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to evaluate any association with infection rate. METHODS: We did a retrospective, observational study of HCP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University for the management of COVID-19 (before person-to-person transmission was official confirmed, no additional protection was provided). A questionnaire was given to all staff listed on the roster in the clinical regions providing care for index patients with COVID-19. All participants were surveyed regarding hand-washing and use of surgical masks and gloves and were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Data were analysed (Student's t test and Pearson &#967;2 test) for an association between infection and use of personal protective equipment. RESULTS: Exposure of a total of 299 non-infected and 30 infected staff was confirmed. None of the 149 staff who reported use of all three preventative measures (hand-washing and use of gloves and masks) became infect-ed. In contrast, all 30 of the staff who became infected had omitted at least one of the measures. Fewer staff who wore surgical masks (P=0.000003) became infected compared with those who did not. Infections rates were significantly lower in HCP from the internal medicine departments, as these personnel generally wore masks. CONCLUSION: An association was found between SARS-CoV-2 infection of HCP and the non-use of masks when working with index cases in clinical settings. We recommend that all HCP follow the strict instructions for prevention and treatment of nosocomial infection during intimate contact with COVID-19, especially staff from surgical departments.","output":"Surgical Masks for Protection of Health Care Personnel Against Covid-19: Results from an Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) affects >33 000 000 individuals, mostly from low- and middle-income countries.

METHODS: As the Cape Town Declaration formed the basis for which the Cardiac Surgery Intersociety Alliance (CSIA) was formed, the purpose of this article is to describe the history of the CSIA, its formation, ongoing activities and future directions, including the announcement of selected pilot sites. RESULTS: The CSIA is an international alliance consisting of representatives from major cardiothoracic surgical societies and the World Heart Federation. Activities have included meetings at annual conferences, exhibit hall participation for advertisement and recruitment and publication of selection criteria for cardiac surgery centres to apply for CSIA support. Criteria focused on local operating capacity, local championing, governmental and facility support, appropriate identification of a specific gap in care and desire to engage in future research. Eleven applications were received for which 3 finalist sites were selected and site visits conducted.

This study aimed to investigate NET-related genes, their clinical prognostic value and their correlation with immunotherapy and anticancer drugs in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Methods: Differentially expressed NET-related genes in HNSCC were identified based on multiple public databases. To improve the clinical practicability and avoid overfitting, univariable, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariable Cox algorithms were used to construct a prognostic risk model. A nomogram was further used to explore the clinical value of the model. Internal and external validation were conducted to test the model. Furthermore, the immune microenvironment, immunophenoscore (IPS) and sensitivity to anticancer drugs in HNSCC patients with different prognostic risks were explored. Results: Six NET-related genes were screened to construct the risk model. In the training cohort, KaplanCMeier (K-M) analysis showed that the overall survival (OS) of low-risk HNSCC patients was significantly better than that of high-risk HNSCC patients (p < 0.001). The nomogram also showed a promising prognostic value with a better C-index (0.726 vs 0.640) and area under the curve (AUC) (0.743 vs 0.706 at 3 years, 0.743 vs 0.645 at 5 years) than those in previous studies. Calibration plots and decision curve analysis (DCA) also showed the satisfactory predictive capacity of the nomogram. Internal and external validation further strengthened the credibility of the clinical prognostic model. The level of tumor mutational burden (TMB) in the high-risk group was significantly higher than that in the low-risk group (p = 0.017), and the TMB was positively correlated with the risk score (R = 0.11; p = 0.019). Moreover, the difference in immune infiltration was significant in HNSCC patients with different risks (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the IPS analysis indicated that anti-PD-1 (p < 0.001), anti-CTLA4 (p < 0.001) or combining immunotherapies (p < 0.001) were more beneficial for low-risk HNSCC patients. The response to anticancer drugs was also closely correlated with the expression of NET-related genes (p < 0.001).

Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional online survey was circulated using an anonymous and self-reporting questionnaire via Google form with a consent form appended to it. Results: Four hundred twenty-two physicians participated (62.80% medical doctors, 33.65% seniors, and 3.55% residents). The proportion of stethoscope and non Infrared thermometer disinfections after every use was 13.9% (95%CI: 10.9-17.6) and 20.4% (95%CI: 16.7-24.5), respectively.

We posit current infection control guidelines generally protect HCP from SARS-CoV-2 infection in a healthcare setting. METHODS: In this retrospective case series, we use viral genomics to investigate the likely source of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCP at a major academic medical institution in the Upper Midwest of the United States between 25 March - 27 December, 2020. We obtain limited epidemiological data through informal interviews and review of the electronic health record. We combine epidemiological information with healthcare-associated viral sequences and with viral sequences collected in the broader community to infer the most likely source of infection in HCP. RESULTS: We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters involving 95 HCP and 137 possible patient contact sequences. The majority of HCP infections could not be linked to a patient or co-worker (55/95; 57.9%) and were genetically similar to viruses circulating concurrently in the community. We found 10.5% of infections could be traced to a coworker (10/95). Strikingly, only 4.2% of HCP infections could be traced to a patient source (4/95). CONCLUSIONS: Infections among HCP add further strain to the healthcare system and put patients, HCP, and communities at risk. We found no evidence for healthcare-associated transmission in the majority of HCP infections evaluated here. Though we cannot rule out the possibility of cryptic healthcare-associated transmission, it appears that HCP most commonly becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2 via community exposure.

Among these is the Capacity-Building and Mentorship Partnership (CBMP) Programme in collaboration with public universities in Ethiopia since November 2017. This study aims to evaluate the outcomes and share experiences of the country in working with universities to strengthen the national HIS. METHODS: The study employed a mixed-methods approach that included 247 health organizations (health offices and facilities) of CBMP-implementing woredas (districts) and 23 key informant interviews. The programme focused on capacity-building and mentoring facilities and woreda health offices. The status of HIS was measured using a connected woreda checklist before and after the intervention. The checklist consists of items related to HIS infrastructure, data quality and administrative use. The organizations were classified as emerging, candidate or model based on the score. The findings were triangulated with qualitative data collected through key informant interviews. RESULTS: The results showed that the overall score of the HIS implementation was 46.3 before and 74.2 after implementation of the programme. The proportion of model organizations increased from 1.2% before to 31.8% after the programme implementation. The health systemCuniversity partnership has provided an opportunity for higher education institutions to understand the health system and tune their curricula to address real-world challenges. The partnership brought opportunities to conduct and produce local- and national-level evidence to improve the HIS.

Research Question The goal of this meta-analysis was to summarize the evidence regarding the prognostic relevance of cardiac biomarkers from data available in published reports. Study Design and Methods PubMed was searched from inception through April 2020 for studies comparing median values of cardiac biomarkers in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, or patients who died versus those who survived. The weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between the groups were calculated for each study and combined using a random effects meta-analysis model. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality based on cardiac injury was combined from studies reporting it. Results Troponin levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients who died or were critically ill versus those who were alive or not critically ill (WMD 0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.71, p&lt;0.001). Cardiac injury was independently associated with significantly increased odds of mortality (OR 6.641, 95% CI 1.26 - 35.1, p=0.03). No difference in BNP was seen between the two groups. A significant difference in levels of D-dimer was seen in those who died or were critically ill.

METHODS: We identified 48 440 adult patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis from 1 January 2020 to 21 October 2020, with at least three exercise vital sign measurements from 19 March 2018 to 18 March 2020. We linked each patient's self-reported physical activity category (consistently inactive=0-10 min/week, some activity=11-149 min/week, consistently meeting guidelines=150+ min/week) to the risk of hospitalisation, ICU admission and death after COVID-19 diagnosis. We conducted multivariable logistic regression controlling for demographics and known risk factors to assess whether inactivity was associated with COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 who were consistently inactive had a greater risk of hospitalisation (OR 2.26; 95% CI 1.81 to 2.83), admission to the ICU (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.18 to 2.55) and death (OR 2.49; 95% CI 1.33 to 4.67) due to COVID-19 than patients who were consistently meeting physical activity guidelines.

The Nrf2 pathway is believed to be a component of the anti-aging program responsible for the healthspan and longevity. Nrf2 enables stress adaptation by activating cell antioxidant defense and other metabolic processes via control of expression of over 200 target genes in response to various types of stress. The GSK3 system represents a regulating valve that controls fine oscillations in the Nrf2 level, unlike Keap1, which prevents significant changes in the Nrf2 content in the absence of oxidative stress and which is inactivated by the oxidative stress. Furthermore, GSK3 modifies core circadian clock proteins (Bmal1, Clock, Per, Cry, and Rev-erb). Phosphorylation by GSK3 leads to the inactivation and degradation of circadian rhythm-activating proteins (Bmal1 and Clock) and vice versa to the activation and nuclear translocation of proteins suppressing circadian rhythms (Per and Rev-erb) with the exception of Cry protein, which is likely to be implicated in the fine tuning of biological clock. Functionally, GSK3 appears to be one of the hubs in the cross-regulation of circadian rhythms and antioxidant defense. Here, we present the data on the crosstalk between the most powerful cell antioxidant mechanism, the Nrf2 system, and the biorhythm-regulating system in mammals, including the impact of GSK3 overexpression and knockout on the Nrf2 signaling. Understanding the interactions between the regulatory cascades linking homeostasis maintenance and cell response to oxidative stress will help in elucidating molecular mechanisms that underlie aging and longevity.","output":"A Crosstalk between the Biorhythms and Gatekeepers of Longevity: Dual Role of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 global pandemic starting in January 2020 disrupted international collaborations in scholarly exchange, reducing mobility and connections across the globe.

However, findings indicate variation among locations in the capacity for detection of imported cases. Singapore has had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing capacity during previous infectious disease outbreaks and has consistently shown high sensitivity of case-detection during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We used a Bayesian modelling approach to estimate the relative capacity for detection of imported cases of COVID-19 for 194 locations (excluding China) compared with that for Singapore. We also built a simple mathematical model of the point prevalence of infection in visitors to an epicentre relative to that in residents. FINDINGS: The weighted global ability to detect Wuhan-to-location imported cases of COVID-19 was estimated to be 38% (95% highest posterior density interval [HPDI] 22-64) of Singapore's capacity. This value is equivalent to 28 (95% HPDI 15-44) times the current number of imported and reported cases that could have been detected if all locations had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore was 40% (95% HPDI 22-67) among locations with high surveillance capacity, 37% (18-68) among locations with medium surveillance capacity, and 11% (0-42) among locations with low surveillance capacity. Treating all travellers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travellers in Wuhan) contributed modestly to underestimation of prevalence. INTERPRETATION: Estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of 100% detection in travellers could have been underestimated by several fold. Furthermore, severity estimates will be inflated several fold since they also rely on case count estimates. Finally, our model supports evidence that underdetected cases of COVID-19 have probably spread in most locations around the world, with greatest risk in locations of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicentre of the outbreak.

Studies indicate a worsening of mental health in Spain in the years of economic crisis, especially in men. Working conditions (unemployment, low wages, instability, precariousness) emerge as one of the main channels through which mental health is put at risk or deteriorates. This deterioration occurs with intensity in particularly vulnerable groups, such as immigrant population and families with economic burdens. In the case of suicides, the results were inconclusive. Regarding the use of health care services, an increase in the consumption of certain drugs seems to be identified, although the conclusions of all the studies are not coincidental. Social inequalities in mental health do not seem to have remitted. We conclude that Spain needs to improve information systems to a better understanding of the health effects of economic crises.

Background The MSCs possess trophic potentialities which enable them to find out the sites of injury or inflammation and because of their pleiotropic and pericytic nature, these cells are capable of differentiating into different cell types. The MSCs can be derived from a variety of tissue sources be it adult or embryonic origin. The one major characteristic of MSCs is that they are immunologically na?ve in terms of expression of MHC Class II. This very low or no expression of MHC class II makes them useful in clinical settings where they can be used in allogenic transplant cases. This allogenic transplant possibilities of these MSCs makes them one of the most researched stem cells and investigated for cell-based therapies. Though these MSCs are in clinical settings for long the one even more important characteristic which makes them even more in demand is their immunomodulatory properties which have been used in various cases to mitigate the effect of overstimulation of the immune system. In recent times after the pandemic of the novel corona virus disease 2019 (nCOVID-19) generated by SARS-CoV-2, the effect of various MSCs isolated from various tissue sources are being utilized to curb the overstimulation of immune response, so that the immune system can be brought under some regulation to ultimately reduce the effect of inflammation.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesise evidence on the prevalence of NCDs among Syrian refugees residing in neighbouring host countries. STUDY DESIGN: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: The review was carried out in line with PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO CRD420201970430).

The establishment of a persistent infection and the subsequent demyelinating disease triggered by the virus depend on the expression of L*, a viral accessory protein encoded by an alternative open reading frame of the virus. We discovered that L* potently inhibits the interferon-inducible OAS/RNase L pathway. The antagonism of RNase L by L* was particularly prominent in macrophages where baseline oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and RNase L expression levels are elevated, but was detectable in fibroblasts after IFN pretreatment. L* mutations significantly affected Theiler's virus replication in primary macrophages derived from wild-type but not from RNase L-deficient mice. L* counteracted the OAS/RNase L pathway through direct interaction with the ankyrin domain of RNase L, resulting in the inhibition of this enzyme. Interestingly, RNase L inhibition was species-specific as Theiler's virus L* protein blocked murine RNase L but not human RNase L or RNase L of other mammals or birds. Direct RNase L inhibition by L* and species specificity were confirmed in an in vitro assay performed with purified proteins. These results demonstrate a novel viral mechanism to elude the antiviral OAS/RNase L pathway.

The areas under the ROC curves of IgM and IgG were 0.988 and 1.000, respectively. Specific antibody detection has good sensitivity and specificity. Detection of specific antibodies in patients with fever can be a good distinction between COVID-19 and other diseases, so as to be a complement to nucleic acid diagnosis to early diagnosis of suspected cases.","output":"Serological detection of 2019-nCoV respond to the epidemic: A useful complement to nucleic acid testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Diabetes has been found to be one of the leading comorbidities associated with fatality in COVID-19 patients.

This study described the clinical characteristics of children admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and explored factors associated with the need for invasive ventilation or mortality. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective, cohort study was conducted over eight medical centers, including all patients younger than 18 years of age and admitted to the ICU due to a direct consequence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients who were admitted to the ICU for any alternate reason and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by screening test, and patients who were admitted due to multi-inflammatory syndrome in children, were excluded. Demographic, laboratory, imaging, and clinical data were collected. Descriptive statistics were used to compare survivors and non-survivors. Fine and Gray's hazard model was used to estimate the association between clinical variables and ICU death. RESULTS: During the study period, 25 pediatric COVID-19 patients received care in the ICUs. The median age was 2.78 years (IQR 0.21-8.51), and 60% were male. Only three patients were reported to be previously healthy at admission. Nine (36%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, including two were on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Four (16%) patients died during ICU care. In univariate analysis, the presence of comorbidity (HR 0.0001; 95%CI 0.00001-0.00016), platelets count (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98-0.99), elevated procalcitonin (HR 1.05; 95%CI 1.016-1.09), and circulatory compromise (HR 16.34; 95%CI 1.99-134.35), all at the time of ICU admission, were associated with in-ICU mortality. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that children admitted to the ICU with SARS-CoV-2 infection, generally, have a favorable outcome. Low platelets count, elevated procalcitonin, presence of comorbidity, and shock at the time of ICU admission were associated with death.

Firstly, the vaccination status and demographic characteristics of all healthcare personnel was evaluated. After that, a survey was applied to 408 vaccinated and 297 nonvaccinated personnel. Within the first month after the beginning of vaccination, 66% of 3937 healthcare personnel received a COVID-19 vaccine. The number of vaccinated personnel was higher among doctors, master graduates or higher educational levels and basic science-laboratory unit workers.

This investment could contribute to progress on the SDGs and global climate targets insofar as it was invested within a framework that supports both socio-economic recovery and sustainability. Initial analysis indicates that investments for economic recovery did not sufficiently address food security and sustainability, concentrating instead on immediate economic risk management. The global sustainable development agenda must promote the resilience and sustainability of food systems through policies and measures that: i) account for environmental thresholds and trade-offs;ii) promote food security and healthy diets;iii) enhance and protect rural livelihoods;and iv) address the inequalities and injustices that have emerged and will prevail during a post-COVID transition.

Here, we report that interleukin-4 (IL-4) promotes oligodendrocyte regeneration and remyelination. IL-4 receptor expression was detected in a variety of glial cells after ischemic brain injury, including oligodendrocyte lineage cells. IL-4 deficiency in knockout mice resulted in greater deterioration of white matter over 14 d after stroke. Consistent with these findings, intranasal delivery of IL-4 nanoparticles after stroke improved white matter integrity and attenuated long-term sensorimotor and cognitive deficits in wild-type mice, as revealed by histological immunostaining, electron microscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and electrophysiology. The selective effect of IL-4 on remyelination was verified in an ex vivo organotypic model of demyelination. By leveraging primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), microglia-depleted mice, and conditional OPC-specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR) knockout mice, we discovered a direct salutary effect of IL-4 on oligodendrocyte differentiation that was mediated by the PPAR axis. Our findings reveal a new regenerative role of IL-4 in the central nervous system (CNS), which lies beyond its known immunoregulatory functions on microglia/macrophages or peripheral lymphocytes.

METHOD: This trend study analysed weekly cross-sectional surveys of probabilistic samples of students from the University of British Columbia for 13 weeks, through the first wave of COVID-19. The main variable assessed was propinquity of COVID-19, defined as knowing someone who tested positive for COVID-19, which was specified at different levels: knowing someone anywhere globally, in Canada, in Vancouver, in their course or at home. Proximity was included in multivariable linear regressions to assess its association with primary outcomes, including 30-day symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. RESULTS: Of 1388 respondents (adjusted response rate of 50%), 5.6% knew someone with COVID-19 in Vancouver, 0.8% in their course and 0.3% at home. Ten percent were overwhelmed and unable to access help.

METHOD OF STUDY Female beagle dogs (n = 4) were immunized with physical mixture of E. coli-expressed recombinant porcine ZP3 with promiscuous T cell epitope of tetanus toxoid (TT-KK-pZP3) and porcine ZP4 with promiscuous T cell epitope of bovine RNase (bRNase-KK-pZP4), or with a fusion protein encompassing dog ZP3 fragment and two copies of GnRH with appropriate promiscuous T cell epitopes (dZP3-GnRH2 ); control animals received only alum, the adjuvant. The immunized animals were followed-up for antibody titres by ELISA as well as for fertility status subsequent to mating with male dogs. RESULTS Active immunization of female dogs following a 3 injections schedule at four-week intervals with a physical mixture of TT-KK-pZP3 + bRNase-KK-pZP4 as well as dZP3-GnRH2 , led to generation of significant antibody titres against respective recombinant proteins. Active immunization with dZP3-GnRH2 also led to generation of antibodies reactive with both dZP3 and GnRH. A booster dose on day 383 led to an increase in antibody titres and circulating antibodies against respective recombinant proteins could be observed on day 528. Antibodies in immune serum samples from dogs immunized with TT-KK-pZP3 + bRNase-KK-pZP4 or dZP3-GnRH2 reacted with native canine ZP as assessed by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Mating studies revealed a reduced number of pregnancies as well as a significant reduction in the number of pups born in the female dogs immunized with dZP3-GnRH2 as compared to the adjuvanted control. Curtailment of pregnancy in dZP3-GnRH2 immunized group was associated with antibody titres against dZP3-GnRH2 . However, immunization with recombinant TT-KK-pZP3 + bRNase-KK-pZP4 did not significantly decrease the number of pups born as compared to the adjuvanted control.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the viral removal from wastewater treatment technologies, also considering wastewater physicochemical properties based on a bibliometric-statistical review. A preliminary bibliometric analysis (keywords co-occurrence) using VOS viewer (n = 698 scientific publications) was established. Moreover, systematic constraining criteria (1983C2021) limiting the statistical study to 93 scientific publications were carried out. Variance Analysis (ANOVA-2 ways) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were used to identify the most influential wastewater treatment typology and parameters affecting viral removal. Bibliometric results showed that at least 25% of the studies on viral removal from wastewater corresponded to the last 2 years. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 was approached in a particular way. Thus, more than 15 viruses and/or genotypes and more than 20 specific/non-specific technologies for viral removal were statistically analyzed. Results did not report significant differences (p < 0.05) of Log Removal Virus (LRV) between specific (e.g., MBR, chlorination) and non-specific (e.g., activated sludge, anaerobic digestion) technologies.

After LOTUS China, there is probably no future for lopinavir in the treatment of severe COVID-19, but some clinical trials for prevention or in various stages of COVID-19 have recently started or are ongoing. The major limitation of these trials is that as lopinavir does not inhibit COVID-19, it is unlikely to prevent infection, reduce viral load, or reduce the severity.

A wearable chest patch (VitalPatch?, VitalConnect, United States of America, USA) and finger-worn pulse oximeter (WristOx2? 3150, Nonin, USA) were used to estimate and transmit continuous Heart Rate (HR), Respiratory Rate (RR), and peripheral blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO(2)) data from ambulatory patients on these isolation wards to nurse bays remote from these patients, with a view to minimising the risk of infection for nursing staff. Our virtual High-Dependency Unit (vHDU) system used a secure web-based architecture and protocols (HTTPS and encrypted WebSockets) to transmit the vital-sign data in real time from wireless Android tablet devices, operating as patient data collection devices by the bedside in the isolation rooms, into the clinician dashboard interface available remotely via any modern web-browser. Fault-tolerant software strategies were used to reconnect the wearables automatically, avoiding the need for nurses to enter the isolation ward to re-set the patient monitoring equipment. The remote dashboard also displayed the vital-sign observations recorded by the nurses, using a separate electronic observation system, allowing them to review both sources of vital-sign data in one integrated chart. System usage was found to follow the trend of the number of local COVID-19 infections during the first wave of the pandemic in the UK (March to June 2020), with almost half of the patients on the isolation ward monitored with wearables during the peak of hospital admissions in the local area.

It has also had an important impact on the management of banks off-balance-sheet (OBS) innovation. This paper uses unbalanced panel data on 75 commercial banks in China from 2007 to 2017 and combines a theoretical and an empirical model to study the development of bank OBS innovation and bank risk taking from the perspective of new asset management regulations. The analysis finds (1) the rapid development of OBS innovation will increase bank risk taking and (2) the solution to the problem of rigid payments are conducive to reducing the risk taken by Chinese commercial banks when providing OBS innovation.","output":"The impact of Off-Balance-Sheet regulations on bank risk-taking: Evidence from China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rotavirus and Coronavirus are two main causes of severe diarrhea in human infants and many animal species worldwide. Calves up to 3 months old can be affected by these viruses. The importance of these viruses in cattle industry is due to substantial economic loss, treatment costs, and reduced growth rates in beef and dairy calves. Mixed infections caused by Rotavirus and Coronavirus can lead to severe form of diarrhea. In present case-control study, 261 samples of healthy and diarrheic calves from farms around Mashhad were collected. These samples were tested by antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Bio-X diagnosis kit). The results showed that the prevalence of Rotavirus and Coronavirus infection in diarrheic calves is 26.98% and 3.17%, respectively. Also, there was no significant relationship between infection with Rotavirus, Coronavirus, and diarrhea in the studied population.","output":"Evaluation of relationship between Rotavirus and Coronavirus infections with calf diarrhea by capture ELISA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evidence and effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions in treatment of patients with confirmed or suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. Routinely used interventions in physiotherapy imply a very high risk for physiotherapists because the duration of direct contact with patients is quite long. Physiotherapy may need to be administered by weighing the benefit-risk ratio. Therefore, there is a critical and urgent need to adopt alternatives or modified forms of physiotherapy interventions. As the situation for management of COVID-19 in low-resource contexts could differ from that in high resource context, interventions need to be adapted to the available resources and technology in various settings. Tele-physiotherapy could be a viable option for patients who are in acute care in the hospital, in rehabilitation unit or under quarantine at home due to confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Modification in physiotherapy interventions and adjustment in intervention parameters may serve as an alternative strategy. This article describes alternatives to and/or modification of routinely used physiotherapy interventions for achieving maximum patients benefits and minimising therapists exposure in treatment of individuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.","output":"Alternatives to routinely used physiotherapy interventions for achieving maximum patients benefits and minimising therapists exposure in treatment of COVID-19Ca commentary"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a large number of non-pharmaceutical measures that pertain to the wider group of social distancing interventions (e.g. public gathering bans, closures of schools, workplaces and all but essential business, mandatory stay-at-home policies, travel restrictions, border closures and others) have been deployed. Their urgent deployment was defended with modelling and observational data of spurious credibility. There is major debate on whether these measures are effective and there is also uncertainty about the magnitude of the harms that these measures might induce. Given that there is equipoise for how, when and if specific social distancing interventions for COVID-19 should be applied and removed/modified during reopening, we argue that informative randomised-controlled trials are needed. Only a few such randomised trials have already been conducted, but the ones done to-date demonstrate that a randomised trials agenda is feasible. We discuss here issues of study design choice, selection of comparators (intervention and controls), choice of outcomes and additional considerations for the conduct of such trials.

Therapeutic benefits of using RDS for both disease control and prevention, in the effort to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have been shown. However, the biochemically active constituents of RDS and their mechanisms of action are still unclear. The goal of the present study is to clarify the material foundation and action mechanism of RDS. METHODS: To conduct an analysis of RDS, an integrative analytical platform was constructed, including target prediction, proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network, and cluster analysis; further, the hub genes involved in the disease-related pathways were identified, and the their corresponding compounds were used for in vitro validation of molecular docking predictions. The presence of these validated compounds was also measured in samples of the RDS formula to quantify the abundance of the biochemically active constituents. In our network pharmacological study, a total of 26 bioinformatic programs and databases were used, and six networks, covering the entire Zang-fu viscera, were constructed to comprehensively analyze the intricate connections among the compounds-targets-disease pathways-meridians of RDS. RESULTS: For all 1071 known chemical constituents of the nine ingredients in RDS, identified from established TCM databases, 157 passed drug-likeness screening and led to 339 predicted targets in the constituentCtarget network. Forty-two hub genes with core regulatory effects were extracted from the PPI network, and 134 compounds and 29 crucial disease pathways were implicated in the targetCconstituentCdisease network. Twelve disease pathways attributed to the LungCLarge Intestine meridians, with six and five attributed to the KidneyCUrinary Bladder and StomachCSpleen meridians, respectively. One-hundred and eighteen candidate constituents showed a high binding affinity with SARS-coronavirus-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)), as indicated by molecular docking using computational pattern recognition. The in vitro activity of 22 chemical constituents of RDS was validated using the 3CL(pro) inhibition assay. Finally, using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in data-independent analysis mode, the presence of seven out of these 22 constituents was confirmed and validated in an aqueous decoction of RDS, using reference standards in both non-targeted and targeted approaches. CONCLUSION: RDS acts primarily in the LungCLarge Intestine, KidneyCUrinary Bladder and StomachCSpleen meridians, with other Zang-fu viscera strategically covered by all nine ingredients. In the context of TCM meridian theory, the multiple components and targets of RDS contribute to RDSs dual effects of health-strengthening and pathogen-eliminating.

The pathogenicity of the virus is highly variable ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. Evidence from experimental and observational studies suggests that circulating micronutrients may affect COVID-19 outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To complement and inform observational studies, we investigated the associations of genetically predicted concentrations of 12 micronutrients (-carotene, calcium, copper, folate, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, selenium, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, vitamin D, and zinc) with SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and COVID-19 severity using Mendelian randomization (MR). METHODS: Two-sample MR was conducted using 87,870 individuals of European descent with a COVID-19 diagnosis and 2,210,804 controls from the COVID-19 host genetics initiative. Inverse variance-weighted MR analyses were performed with sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of potential violations of MR assumptions. RESULTS: Compared to the general population, nominally significant associations were noted for higher genetically predicted vitamin B-6 (Odds ratio per standard deviation [OR(SD)]: 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00, 1.13; p-value = 0.036) and lower magnesium concentrations (OR(SD): 0.33; 95%CI: 0.11, 0.96; P = 0.042) with COVID-19 infection risk. However, the association for magnesium was not consistent in some sensitivity analyses, and sensitivity analyses could not be performed for vitamin B-6 as only two genetic instruments were available. Genetically predicted levels of calcium, folate, -carotene, copper, iron, vitamin B-12, vitamin D, selenium, phosphorus, or zinc were not associated with the outcomes from COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSION: These results, though based only on genetically predicated circulating micronutrient concentrations, provide scant evidence for possible associations of micronutrients with COVID-19 outcomes.","output":"Genetically Predicted Circulating Concentrations of Micronutrients and COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity: A Mendelian Randomization Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oxidative stress may be defined as an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the antioxidant system to counteract or detoxify these potentially damaging molecules.

There are many therapeutic options to treat oxidative stress-associated cardiovascular diseases. Numerous studies have focused on the utility of antioxidant supplementation. However, whether antioxidant supplementation has any preventive and/or therapeutic value in cardiovascular pathology is still a matter of debate. In this review, we provide a detailed description of oxidative stress biomarkers in several cardiovascular risk factors.

OBJECTIVES The aim was to evaluate whether the CBP was associated with changes in spending, utilization, and adverse health events (emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and falls). RESEARCH DESIGN A comparative interrupted time series over 8 years was used to compare Round1 and Round2 bidding to nonbidding areas. Medicare fee for services claims were aggregated at the quarterly Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level from 2009 to 2016. RESULTS For the 3 evaluated DME (continuous positive airway pressure machines, oxygen supplies, and walkers), we found that implementation of the Medicare CBP was associated with reductions in per capita spending without changes in DME utilization or adverse health outcomes in CBP areas compared with nonbidding areas. For example, the slope change in the proportion of oxygen supplies purchasers in Round1 areas after implementation of Round1 was similar to the slope change in nonbidding areas (-0.0002; 95% CI: -0.0004, 0.0001; P=0.189). The difference in slope changes of emergency department visits and hospitalization in Round1 areas for oxygen supplies were (-0.0004; 95% CI: -0.0016, 0.0008; P=0.514) and (0.0002; 95% CI: -0.0010, 0.0014; P=0.757), respectively.

using digital, connected, tools in the main goal to collect digital data (especially important in this period of COVID-19) A second field corresponds to Big Psychiatry, or Big Data Psychiatry, which deals with large amounts of data, e g through recent methodologies in Machine learning or artificial intelligence A third field corresponds to Psychiatry Modeling, which corresponds to the utilization of formal hypothesis (i e mathematical models) about brain and behavior (and their dysfunctions) in line with computational neurosciences Results The collection of digital data fits into methodologies of assessments and interventions in daily life, named Ecological Momentary Assessment Of course, these digital data, which differ quantitatively and qualitatively from what psychiatry has been able to collect in its history, raise numerous epistemological and ethical questions In the field of Big Psychiatry, most Machine learning techniques provide predictions rather than pathophysiological mechanisms, and these Machine learning techniques makes it possible to propose new delineations of disorders in a logic of stratified medicine Lastly, resulting from studies in computational neurosciences, explanatory modeling of the brain (often called Generative modeling) proposes a number of theories to understand the functioning of the brain in psychiatric disorder (e g predictive coding, reinforcement learning, decision making theories, but also dynamical systems theories and graph and network theory) Discussion and conclusion This field could offer a framework to characterize the origin of the psychiatric symptoms Obviously, these three fields are highly mutually dependent, with for instance a data access provided by Digital Psychiatry (with Digital Tools), a data processing operated by Big Psychiatry (with Machine learning) and a formalization of hypotheses offered by Generative modeling of the brain from Psychiatry Modeling This triple organization of

Confirmatory factor analysis followed by multiple logistic regression models adjusting for relevant covariates were used to identify vaccine perceptions uniquely associated with (a) intention to get the COVID-19 vaccine (intention), and (b) intention to get vaccinated right away (urgency). Results In total, 95.4% of participants of the seroprevalence study completed the vaccine questionnaire, corresponding to 17.7% of the target population. Vaccine intention was associated with staff who valued expert recommendations (AOR = 10.5, 95% CI = 7.39C14.90) accepted routine vaccines (AOR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.26C2.98) and perceived higher benefits (AOR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.01C1.65) and lower safety risks of vaccination (AOR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.29C0.54). Comparable associations were found with vaccine urgency. Perceived susceptibility to the COVID-19 virus was uniquely associated with vaccine urgency (AOR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.05C1.61).

Minimal literature exists comparing RR of trauma patients who required an inpatient stay to those whose treatment was limited to the Emergency Department (ED), as they are at high risk of recidivism. We hypothesized post-trauma follow-up calls would show higher RR for ED patients than those requiring inpatient stay, as well as potentially differing outcomes for minorities. STUDY DESIGN A retrospective analysis from 2019-2020 of 1328 trauma patients from UCI Medical Center, discharged from inpatient facilities or the ED. A questionnaire script read by a nurse practitioner to patients via phone call following discharge. Data associated with readmission were captured. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed, controlling for patient factors including severity of injury. RESULTS Patients discharged from the ED were 47.4% less likely to be readmitted than those who required an inpatient stay (P < .01). However, ED patients were 88.7% less likely to receive a prescription than inpatient stay patients (P < .01). No difference between ED and inpatient discharge contact rates was noted (P < .99). Furthermore, no difference in readmission rates was noted for minorities. CONCLUSION Post-trauma follow-up calls showed lower RR for index ED visit patients than those requiring inpatient stay, contrary to expectations. However, ED visit patients were also less likely to receive/fill prescriptions compared to those requiring inpatient stay. Ongoing analysis is warranted to further validate and improve follow-up call programs to ensure equitable health care.","output":"Post-Trauma Follow-up Phone Call Shows Lower Readmission Rates for Patients Discharged From Emergency Department Compared to Inpatient Stay."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Healthcare professionals who are directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and general care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk of developing adverse psychological reactions A cross-sectional study of healthcare professionals aimed to determine the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare professionals in two of the largest referral hospitals in Athens, Greece Methods: The study was conducted in the two largest SARS-CoV-2 referral hospitals in Athens, Greece An assessment and the interrelationship of post-traumatic stress disorder, using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised [IES-R]) and burnout, using the Maslach Burnout Inventory [MBI]) was carried out Results: A total of 162 subjects were enrolled in the study Fifty-six (35%) had an IES-R score &gt; 33, suggesting post-traumatic stress disorder Forty-nine (30%) had an MBI score &gt; 27 Seventy-five (46%) had a personal accomplishment score of 10 Stepwise backward logistic regression revealed that the only independent variable that was retained regarding the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder was the emotional exhaustion score of the MBI (at a cut-off of 24 in this scale, the 95% CI of the odds ratio for the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 1 077-1 173) Conclusions: In this sample of first-line Greek healthcare professionals against SARS-CoV-2, most of them were proven to be quite resilient to this challenge One-third of them had post-traumatic stress disorder, which depended on their degree of emotional exhaustion Healthcare professionals, as represented by this study, performed their duties without feeling helpless and developing adverse psychological reactions","output":"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Burnout in Healthcare Professionals During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Baricitinib is a JAK1/2 inhibitor that was first approved for treating moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but that later showed considerable efficacy in the control of exaggerated inflammatory responses that occur in a wide range of diseases.

With an estimated incidence of 2/100,000 children, MIS-C is relatively rare, but can be fatal. Clinical features can include fever, hyperinflammatory state, gastrointestinal symptoms, myocardial dysfunction, and shock. The pathogenesis of MIS-C, although yet to be completely elucidated, appears to be distinct from KD in terms of epidemiology, severity, and biochemical signature. Methods: This comprehensive review searched AMED, EBM Reviews, Embase, Healthstar, MEDLINE, ERIC, and Cochrane for studies that reported treatments and outcomes of MIS-C. Results: The search strategy yielded 42 papers, from which 15 underwent full-text review (na?=a?386). A majority of children received intravenous immunoglobulin (77%) and some form of anticoagulation (63%). Steroid use was also common (44%), with immunotherapy used only in severe cases (na?=a?72). Outcomes reported included PICU admission (77%), need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (5%), and mortality (1.3%). Although efficacy of treatments for MIS-C have largely not yet been investigated, we propose close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team, symptomatic treatment (e.g., intravenous immunoglobulin for KD-like symptoms, steroids/immunotherapy for multisystem inflammation), and long-term follow-up. Conclusion: Although outcomes are largely favorable, management is based on a different disease entity (KD), which may not be appropriate given the likely pathophysiologic divergences. Further research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of current MIS-C treatments and to determine more refined therapies.","output":"Management of COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: A comprehensive literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Of the 80 million forced displaced persons worldwide, women and children bear greater morbidity and mortality, especially in conflict-affected regions. This is due to disruption in health service provision, breakdown of social institutions and increase in sexual and gender-based violence. Reproductive health (RH) service delivery as part of humanitarian health cluster services is outlined in the Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP). This study explores the challenges of delivering RH services to forced-displaced populations, focussing on field level stakeholders in humanitarian settings. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders from non-governmental and United Nations agencies involved in delivering RH services to conflict-affected populations. Additionally, a scoping review, using the Arksey and O'Malley framework, of the literature was also conducted reviewing challenges of delivering RH programmes to women in forced displaced populations. An inductive and deductive thematic approach was used in data analysis. RESULTS: Eleven key informants (KIs) were interviewed from six conflict-affected countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Libya. Main emerging themes were: 1. Poor awareness of international guidelines (including the MISP) 2. Service provision barriers including lack of human resources 3. Attitudes towards SRH and women's rights 4. Disruption of health services due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study has highlighted the main challenges that the humanitarian actors delivering RH programmes in conflict-affected settings face. Implementation of international guidelines remains a key barrier. Key policy recommendations would be to standardise training for all RH providers, prioritise training in the MISP and address cultural attitudes towards RH. Further research exploring the use of WHO's essential medicines for RH and the long-term impact of COVID-19 on forced displaced females needs to be conducted. KEY MESSAGES: Providing basic essential reproductive health services to conflict affected populations remains a challenge, including implementation of standardised international guidance through the MISP. One key policy recommendation would be to prioritise training in MISP for conflict-affected humanitarian settings to ensure it is offered as part of the essential package.","output":"Challenges of delivering reproductive health services to forced displaced populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genomic studies of patients with COVID-19, or exposed to it, are underway to delineate host factors associated with variability in susceptibility, infectivity, and disease severity.

Whereas Carsonella_DC is a typical nutritional symbiont, Profftella_DC is a unique defensive symbiont with organelle-like features including intracellular localization within the host, perfect infection in host populations, vertical transmission over evolutionary time, and drastic genome reduction down to much less than 1 Mb. Large parts of the 460 kb genome of Profftella_DC are devoted to genes for synthesizing a polyketide toxin; diaphorin. To better understand the evolution of this unusual symbiont, the present study analyzed the genome of Profftella_Dco, a sister lineage to Profftella_DC, using Diaphorina cf. continua, a host psyllid congeneric with D. citri. The genome of co-residing Carsonella (Carsonella_Dco) was also analyzed. The analysis revealed nearly perfect synteny conservation in these genomes with their counterparts from D. citri. The substitution rate analysis further demonstrated genomic stability of Profftella which is comparable to that of Carsonella. Profftella_Dco and Profftella_DC shared all genes for the biosynthesis of diaphorin, hemolysin, riboflavin, biotin, and carotenoids, underlining multiple roles of Profftella, which may contribute to stabilizing symbiotic relationships with the host. However, acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) were extensively amplified in polyketide synthases DipP and DipT for diaphorin synthesis in Profftella_Dco. This level of ACP augmentation, unprecedented in modular polyketide synthases of any known organism, is not thought to influence the polyketide structure but may improve the synthesis efficiency.","output":"Comparative Genomics Underlines Multiple Roles of Profftella, an Obligate Symbiont of Psyllids: Providing Toxins, Vitamins, and Carotenoids."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disease outbreaks in the form of epidemics and pandemics are known to destabilise the existing global public health infrastructure and to put nation-states in an alarming set of circumstances, thereby posing quite a few questions before us, including: can there be a solution to such problem in international law?

The virus that first manifested in Wuhan, China has travelled across continents. The increase in number of deaths in Italy, Iran, USA, and other countries has alarmed both the developed and developing countries. Scientists are working hard to develop a vaccine against the virus, but until now no breakthrough has been achieved. India, the second most populated country in the world, is working hard in all dimensions to stop the spread of community infection. Health care facilities are being updated; medical and paramedical staffs are getting trained, and many agencies are raising awareness on the issues related to this virus and its transmission. The administration is leaving no stone unturned to prepare the country to mitigate the adverse effects. However, as the number of infected patients, and those getting cured is changing differently in different states everyday it is difficult to predict the spread of the virus and its fate in Indian context.

RESULTS: A total of 1,033 questionnaires were collected (273 dental students, 193 dental auxiliary personnel, 544 dentists). In all, 63.4% of the respondents worked in hospitals. Of all the respondents, 44.9%, 33.4%, and 21.7% worked in governmental clinics, academia, and the private sector, respectively. Overall knowledge of the incubation period and route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was consistent across all dental professions. Knowledge of hand-soap cleaning time was significantly different among dental professionals (p < 0.001). Dental professionals displayed significant disagreement on the survival of SARS-CoV-2 outside the host (p < 0.001). Furthermore, 75.1% of the respondents were reluctant to treat a suspected COVID-19 patient, and 92% of the participants believed that the mode of transmission was droplet inhalation.

METHODS: Individuals aged  18 years who were quarantined in Saudi Arabia due to COVID-19 exposure or travel history were included. We used a sequential mixed methods design, using an online survey followed by in-depth individual telephonic interviews. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IESCR) was used to measure post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms after the quarantine. To identify factors associated with significant symptoms (IESCR score  33), prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence intervals were computed using Poisson regression with robust error variance. In the next phase, a subset of the participants (n = 26) were interviewed to elicit their quarantine-related experiences and coping responses. Major themes and subthemes were identified. RESULTS: Of the 111 adults who completed the survey, 32 (28.8% [95% CI, 21.1C38.0%]) had significant PTSD symptoms (IESCR score  33) and 27 (24.3% [95% CI, 17.2C33.3%]) had severe symptoms (IESCR score > 37).

Descriptive data analysis was employed and presented in simple and relational tables. Independent t-test and ANOVA were used to determine differences in the mean age of the sexes and the number of days taken for the first and second retesting to be done per selected patient characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 146 records reviewed, 54% were male; mean age of patients was 41.9  17.5 years, nearly half were asymptomatic, with 9% being severely ill. The commonest presenting symptoms were cough (22.6%), headache (13%) and sore throat (11%) while the commonest co-morbidities were hypertension (25.3%), diabetes mellitus (14%) and heart disease (3.4%). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 affected more males than females; nearly half of those infected were asymptomatic. Cough, headache and sore throat were the commonest symptoms and mean duration from case confirmation to full recovery was 19 days.

We aimed to assess the prognostic value of right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, evaluated by bedside echocardiography (echo), in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods Patients admitted in 2 reference hospitals in Brazil from Jul to Sept/2020 with confirmed COVID-19 and moderate/severe presentations underwent clinical and laboratory evaluation, and focused bedside echo (GE Vivid-IQ), at the earliest convenience, with remote interpretation. The association between demographics, clinical comorbidities and echo variables with all-cause hospital mortality was assessed, and factors significant at p < 0.10 were put into multivariable models. Results Total 163 patients were enrolled, mean age was 64  16 years, 59% were men and 107 (66%) were admitted to intensive care. Comorbidities were present in 144 (88%) patients: hypertension 115 (71%), diabetes 61 (37%) and heart failure 22 (14%). In-hospital mortality was 34% (N = 56). In univariate analysis, echo variables significantly associated with death were: LV ejection fraction (LVEF, OR = 0.94), RV fractional area change (OR = 0.96), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE, OR = 0.83) and RV dysfunction (OR = 5.3). In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for clinical and demographic variables, independent predictors of mortality were age (OR = 1.05, 95%CI 1.01C1.10, p = 0.023), LVEF (OR = 0.95, 95%CI 0.91C1.00, p = 0.48) and TAPSE (OR = 0.76, 95%CI 0.63C0.91, p = 0.005). The final model had good discrimination, with C-statistic = 0.78 (95%CI 0.68C0.88).

Since university students could be considered a knowledgeable group, this study aimed to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among this group in Jordan. Additionally, we aimed to examine the association between vaccine conspiracy beliefs and vaccine hesitancy. We used an online survey conducted in January 2021 with a chain-referral sampling approach. Conspiracy beliefs were evaluated using the validated Vaccine Conspiracy Belief Scale (VCBS), with higher scores implying embrace of conspiracies. A total of 1106 respondents completed the survey with female predominance (n = 802, 72.5%). The intention to get COVID-19 vaccines was low: 34.9% (yes) compared to 39.6% (no) and 25.5% (maybe). Higher rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were seen among males (42.1%) and students at Health Schools (43.5%). A Low rate of influenza vaccine acceptance was seen as well (28.8%), in addition to 18.6% of respondents being anti-vaccination altogether. A significantly higher VCBS score was correlated with reluctance to get the vaccine (p < 0.001). Dependence on social media platforms was significantly associated with lower intention to get COVID-19 vaccines (19.8%) compared to dependence on medical doctors, scientists, and scientific journals (47.2%, p < 0.001). The results of this study showed the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its association with conspiracy beliefs among university students in Jordan.

Even if benign, they may require a treatment in case of symptoms or cosmetic concerns. In the last years, minimally invasive treatments alternative to surgery have been developed, in particular ultrasound (US) guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Methods Twenty-four patients (9 males; 15 females; mean age 57.9 years) were treated and divided in two groups (A and B) according to the RFA needle used (18 gauge needle, AMICA; 17 gauge needle, COVIDIEN). Nodules and patients characteristics, together with procedural data were registered pre-treatment and at 1-month follow-up. US visibility of the needle, volume of the nodules, symptoms and cosmetic concerns, complications were registered. Results Visibility of the needle was not significantly different in the two groups (P=0.0787). At 1 month the mean volume of the nodules dropped from 37.1 to 25 mL in group A and from 23.2 to 15.4 mL in group B; shrinkage rate (36.9% and 39.5%, respectively) was not significantly different (P=0.3137). Symptoms decreased from 3.1 to 1.4 in group A and from 4 to 1.6 in group B: no significant differences in reductions were observed (P=0.3305).

We examined the relationship between cold and/or dry air and daily influenza and pneumonia mortality in the cold season in the New York metropolitan area from 1975C2002. We conducted a retrospective study relating daily pneumonia and influenza mortality for New York City and surroundings from 1975C2002 to daily air temperature, dew point temperature (a measure of atmospheric humidity), and daily air mass type. We identified high mortality days and periods and employed temporal smoothers and lags to account for the latency period and the time between infection and death. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare high mortality events to non-events and nonparametric bootstrapped regression analysis was used to examine the characteristics of longer mortality episodes. We found a statistically significant (p = 0.003) association between periods of low dew point temperature and above normal pneumonia and influenza mortality 17 days later. The duration (r = ?0.61) and severity (r = ?0.56) of high mortality episodes was inversely correlated with morning dew point temperature prior to and during the episodes. Weeks in which moist polar air masses were common (air masses characterized by low dew point temperatures) were likewise followed by above normal mortality 17 days later (p = 0.019). This research supports the contention that cold, dry air may be related to influenza mortality and suggests that warning systems could provide enough lead time to be effective in mitigating the effects.","output":"The Impact of Weather on Influenza and Pneumonia Mortality in New York City, 1975C2002: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Root-associating arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi foster vegetation recovery in degraded habitats. AM fungi increase nutrient availability for host plants; therefore, their importance is expected to be higher when nutrient availability is low. However, little is known about how small-scale variation in nutrient availability influences plant and AM fungal communities in a stable ecosystem. We conducted a 2-year field study in the understorey of a boreonemoral forest where we examined plant and AM fungal communities at microsites (15 cm diameter) with intact vegetation cover and at disturbed microsites where vegetation was cleared away and soil was sterilized to remove soil biota. We manipulated soil nutrient content (increased with fertilizer, unchanged, or decreased with sucrose addition) and fungal activity (natural or suppressed by fungicide addition) at these microsites. After two vegetation seasons, manipulations with nutrient content resulted in significant, although moderate, differences in the content of soil nutrients (e.g. in soil phosphorus). Suppression of fungal activity resulted in lower richness, abundance and phylogenetic diversity of AM fungal community, independently of microsite type and soil fertility level. Plant species richness and diversity decreased when fungal activity was suppressed at disturbed but not in intact microsites. The correlation between plant and AM fungal communities was not influenced by microsite type or soil fertility. We conclude that small-scale variation in soil fertility and habitat integrity does not influence the interactions between plants and AM fungi. The richness, but not composition, of AM fungal communities recovered fast after small-scale disturbance and supported the recovery of species-rich vegetation.","output":"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi promote small-scale vegetation recovery in the forest understorey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) describe \\"post COVID-19 syndrome\\" or \\"Long COVID\\" as a set of persistent physical, cognitive and/or psychological symptoms that continue for more than 12 weeks after illness and which are not explained by an alternative diagnosis.

As midwives act as primary contact for Dutch pregnant women, the goal was to explore the experiences and perspectives of midwives on (1) nutritional counselling during pregnancy, and (2) nutritional mHealth apps to support midwifery care. Analyses of eleven in-depth interviews indicated that nutritional counselling involved the referral to websites, a brochure, and an app developed by the Dutch Nutrition Centre.

Utilizing propensity-matched pre-pandemic data and our institutional experience during the crisis, we aimed to assess the safety of immediate device reconstruction following mastectomy to aid in decision-making during the pandemic. Methods: Women undergoing mastectomy only and mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) with tissue expander or permanent implant from the 2007-2013 ACS-NSQIP datasets were included. Multivariate analysis of independent variables was used to form propensity-matched cohorts. Incidence of 30-day major postoperative bleeding and hospital length of stay were compared. Results: In total, 13,580 mastectomy only patients and 11,636 IBR patients were identified. Factors that were found to be associated with IBR included age (P = 0.022), BMI (P &lt; 0.001), race (P = 0.010), diabetes (P = 0.007), chronic steroid use (P = 0.003), pulmonary disease (P = 0.004), cardiovascular disease (P &lt; 0.001), disseminated cancer (P = 0.001), chemotherapy before surgery (P = 0.016), low hematocrit (P &lt; 0.001), and total operative time (P &lt; 0.001). After propensity matching, immediate device reconstruction following mastectomy was not found to be associated with greater risk of postoperative bleeding (1.4% versus 1.0%, P = 0.334) or increased length of stay (1.5 +/- 2.9 versus 1.5 +/- 3.5 days, P = 0.576). Conclusions: Immediate device reconstruction does not elevate morbidity in terms of postoperative bleeding or does not increase the length of hospital exposure. Tissue expander or implant reconstruction can be safely performed immediately following mastectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data on several exposure variables were collected. Prevalence rates of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD were measured using clinically validated questionnaires: Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) anxiety and depression subscales, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Univariate analyses and adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the strengths in associations.Findings: There were 2638 eligible participants who completed the survey (female 795%, median age 42 [IQR: 32-51] years). The prevalence rates of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD were high (343%, 312% and 245% respectively). In adjusted analysis a history of mental health conditions was associated with clinically significant symptoms of anxiety (odds ratio 23 [95% CI 19C27];p< 0001), depression (25 (21C30);p< 0001) and PTSD (21 [17C25];p< 0001). The availability of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), wellbeing support and lower exposure to moral dilemmas at work demonstrated significant negative associations with former symptoms.

A significant amount of ivermectin could deposit into sediments of the semi-closed Mediterranean Sea, where three European COVID-19 epicenters are located: Italy, Spain, and France. Meiobenthic nematodes were exposed to three ivermectin doses (1.8 ng.g(?1), 9 ng.g(?1), and 18 ng.g(?1)) for 10 days. Ivermectin caused a great reduction in abundance. However, the diversity indices decreased only at high doses.

Specimens found dead, such as road-killed animals, can therefore serve as a valuable source to address various questions concerning the population level. We herein describe pathological findings in Eurasian otters found dead in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, which were obtained using a special otter dissection protocol. To actually monitor population trends and the health of otters, the continuation of post-mortem investigations is essential. ABSTRACT: In times of massive biodiversity loss and ongoing environmental crises, it is extremely important to ensure long-term conservation efforts of threatened species like Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra). To gain insights into the status of Northern Germanys otter population, 92 otters found dead in Schleswig-Holstein between 2015?2020 were collected and underwent detailed dissection with the aim to establish a monitoring program for this population. Examinations followed a protocol especially designed for otters, including various biological data assessments and extended sampling. The finding sites showed a clear concentration in the Continental region. Seasonal concentration differed among the years, yet peaks were seen from fall to winter. Overall, more males than females were found, although this differed among the years. The majority of otters that could be aged were between 1C3 years. Placental scars and pregnancy were recorded in only few females. Nutritional status was good in most cases. Infectious diseases found included Vagococcus lutrae, Toxoplasma gondii, and Emmonsia spp. A major cause of death was roadkill. Known sample bias in studies focusing on roadkill was considered in the finding interpretation. Continuation of the population health investigations is mandatory to analyze potential trends and to establish an actual monitoring program for Eurasian otters in Schleswig-Holstein.","output":"Pathological Findings in Eurasian Otters (Lutra lutra) Found Dead between 2015?2020 in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads across the globe, physicians face the challenges of a contagious pandemic including which patients to isolate, how to conserve personal protective equipment, and who to test The current protocol at our hospital is to place anyone with new cough, dyspnea, or fever into airborne and contact precautions and consider them for testing Unfortunately, the symptomatic presentations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are proving more variable than previously thought CASE REPORT: Our case of COVID-19 presented with headache and then progressed to a meningitis-like illness with co-existing shingles rash CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can have a variety of initial presentations that are not the classic respiratory symptoms and fever These presenting symptoms of COVID-19 can include a meningitis-like illness, as our case report indicates The wide variety of presentations of COVID-19 may warrant widespread testing to identify cases, protect healthcare workers, and prevent the spread of this pandemic","output":"An Unusual Case Report of COVID-19 Presenting with Meningitis Symptoms and Shingles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals just released from prison, or returning citizens (RCs), face high mortality rates during the reentry period, with cardiovascular disease (CVD) being a leading cause Peer mentors can support RCs' health, but they traditionally work in person, which may not always be feasible, particularly during pandemic outbreaks such as COVID-19 We used human-centered design to build a prototype of RCPeer, a web/mobile application (app) to support peer-led reentry efforts through CVD risk screening, action planning, linkage to resources addressing reintegration needs (e g , housing, transportation), and goal-setting We assessed feasibility, acceptability, and usability of RCPeer using mixed-methods System Usability Scale (SUS) scores were 68 for peers and 66 for RCs, indicating good usability Qualitative data suggests that RCPeer can support reentry tasks through RCs and peers sharing data, strengthen RC-peer relationships, and facilitate RCs meeting their goals Future work is needed to enhance usability for RCs with limited technology experience","output":"A Mobile Health Tool for Peer Support of Individuals Reentering Communities After Incarceration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the importance of correctly using personal protective equipment (PPE). Doffing is a critical phase that increases the risk of contamination of health care workers. Although a gamified electronic learning (e-learning) module has been shown to increase the adequate choice of PPE among prehospital personnel, it failed to enhance knowledge regarding donning and doffing sequences. Adding other training modalities such as face-to-face training to these e-learning tools is therefore necessary to increase prehospital staff proficiency and thus help reduce the risk of contamination. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the Peyton 4-step approach in addition to a gamified e-learning module for teaching the PPE doffing sequence to first-year paramedic students. METHODS: Participants will first follow a gamified e-learning module before being randomized into one of two groups. In the control group, participants will be asked to perform a PPE doffing sequence, which will be video-recorded to allow for subsequent assessment. In the experimental group, participants will first undergo face-to-face training performed by third-year students using the Peyton 4-step approach before performing the doffing sequence themselves, which will also be video-recorded. All participants will then be asked to reconstruct the doffing sequence on an online platform. The recorded sequences will be assessed independently by two investigators: a prehospital emergency medicine expert and an infection prevention and control specialist. The assessors will be blinded to group allocation. Four to eight weeks after this first intervention, all participants will be asked to record the doffing sequence once again for a subsequent skill retention assessment and to reconstruct the sequence on the same online platform to assess knowledge retention. Finally, participants belonging to the control group will follow face-to-face training. RESULTS: The study protocol has been presented to the regional ethics committee (Req-2020-01340), which issued a declaration of no objection as such projects do not fall within the scope of the Swiss federal law on human research. Study sessions were performed in January and February 2021 in Geneva, and will be performed in April and June 2021 in Bern.

We present the Hasse diagrams of organizations for the twelve virus models analyzed within this study. For comparing models, each organization is characterized by the types of species it contains. For this, each species is mapped to one out of four types, representing uninfected, infected, immune system, and bacterial species, respectively. Subsequently, we can integrate these results with those of our former work on Influenza-A virus resulting in a single joint hierarchy of 24 models. It appears that the SARS-CoV-2 models are simpler with respect to their long term behavior and thus display a simpler hierarchy with little dependencies compared to the Influenza-A models.

IV, Etude pidmiologique observationnelle Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic in France has recently modified the patients lifestyles, as well as methods of medical and surgical management. This could explain subsequent changes to the microbiological spectrum, the severity, as well as the scalability of phlegmons of the flexor tendon sheath. The objective of this study was to construct an epidemiological and bacteriological inventory of these hand infections, and to compare the clinical and microbiological data, before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Hypothesis: The hypothesis of this work was that the phlegmons of the flexor tendon sheath presented specific microbiological characteristics in the tropical environment of our University Hospital Center, and that these characteristics could have changed with the recent introduction of hydro-alcoholic solution (HAS) associated to the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods: The preoperative epidemiological data of our patients were collected between January 2016 and December 2020. The stage of severity, according to the classification of Michon, the use of hydro-alcoholic solution, as well as the early clinical evolution were collected. The cohort was then divided into two groups in order to compare the microbiological profiles, the management and the clinical evolution of patients in the pre-COVID period with those in the post-COVID period. Results: A total of 199 patients were included, 154 patients in the pre-COVID period and 26 in the post-COVID period. We found a majority of MSSA (58.3%, n=105) and negative samples comprised 18.9% (n=34). No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the bacteriological results. The clinical course was judged to be favorable in 93.5% of cases in the pre-COVID group compared to 80.8% in the post-COVID group (p=0.046). The use of HAS (p<0.0001), as well as the initial stage of severity according to Michon, were significantly higher in group 2 (p=0.04). Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic has not shown any change in the microbiological spectrum, despite the now daily use of HAS in everyday life. The postoperative clinical evolution was significantly less favorable after the onset of COVID and could be explained by an increase in cases with a more advanced initial stage of severity.

DESIGN: Using historical prospective Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) data (1 January 2013C31 December 2016) and multilevel modelling, cross-sectional (2015C2016; 30 791 patients nested within 55 hospitals) and repeated cross-sectional (2013C2014 vs 2015C2016; 49 266 patients nested within 41 hospitals) analyses were undertaken. SETTING: Hospitals were sampled across a large geographical area of England covering the West and East Midlands, the East of England and the North of England. PARTICIPANTS: Stroke patients whose data were entered into the SSNAP database by hospital teams. INTERVENTIONS: Receiving ESD along the patient care pathway. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Length of hospital stay. RESULTS: When adjusted for important case-mix variables, patients who received ESD on their stroke care pathway spent longer in hospital, compared with those who did not receive ESD. The percentage increase was 15.8% (95% CI 12.3% to 19.4%) for the 2015C2016 cross-sectional analysis and 18.8% (95% CI 13.9% to 24.0%) for the 2013C2014 versus 2015C2016 repeated cross-sectional analysis. On average, the increased length of hospital stay was approximately 1 day. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that by comparing ESD and non-ESD patient groups matched for important patient characteristics, receiving ESD resulted in a 1-day increase in length of hospital stay. The large reduction in length of hospital stay overall, since original trials were conducted, may explain why a reduction was not observed.

Gamma variants were most prevalent; Delta emerged increasingly during implementation. Overall sensitivity of evaluated tests ranged from 33%C76%. Performance was higher among symptomatic cases and cases with Ct < 34 and lower among oligo/asymptomatic cases. Assuming a 24-hour time-to-result for RT-PCR, the cumulative sensitivity of an ANS rapid antigen test was >70% and almost 90% after four days. CONCLUSIONS: The near immediate time-to-result for antigen tests significantly offsets lower analytical sensitivity in settings where RT-PCR results are delayed or unavailable.","output":"Screening for SARS-CoV-2 in close contacts of individuals with confirmed infection: performance and operational considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides an optimized cable path planning solution for a tree-topology network in an irregular 2D manifold in a 3D Euclidean space, with an application to the planning of submarine cable networks. Our solution method is based on total cost minimization, where the individual cable costs are assumed to be linear to the length of the corresponding submarine cables subject to latency constraints between pairs of nodes. These latency constraints limit the cable length and number of hops between any pair of nodes. Our method combines the Fast Marching Method (FMM) and a new Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) where there are constraints between pairs of nodes. We note that this problem of MST with constraints is NP-complete. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that ILP running time is adequate for the great majority of existing cable systems. For cable systems for which ILP is not able to find the optimal solution within an acceptable time, we propose an alternative heuristic algorithm based on Prim's algorithm. In addition, we apply our FMM/ILP-based algorithm to a real-world cable path planning example and demonstrate that it can effectively find an MST with latency constraints between pairs of nodes.","output":"Optimal Tree Topology for a Submarine Cable Network With Constrained Internodal Latency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among health care professionals, dentists are more prone to infection due to their direct contact with blood and saliva. This study highlights the level of compliance with infection control measures among dental students; and linked this to their knowledge and attitudes regarding infection control measures and proper vaccinations. The study is a multi-centre analytical cross-sectional survey. The sample size was 969 clinical years' students from governmental and private dental colleges in Sudan and Saudi Arabia. A pre-coded, pre-tested, and anonymous questionnaire consisted of seven categories of knowledge, attitude, awareness, and practices, including 40 questions, was answered. The study has linked knowledge, attitude, and practice in dental clinics with possible COVID-19 transmission in dental clinics. The results showed that the use of some Personal Protective Equipment was low in Sudan and moderate in Saudi Arabia (statistically significant, p < 0.001). Moderate percentage of Hepatitis B vaccination status, with low percentage of Post HBV serology, was reported (p < 0.001).

We aimed to estimate gains in case-finding yield under an adaptive decision-making approach for spatially-targeted, mobile digital chest radiography (dCXR)-based screening in communities with varying levels of TB prevalence. METHODS: We used a Monte-Carlo simulation model to simulate a spatially-targeted screening intervention in 24 communities with TB prevalence estimates derived from a large community-randomized trial. We implemented a Thompson sampling algorithm to allocate screening units based on Bayesian probabilities of local TB prevalence that are continuously updated during weekly screening rounds. Four mobile units for dCXR-based screening and subsequent Xpert Ultra-based testing were allocated among the communities during a 52-week period. We estimated the yield of bacteriologically-confirmed TB per 1000 screenings comparing scenarios of spatially-targeted and untargeted resource allocation. RESULTS: We estimated that under the untargeted scenario, an expected 666 (95% uncertainty interval 522C825) TB cases would be detected over one year, equivalent to 8.9 (7.5C10.3) per 1000 individuals screened. Allocating the screening units to the communities with the highest (prior-year) cases notification rates resulted in an expected 760 (617C926) TB cases detected, 10.1 (8.6C11.8) per 1000 screened. Adaptive, spatially-targeted screening resulted in an expected 1241 (995C1502) TB cases detected, 16.5 (14.5C18.7) per 1000 screened. Numbers of dCXR-based screenings needed to detect one additional TB case declined during the first 12C14 weeks as a result of Bayesian learning. CONCLUSION: We introduce a spatially-targeted screening strategy that could reduce the number of screenings necessary to detect additional TB in high-burden settings and thus improve the efficiency of screening interventions. Empirical trials are needed to determine whether this approach could be successfully implemented.","output":"Spatially targeted digital chest radiography to reduce tuberculosis in high-burden settings: A study of adaptive decision making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The respiratory rate-oxygenation (ROX) index is a fraction of oxygen saturation, FIO2, and respiratory rate that has been validated to predict receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation in patients receiving high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). This study aimed to validate ROX in a cohort of inpatients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure. DESIGN: Retrospective validation of the ROX index. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and 95% CIs of ROX for invasive mechanical ventilation any time during hospitalization. SETTING: Twenty-one hospitals of Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated healthcare delivery system. PATIENTS: We identified adults with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction test within 3 weeks of, or during, hospitalization between February 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020. We calculated ROX at 12 hours after HFNC initiation. We grouped patients as low ( 4.88), intermediate (< 4.88 and  3.85), or high (< 3.85) risk using previously published thresholds. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 1,847 patients who had no limitation of life support. Of these, 525 (31.7%) received invasive mechanical ventilation any time during hospitalization and 511 died (27.7%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 12-hour ROX threshold (< 3.85) predicting invasive mechanical ventilation were 32.3% (95% CI, 28.5-36.3%), 89.8% (95% CI, 88.0-91.4%), 59.4% (95% CI, 53.8-64.9%), and 74.1% (95% CI, 71.8-76.3%), respectively.

The existence of the virus in the gastrointestinal tract makes digestive endoscopy a high-risk operation, which associated with an increased risk of infection rate in healthcare workers. This study aimed at exploring current knowledge, practice and attitudes of healthcare workers in endoscopy units in China regarding the status of occupational protection during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study of a national online survey involving 717 healthcare workers in endoscopy units from 94 medical structures in 24 provinces and municipalities around China was conducted online via a questionnaire platform called Wenjuanxing (wjx.cn). The data were analyzed using correlation approaches, Kruskal-Wallis test for independent samples, and linear regression models. Results: Most Chinese healthcare workers in endoscopy units had a good knowledge of COVID-19 (median: 10; range: 7-12), showed a strikingly positive attitude (median: 65; range: 39-65), and carried out good practice (median: 47; range: 14-50) in strengthening the protection, disinfection and management of COVID-19. In terms of attitudes, female staff was more concerned about protection against COVID-19 than male staff (KW = 8.146, P = 0.004). Nurses performed better in both attitude (KW = 2.600, P = 0.009) and practice (KW = 6.358, P < 0.001) than endoscopic physicians when carrying out personal protection, patient care and environmental disinfection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. More positive attitudes in protection were related to better protective behavior in endoscopic daily medical work (r = 0.312; P < 0.001). Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that Chinese endoscopy healthcare workers have an excellent mastery of knowledge about COVID-19, which is transformed into positive beliefs and attitudes, contributing to good practice during daily endoscopic procedures. Medical staff may benefit from further education.

This study investigated the knowledge and awareness of chemical engineering students in Al-Balqa Applied University (BAU) in Jordan about respiratory protective measures against COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was developed using a multi-stage random sampling technique conducted from April 21C28, 2020. The data were collected through an online questionnaire distributed to BAU's chemical engineering students, with 179 responders completed the survey correctly. The data were analyzed statistically using the SPSS program. The questionnaire consisted of two parts: the first measured the student's general knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic, while the second focused on the respiratory protection methods against COVID-19; it was structured to assess the student's knowledge about the suitable types of masks and respirators used in COVID-19 prevention, their detailed mechanism of action and filtration process type, their production materials, and finally how the student's knowledge affects choosing a proper preventive method. Results: The study found moderate awareness among engineering students about COVID-19 causative agent, effective preventive masks/respirators used, and the mask's viral blockage mechanisms. A total of 89 respondents (49.7%) pointed to the correct best protective mask, i.e., N95 mask. On the other hand, 119 respondents (66.5%) believed that a surgical mask is the best protective mask. The study also showed differences in knowledge between different academic years; the knowledge about respirators, masks, and their action mechanism among senior students in the last three academic years was better than the younger students with a P-value of 0.047 for knowledge about respirator used for protection against coronavirus disease and the P-value of 0.028 for knowledge of the comparisons between the N95 and surgical mask.

Here we demonstrate that despite the challenges of remote learning, first year university students (N= 166) taking an online Science of Happiness course during the first term experienced positive benefits to mental well-being in comparison to a wait-list control group (N=198) registered to take the course in the second term.

Instead, they had to use self-management strategies to cope with the situation. CONCLUSION: The intensive work exhausted participants physically and emotionally. They were holding a lot of grief and hurt inside, but still, healthcare professionals showed the spirit of professional dedication to overcome difficulties. Although currently coping with their emotional problems, comprehensive professional support should be made available to cater to the wellbeing of frontline physicians.","output":"Experiences of frontline Pakistani emigrant physicians combating COVID-19 in the United Kingdom: a qualitative phenomenological analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic induced a radical shift towards digitally enhanced learning and teaching (DELT).

In this comparative study, we sought to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the surgical management of breast cancer in a breast unit in an Italian region with a low incidence of COVID-19 infection. Eighty-three patients were included, of whom 41 received surgery during the height of the pandemic (Group A, operated on between March and April 2020), and 42 during the same period of the year in 2019 (Group B). Clinicopathological characteristics and surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups. There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the two groups with regard to age (p = 0.62), tumour size (p = 0.25), grade (p = 0.27), histology (p = 0.43), positive lymph node status (p = 0.35), and ER positive status (0.35). Waiting time for surgery was slightly longer in Group A (49.11 vs. 46.39 days, p = 0.38). Patients receiving immediate breast reconstruction were significantly less in Group A (p < 0.001). The use of sentinel node biopsy was similar in the two groups (p = 0.84). Hospital stay was longer in patients of Group B (p = 0.008).

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is the international body that is mandated to protect refugees. However, in undertaking its function, it involves many stakeholders such as refugee communities, civil society actors, government entities, non-governmental organisations, other United Nations agencies and the church;thus ensuring effective interventions. With this in mind, it is sought in this article to understand how the UNHCR involved or integrated churches in its approach to intervention in refugee crises, as some churches had evidently become community bulwarks and safe havens for refugees. In order to accomplish the aforementioned objective, literature pertinent to the subject is reviewed. It commenced by discussing the UNHCRs approach to intervention in and responses to the refugee crisis, and this was followed by the identification and discussion of the UNHCRs interventions in which the churches were meaningfully involved to optimise their response to refugee crises. In discussing this role and the approach of the UNHCR, the extent is revealed to which the churches involvement or integration in the refugee agencys approach to intervention in the refugee crisis was limited. Notably, this limitation was exacerbated by, among many others, the key sticking issues that could be the barriers or challenges in preventing the integration of churches in the UNHCRs responses to migration crises and vice versa. Although there were sticking issues that hampered the UNHCRs integration of churches in its approach to intervention in the refugee crisis, the article is concluded by identifying and discussing some existing opportunities that may further strengthen the existing UNHCRCChurch intervention approaches to the crises. Among many others, formal UNHCRCChurch collaborations were found to be critical in strengthening their mutual efforts to ameliorate the refugee crisis, as they could complement each other in providing effective and comprehensive interventions. Contribution: The major contribution of this article is that it examined the responses of the UNHCR and the church to the refugee crisis. Notably, embedded in this was the assessment of how the UNHCR was integrating churches in its approach to intervention in refugee crises.

Basigin (BSG/CD147) may also act as an ACE2 independent receptor mechanism. The cysteine protease cathepsin-L (CTSL) may also cleave the viral spike proteins and facilitate cell entry. The objective of this study was to characterize the mRNA and protein expression of these cellular entry receptors and proteases in female reproductive cells to determine their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design: Prospective Research Study. Materials and Methods: Materials and Methods: Oocytes (GV, MII), follicular cells (cumulus, CC;granulosa, GC) and embryos (1 cell, 1C;blastocyst, BL) were collected from a minimum of three different patients per sample type, with consent. Samples were analyzed for mRNA expression of ACE2, CD147, TMPRSS2, and CTSL genes relative to GAPDH using RT-qPCR. Primers were validated using human mixed tissue cDNA. Protein quantification was performed by immunoblotting using the Jess system (ProteinSimple) optimized to detect over 10 proteins/5-10 oocytes or embryos. Antibodies for ACE2, CD147, TMPRSS2, and CTSL proteins were validated and then used to determine protein abundance relative to total protein. Data were obtained from three independent biological replicates and analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Results: Results from q-PCR analysis revealed high (p<0.05) abundance of ACE2 transcripts in GV and MII oocytes compared to CC, GC, and BL. ACE2 protein was present in all the samples, but was relatively higher (p<0.17) in M2 oocytes, 1C, BL, and CC compared to GV oocytes and GC. TMPRSS2 protein was abundant in MII oocytes, 1C, and BL, and was present but at low levels in GV oocytes and follicular cells. Protein abundance of CD147 was five-fold higher (p<0.05) in GV and 1.5 fold higher in GC compared to all other samples analyzed. No CTSL protein was observed with the expected molecular weight (38 kD), although a 55 kD band (a possible isoform) was detected in GV oocytes and CC. Conclusions: Cumulus and granulosa cells are least susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the lack of required receptors and proteases. Co-expression of the protein for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in MII oocytes, zygotes, and blastocysts suggests that these reproductive cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, using a combined approach of mRNA and protein analysis from the same samples suggests that mature human oocytes and preimplantation embryos have the cellular machinery required for SARS-Cov2 entry, although we do not know if this occurs in vivo. The potential for viral infection in oocytes and embryos has important ramifications for ART. Care must be taken to avoid introduction of the virus to the embryo while in the ART laboratory, as well as potentially introducing the virus from an infected embryo to laboratory workspaces.","output":"MATURE HUMAN OOCYTES AND PRE-IMPLANTATION EMBRYOS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SARS-COV-2 INFECTION BASED ON THE PRESENCE OF ACE2 AND TMPRSS2 PROTEINS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract It has been reported that frequent occurrence of COVID-19 infection in these patients is associated with low cytosolic pH. During virus infection, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level excessively rises. LDH is a cytosolic enzyme and the serum level increases as the cell break down. When anaerobic conditions develop, lactate formation increases from pyruvate. Cell pH is regulated by very complex mechanisms. When lactate increases in the extracellular area, this symporter carries lactate and H+ ion into the cell, and the intracellular pH quickly becomes acidic. Paradoxically, Na+/H+ exchanger activation takes place. While H+ ion is thrown out of the cell, Na+ and Ca+2 enter the cell. When Na+ and Ca+2 increase in the cell, the cells swell and die. Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor. Dapagliflozin has been reported to reduce lactate levels by various mechanisms. Also, it reduces oxygen consumption in tissues and causes the use of glucose in the aerobic pathway, thereby reducing lactate production. A lactate decrease in the environment reduces the activation of lactate/H+ symporter. Thus, the H ion pumping into the cell by this symporter is reduced and the cytosolic pH is maintained. Dapagliflozin also directly inhibits NHE. Thus, Na+ and Ca+2 flow to the cell are inhibited. Dapagliflozin provides the continuation of the structure and functions of the cells. Dapagliflozin can prevent the severe course of COVID-19 infection by preventing the lowering of cytosolic pH and reducing the viral load.","output":"Can dapagliflozin have a protective effect against COVID-19 infection?

This mixed methods study investigated digital equity, constituted as access, use and quality, of HIV and specialty telehealth services for PLWH > 50 years during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic when services transitioned to remote care. METHODS: A survey of closed and open-ended questions was administered to 80 English (N = 63) and Spanish (N = 17) speaking PLWH receiving HIV care at an Academic Medical Center (N = 50) or a Federally Qualified Health Center (N = 30) in New York State. Quantitative analyses examined characteristics predicting telehealth use and visit quality. Qualitative analyses utilized thematic coding to reveal common experiences. Results were integrated to deepen the interpretation. RESULTS: Telehealth access and use were shaped by multiple related and unstable factors including devices and connectivity, technology literacy, and comfort including privacy concerns. Participants demonstrated their substantial effort to achieve the visit. The majority of patients with a telehealth visit perceived it as worse than an in-person visit by describing it as less interpersonal, and resulting in poorer outcomes, particularly participants with less formal education. Technology was not only a barrier to access, but also influenced perceptions of quality. CONCLUSIONS: In the COVID-19 pandemic initial wave, barriers to using telehealth were unequally distributed to those with more significant access and use challenges. Beyond these barriers, examining the components of equity indicate further challenges replicating in-person care using telehealth formats for older PLWH.

Fever (84.52%) were the most common symptoms, and short of breath was more common in severe patients (P<0.01). Lymphopenia was observed in most patients (74, 47.7%). It showed the elevation of CRP in 100 (64.5%) patients, the elevation of SAA or IL-6 in 104 (67.1%) patients. The calculated cut-off value of CRP was 19.35 mg/mL, the AUC was 0.777, sensitivity was 73.3%, specificity was 69.6%; SAA was 73.55 mg/L, 0.679, 83.3%, 56.8% respectively; IL-6 was 18.85 pg/mL, 0.797, 83.3%, 64.8%; D-Dimer was 0.325 mg/L, 0.673, 66.7% and 68.8%. The combination of CRP, SAA, IL-6 and D-Dimer was 0.823 in AUC, 73.3% in sensitivity and 78.4% in specificity. 12(42.86%) followed-up patients had completely normal lung function indicators. CONCLUSION Elevated CRP, SAA, IL-6 and D-Dimer can be predictors to severe COVID-19. The combination of these four indicators can improve the effectivity and specificity of assessing severe COVID-19. Most of the followed-up patients showed no abnormalities in lung function test. Abnormal lung function is mainly reflected in the diffusion function.","output":"Laboratory predictors of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 and lung function in followed-up."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A network is often an obvious choice for modeling real-life interconnected systems, where the nodes represent interacting objects and the edges represent their associations.

In hospitals, there has been a drastic increase in the use of salbutamol pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs), as well as salbutamol Diskus, leading to a decline in availability and causing interruptions in the supply chain. Patients with asthma are at higher risk of respiratory complications if they are infected with COVID-19. Salbutamol, a short-acting ?-agonist (SABA), could be a life-saving medication during critical conditions. Other short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs), such as ipratropium pMDI, and combinations of SABA/SAMA, such as Combivent Respimat, are also starting to have supply issues. With the ongoing pandemic, hospitals need to consider conservation strategies to facilitate resource-efficient salbutamol delivery and reduce their waste. In this current opinion, we demonstrate several strategies for avoiding pMDI wastage that can be adopted in both the hospital and community settings. These strategies include reprocessing used or expired pMDIs, using intravenous salbutamol and other short acting inhalers when available, and prescribing maintenance inhalers to prevent over usage of salbutamol pMDIs.

Methods: The participants (weighted n = 206, age 65-94) for the current study were selected from a nationally representative online survey of US adults from April 10-20, 2020. We used multiple linear regression to estimate the relative contribution of the four RAA global constructs (instrumental attitude, injunctive norms, descriptive norms, and self-efficacy) in explaining intention to stay home after controlling for demographic covariates. We also conducted a content analysis to identify beliefs about advantages, disadvantages, and facilitators of staying home. Results: After controlling for demographic characteristics, injunctive norms (b = 0.208; SE = 0.059; B = 0.213, p < 0.01) and self-efficacy (b = 0.532; SE = 0.058; B = 0.537, p < 0.001) showed statistically significant independent associations with intention to stay home. The specific beliefs underlying the decision to stay home spanned across health and wellness dimensions and suggested interpersonal, mental health, and leisure/recreational facilitators. Conclusions: These findings suggest three public health intervention targets. First, self-efficacy building interventions could enhance older adults' perceptions of their ability to stay home to avoid unnecessary exposures. Second, health communication messages to address injunctive norms could emphasize that people important to older adults think they should stay home.

The aim of this study was to report the epidemiologic characteristics of surgically-treated fractures during the COVID-19 outbreak over a six-month period, and to describe the variation in volumes and types of injuries, by comparing them with fractures which occurred during the same period in 2019. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all surgically-treated fractures which were admitted from the January 1(st) 2020 to June 30(th) 2020, and compared these data to those of the corresponding timeframe in 2019. The collected data of interest included demographics, such as age and gender, fracture location, time lapse between presentation at Emergency Department and admission in the ward, length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were admitted with a diagnosis of facture and surgically treated, with no cases of COVID-19 positive patients. In the corresponding period of 2019, the number of patients admitted for the same reasons was 129. This decrease was more significant in the period between March and April (-30.6%), during which time prevention measures were more stringent. The only statistically significant discrepancy between the two study groups was the mean age, which was significantly higher in 2020. The location of examined injuries were similar in the two study groups, with proximal femur fractures representing the most frequent injuries. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated significant changes of epidemiologic patterns of fractures during COVID-19 outbreak.

Exploration of pregnant individuals psychosocial condition using a qualitative lens during an infectious outbreak is limited. In this study we explore pregnant individuals lived experiences as well as their psychological and behavioural responses during COVID-19 with the goal of providing useful strategies from the patients perspective to enable health care providers to help pregnant patients navigate this and future pandemics. METHODS: Pregnant individuals between 20-weeks gestation and 3 months postpartum who received maternity care from an urban academic interprofessional teaching unit in Toronto, Canada were invited to participate. Semi-structured 60 min interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using descriptive thematic analysis. Interview questions probed psychological responses to the pandemic, behavioural and lifestyle changes, strategies to mitigate distress while pregnant during COVID-19 and advice for other patients and the healthcare team. RESULTS: There were 12 participants, mean age 35 years (range 30C43 years), all 1 to 6 months postpartum. Six main themes emerged: 1) Childbearing-related challenges to everyday life; 2) Increased worry, uncertainty and fear; 3) Pervasive sense of loss; 4) Challenges accessing care; 5) Strategies for coping with pandemic stress; 6) Reflections and advice to other pregnant people and health care professionals. Pregnant individuals described lack of social support due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and a profound sense of loss of what they thought their pregnancy and postpartum period should have been. Advice to healthcare providers included providing mental health support, clear and up to date communication as well as more postpartum and breastfeeding support. CONCLUSIONS: These participants described experiencing psychosocial distress during their pregnancies and postpartum. In a stressful situation such as a global pandemic, health care providers need to play a pivotal role to ensure pregnant individuals feel supported and receive consistent care throughout the pregnancy and postpartum period. The health care provider should ensure that mental health concerns are addressed and provide postpartum and breastfeeding support. Without addressing this need for support, parental mental health, relationships, parent-infant bonding, and infant development may be negatively impacted.","output":"Pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic: an exploration of patients lived experiences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Measurements of redshifted 21-cm emission of neutral hydrogen at<30 MHz have the potential to probe the cosmic\\"dark ages,\\"a period of the universe's history that remains unobserved to date.

Methods: A multicenter, prospective study was conducted, forty patients were included. Seventy-eight CXRs were performed on the first derivation cohort of twenty patients with COVID-19 (median age 47.5 years, 10 females and four with comorbidities) admitted between 22 January 2020 and 1 February 2020. Each CXR was scored by three radiologists in consensus and graded on a 72-point COVID-19 Radiographic Score (CRS). This was correlated with supplemental oxygen requirement, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and lymphocyte count. To validate our findings, the parameters of another validation cohort of twenty patients with 65 CXRs were analysed. Results: In the derivation cohort, seven patients needed supplemental oxygen and one was intubated for mechanical ventilation with no death. The maximum CRS was significantly different between patients on and not on supplemental oxygen (p=<.001). There was strong correlation between maximum CRS and lowest oxygen saturation (r= -.849), maximum CRP (r= .832) and maximum LDH (r= .873). These findings were consistent in the validation cohort. An increment of 2 points in CRS had an accuracy of 0.938 with 100.0% sensitivity (95% CI 100.0-100.0) and 83.3% (95% CI 65.1-100.0) specificity in predicting supplemental oxygen requirement.

This paper analyzed case information for 417 patients with COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China. The nearest neighbor index method, kernel density method, and the standard deviation ellipse method were used to analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics of the COVID-19 spread in Shenzhen. The factors influencing that spread were then explored using the multiple linear regression method. The results show that: (1) The development of COVID-19 epidemic situation in Shenzhen occurred in three stages. The patients showed significant hysteresis from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization and then to diagnosis. Prior to 27 January, there was a relatively long time interval between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization for COVID-19; the interval decreased thereafter. (2) The epidemic site (the place where the patient stays during the onset of the disease) showed an agglomeration in space. The degree of agglomeration constantly increased across the three time nodes of 31 January, 14 February, and 22 February. The epidemic sites formed a core area in terms of spatial distribution and spread along the northwestCsoutheast direction of the city.

Here we provide evidence that PRO-seq also detects RdRp activity and can serve as a highly sensitive RdRp mapping method. Coupled to PRO-seq in human blood samples, we propose to use PRO-seq as a single package method to detect (+)ssRNA virus RdRp activity and its interaction with host immune response through transcriptome-wide profiling of leukocyte gene expressions at once.","output":"Mapping RNA dependent RNA polymerase activity and immune gene expression using PRO-seq"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a 32\\\\year\\\\old male who brought to the emergency department with generalized convulsions.

This paper explores the experiences of eight Polish complementary school heads, focusing on their response to lockdown and the measures they took to provide online learning through the year. The paper also examines how changing lockdown policies impacted the running of their schools. Key findings suggest a creative approach was taken to learning, and that students were eager to respond. Meanwhile, there was increasing cooperation between different schools and support from external organisations. However, the challenges of online learning were also highlighted. Additionally, heads expressed concern about student retention and recruitment, and the potential long-term effects on their school. There was also discussion about the position of complementary schools within the broader education system. The paper argues that these findings highlight questions of inequality between the complementary and mainstream sectors, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic.

An effective strategy to actively oppose the structural racism ingrained in the fabric of medicine is to intentionally and systematically address diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in medical education and research. As part of ARMED MedEd, a new longitudinal cohort course in advanced research methods in medical education, sponsored by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, the leadership team deliberately included a nested DEI curriculum. The goal of the DEI curriculum is to reduce bias in development, recruitment, and implementation of education research studies to promote equity and inclusion in medical education, research, and ultimately, patient care. A team of medical educators with expertise in DEI developed curricular elements focusing on DEI in education research. The two major components are a didactic curriculum (including implicit bias training) to teach researchers to consider equity as they design studies and a consultative service to refine research protocols to address lingering unintended bias. A dedicated focus on DEI can be incorporated into an advanced education research methodology course to raise awareness and provide tools to avoid bias in research design and implementation of interventions. Over time, the network of education researchers who are trained in DEI awareness will grow and provide equitable offerings to their learners to mitigate health inequities.","output":"Planning for diverse, equitable, inclusive research in health professions education: An integral thread in the ARMED MedEd research course."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The overdose crisis has generated innovative harm reduction and drug market monitoring strategies. In Toronto, Ontario, Canada, a multi-site drug checking service (DCS) pilot project was launched in October 2019. The project provides people who use drugs with information on the chemical composition of their substances, thereby increasing their capacity to make more informed decisions about their drug use and avoid overdose. DCS also provides real-time market monitoring to identify trends in the unregulated drug supply. METHODS: Sample data were obtained through analyses of drug and used drug administration equipment samples submitted anonymously and free of charge to DCS in downtown Toronto from October 10, 2019, to April 9, 2020, representing the first six months of DCS implementation. Analyses were conducted in clinical laboratories using liquid chromatography- and/or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCCMS, GCCMS) techniques. RESULTS: Overall, 555 samples were submitted, with 49% (271) of samples that were found to contain high-potency opioids, of which 87% (235) also contained stimulants. Benzodiazepine-type drugs were found in 21% (116) of all samples, and synthetic cannabinoids in 1% (7) of all samples. Negative effects (including overdose, adverse health events, and extreme sedation) were reported for 11% (59) of samples submitted for analysis.

Thus, we sought to analyze the temporal profiles of specific antibodies, as well as the correlations between the antibodies, proinflammatory cytokines, and survival of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A total of 1830 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were recruited. The temporal profiles of the virus, antibodies, and cytokines of the patients until 12 weeks since illness onset were fitted by the locally weighted scatter plot smoothing (LOWESS) method. The mediation effect of cytokines on the associations between antibody responses and survival were explored by mediation analysis. Of the 1830 patients, 1435 were detectable for SARS-CoV-2, while 395 were positive in specific antibodies only. Of the 1435 patients, 2.4% presented seroconversion for neither immunoglobulin G (IgG) nor immunoglobulin M (IgM) during hospitalization. The seropositive rates of IgG and IgM were 29.6% and 48.1%, respectively, in the first week, and plateaued within five weeks. For the patients discharged from the hospital, the IgM decreased slowly, while high levels of IgG were maintained at around 188 AUmL-1 for the 12 weeks since illness onset. In contrast, in the patients who subsequently died, IgM declined rapidly and IgG dropped to 87 AUmL-1 at the twelfth week.

The effectiveness and durability of protection of the first two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is an important area for study, as are questions related to optimal dose combinations and dosing intervals. Methods: We performed a case-cohort study to generate real-world evidence on efficacy of first and second dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, using a population-based case line list and vaccination database for the province of Ontario, Canada between December 2020 and October 2021. Risk of infection after vaccination was evaluated in all laboratory-confirmed vaccinated SARS-CoV-2 cases, and a 2% sample of vaccinated controls, evaluated using survival analytic methods, including construction of Cox proportional hazards models. Vaccination status was treated as a time-varying covariate. Results: First and second doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine markedly reduced risk of infection (first dose efficacy 68%, 95% CI 67% to 69%; second dose efficacy 88%, 95% CI 87 to 88%). In multivariable models, extended dosing intervals were associated with lowest risk of breakthrough infection (HR for redosing 0.64 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.67) at 6-8 weeks). Heterologous vaccine schedules that mixed viral vector vaccine first doses with mRNA second doses were significantly more effective than mRNA only vaccines. Risk of infection largely vanished during the time period 4-6 months after the second vaccine dose, but rose markedly thereafter. Interpretation: A case-cohort design provided an efficient means to identify strong protective effects associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, particularly after the second dose of vaccine. However, this effect appeared to wane once more than 6 months had elapsed since vaccination. Heterologous vaccination and extended dosing intervals improved the durability of immune response.","output":"Timing of Breakthrough Infection Risk After Vaccination Against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19 pandemics, exhibit patterns that can be described by the dynamics of a mathematical model This study seeks to explore the use of LSTM in order to develop models that will capture the non-linear dynamic changes of COVID-19 cases in Zamboanga Peninsula.

METHODS: The analysis included 17 666 COVID-19 inpatients aged 20C89 years (10 250 men and 7416 women). We graded the severity of COVID-19 (grades 0 to 5) according to the most intensive treatment required during hospitalization. The smoking status of severe grades 3/4/5 (invasive mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation/death) and separately of grade 5 (death) were compared with that of grade 0 (no oxygen, reference group) using multiple logistic regression. Results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for age and other factors considering the potential intermediate effects of comorbidities. RESULTS: Among men, former smoking significantly increased the risk of grade 3/4/5 and grade 5, using grade 0 as a reference group, with age- and admission-date-adjusted ORs (95% CI) of 1.51 (1.18C1.93) and 1.65 (1.22C2.24), respectively. An additional adjustment for comorbidities weakened the ORs. Similar results were seen for women. Current smoking did not significantly increase the risk of grade 3/4/5 and grade 5 in either sex.

Rs678849, an intronic variant in the delta-opioid receptor gene (OPRD1), has been found to predict regional brain volume, addiction risk, and the efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in treating opioid use disorder. The variant has also been implicated as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for several genes. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify functional differences between the two alleles of rs678849 in vitro. We hypothesized that the two alleles of rs678849 would have different effects on transcriptional activity due to differential interactions with transcription factors. METHODS: 15bp regions containing the C or T alleles of rs678849 were cloned into luciferase constructs and transfected into BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells to test the effect on transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using nuclear lysates from BE(2)C cell or human postmortem medial prefrontal cortex were used to identify proteins that differentially bound the two alleles. RESULTS: At 24 hours post-transfection, the C allele construct had significantly lower luciferase expression than the T allele construct and empty vector control (ANOVA p < .001). Proteomic analysis and supershift assays identified XRCC6 as a transcription factor specifically binding the C allele, whereas hnRNP D0 was found to specifically bind the T allele. CONCLUSION: These functional differences between the C and T alleles may help explain the psychiatric and neurological phenotype differences predicted by rs678849 genotype and the potential role of the variant as an eQTL.","output":"Differential expression and transcription factor binding associated with genotype at a pharmacogenetic variant in OPRD1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent global surge in COVID-19 infections has been fueled by new SARS-CoV-2 variants, namely Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, etc. The molecular mechanism underlying such surge is elusive due to 4,653 non-degenerate mutations on the spike protein, which is the target of most COVID-19 vaccines. The understanding of the molecular mechanism of transmission and evolution is a prerequisite to foresee the trend of emerging vaccine-breakthrough variants and the design of mutation-proof vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. We integrate the genotyping of 1,489,884 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolates, 130 human antibodies, tens of thousands of mutational data points, topological data analysis, and deep learning to reveal SARS-CoV-2 evolution mechanism and forecast emerging vaccine-escape variants. We show that infectivity-strengthening and antibody-disruptive co-mutations on the S protein RBD can quantitatively explain the infectivity and virulence of all prevailing variants. We demonstrate that Lambda is as infectious as Delta but is more vaccine-resistant. We analyze emerging vaccine-breakthrough co-mutations in 20 countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Denmark, Brazil, and Germany, etc. We envision that natural selection through infectivity will continue to be the main mechanism for viral evolution among unvaccinated populations, while antibody disruptive co-mutations will fuel the future growth of vaccine-breakthrough variants among fully vaccinated populations. Finally, we have identified the co-mutations that have the great likelihood of becoming dominant: [A411S, L452R, T478K], [L452R, T478K, N501Y], [V401L, L452R, T478K], [K417N, L452R, T478K], [L452R, T478K, E484K, N501Y], and [P384L, K417N, E484K, N501Y].

The identification and establishment of one or multiple correlates of protection (CoP) against infectious pathogens is challenging, but beneficial from both the patient care and public health perspectives. Multiple studies have shown that neutralizing antibodies, whether generated following SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination, or a combination of both (i.e., hybrid immunity), as well as adaptive cellular immune responses, serve as CoPs for COVID-19. However, the diverse number and type of serologic assays, alongside the lack of cross-assay standardization and emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants with immune evasive characteristics, have collectively posed challenges to determining a robust CoP 'threshold' and for the routine utilization of these assays to document 'immunity,' as is commonly done for other vaccine preventable diseases.

While neutralizing antibody responses wane over time, the ability of T cells to recognize viruses including SARS-CoV-2 is instrumental to providing long-term immunity. Although T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire screening can provide insights into the skewing of a T-cell response elicited upon vaccination or infection, they unfortunately provide no assessment into the functional capacity of T cells or their ability to eliminate virally infected targets. We have used time-lapse imaging microscopy in nanowell grids (TIMING) to integrate the migration of individual T cells with analysis of effector functions including cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity. Machine learning is then applied to study thousands of videos of dynamic interactions as T cells with specificity for SARS-CoV-2 eliminate targets bearing spike protein as a surrogate for viral infection. Our data provide the first direct evidence that cytotoxic T lymphocytes from a convalescent patient targeting an epitope conserved across all known variants of concern (VoC) are serial killers capable of eliminating multiple infected targets. These data have implications for development of vaccines to provide broad and sustained cellular immunity and for the recovery and monitoring of individuals who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: The patients operated on in nine Operating Units(OUs) in the period February 1 - March 31 2020 with follow-ups on April 30 2020 were evaluated both retrospectively and prospectively. Organizational, clinical and impact parameters on staff were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 833 consecutive admitted patients, 742 were operated on ,705 of whom were recruited for the study. Compared to the same period in 2019 there was a decrease in the number of operations (742 compared to 1187), similar use of intensive care unit (ICU), a diagnostic activity only for symptomatic patients, heterogeneity in organizational behaviors, an impact on staff who highlighted concerns about getting sick or passing the infection on to others (87.64%) or their family members (75.14%).

The results emphasize the importance of diminishing the inter-group infections in the effort of substantial flattening/delaying of the epi(demiologic) curve with concomitant mitigation of disastrous economy and social consequences. To exemplify, splitting a population into m (say, 5 or 10) noninteracting groups while keeping intra-group interaction unchanged yields a stretched epidemiological curve having the maximum number of daily infections reduced and postponed in time by the same factor m (5 or 10). More generally, the study suggests a practical approach to fight against SARS- CoV- 2 virus spread based on population splitting into groups and minimizing intermingling between them. This strategy can be pursued by large-scale infrastructure reorganization of activity at different levels in big logistic units (e.g., large productive networks, factories, enterprises, warehouses, schools, (seasonal) harvest work). Importantly, unlike total lockdown, the proposed approach prevents economic ruin and keeps social life at a more bearable level than distancing everyone from anyone.

This article presents a literature review and discussion of the pharmacologic management of PHPT and severe hypercalcemia, which can be used as a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic until parathyroidectomy can be performed safely. METHODS: This narrative review was conducted by searching literature on the PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases using the terms primary hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, cinacalcet, bisphosphonates, denosumab, vitamin D, raloxifene, hormone replacement therapy, coronavirus, and COVID-19. FINDINGS: Appropriate monitoring and remote medical follow-up of these patients are essential until the resolution of the pandemic. Cinacalcet is the drug of choice for controlling hypercalcemia, whereas bisphosphonate or denosumab is the drug for improving bone mineral density. Combined therapy with cinacalcet and bisphosphonates or cinacalcet and denosumab should be considered when the effects on serum calcium and bone mineral density are simultaneously desired.

However, despite its potential advantages, its implementation has often led to dissatisfaction amongst health care professionals (HCP). This can be addressed using a user centred design (UCD) which is based on the philosophy that the final product should suit the users, rather than making the users suit the product. There is often no agreed best practice on the role of HCPs in the UCD process. In this paper, we describe practical qualitative methodologies that can be used by HCPs in the design, implementation and evaluation of ophthalmology EHRs. METHODS: A review of current qualitative usability methodologies was conducted by practising ophthalmologists who are also qualified health informaticians. RESULTS: We identified several qualitative methodologies that could be used for EHR evaluation. These include: 1. Tools for user centred design: shadowing and autoethnography, semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. 2. Tools for summative testing: card sort and reverse card sort, retrospective think aloud protocol, wireframing, screenshot testing and heat maps. CONCLUSION: High-yield, low-fidelity tools can be used to engage HCPs with the process of ophthalmology EHR design, implementation and evaluation.

Telehealth and telemedicine services, especially, fulfilled their promise by allowing patients to receive advice and care at a distance, making it safer for all concerned. Over the preceding years, professional societies, governments, and scholars examined ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) related to telemedicine and telehealth. Primary concerns evident from reviewing this literature have been quality of care, access, consent, and privacy.Objectives: To identify and summarize ethical, legal, and social issues related to information technology in healthcare, as exemplified by telehealth and telemedicine. To expand on prior analyses and address gaps illuminated by the COVID-19 experience. To propose future research directions.Methods: Literature was identified through searches, forward and backward citation chaining, and the authors knowledge of scholars and works in the area. EU and professional organizations guidelines, and nineteen scholarly papers were examined and categories created to identify ethical, legal, and social issues they addressed. A synthesis matrix was developed to categorize issues addressed by each source.Results: A synthesis matrix was developed and issues categorized as: quality of care, consent and autonomy, access to care and technology, legal and regulatory, clinician responsibilities, patient responsibilities, changed relationships, commercialization, policy, information needs, and evaluation, with subcategories that fleshed out each category. The literature primarily addressed quality of care, access, consent, and privacy. Other identified considerations were little discussed. These and newer concerns include: usability, tailoring services to each patient, curriculum and training, implementation, commercialization, and licensing and liability. The need for interoperability, data availability, cybersecurity, and informatics infrastructure also is more apparent. These issues are applicable to other information technologies in healthcare.Conclusions: Clinicians and organizations need updated guidelines for ethical use of telemedicine and telehealth care, and decision- and policy-makers need evidence to inform decisions. The variety of newly implemented telemedicine services is an on-going natural experiment presenting an unparalleled opportunity to develop an evidence-based way forward. The paper recommends evaluation using an applied ethics, context-sensitive approach that explores interactions among multiple factors and considerations. It suggests evaluation questions to investigate ethical, social, and legal issues through multi-method, sociotechnical, interpretive and ethnographic, and interactionist evaluation approaches.

Throughout their ontogeny, delta smelt may exhibit unique requirements and tolerances to environmental conditions including salinity. Here, we describe 22 stages of embryonic development of H. transpacificus that characterize early differentiation from the fertilized egg until hatching, allowing the identification of critical morphological features unique to this species. Additionally, we investigated aspects of physiological tolerance to environmental salinity during development. Embryos survived incubation at salinity treatments between 0.4 and 20 ppt, yet had lower hatch success at higher salinities. Prior to hatching, embryos exposed to higher salinities had increased osmolalities and reduced fractions of yolk implying that the elevated external salinity altered the physiology of the embryo and the environment internal to the chorion. Lastly, egg activation and fertilization appear to also be impacted by salinity. Altogether, we suggest that any potential tolerance to salinity during embryogenesis, a common feature in euryhaline teleost species, impacts life cycle transitions into, and out of, embryonic development.

After 36 hours, he deteriorated requiring initiation of non-invasive ventilatory (NIV) support. In the context of worsening clinical status, the patient received Tocilizumab as a single dose with good clinical response. Early Tocilizumab intervention in appropriately selected patients should improve the outcome and length of hospitalization in COVID-19 pneumonia. It can be used as an intensive therapy unit sparing agent allowing management of critically ill patients on a ward-based level.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To obtain a thorough understanding of substrate specificity of the protease, a substrate library of 19[Image: see text]8 variants was created by performing saturation mutagenesis on the autocleavage sequence at P5 to P3' positions. The substrate sequences were inserted between cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins so that the cleavage rates were monitored by in vitro fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The relative cleavage rate for different substrate sequences was correlated with various structural properties. P5 and P3 positions prefer residues with high -sheet propensity; P4 prefers small hydrophobic residues; P2 prefers hydrophobic residues without -branch. Gln is the best residue at P1 position, but observable cleavage can be detected with His and Met substitutions. P1' position prefers small residues, while P2' and P3' positions have no strong preference on residue substitutions. Noteworthy, solvent exposed sites such as P5, P3 and P3' positions favour positively charged residues over negatively charged one, suggesting that electrostatic interactions may play a role in catalysis. A super-active substrate, which combined the preferred residues at P5 to P1 positions, was found to have 2.8 fold higher activity than the wild-type sequence. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrated a strong structure-activity relationship between the 3CL(pro) and its substrate.

The long-term consequences of COVID-19 are not fully understood and there is no clear consensus on the definition of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). The reported prevalence of PASC widely varies from 10% up to 87%. The purpose of this study is to assess PASC in cancer patients following acute COVID-19 recovery. METHODS: We assessed cancer patients at MD Anderson Cancer Center who were diagnosed with COVID-19 disease between March 1, 2020 and Sept 1, 2020. Using patient questionnaires and medical chart reviews we followed these patients from March 2020 till May 2021. Patient questionnaires were sent out remotely daily for 14 days after COVID-19 diagnosis then weekly for 3 months, and then monthly thereafter. Chart reviews were conducted for each patient hospital re-admission and emergency department visit. These admissions were classified as either COVID-19 related or non-related. The persistence or emergence of new COVID19-related symptoms were captured at each COVID-19 related admission. RESULTS: We included 312 cancer patients with a median age of 57 years (18-86). The majority of patients had solid tumors (75%). Of the 312 patients, 188 (60%) reported long COVID-19 symptoms with a median duration of 7 months and up to 14 months after COVID-19 diagnosis. The most common symptoms reported included fatigue (82%), sleep disturbances (78%), myalgias (67%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (61%), followed by headache, altered smell or taste, dyspnea (47%) and cough (46%). A higher number of females reported a persistence of symptoms compared to males (63% vs 37%; p=0.036). Cancer type, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, and hospital admission during acute COVID-19 disease were comparable in both groups and did not seem to contribute to a higher number of long-COVID-19 patients in our study group. CONCLUSION: Long-COVID occurs in 60% of cancer patients and may persist up to 14 months after acute illness. The most common symptoms are fatigue, sleep disturbance, myalgia and gastro-intestinal symptoms. DISCLOSURES: Fareed Khawaja, MBBS, Eurofins Viracor (Research Grant or Support)","output":"300.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins act as master regulatory transcription factors of such specialized cell types. Plant stomata are cellular valves in the aerial epidermis for efficient gas exchange and water control. Stomatal differentiation is governed by sequential actions of three lineage-specific bHLH proteins, SPEECHLESS (SPCH), MUTE, and FAMA, specifying initiation and proliferation, commitment, and terminal differentiation, respectively. A broadly expressed bHLH, SCREAM (SCRM), heterodimerizes with SPCH/MUTE/FAMA and drives stomatal differentiation via switching its partners. Yet nothing is known about its heterodimerization properties or partner preference. Here, we report the role of the SCRM C-terminal ACT-like (ACTL) domain for heterodimerization selectivity. Our intragenic suppressor screen of a dominant scrm-D mutant identified the ACTL domain as a mutation hotspot. Removal of this domain or loss of its structural integrity abolishes heterodimerization with MUTE, but not with SPCH or FAMA, and selectively abrogates the MUTE direct target gene expression. Consequently, the scrm-D ACTL mutants confer massive clusters of arrested stomatal precursor cells that cannot commit to differentiation when redundancy is removed. Structural and biophysical studies further show that SPCH, MUTE, and FAMA also possess the C-terminal ACTL domain, and that ACTLa?ACTL heterodimerization is sufficient for partner selectivity. Our work elucidates a role for the SCRM ACTL domain in the MUTE-governed proliferation-differentiation switch and suggests mechanistic insight into the biological function of the ACTL domain, a module uniquely associated with plant bHLH proteins, as a heterodimeric partner selectivity interface.","output":"Intragenic suppressors unravel the role of the SCREAM ACT-like domain for bHLH partner selectivity in stomatal development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) utilizes the angiotensin\\\\converting enzyme\\\\2 (ACE\\\\2) receptor to enter human cells.

The primary outcome was in\\\\hospital mortality. Among these 781 patients, 133 (17.0%) used an ARB and 171 (21.9%) used an ACEI. While neither sex nor smoking status differed by user groups, patients on ACEI/ARB were older and more likely to have hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure. The overall mortality rate was 15.1% (118/781) and increased with age (P (Trend)<0.0001).

T helper 17 (Th17) cells are strongly associated with the pathogenesis of multiple CID, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. In line with the increasingly recognized contribution of innate immune cells to the modulation of dendritic cell (DC) function and DC-driven adaptive immune responses, we recently showed that neutrophils are required for DC-driven Th17 cell differentiation from human naive T cells. Consequently, recruitment of neutrophils to inflamed tissues and lymph nodes likely creates a highly inflammatory loop through the induction of Th17 cells that should be intercepted to attenuate disease progression. Tolerogenic therapy via DCs, the central orchestrators of the adaptive immune response, is a promising strategy for the treatment of CID. Tolerogenic DCs could restore immune tolerance by driving the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the periphery. In this review, we discuss the effects of the tolerogenic adjuvants vitamin D3 (VD3), corticosteroids (CS), and retinoic acid (RA) on both DCs and neutrophils and their potential interplay. We briefly summarize how neutrophils shape DC-driven T-cell development in general.

Methods: Mixed methods including a survey (n=429) which assessed socio-demographics and the psychological factors associated with vaccine uptake (i.e. confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation and collective responsibility) with binary logistic regression analysis. We also undertook focus groups and interviews (n=59) to further explore barriers and enablers to uptake using thematic analysis. Results: The survey analysis identified that older participants were more likely to accept the vaccine, as were those with higher perceptions of collective responsibility around vaccination, lower levels of complacency, and lower levels of constraints. Thematic analysis showed that concerns over vaccine side effects, lack of tailored information and knowledge, and a lack of trust and rapport with healthcare professionals were key barriers. In contrast, the importance of feeling protected, acceptance of being part of an at-risk group, and feeling a reduced sense of vulnerability after vaccination were seen as key enablers. Conclusions: Our findings showed that the decision to accept a vaccine against influenza is influenced by multiple sociodemographic and psychological factors.

Previous RSV burden of disease estimates used hospital-based surveillance data and modelled, rather than directly measured, community deaths. Given this uncertainty, we conducted a 3-year post-mortem prevalence study among young infants at a busy morgue in Lusaka, Zambiathe Zambia Pertussis RSV Infant Mortality Estimation (ZPRIME) study. METHODS: Infants were eligible for inclusion if they were aged between 4 days and less than 6 months and were enrolled within 48 h of death. Enrolment occurred mainly at the University Teaching Hospital of the University of Zambia Medical School (Lusaka, Zambia), the largest teaching hospital in Zambia. We extracted demographic and clinical data from medical charts and official death certificates, and we conducted verbal autopsies with the guardian or next of kin. RSV was identified using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR and stratified by age, time of year, and setting (community vs facility deaths). By combining the PCR prevalence data with syndromic presentation, we estimated the proportion of all infant deaths that were due to RSV. FINDINGS: The ZPRIME study ran from Aug 31, 2017, to Aug 31, 2020, except for from April 1 to May 6, 2020, during which data were not collected due to restrictions on human research at this time (linked to COVID-19). We enrolled 2286 deceased infants, representing 79% of total infant deaths in Lusaka. RSV was detected in 162 (7%) of 2286 deceased infants. RSV was detected in 102 (9%) of 1176 community deaths, compared with 10 (4%) of 236 early facility deaths (<48 h from admission) and 36 (5%) of 737 late facility deaths (48 h from admission). RSV deaths were concentrated in infants younger than 3 months (116 [72%] of 162 infants), and were clustered in the first half of each year and in the poorest and most densely populated Lusaka townships. RSV caused at least 28% (95% CI 10C46) of all infant deaths and 47% (13C81) of community deaths. INTERPRETATION: RSV was a major seasonal cause of overall infant mortality, particularly among infants younger than 3 months of age. Because most RSV deaths occurred in the community and would have been missed through hospital-based surveillance, the global burden of fatal RSV has probably been underestimated.

AIM To develop novel DESs coated with gemcitabine (GEM) and cisplatin (CIS)-coloaded nanofilms that can maintain the continuous and long-term release of antitumor agents in the bile duct to inhibit tumor growth and reduce systemic toxicity. METHODS Stents coated with different drug-eluting components were prepared by the mixed electrospinning method, with poly-L-lactide-caprolactone (PLCL) as the drug-loaded nanofiber membrane and GEM and/or CIS as the antitumor agents. Four different DESs were manufactured with four drug-loading ratios (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%), including bare-loaded (PLCL-0), single-drug-loaded (PLCL-GEM and PLCL-CIS), and dual-drug-loaded (PLCL-GC) stents. The drug release property, antitumor activity, and biocompatibility were evaluated in vitro and in vivo to confirm the feasibility and efficacy of this novel DES for ECC. RESULTS The in vitro drug release study showed the stable, continuous release of both GEM and CIS, which was sustained for over 30 d without an obvious initial burst, and a higher drug-loaded content induced a lower release rate. The drug-loading ratio of 10% was used for further experiments due to its ideal inhibitory efficiency and relatively low toxicity. All drug-loaded nanofilms effectively inhibited the growth of EGI-1 cells in vitro and the tumor xenografts of nude mice in vivo; in addition, the dual-loaded nanofilm (PLCL-GC) had a significantly better effect than the single-drug-loaded nanofilms (P < 0.05). No significant differences in the serological analysis (P > 0.05) or histopathological changes were observed between the single-loaded and drug-loaded nanofilms after stent placement in the normal porcine biliary tract. CONCLUSION This novel PLCL-GEM and CIS-eluting stent maintains continuous, stable drug release locally and inhibits tumor growth effectively in vitro and in vivo. It can also be used safely in normal porcine bile ducts. We anticipate that it might be considered an alternative strategy for the palliative therapy of ECC patients.","output":"Feasibility and efficacy evaluation of metallic biliary stents eluting gemcitabine and cisplatin for extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Various complications have been reported in patients with COVID-19 including pneumomediastinum. METHODS: The primary objective of the study was to determine the incidence of pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 positive patients who underwent CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). The secondary objectives were to analyse if the incidence of pneumomediastinum changed between March and May 2020 (peak of the first wave in the UK) and January 2021 (peak of the second wave in the UK) and to determine the mortality rate in patients with pneumomediastinum. We undertook an observational, retrospective, single-centre, cohort study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to Northwick Park Hospital. RESULTS: 74 patients in the first wave and 220 patients in the second wave met the study criteria. Two patients during the first wave and eleven patients during the second wave developed pneumomediastinum. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pneumomediastinum changed from 2.7% during the first wave to 5% during the second wave and this change was not statistically significant (p value 0.4057). The difference in mortality rates of patients with pneumomediastinum in both waves of COVID-19 (69.23%) versus patients without pneumomediastinum in both waves of COVID-19 (25.62%) was statistically significant (p value 0.0005). Many patients with pneumomediastinum were ventilated, which could be a confounding factor.

Several of the co-opted host factors bind to the viral RNA, which plays multiple roles, including mRNA function, as an assembly platform for the viral replicase (VRC), template for RNA synthesis, and encapsidation during infection. It is likely that remodeling of the viral RNAs and RNA-protein complexes during the switch from one step to another requires RNA helicases. In this paper, we have discovered a second group of cellular RNA helicases, including the eIF4AIII-like yeast Fal1p and the DDX5-like Dbp3p and the orthologous plant AtRH2 and AtRH5 DEAD box helicases, which are co-opted by tombusviruses. Unlike the previously characterized DDX3-like AtRH20/Ded1p helicases that bind to the 3 terminal promoter region in the viral minus-strand (?)RNA, the other class of eIF4AIII-like RNA helicases bind to a different cis-acting element, namely the 5 proximal RIII(?) replication enhancer (REN) element in the TBSV (?)RNA. We show that the binding of AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases to the TBSV (?)RNA could unwind the dsRNA structure within the RIII(?) REN. This unique characteristic allows the eIF4AIII-like helicases to perform novel pro-viral functions involving the RIII(?) REN in stimulation of plus-strand (+)RNA synthesis. We also show that AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases are components of the tombusvirus VRCs based on co-purification experiments. We propose that eIF4AIII-like helicases destabilize dsRNA replication intermediate within the RIII(?) REN that promotes bringing the 5 and 3 terminal (?)RNA sequences in close vicinity via long-range RNA-RNA base pairing. This newly formed RNA structure promoted by eIF4AIII helicase together with AtRH20 helicase might facilitate the recycling of the viral replicases for multiple rounds of (+)-strand synthesis, thus resulting in asymmetrical viral replication.","output":"The Expanding Functions of Cellular Helicases: The Tombusvirus RNA Replication Enhancer Co-opts the Plant eIF4AIII-Like AtRH2 and the DDX5-Like AtRH5 DEAD-Box RNA Helicases to Promote Viral Asymmetric RNA Replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction and Objectives Asthma is a complex disease with multiple interacting factors determining individual phenotypes We performed a service evaluation of children attending specialist paediatric respiratory clinics for their asthma at tertiary care hospital as part of routine follow up and whilst shielding according to NHS advice during the COVID 19 pandemic (March-July 2020) Method Patients and parents/guardians were asked to complete a pre-prepared series of questions about how their asthma had been affected by shielding as a part of telephone/video link follow-up consultations having shielded for between 2-5 months Results 58 families (Male 33, Female 25) provided data Mean age of respondents was 12 years (range 5-18 years) All families were shielding Only one patient had been admitted for acute asthma whilst shielding They were COVID-19 positive at the end of admission One other asymptomatic patient was COVID-19 positive through screening Only 11 (19%) reported being less likely to self-refer for symptoms with 6 (11%) more likely and 41 (70%) no difference Twenty-three (40%) reported better asthma control, 10 (17%) worse asthma and 25 (43%) no different Twenty-nine (50%) had an ACT-20 indicative of well controlled asthma 47 (81%) were using the same or less relief medication, 40 (69%) were sleeping the same or better at night and 38 (66%) were the same or less anxious Comparing asthma control to the same period in the previous year 28 (48%) reported better symptom control, 7 (12%) worse control and 23 (40%) no different Reasons reported for improved asthma are shown in table 1 Reasons for the 7 with worse control included increased seasonal allergic rhinitis 3 (43%) and more indoor aeroallergen exposure 3 (43%) Thirty-one families (53%) preferred video link (attend anywhere) consultations and 11 (19%) expressed a preference for face to face appointments Conclusion Overall severe asthmatics have experienced better symptom control during shielding Reasons are multiple although decreased infections were identified as a cause by the majority of families Ongoing care using video link consultations would be acceptable for the majority of families attending our service","output":"An evaluation of the impact of shielding to Avoid covid 19 infection on respiratory Symptoms in children with severe asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children and adolescents are not indifferent to the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the need to be forced to live in confinement.

The present study was carried out with the intention of studying the consequences of confinement on anxiety, sleep routines and executive functioning of 1,028 children and adolescents, aged from 6 to 18 years, residing in Spain to; assess if there are differences regarding these consequences in terms of sex and age; how anxiety affects executive functioning in males and females; and to examine the possible correlations between the measured variables. For this purpose, an online questionnaire containing five sections was designed: the first section gathers information on sociodemographic and health data, while the following sections gather information from different standardized scales which measure anxiety, sleep and executive functions, whose items were adapted in order to be completed by parents, and/or legal guardians. The statistical analyzes carried out highlights significant differences in executive functioning between males and females. In turn, in regards to age, greater difficulties were detected in anxiety in the 9 to 12 age group and greater sleep disturbances between 13 and 18 year olds. On the other hand, significant differences were found in intra-sexual executive functioning depending on whether they presented greater or lesser anxiety, with executive functioning being more tendentiously maladjusted in males than in females, revealing a significantly relevant effect size (p = 0.001; (2) = 0.27 BRIEF-2; (2) = 0.19 BDEFS-CA; 95%).

Currently used rodent models have yielded little clinical success, however large animal models may provide a more suitable alternative to improve clinical translation. We sought to develop a model of acute proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke in sheep, including both permanent occlusion and transient occlusion with reperfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS 18 adult male and female Merino sheep were randomly allocated to one of three groups (n = 6/gp): 1) sham surgery; 2) permanent proximal MCA occlusion (MCAO); or 3) temporary MCAO with aneurysm clip. All animals had invasive arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure and brain tissue oxygen monitoring. At 4 h following vessel occlusion or sham surgery animals were killed by perfusion fixation. Brains were processed for histopathological examination and infarct area determination. 6 further animals were randomized to either permanent (n = 3) or temporary MCAO (n = 3) and then had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 4 h after MCAO. RESULTS Evidence of ischemic injury in an MCA distribution was seen in all stroke animals. The ischemic lesion area was significantly larger after permanent (28.8%) compared with temporary MCAO (14.6%). Sham animals demonstrated no evidence of ischemic injury. There was a significant reduction in brain tissue oxygen partial pressure after permanent vessel occlusion between 30 and 210 mins after MCAO. MRI at 4 h demonstrated complete proximal MCA occlusion in the permanent MCAO animals with a diffusion deficit involving the whole right MCA territory, whereas temporary MCAO animals demonstrated MRA evidence of flow within the right MCA and smaller predominantly cortical diffusion deficits. CONCLUSIONS Proximal MCAO can be achieved in an ovine model of stroke via a surgical approach.

While the disparities are clear, the reasons underlying the rapidity of disease spread - characterized by the basic reproduction ratio R 0 - in these communities are less so. Here, we investigate the relative impact of disparities in socioeconomic, environmental, and lung health factors on R 0 across 12 major metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the US at the county-level. We inferred county-level R 0 values using an established metapopulation epidemiological model corresponding to the period 1 March-30 April 2020 marked by a rapid surge in COVID-19 cases across the US and implementation of strict lockdown measures. We find that disparities in long-term, ambient PM2.5 exposure (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter 2.5 m or less) and population density have an outsized effect on R 0 in comparison to disparities in the other factors. We also find that the effect of increasing population density on R 0 is dependent on ambient PM2.5 mass concentrations. PM2.5 exposure has a well-established causal effect with increased risks and severe outcomes during previous infectious disease outbreaks. Overall, we find the largest disparities in PM2.5 exposure, population density, and associated increase in R 0 among the Hispanic-American population, followed by Asian-American and African-American populations, respectively. Longstanding geographic segregation of minority communities has led to extremely large fluctuations in county-level racial and ethnic minority fractions. As such, we conclude by providing each MSA with a roadmap for identifying which communities should be targeted for PM2.5 mitigation policy implementation.

Competing accounts suggest that the gap is due either to women's stereotype-congruent behavior in negotiations or to backlash enacted toward women for stereotype-incongruent behavior. In this article, we use a novel data set of over 2,500 individual negotiators to examine how negotiation performance varies as a function of gender and the strength of one's alternative to a negotiated agreement. We find that the gender gap in negotiation outcomes exists only when female negotiators have a strong outside option. Furthermore, our large data set allows us to examine an understudied performance outcome, rate of impasse. We find that negotiations in which at least one negotiator is a woman with a strong alternative disproportionately end in impasse, a performance outcome that leaves considerable potential value unallocated. In addition, we find that these gender differences in negotiation performance are not due to gender differences in aspirations, reservation values, or first offers. Overall, these findings are consistent with a backlash account, whereby counterparts are less likely to come to an agreement and therefore reach a potentially worse outcome when one party is a female negotiator empowered by a strong alternative.

Beyond the regulation of gas exchange, enhanced awareness of respiratory sensations is directly related to psychiatric symptoms such as panic and anxiety. Indeed, chronic breathlessness (dyspnea) is associated with a fourfold increase in the risk of developing depression and anxiety, and the regulation of the breath is a key aspect of many mindfulness-based approaches to the treatment of mental illness. Physiologically speaking, the ability to accurately monitor respiratory sensations is important for optimizing cardiorespiratory function during athletic exertion, and can be a key indicator of illness. Given the important role of respiroception in mental and physical health, it is unsurprising that there is increased interest in the quantification of respiratory psychophysiology across different perceptual and metacognitive levels of the psychological hierarchy. Compared to other more popular modalities of interoception, such as in the cardiac domain, there are relatively few methods available for measuring aspects of respiroception. Existing inspiratory loading tasks are difficult to administer and frequently require expensive medical equipment, or offer poor granularity in their quantification of respiratory-related perceptual ability.

In this study, we explore patient/caregiver satisfaction with the rapid institution of telehealth in our pediatric plastic surgery clinic and factors affecting satisfaction scores. METHODS: From March 2020 to February 2021, families of pediatric patients seen via video telehealth in the pediatric plastic surgery clinic at our center were invited to participate in a posttelehealth session survey. Telehealth visits encompassed both preliminary consultations as well as follow-up visits. After appropriate consent was obtained, patients' families completed a posttelehealth survey conveying demographics and satisfaction with telehealth via a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS: Seventy eight of 131 eligible families elected to participate. Visit types included the following: initial consultations (23.1%), preoperative visits (10.3%), postoperative visits (29.5%), and follow-up visits (37.1%).

We examined anxiety, symptom awareness, trust and associated behavioural responses in the first three weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 (covid-19) outbreak in Thailand. We collected data on-street at randomly selected locations in Bangkok. Of 274 potential respondents, 203 (74.7%) responded. A four-item measure assessed anxiety, with open-ended questions assessing knowledge of symptoms, trusted information sources and measures taken to avoid infection. Respondents reported good awareness of the prime symptoms of the Coronovirus. Binary logistic regressions controlling for sex and age found the more anxious avoided the Chinese, people who were coughing, crowded places and public transport or flying. Younger respondents reported greater trust in foreign media and older populations information from national government. Trust in doctors online was positively associated with handwashing, avoidance of coughing people and keeping fit; trust in national government with avoiding coughing people, keeping fit, avoiding public transport and avoiding Chinese people. We conclude that anxiety can motivate both desirable and undesirable behaviours during pandemic outbreaks. Effective and targeted communication by trusted sources is needed to motivate preventive actions but also limit unnecessary or disruptive behaviours.","output":"Anxiety and public responses to covid-19: Early data from Thailand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Researchers at the Precision Immunology Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine (PrIISM), New York, describe their contribution to the global research effort against COVID-19 by trying to separate signal from noise in the preprint arena.","output":"Advancing scientific knowledge in times of pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective management of the COVID-19 pandemic requires widespread and frequent testing of the population for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Saliva has emerged as an attractive alternative to nasopharyngeal samples for surveillance testing as it does not require specialized personnel or materials for its collection and can be easily provided by the patient. We have developed a simple, fast, and sensitive saliva-based testing workflow that requires minimal sample treatment and equipment. After sample inactivation, RNA is quickly released and stabilized in an optimized buffer, followed by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and detection of positive samples using a colorimetric and/or fluorescent readout. The workflow was optimized using 1,670 negative samples collected from 172 different individuals over the course of 6 months. Each sample was spiked with 50 copies/L of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus to monitor the efficiency of viral detection. Using pre-defined clinical samples, the test was determined to be 100% specific and 97% sensitive, with a limit of detection comparable to commercially available RT-qPCR-based diagnostics. The method was successfully implemented in a CLIA laboratory setting for workplace surveillance and reporting. From April 2021-February 2022, more than 30,000 self-collected samples from 755 individuals were tested and 85 employees tested positive mainly during December and January, consistent with high infections rates in Massachusetts and nationwide.

Hypoxia affects histone modifications by altering the activities of histone-modifying enzymes and the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) isoforms. Synthetic hypoxia mimetics promote a similar response, but how accurately the hypoxia mimetics replicate the effects of limited oxygen availability on the levels of histone PTMs is uncertain. Here we report studies on the profiling of the global changes to PTMs on intact histones in response to hypoxia/hypoxia-related stresses using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We demonstrate that intact protein LC-MS profiling is a relatively simple and robust method for investigating potential effects of drugs on histone modifications. The results provide insights into the profiles of PTMs associated with hypoxia and inform on the extent to which hypoxia and hypoxia mimetics cause similar changes to histones. These findings imply chemically-induced hypoxia does not completely replicate the substantial effects of physiological hypoxia on histone PTMs, highlighting that caution should be used in interpreting data from their use.","output":"Hypoxia and hypoxia mimetics differentially modulate histone post-translational modifications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To assess modulation of neutralizing antibody titers in COVID-19 patients and understand association of variables such as age, presence of comorbidity, BMI and gender with antibody titers. METHODS: Patients (n=100) diagnosed from 20(th) March 2020-17(th) August 2020 and treated at two large hospitals from Pune, India were included and followed up (clinical and serologic) for varied periods. IgG-anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Spike protein-based ELISA) and neutralizing antibody titers (NAb, PRNT) were determined in all the samples. RESULTS: Of the 100 patients enrolled initially (median 60 days of diagnosis), follow up samples were collected from 70 patients (median 106 days of diagnosis). Overall, NAb titers reduced significantly (p < 0.001) and as early as 3-4 months. During two visits, 20% and 7.1% patients reported some symptoms. At the first visit, NAb titers were higher in patients with severe disease (p<0.001), comorbidities (p<0.005), age <50 years (p<0.05) and male gender (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis identified older age (p<0.001), duration post-diagnosis and female gender as independent variables influencing NAb titers (negative correlation, p<0.05). During the follow-up, reduction in NAb titers was recorded in patients with comorbidity (p<0.05), mild disease (p<0.05), age <50years (p<0.05), higher BMI (p<0.05) and male gender (p <0.001). Serology identified six cases of asymptomatic reinfections. CONCLUSIONS: Decline of NAb titers was associated with age<50 years, mild disease, comorbidities, higher BMI and male gender.

As a group of Chinese physicians, nutritionists and scientists working on the frontline treating COVID-19 patients, we aim to integrate our experiences and the current clinical evidence to address this pressing issue in this article. Based on our clinical observations and available evidence, we recommend the following practice. Firstly, the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 tool should be used routinely and periodically; for patients with a score 3, oral nutritional supplements should be given immediately. Secondly, for patients receiving the antiviral agents lopinavir/ritonavir, gastrointestinal side effects should be monitored for and timely intervention provided. Thirdly, for feeding, the enteral route should be the first choice. In patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, establishing a jejunal route as early as possible can guarantee the feeding target being achieved if gastric dilatation occurs. Fourthly, we suggest a permissive underfeeding strategy for severe/critical patients admitted to the intensive care unit during the first week of admission, with the energy target no more than 20 kcal/kg/day (for those on mechanical ventilation, this target may be lowered to 10C15 kcal/kg/day) and the protein target around 1.0C1.2 g/kg/day. If the inflammatory condition is significantly alleviated, the energy target may be gradually increased to 25C30 kcal/kg/day and the protein target to 1.2C1.5 g/kg/day. Fifthly, supplemental parenteral nutrition should be used with caution. Lastly, omega-3 fatty acids may be used as immunoregulators, intravenous administration of omega-3 fatty emulsion (10 g/day) at an early stage may help to reduce the inflammatory reaction.","output":"Gut, metabolism and nutritional Support for COVID-19: Experiences from China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact countries around the globe, refining our understanding of its transmission dynamics and the effectiveness of interventions is imperative. In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading. These have important implications for the planning of relaxing social distancing and, more generally, designing optimal control measures.","output":"Characterizing super-spreading events and age-specific infectivity of COVID-19 transmission in Georgia, USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text]","output":"PCSK9 inhibitors for COVID\\\\19: an opportunity to enhance the antiviral action of interferon in patients with hypercholesterolaemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines is a global priority and the best hope for ending the COVID-19 pandemic.

DESIGN: This study was based on the COVID-19 Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey (COINLICS), a national retrospective survey established in early May 2020. The questionnaire was distributed through social media platforms. The sociodemographic information and routine dietary patterns before and after lockdown of participants were investigated. t tests and &#967;2 tests were used to compare the differences in consumption patterns of twelve major food groups and beverages between sex and across educational levels before and after lockdown. Factor analysis was employed to obtain the main dietary patterns. SETTINGS: China. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10 082 youths. RESULTS: A significant decrease was observed in the average weekly frequency of rice intake, while significant increases were observed in the frequency of intake of wheat products, other staple foods, fish, eggs, fresh vegetables, preserved vegetables, fresh fruit and dairy products (all P values < 001). Heterogeneities of average weekly frequency existed between sex and across educational levels to different extents. The three main dietary patterns derived were loaded most heavily on dairy products, rice and wheat products, separately; the rice pattern became more dominant than the wheat products pattern after lockdown. The frequency of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption had decreased, while the frequency of other beverages had increased.

METHODS: Data came from an online survey of United States pregnant women (n = 715), conducted in May 2020. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale were used to assess depressive symptoms, thoughts of self-harm, and moderate or severe anxiety. Multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the associations of COVID-19 experiences with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Participants were racially diverse. The prevalence of adverse mental health outcomes was 36% for probable depression, 20% for thoughts of self-harm, and 22% for anxiety. Women who reported family members dying from COVID-19 had four times higher odds of having thoughts of self-harm than women who did not experience family death. Depression was more prevalent among women who canceled or reduced medical appointments. Women were more likely to have worse mental health outcomes if they expressed worry about getting financial or emotional/social support, about their pregnancy, or about family or friends. Strict social distancing was positively associated with depression. A higher proportion of adults working from home was inversely associated with depression and thoughts of self-harm.

As the death ratio due to the Virus increases, the medical fraternity and pharmacologists are working relentlessly to identify and prescribe a standardized and effective course of treatment for treating COVID-19 patients. However, medical specialists are confused about opting for the most efficacious course of treatment because the patients infected with this virus have varied symptoms at different stages. In this league, our research study attempts to conduct an empirical analysis to identify which course of treatment is the most effective and preferred one for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. The study proposes to achieve this objective by employing a scientific computation based symmetrical methodology. The present study has adopted a well-established and highly effective Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach named Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets based Analytical Hierarchy Process-Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (HFLTS-AHP-TOPSIS) Methodology. The computation based symmetrical methodology evaluates the various selected course of treatments identified through different research articles and guidelines suggested by different countries, and evaluates them on the basis of opinions suggested by medical experts (including doctors, industry experts, and others) and practitioners.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients at a single center with COVID-19 infection and shock who were treated with angiotensin II. The hemodynamic response to angiotensin II was estimated by recording the mean arterial pressure, norepinephrine equivalent dose (NED) and urine output. RESULTS: Ten patients with COVID-19 related shock were treated with angiotensin II. Over the initial 6 hours, the average the norepinephrine equivalent dose decreased by 30.4% (from 64.6 mcg/min to 44 mcg/min) without a significant change in the mean arterial pressure (0.7% decrease). Six patients experienced at least a 25% reduction in norepinephrine equivalent dose by 6 hours, and two experienced at least a 50% reduction. CONCLUSIONS: On average, the hemodynamic response to angiotensin II in COVID-19 related shock was favorable. Two patients had a marked rapid improvement. Given the relationship of SARS-CoV-2 with the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, further evaluation of angiotensin II for the treatment of COVID-19 related shock is warranted.","output":"Angiotensin II Administration in Patients with COVID-19 Shock"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic begins in China in 2019 and because of the connections of China with the rest of the World in trade and businesses, the virus started to spread quickly around the World This rapidly spread causes serious negative effects on education, small, medium, and large businesses, economic, health, food security, employment, traveling, environment, energy, market, even causes countries to take loans and their debt rises The specific knowledge about COVID-19 also affects education, which is a source of human capital formation The data obtained from an online survey, covered from June 2020 to October 2020 The methods used are descriptive statistics, correlation, and multiple regression analysis As the results generated, we confirmed that peoples perception about COVID-19 pandemic increases with mandatory testing in schools In addition, the results also revealed that the work from the home measure is an insignificant negative impact on perception 10% increases in work from the home measure, decreases peoples perception by 0 0305% The results also confirmed that the reopening of schools had significant negative impact on mandatory testing in schools 10% increases in the reopening of school, decrease the mandatory testing in schools by 0 071% In this regard, the main aim of this research is to understand the role of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, staff development, and training in Africa","output":"Potential Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on Education, Staff development and Training in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We sought to systematically review the literature and perform a meta-analysis by assessing the prevalence of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infections from a number of studies conducted in Iran.

OBJECTIVE: To understand the onset, severity, and recovery of sensory changes associated with COVID-19 infection, this study will longitudinally track changes in chemosensory acuity among people with suspected COVID-19 infection using standardized test stimuli that are self-administered over 28 days. METHODS: In a prospective, case-controlled observational study, volunteers will be recruited when they present for COVID-19 screening by respiratory tract polymerase chain reaction test (swab test). The volunteers will initially complete a series of questionnaires to record their recent changes in smell and taste ability, followed by a brief standardized smell and taste test. Participants will receive a home-use smell and taste test kit to prospectively complete daily self-assessments of their smell and taste acuity at their place of residence for up to 4 weeks, with all data submitted for collection through web-based software. RESULTS: This study has been approved by the Domain Specific Review Board of the National Healthcare Group, Singapore, and is funded by the Biomedical Research Council Singapore COVID-19 Research Fund. Recruitment began on July 23, 2020, and will continue through to March 31, 2021. As of October 2, 2020, 69 participants had been recruited. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study will be the first to collect longitudinal data on changes to smell and taste sensitivity related to clinically diagnosed COVID-19 infection, confirmed by PCR swab test, in a population-based cohort. The findings will provide temporal insights on the onset, severity, and recovery of sensory changes with COVID-19 infection, the consistency of symptoms, and the frequency of full smell recovery among patients with COVID-19. This self-administered and cost-effective approach has many advantages over self-report questionnaireCbased methods and provides a more objective measure of smell and taste changes associated with COVID-19 infection; this will encourage otherwise asymptomatic individuals who are potential spreaders of the virus to self-isolate and seek formal medical diagnosis if they experience a sudden change in sensory acuity. This broadened case finding can potentially help control the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the emergence of clusters of infections.

METHODS: Diquafosol was administered for 8wk to 3 patient groups who received diquafosol as add-on therapy to existing medication (Add group, n=150); received diquafosol only (Monotherapy group, n=196); or discontinued part of their existing medication in favor of diquafosol (Switch group, n=11). Tear break-up time (TBUT), cornea and conjunctival staining based on National Eye Institute/Industry scoring scheme, subjective symptoms using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire, and meibum quality and expressibility were evaluated at baseline, week 4, and week 8. RESULTS: The mean TBUT increased (from 3.46, 3.92, and 5.84s, respectively, to 5.15, 5.53, and 8.59s, respectively) and corneal staining score decreased (from 2.23, 2.24, and 3.09, respectively, to 0.85, 0.97, and 1.64, respectively) in a time-dependent manner from baseline to week 8 in all three groups.

Case 55 year old female with past history of diabetes, CVA (8 years back), recently diagnosed COVID 19 who presented to ED with chest pain for 18 hours. She was noted to have ST elevation in anterolateral leads and was taken for emergent angiogram. Angiogram showed large ostial LAD thrombus with thrombotic occlusion of distal LAD1. Decision-making Considering thrombus burden, several runs of aspiration thrombectomy was performed followed by balloon dilation. No distal flow was noted. Subsequently, 2 mg IC alteplase was infused twice, followed by thrombectomy. Repeat angiogram showed TIMI 0 flow. Intracoronary ultrasound (IVUS) was performed which showed heavy thrombus burden with no plaque rupture. PTCA of ostial LAD was performed afterwards with 4.0 x 15 mm compliant balloon. Thrombus was persistently noted in ostial LAD with TIMI 0 flow distally. She was started on aspirin, ticagrelor, heparin drip and 12 hour tirofiban infusion. 24 hours later she was taken back to the cath lab due to on and off chest pain and persistent ST elevation on EKG. Repeat angiogram showed persistent ostial LAD thrombus with TIMI 2 distal flow. PCI of ostial LAD was subsequently performed with excellent final result2.

We performed multiplex PCR-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) to obtain the genome sequences of clinical HTNV in urine specimens containing ultra-low amounts of viral genomes. The epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses of HTNV demonstrated geographically homogenous clustering with those in Apodemus agrarius captured in highly endemic areas, indicating that phylogeographic tracing of HTNV genomes reveals the potential infection sites of patients with HFRS. Genetic exchange analyses showed a genetic configuration compatible with HTNV L segment exchange in nature.

While some countries are still grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, others have fared better and have established relative normalcy quickly. The rapid transmission rate of the virus has shown a greater need for efficient and technologically modern containment measures. The use of digital tools to facilitate strict containment measures in countries that have faired well against the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked both interest and controversy. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we compare the precautions taken against the spread of COVID-19, particularly the use of digital tools in contact tracing, and propose policies that could be utilized in the U.S. for future COVID-19 waves or pandemics. METHODS: COVID-19 death rates data were obtained from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) accessed through the Our World in Data database, and were evaluated based on population size per 100,000 from December 31, 2019 to September 6, 2020. All policies and measures enacted were obtained from their respective governmental websites. RESULTS: We found a strong association between lower death rates per capita and countries that implemented early mask use and strict border control measures that included mandatory quarantine using digital tools. There is a significant difference in the number of deaths per 100,000 when comparing Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore versus the U.S., Spain, and Italy. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our research, it is evident that early intervention with the use of digital tools has a strong correlation for containing COVID-19. Infection rates and subsequent deaths in Italy, Spain, and more specifically the U.S. could have been much lower with early mask use and, more importantly, timely border control measures utilizing modern digital tools. Thus, we propose that the U.S. execute the following national policies should a public health emergency be declared: (1) Immediately establish a National Command responsible for enacting strict mandatory guidelines enforced by federal and state governments, including national mask use. (2) Mandate civilian cooperation with health officials in contact tracing and quarantine orders. Incoming travelers to the U.S. and those quarantined will be required to download a contact tracing app. We acknowledge the countries we studied differ in their cultures, political systems, and reporting criteria for COVID-19 deaths. Further research may need to be conducted to address these limitations; however, we believe that the proposed policies could protect the American public.","output":"Proposal for Using Digital Tools in Mitigating a Pandemic: Lessons Learned from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)Cassociated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) is an umbrella term for the behavioural, psychiatric, intellectual, academic, neuropsychological and psychosocial manifestations of TSC. Although TAND affects 90% of individuals with TSC during their lifetime, these manifestations are relatively under-assessed, under-treated and under-researched. We performed a comprehensive scoping review of all TAND research to date (a) to describe the existing TAND research landscape and (b) to identify knowledge gaps to guide future TAND research. METHODS: The study was conducted in accordance with stages outlined within the Arksey and OMalley scoping review framework. Ten research questions relating to study characteristics, research design and research content of TAND levels and clusters were examined. RESULTS: Of the 2841 returned searches, 230 articles published between 1987 and 2020 were included (animal studies = 30, case studies = 47, cohort studies = 153), with more than half published since the term TAND was coined in 2012 (118/230; 51%). Cohort studies largely involved children and/or adolescents (63%) as opposed to older adults (16%). Studies were represented across 341 individual research sites from 45 countries, the majority from the USA (89/341; 26%) and the UK (50/341; 15%). Only 48 research sites (14%) were within lowCmiddle income countries (LMICs). Animal studies and case studies were of relatively high/high quality, but cohort studies showed significant variability. Of the 153 cohort studies, only 16 (10%) included interventions. None of these were non-pharmacological, and only 13 employed remote methodologies (e.g. telephone interviews, online surveys). Of all TAND clusters, the autism spectrum disorderClike cluster was the most widely researched (138/230; 60%) and the scholastic cluster the least (53/200; 27%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the recent increase in TAND research, studies that represent participants across the lifespan, LMIC research sites and non-pharmacological interventions were identified as future priorities. The quality of cohort studies requires improvement, to which the use of standardised direct behavioural assessments may contribute. In human studies, the academic level in particular warrants further investigation. Remote technologies could help to address many of the TAND knowledge gaps identified.

Consequently, pulmonary embolism is a recognized complication of COVID-19. Currently, the need for Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) relies on the Wells score and serum D-dimer levels. However, since COVID-19 patients have a different thrombotic and inflammatory milieu, the usefulness of the Wells score deserves further exploration for this patient population. We aimed to explore the ability of the Wells score to predict pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients found to have a CTPA and a COVID-19 diagnosis during the same admission were selected for analysis. Patients age and gender, CTPA results, and associated D-dimer levels were entered in a database. The Wells score sensitivity and specificity were calculated at different values, and an area under the curve of a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC/ROC) measured. RESULTS: Of 459 patients with COVID-19, 64 had a CTPA and 12 (19%) had evidence of pulmonary embolism. Previous or current evidence of deep vein thrombosis, a Wells score above four points, and serum D-dimer levels five times above age-adjusted upper normal values were associated with pulmonary embolism. However, only 33% of patients with PE had a Wells score of four points or higher.

The optimized compound 6a, however, displays a much lower micromolar antiviral activity (EC(50) value of 3.95 M), considerably better cytotoxic liability (CC(50) value of 260 M) and consequently an improved SI of greater than 61. Therefore, we report the identification of a promising novel compound class that has the potential for further development of antiviral drugs against the CHIKV.","output":"Identification of 2-(4-(Phenylsulfonyl)piperazine-1-yl)pyrimidine Analogues as Novel Inhibitors of Chikungunya Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We assessed the effects of COVID-19 infection on nasal mucociliary activity. METHODS: The study was conducted in the pandemic wards of Adiyaman University Training and Research Hospital during April and May 2020. All patients admitted to the COVID-19 pandemic wards during the study period were invited to participate in the study. The study included 40 adults who agreed to participate and underwent a mucociliary clearance test successfully. The primary outcome was mucociliary clearance time and the secondary variables of interest were age, sex, and sino-nasal outcome test-22 scores. The control group included 40 concomitant healthy patients who visited the outpatient ear, nose and throat clinic with non-nasal symptoms. RESULTS: The study included 40 COVID-19-positive patients and 40 healthy controls. The mean mucociliary clearance times of the study (15.53  5.57 min) and control (9.50  3.70 min) groups were significantly different (Z = 4.675, p < 0.001). However, the mucociliary clearance time was not significantly different between males and females (t = 0.590, p = 0.558). CONCLUSIONS: Nasal mucociliary clearance time was prolonged in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Thus, we conclude that smell and taste are crucial symptoms that should not be overlooked in patients suspected of COVID-19 disease.","output":"Assessment of mucociliary clearance as an indicator of nasal function in patients with COVID-19: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe pandemic of COVID-19 has brought a disastrous impact on every single aspect of human life and activities. The economic and health sectors are most affected by restriction on public movement, daily activities, and burden of coronavirus infection through increased infection and hospitalisation rate. Most research focused on front liners but they overlooked ambulance and healthcare drivers.ObjectivesTo determine the stress status of healthcare drivers in Malaysia and its associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted among randomly selected 163 healthcare drivers in Negeri Sembilan State Health Department, Malaysia, using self-reported validated questionnaires.ResultsA majority of healthcare drivers were male (100%), married (90.1%) with their highest education consisting of a high school certificate (90.1%). Ethnically, they consisted of Malay (95.7%), Indian (3.7%) and Chinese (0.6%). Three out of ten healthcare drivers were ambulance drivers, while the rest were non ambulance drivers. The prevalence of stress among healthcare drivers was 7.4% (95% CI: 3.7, 11.7). Higher prevalence was found among ambulance drivers compared to non ambulance drivers;10.6% and 6.0% respectively. There was a significant association between stress and smoking status, performing on-call and duration of working hours in a similar unit.ConclusionThe study revealed that there was a low prevalence of stress among healthcare drivers in Malaysia during the pandemic. The reduced life threatening tasks, fewer emergency incidents and lesser assigned tasks throughout the movement control order during the COVID-19 pandemic could have contributed to the low prevalence statistics among the healthcare drivers in Malaysia. In addition, the effort by the Occupational and Environmental Health Unit, Negeri Sembilan State Health Department in providing consistent safety and health training including stress management might have assisted healthcare drivers to cope with the stressed situation both mentally and physically.","output":"Stress status of healthcare drivers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Manipulating weakly bound helium dimers with ultrafast laser pulses reveals their quantum behaviour This method opens a route towards studying the low-energy dynamics of other exotic and fragile quantum states","output":"Gently stirred not shaken"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This study aimed to identify the programmed death ligand-1 (PDL1, also termed as CD274) and its positively correlated immune checkpoint genes (ICGs) and to determine the immune subtypes of CD274-centered ICG combinations in oral and squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Materials and Methods: Firstly, the 95 ICGs obtained via literature reviews were identified in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database in relation to OSCC, and such 88 ICG expression profiles were extracted. ICGs positively correlated with CD274 were utilized for subsequent analysis. The relationship between ICGs positively correlated with CD274 and immunotherapy biomarkers (tumor mutation burden (TMB), and adaptive immune resistance pathway genes) was investigated, and the relationships of these genes with OSCC clinical features were explored. The prognostic values of CD274 and its positively correlated ICGs and also their associated gene pairs were revealed using the survival analysis. Results: Eight ICGs, including CTLA4, ICOS, TNFRSF4, CD27, B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), ADORA2A, CD40LG, and CD28, were found to be positively correlated with CD274. Among the eight ICGs, seven ICGs (CTLA4, ICOS, TNFRSF4, CD27, BTLA, CD40LG, and CD28) were significantly negatively correlated with TMB. The majority of the adaptive immune resistance pathway genes were positively correlated with ICGs positively correlated with CD274. The survival analysis utilizing the TCGA-OSCC data showed that, although CD274 was not significantly associated with overall survival (OS), the majority of ICGs positively correlated with CD274 (BTLA, CD27, CTLA4, CD40LG, CD28, ICOS, and TNFRSF4) were significantly correlated with OS, whereby their low-expression predicted a favorable prognosis. The survival analysis based on the gene pair subtypes showed that the combination subtypes of CD274_low/BTLA_low, CD274_low/CD27_low, CD274_low/CTLA4_low, CD8A_high/BTLA_low, CD8A_high/CD27_low, and CD8A_high/CTLA4_low predicted favorable OS.

This study sought to examine the views of oncology health care providers (HCP) on the value and impact of virtual care models in clinical practice. Materials and Methods: A semi-structured interview-survey was developed to compare provider practice patterns between May 2019 and May 2020. Questions were designed to determine provider-perceived value and impact of virtual visits on clinical interactions with patients. HCP (including physicians, dentists, and nurse practitioners) at a provincial oncology institution were invited to participate. Responses to the interview questions were de-identified and HCP names were replaced with a study code. Quantitative questions were interpreted with descriptive statistics. Qualitative results were analyzed and iteratively coded by multiple reviewers for emerging themes. Results: Among 531 invited participants, 61 completed the interview-survey and 60 were included in the final analysis. Of those interviewed, 47% were radiation oncologists and 33% were medical oncologists. The remainder of HCP interviewed (n=12) included functional imaging physicians, general practitioners in oncology, hereditary cancer physicians, nurse practitioners, palliative care physicians, psychiatrists, and surgical oncologists. Most oncology providers (87%) desired the continuation of virtual visits as part of their clinical practice so long as barriers to integration were addressed. Barriers identified included limited access to physical resources, such as hardware (70% responses) and quiet spaces (54% responses), insufficient logistic support such as information technology services (84% responses) and operational workflows (46% responses), the absence of guidelines to select patients for this delivery model (38% responses), and concerns regarding HCP liability, security and privacy (30% responses).

An example of classifying high-dimensional ordinal data is to use gene expressions to predict the ordinal drug response, which has been increasingly studied in pharmacogenetics. Classical ordinal classification methods are typically not able to tackle high-dimensional data and standard high-dimensional classification methods discard the ordering information among the classes. Existing work of high-dimensional ordinal classification approaches usually assume a linear ordinality among the classes. We argue that manually-labeled ordinal classes may not be linearly arranged in the data space, especially in high-dimensional complex problems. RESULTS: We propose a new approach that can project high-dimensional data into a lower discriminating subspace, where the innate ordinal structure of the classes is uncovered. The proposed method weights the features based on their rank correlations with the class labels and incorporates the weights into the framework of linear discriminant analysis. We apply the method to predict the response to two types of drugs for patients with Multiple Myeloma, respectively. A comparative analysis with both ordinal and nominal existing methods demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve a competitive predictive performance while honoring the intrinsic ordinal structure of the classes. We provide interpretations on the genes that are selected by the proposed approach to understand their drug-specific response mechanisms.

Though the virus originated in China, it has spread rapidly across the world due its firmly established community transmission. To successfully tackle the spread and further infection, there needs a clear multidimensional understanding of the molecular mechanisms. Henceforth, 942 viral genome sequences were analysed to predict the core genomes crucial in virus life cycle. Additionally, 35 small interfering RNA transcripts were predicted that can target specifically the viral core proteins and reduce pathogenesis. The crystal structure of CoViD-19 main protease-6LU7 was chosen as an attractive target due to the factors that there were fewer mutations and whose structure had significant identity to the annotated protein sequence of the core genome. Drug repurposing of both recruiting and non recruiting drugs was carried out through molecular docking procedures to recognize bitolterol as a good inhibitor of CoViD -19 protease. The study was extended further to screen antiviral phytocompounds through quantitative structure activity relationship and molecular docking to identify davidigenin, from licorice as the best novel lead with good interactions and binding energy. The docking of the best compounds in all three categories was validated with molecular dynamics simulations which implied stable binding of the drug and lead molecule.

This study was conducted to estimate the incidence of self-reported COVID-19 infection among physicians and its possible associated factors. Methods: An online national survey using Survey Monkey was initiated to collect sociodemographic e.g. age and sex, occupational e.g. place and duration of work, and clinical data e.g. COVID symptoms and laboratory investigations, and to describe affected physicians' diagnoses. Results: The self-reported incidence of COVID-19 infection was found to be 65.4% among studied physicians.

However, empirical evidence reveals high variability in affective response to different exercise modalities. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to compare acute affective response and its variation during three different endurance exercise modalities: (a) moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE), (b) vigorous-intensity continuous exercise (VICE), and (c) high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE). Using the dual-mode theory as a theoretical framework, cognitive and interoceptive factors were considered as potential predictors of in-task affective response. In a within-subject design, 40 insufficiently active healthy participants (aged from 20 to 40 years) attended three sessions per exercise modality on a cycle ergometer. Affective valence (measured by the Feeling Scale), two cognitive factors (perceived competence and awareness of interoceptive cues), and one interoceptive factor (heart rate) were assessed before, during, and after each exercise session. Mixed models with three levels (subject, exercise session, and time point) revealed more positive affective valence during MICE compared with VICE (p < 0.001) and HIIE (p < 0.01), while there was no significant difference between the latter two. Levene's test results showed the highest variability of in-task affective valence during VICE (ps < 0.01). Regarding the course across the session, MICE was associated with a constant slight increase in affective valence from pre- to post-exercise (p < 0.05), whereas VICE and HIIE caused a decline in pleasure, followed by an affective rebound immediately after exercise termination (ps < 0.01). The highest importance of cognitive and interoceptive factors for in-task affective valence was observed in VICE (ps < 0.05). The current findings provide support for the tenets of the dual-mode theory, however, indicating that there may be differences in the affect-intensity relationship between continuous and interval exercise. In conclusion, the study results concerning previously insufficiently active individuals extend the knowledge of how exercise can positively shape affective well-being depending on exercise modality and psychophysiological influences. This knowledge enables public health practitioners to design more individualized activity recommendations, thereby improving the subjective experience of exercise.","output":"Different Endurance Exercise Modalities, Different Affective Response: A Within-Subject Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED BACKGROUND This clinical study evaluated the effect of a suctioning maneuver on aspiration past the cuff during mechanical ventilation. METHODS Patients intubated for less than 48 hours with a PVC-cuffed tracheal tube, under mechanical ventilation with a PEEP 5 cm H2O and under continuous sedation, were included in the study. At baseline the cuff pressure was set at 30 cm H2O. Then 0.5ml of blue dye diluted with 3 ml of saline was instilled into the subglottic space just above the cuff. Tracheal suctioning was performed using a 16-French suction catheter with a suction pressure of - 400 mbar. A fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed before and after the suctioning maneuver, looking for the presence of blue dye in the folds within the cuff wall or in the trachea under the cuff. The sealing of the cuff was defined by the absence of leakage of blue dye either in the cuff wall or in the trachea under the cuff. RESULTS Twenty-five patients were included. The size of the tracheal tube was 7-mm ID for 5 patients, 7.5-mm ID for 16 patients, and 8-mm ID for four patients. Blue dye was never seen in the trachea under the cuff before suctioning and only in one patient (4%) after the suctioning maneuver. Blue dye was observed in the folds within the cuff wall in 6 of 25 patients before suctioning and 11 of 25 after (p = 0.063).

We present a base mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in India and its neighbor, Pakistan. The base model, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, is parameterized using cumulative COVID-19 mortality data from each of the two countries. The model was used to assess the population-level impact of the control and mitigation strategies implemented in the two countries (notably community lockdowns, use of face masks, and social-distancing). Numerical simulations of the basic model indicate that, based on the current baseline levels of the control and mitigation strategies implemented, the pandemic trajectory in India is on a downward trend (as characterized by the reproduction number of the disease dynamics in India below, but close to, unity). This downward trend will be reversed, and India will be recording mild outbreaks (i.e., pandemic waves), if the control and mitigation strategies are relaxed from their current levels (e.g., relaxed to the extent that the associated community transmission parameters are increased by 20% or 40% from their current baseline values). Our simulations suggest that India could record up to 460,000 cumulative deaths by early September 2021 under the baseline levels of the control strategies implemented (up to 25,000 of the projected deaths could be averted if the control and mitigation measures are strengthened to the extent that the associated community transmission parameters are reduced by 20% from their baseline values). Our simulations show that the pandemic in Pakistan is much milder, with an estimated projected cumulative mortality of about 24,000 by early September 2021 under the baseline scenario. The basic model was extended to assess the impact of back-and-forth mobility between the two countries. Simulations of the resulting metapopulation model, which uses a Lagrangian mobility framework (based on residence-time spent in each country), shows that the burden of the pandemic in Pakistan increases with increasing values of the average time residents of India spend in Pakistan. In particular, it is shown that the India-to-Pakistan mobility pattern may trigger a significant fourth wave of the pandemic in Pakistan (under certain mobility scenarios and mitigation levels), with daily mortality peaking in mid-August to mid-September of 2021. It is also shown that extending the current travel restrictions by at least three months would significantly enhance the prospect of eliminating the pandemic in both countries. On the other hand, it is shown that, in addition to causing future multiple waves of the pandemic, easing the current levels of control and mitigation measures in the two countries (including travel restrictions) would result in delaying pandemic elimination in India and Pakistan to November and July 2022, respectively.","output":"Dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in India and Pakistan: A metapopulation modelling approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has strained the hospital systems in many countries in the world, especially in developing countries. In many low-resource hospitals, severely ill hypoxemic Covid-19 patients are treated with various forms of low-flow oxygen therapy (0-15 L/min), including interfaces such as a nasal cannula, Hudson mask, venturi-mask, and non-rebreather masks. When 15L/min of pure oxygen flow is not sufficient for the patient, treatment guidelines suggest non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) as the next stage of treatment. However, administering HFNO in the general wards of a low-resource hospital is difficult due to several factors, including difficulty in operation, unavailability of electric power outlets, and frequent maintenance. Therefore, in many cases, the highest level of care a patient receives in the general ward is 15L/min of oxygen on a Non-Rebreather Mask. With a shortage of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, this is a major problem since intermediate forms of treatments are simply not available at an affordable cost. To address this gap, we have developed a low-cost CPAP system specifically designed for low-resource hospitals. The device is a precision venturi-based flow-generator capable of providing up to 60L/min of flow. The device utilizes the mechanics of a jet pump driven by high-pressure oxygen to increase the volumetric flow rate by entraining atmospheric air.

Patients were divided into 3 groups; pre-existing AF (n=55), NOAF (n=28), and sinus rhythm (SR) (n=590). The baseline characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 68 years, 65.4% were male, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 15.6%. The NOAF group demonstrated a higher in-hospital mortality rate (42.9%) than the pre-existing AF (30.9%) and SR (11.2%) groups (P<0.001). Patients with NOAF had a higher incidence of acute respiratory syndrome, multiple organ disease, hemorrhage, and stroke than those with pre-existing AF and NOAF.

We aimed to externally validate a risk prediction algorithm (QCovid) to estimate mortality outcomes from COVID-19 in adults in England. METHODS: We did a population-based cohort study using the UK Office for National Statistics Public Health Linked Data Asset, a cohort of individuals aged 19-100 years, based on the 2011 census and linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, the General Practice Extraction Service data for pandemic planning and research, and radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy records. The primary outcome was time to COVID-19 death, defined as confirmed or suspected COVID-19 death as per death certification. Two periods were used: (1) Jan 24 to April 30, 2020, and (2) May 1 to July 28, 2020. We assessed the performance of the QCovid algorithms using measures of discrimination and calibration. Using predicted 90-day risk of COVID-19 death, we calculated r2 values, Brier scores, and measures of discrimination and calibration with corresponding 95% CIs over the two time periods. FINDINGS: We included 34 897 648 adults aged 19-100 years resident in England. 26 985 (008%) COVID-19 deaths occurred during the first period and 13 177 (004%) during the second. The algorithms had good discrimination and calibration in both periods. In the first period, they explained 771% (95% CI 769-774) of the variation in time to death in men and 763% (760-766) in women. The D statistic was 3761 (3732-3789) for men and 3671 (3640-3702) for women and Harrell's C was 0935 (0933-0937) for men and 0945 (0943-0947) for women. Similar results were obtained for the second time period. In the top 5% of patients with the highest predicted risks of death, the sensitivity for identifying deaths in the first period was 6594% for men and 7167% for women. INTERPRETATION: The QCovid population-based risk algorithm performed well, showing high levels of discrimination for COVID-19 deaths in men and women for both time periods. QCovid has the potential to be dynamically updated as the pandemic evolves and, therefore, has potential use in guiding national policy.

As a consequence, industries, including the agri-food sector, have put in place preventive measures to deal with this pandemic on several fronts, including the use of hydroalcoholic products and bleach for personal and surface disinfection. These disinfection actions may eliminate or reduce the risk of coronavirus infection, but the increased use of these products by employees could lead to serious health problems and increase the occupational chemical risk in the event of uncontrolled exposure. In order to analyze this risk in the dairy industry in Morocco, we have launched a qualitative and quantitative study to identify and assess the severity of chemical risk to which its employees are exposed. This involves an analysis of the safety data sheets [MSDS] of the disinfectants used and a health and safety survey of the users of these products, particularly for hand disinfection. This analysis showed that this chemical risk is omnipresent and prevention measures are partially adopted. Indeed, the strengthening of health safety measures to combat COVID-19 has significantly increased this risk, resulting in a remarkable imbalance in the assessment and management of occupational risks in this industry. These results have led us to propose corrective and preventive measures against this risk to interested parties and to adopt an integrated management of food and occupational health risks in a single system. This is the use of the Risk AnalysisCritical Control Points (HACCP)-Tool for a First Risk Assessment by Activity Analysis (OPERA) approach, which we developed and proposed in a previous study, for a simplified management of chemical risk in the food industry, especially in small- and medium-sized enterprises.","output":"COVID-19: unbalanced management of occupational riskscase of the analysis of the chemical risk related to the use of disinfectants in the dairy industry in Morocco"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human -defensin (HBD), a member of the antimicrobial peptides, is essential for respiratory epithelial cells microbial defense, and is affected by cigarette smoking (CS).

However, as soon as the vaccines were released C the only scientifically verified and efficient therapeutic option thus far C a few mutations combined into variants of SARS-CoV-2 that are more transmissible and virulent emerged raising doubts about their efficiency. Therefore, this work aims to explain possible molecular mechanisms responsible for the increased transmissibility and the increased rate of hospitalizations related to the new variants. A combination of theoretical methods was employed. Constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to quantify the stability of several spike trimeric structures at different conformational states and the free energy of interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) for the most worrying variants. Electrostatic epitopes were mapped using the PROCEEDpKa method. These analyses showed that the increased virulence is more likely to be due to the improved stability to the S trimer in the opened state (the one in which the virus can interact with the cellular receptor ACE2) than due to alterations in the complexation RBD-ACE2, once the increased observed in the free energy values is small. Conversely, the South African variant (B.1.351), when compared with the wild type SARS-CoV-2, is much more stable in the opened state (either with one or two RBDs in the up position) than in the closed state (with the three RBDs in the down position). Such results contribute to the understanding of the natural history of disease and also to indicate possible strategies to both develop new therapeutic molecules and to adjust the vaccine doses for a higher production of B cells antibodies.

METHODS This retrospective secondary analysis used data from two previous studies on the effectiveness of videoconferencing programs (laptop-based and smartphone-based) to improve outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and social support (type and source) among nursing home residents. Generalised estimating equations compared differences from baseline measures with measures at 1 and 3 months between the two groups with and without adjusting for the effects of confounding variables. RESULTS With the exception of age, there were no differences in demographics between participants in the laptop and smartphone groups. Neither changes from baseline in mean scores for loneliness nor depressive symptoms differed between groups. However, changes in mean scores from baseline between groups were significantly greater in the smartphone-based group compared with the laptop-based group for three types of social support: informational and appraisal at 1 and 3 months; and emotional at 3 months. Changes from baseline in mean scores for social support from friends (at 1 and 3 months) and other sources (at 3 months) were also significantly greater for the smartphone group compared with the laptop group.

METHODS: The study comprised a cohort of 688 patients who initially presented as non-COVID patients for ultrasound and echocardiography tests to a non-COVID health-care facility. Patients were divided into low-, moderate-, and high-risk COVID-19 probability groups based on SPSS screening scores of 0C3, 4C6, and more than 6, respectively. All high-risk patients with SPSS of more than 6 were advised real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or plain high-resolution computed tomography chest for the presence of COVID-19 before the diagnostic test could be done and all results were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-four low-risk patients had a median score of 3, and all underwent their radiological examinations. One hundred and forty patients were in the moderate-risk group and had a median score of 5. Thirty-six patients had a score of 6, out of which 12 patients were upgraded to score 6. One hundred and four patients were in the high-risk category group. Out of these, 20 patients were screened as RT-PCR negative and got their ultrasound examinations.

METHODS: We abstracted all adult discharges with suspected Covid-19 from five New York City EDs between March 2nd and April 15th. Those admitted within 72 h were then compared against those who were not using descriptive and regression analysis of background and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Discharged ED patients returning within 72 h were more often admitted if suspected of Covid-19 (32.9% vs 12.1%, p < .0001). Of 7433 suspected Covid-19 discharges, the 139 (1.9%) admitted within 72 h were older (55.4 vs. 45.6 years, OR 1.03) and more often male (1.32) or with a history of obstructive lung disease (2.77) or diabetes (1.58) than those who were not admitted (p < .05). Additional associations included non-English preference, cancer, heart failure, hypertension, renal disease, ambulance arrival, higher triage acuity, longer ED stay or time from symptom onset, fever, tachycardia, dyspnea, gastrointestinal symptoms, x-ray abnormalities, and decreased platelets and lymphocytes (p < .05 for all).

Our results provide evidence that both younger and older adults were able to adequately reweight sources of sensory information based on environmental constraints, indicative of well-functioning neural processes of motor adaptation.","output":"Effects of sensory manipulations on locomotor adaptation to split-belt treadmill walking in healthy younger and older adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study proposes a novel bioinspired metaheuristic simulating how the coronavirus spreads and infects healthy people. From a primary infected individual (patient zero), the coronavirus rapidly infects new victims, creating large populations of infected people who will either die or spread infection. Relevant terms such as reinfection probability, super-spreading rate, social distancing measures, or traveling rate are introduced into the model to simulate the coronavirus activity as accurately as possible. The infected population initially grows exponentially over time, but taking into consideration social isolation measures, the mortality rate, and number of recoveries, the infected population gradually decreases. The coronavirus optimization algorithm has two major advantages when compared with other similar strategies. First, the input parameters are already set according to the disease statistics, preventing researchers from initializing them with arbitrary values. Second, the approach has the ability to end after several iterations, without setting this value either. Furthermore, a parallel multivirus version is proposed, where several coronavirus strains evolve over time and explore wider search space areas in less iterations. Finally, the metaheuristic has been combined with deep learning models, to find optimal hyperparameters during the training phase. As application case, the problem of electricity load time series forecasting has been addressed, showing quite remarkable performance.","output":"Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm: A Bioinspired Metaheuristic Based on the COVID-19 Propagation Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen espa?ol Introduccin: La pandemia COVID-19 ha tenido una repercusin extraordinaria sobre los hospitales espa?oles, que han reorganizado sus recursos para tratar a estos pacientes, limitando su capacidad de atender otras patologas frecuentes.

We were interested in understanding whether nurses, with high health literacy, may receive more care for UI than the general population. METHODS: Medicare Fee for Service claims data for women aged 66-91 years were compared for Nurses' Health Study participants (n = 3,213) and a propensity-matched sample from general Medicare Fee for Service beneficiaries (n = 3,213) with 1 or more outpatient evaluation and management visits for UI in 2012. We examined the mean number of outpatient visits for UI and the type of provider seen, using t tests and &#967;2 tests. Providers were categorized as specialist and nonspecialist providers using taxonomy codes. RESULTS: The percentage of women 65 years or older who had an outpatient visits for UI over 12 months was 6.4% in the Nurses' Health Study cohort and 5.4% in the general population. The mean number of office visits for UI in 2012 was similar between nurses and the matched general population (mean = 1.8 vs 1.8; P = 0.3). A small percentage of women saw both nonspecialists and specialists for UI (9.3% in the Nurses' Health Study and 10.0% in the Center for Medicare Services cohorts). CONCLUSIONS: We found that less than 7% of older women had outpatient evaluation of UI symptoms during a 12-month period, despite UI being very common in this age group. This was similar in nurses and the general population, suggesting that even high health care literacy does not increase UI care seeking.","output":"Primary and Specialty Outpatient Visits for Older Women With Urinary Incontinence: A Comparison of Nurses to the General Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"B Neuroimmune interactions in pain and stress - an interdisciplinary approach b Caroline Sawicki, Michelle Humeidan & John Sheridan B Shedding light on social reward circuitry: (un) common blueprints in human and rodents b Christina Grimm, Joshua Balsters & Valerio Zerbi B Spontaneous beta band rhythms in the predictive coding of natural stimuli b Viviana Betti, Stefania Della Penna, Francesco de Pasquale & Maurizio Corbetta B The ups and downs of BACE1: Walking a fine line between neurocognitive and other psychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease b Saak Ovsepian, Jiri Horacek, Valerie O'Leary & Cyril Hoschl B Neural stem cell niche and adult neurogenesis b Yue Li & Weixiang Guo B COVID-19 pulmonary and olfactory dysfunctions: Is the chemokine CXCL10 the common denominator b Antonio Oliviero, Fernando de Castro, Francesca Coperchini, Luca Chiovato & Mario Rotondi B Multiple motor learning processes in humans: Defining their neurophysiological bases b Danny Spampinato & Pablo Celnik B Migraine and Two-Pore-Domain potassium channels b Clement Verkest, Stephanie H?fner, Pablo valos Prado, Anne Baron & Guillaume Sandoz B Memory engrams in the neocortex b Svenja Brodt & Steffen Gais B -Synuclein in Parkinson's disease: Does a prion-like mechanism of propagation from periphery to the brain play a role?

The aim of this study is a mid-term review of the sequelae on plain chest radiography (CXR) in patients with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, assessing the persistence of residual lesions in the control CXR and analysing their possible relationship with epidemiological factors, risk factors, treatments received and initial radiological patterns. RESULTS: A total of 143 patients (52 women and 91 men) were analysed. Mean age was 64 years. Radiological complete resolution (CR) was observed in 104 (73%) and partial resolution (PR) in 39 (27%). Of the risk factors only age was significantly related to persistence of residual lesions (OR 1.06 CI 95% (1.02,1.10). In relation to treatments, significant differences were found with tocilizumab and glucocorticoids, where treated patients had a higher risk of residual lesions (OR 2.44 (1.03,5.80) and 3.05(1.43,6.51) respectively. In the analysis of radiological patterns, significant differences were observed in patients with peripheral condensations in the acute course and a pattern of early radiological worsening. A clinical-radiological dissociation was evident: 83% of patients with residual lesions had no respiratory symptoms. DISCUSSION: COVID19 pneumonias may have a slower radiological resolution in older patients with certain initial radiological patterns, but the development of pulmonary fibrosis in these patients is still questionable.","output":"Residual lesions on chest-Xray after SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: Identification of risk factors./ Lesiones residuales en radiografa simple de trax tras neumona por SARS-CoV-2: identificacin de factores de riesgo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Being a cross\\\\cultural systemic therapist, clinical supervisor, and educator means that culture and language are central to my work.

The ED plays an important part in detecting an increasing number of new contagious diseases, which could potentially lead to an epidemic or pandemic.During a pandemic, the ED's main task is to detect infected individuals. These patients then need to be isolated and an adequate treatment is required. The ED must be prepared in order to perform well in such a situation. One major part for readiness is communication in an open manner to all partners within the department, as well as with emergency medical services and other departments of the hospital.The ED must be restructured to withstand the rising number of infected patients. These patients must be separated from other critically ill patients. Strategies for a diagnostic workup depending on the kind of infection have to be put in place. Pathways for the outpatient and inpatient management must be defined to avoid overcrowding in the ED. Depending on the number of patients, escalation and de-escalation strategies have to be set up within the hospital.Over the whole course of the pandemic, all staff members are the key resources for the ED and the entire hospital. The ED can only cope with a pandemic situation if staff are working together as a whole. This implies several important steps to get the staff prepared: Recurring, open conversations about fears, problems, and successes are critical for staff morale. Training must be continually provided, and protection strategies implemented.

However, considering public attitudes on tidal energy are not well known, especially in developing countries, a barrier exists in implementing public engagement strategies. This study aims to contribute by identifying strategies for information provisionthe initial step in public engagementand estimate how these can be engaged to enhance support for tidal energy among the local public in a remote area of a developing country, in this case, Flores Timur Regency, Indonesia, considering their socio-cultural background. METHODS: In this paper, we employ statistical analyses using multinomial probit modelling to identify the key variables that shape information flow. The aptness of the variables is then verified using post-estimation techniques for their use as input parameters for the simulation of the information flow in the field study area. Agent-based simulation (ABS) is employed to replicate the actual conditions in Flores Timur Regency, Indonesia, and simulate the flow of information through the local community. RESULTS: According to the multinomial probit estimations, the people belonging to the top hierarchical group show a higher probability to support tidal energy compared to the members belonging to the lower groups. Understandably, around twice as many information flow cycles are needed to disseminate information to the members of the lowest hierarchical group, compared to the members of the top hierarchical group. The results also show that increasing the amount of available information has a positive impact on information dissemination. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that information provision is highly effective with propagation of information that specifically highlights the individual benefits, rather than the community benefits of tidal energy. Additionally, savings in terms of costs, time, and efforts can be realized if the most influential members of the local community are targeted initially before including all other stakeholders. The study also indicated that locals absorb more information and increase their support for tidal energy when additional data is made available. Finally, as long-term strategy, information provision becomes most effective when the local population gains higher educational capabilities.

Consequently, it has forced the countries to follow immediate strategies to alleviate this crisis's impacts. The lockdown and social distance were the most applied precautionary procedures. This situation has devastating consequences for both economic and social life. The construction sector is affected by this temporary paralysis, especially the public-private partnerships (PPP) infrastructure projects with a long-term contract and different stakeholders. Some earlier researches have analyzed the consequences and suggested options to alleviate the negative impacts, but potential positive risks are still spotting. Therefore, there is a need to follow proactive behavior to maximize the potentiality of opportunities. This research is exploring the positive risks for PPP infrastructure projects during COVID 19. This objective has been attained by a literature survey for allocated risks for PPP projects, factors affecting successful PPP projects, and the current practices as a response strategy to COVID -19. The research findings will contribute to building a known base of resilience plans for pandemic through two scenarios of negative and positive impacts to support PPP projects with leading practices. The revealed opportunities have been revealed based on exploring the common concepts between four main areas: 1) Positive Impacts of COVID-19, 2) Principles of resilient infrastructure, 3) Critical success factors of PPP projects, and 4) Current practices to respond to COVID-19. It was found that besides the tremendous burden on project stakeholders, users, the private corporate sector, and the public sector for the short and long term, some opportunities could be attained for PPP infrastructure projects. These revealed opportunities have been summarized as follows: 1) The need for implementing the resilience strategy and long term thinking, 2) Available time for maintenance work and updating operating systems for completed projects, 3) Priority to support and invest in innovative smart infrastructure projects that adopt artificial intelligence and smart systems that reduce human resource interferences and control the social distance, and 4) exploring the need to simplify or remedy the procurement processes of PPP. The concluded opportunities will help investors and public partners react positively during the pandemic and reduce the negative impacts and maximize positive impacts.

The UN and WHO encourage countries to make health facility location data open, to encourage use and improvement. We provide a summary of open access health facility location data in Africa using re-useable R code. We aim to support data analysts developing software tools to address COVID-19 response in individual countries. In Africa there are currently three main sources of such open data;1) direct from national ministries of health, 2) a database for sub-Saharan Africa collated and published by a team from KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme and now hosted by WHO, and 3) The Global Healthsites Mapping Project in collaboration with OpenStreetMap. Methods: We searched for and documented official national facility location data that were openly available. We developed re-useable open-source R code to summarise and visualise facility location data by country from the three sources. This re-useable code is used to provide a web user interface allowing data exploration through maps and plots of facility type. Results: Out of 52 African countries, seven currently provide an official open facility list that can be downloaded and analysed reproducibly. Considering all three sources, there are over 185,000 health facility locations available for Africa. However, there are differences and overlaps between sources and a lack of data on capacities and service provision. Conclusions: These summaries and software tools can be used to encourage greater use of existing health facility location data, incentivise further improvements in the provision of those data by national suppliers, and encourage collaboration within wider data communities.

METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were reviewed from inception to September 2019. We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared NIV, HFNC, and standard oxygen in patients at high risk for or with established postoperative respiratory failure. We performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and Bayesian 95% credible intervals (CrIs). RESULTS: Nine RCTs representing 1865 patients were included (the mean age was 61.6  10.2 and 64.4% were males). In comparison with standard oxygen, NIV was associated with a significant reduction in intubation rate (OR 0.23; 95% Cr.I. 0.10C0.46), mortality (OR 0.45; 95% Cr.I. 0.27C0.71), and intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infections (OR 0.43, 95% Cr.I. 0.25C0.70). Compared to standard oxygen, HFNC was associated with a significant reduction in intubation rate (OR 0.28, 95% Cr.I. 0.08C0.76) and ICU-acquired infections (OR 0.41; 95% Cr.I. 0.20C0.80), but not mortality (OR 0.58; 95% Cr.I. 0.26C1.22). There were no significant differences between HFNC and NIV regarding different outcomes. In a subgroup analysis, we observed a mortality benefit with NIV over standard oxygen in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgeries but not in abdominal surgeries. Furthermore, in comparison with standard oxygen, NIV and HFNC were associated with lower intubation rates following cardiothoracic surgeries while only NIV reduced the intubation rates following abdominal surgeries. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with post-operative respiratory failure, HFNC and NIV were associated with significantly reduced rates of intubation and ICU-acquired infections compared with standard oxygen.

However, the trajectories of these mental health impacts over multiple COVID-19 peaks and corresponding lockdowns are unknown. This study explored the trajectories of anxiety and depression over two consecutive lockdowns during the first nine months of the pandemic in Europe (April 2020CJanuary 2021) and examined whether they varied as a function of different psychological flexibility and inflexibility profiles. METHODS: A total of 569 Italians completed online surveys at four assessment points. Trajectories of anxiety and depression were examined with latent growth modeling and according to different psychological flexibility and inflexibility profiles. RESULTS: Anxiety increased linearly throughout the study period, whereas depression displayed a quadratic trajectory evidencing a decrease with the easing of the first lockdown followed by an increase during the second lockdown. Furthermore, two profiles were identified that displayed different anxiety and depression trajectories. Compared to the psychologically flexible profile, the psychologically inflexible profile reported significantly higher anxiety and depression which remained higher across the study period. LIMITATIONS: A reliance on self-report measures and convenience sampling constitute key study limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that high psychological inflexibility is a risk factor for prolonged elevated anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas high psychological flexibility is a protective factor. Psychological flexibility and inflexibility should be targeted by preventive public health interventions that harness evidence-based strategies shown to effectively target these factors.","output":"The trajectories of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic and the protective role of psychological flexibility: A four-wave longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remdesivir is an antiviral approved for COVID-19 treatment, but its wider use is limited by intravenous delivery. An orally bioavailable remdesivir analog may boost therapeutic benefit by facilitating early administration to non-hospitalized patients.

Both GS-621763 and GS-441524 inhibit SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern (VOC) in cell culture and human airway epithelium organoids. Oral GS-621763 is efficiently converted to plasma metabolite GS-441524, and in lungs to the triphosphate metabolite identical to that generated by remdesivir, demonstrating a consistent mechanism of activity. Twice-daily oral administration of 10 mg/kg GS-621763 reduces SARS-CoV-2 burden to near-undetectable levels in ferrets. When dosed therapeutically against VOC P.1 gamma , oral GS-621763 blocks virus replication and prevents transmission to untreated contact animals.

This is critical among hernia repairs, where improved outcomes are reliant on understanding the impact of different patient characteristics and surgical approaches. In this context, a hernia-specific synoptic operative note was piloted as part of an effort to create a statewide hernia registry. We aimed to understand the impact of the synoptic operative note on variable missingness and evaluate barriers and facilitators to improved intraoperative communication and note adoption. METHODS: In January 2020, the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC) registry was expanded to capture hernia-specific intraoperative variables. A synoptic operative note for hernia repair was piloted at 8 hospitals. The primary outcome was change in hernia variable communication, measured by missingness. Using a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design, we performed semi-structured interviews with data abstractors (n = 4) and surgeons (n = 4) at 5 pilot sites to assess barriers and facilitators of implementation. Interviews were iteratively analyzed using content analysis with both deductive and inductive approaches. RESULTS: From January to June 2020, 870 hernia repairs were performed across 8 pilot and 53 control sites. Pilot sites had significantly less missingness for all hernia-specific variables. At pilot sites, 46% of notes were fully complete in regard to hernia variables, compared to 21% at control sites (p value < 0.001). While collection of intraoperative variables improved after synoptic note implementation, low note adoption was reported. Facilitators of improved variable collection were (1) communication with data abstractors and (2) stakeholder acknowledgment of widespread benefit, while barriers included (1) surgeon resistance to practice change, (2) EMR/technology, and (3) interruptions to communication and implementation. CONCLUSION: This mixed-methods evaluation of a synoptic operative note implementation suggests that sustained communication, particularly with abstractors, was the most impactful intervention. Future implementation efforts may have improved effectiveness with interventions supplementary to surgeon-level direction.

It also describes the acute phase of annual outbreaks of endemic influenza and in all of these instances it has significant predictive power. For Covid-19, we show that the Gompertz Function provides accurate forecasts not just for cases and deaths but, independently, for hospitalisations, intensive care admissions and other medical requirements. In particular Gompertz Function projections of healthcare requirements have been reliable enough to allow planning for: hospital admissions,intensive care admissions,ventilator usage, peak loads and duration. Analysis of data from the Spanish Flu pandemic and the endemic influenza cycle reveals alternating periods of Gompertz Function growth and linear growth in cumulative cases or deaths. Linear growth means the Reproduction Number is equal to 1 which in turn indicates endemicity. The same pattern has been observed with Covid-19. All the initial outbreaks ended in linear growth. Each new outbreak has been preceded by a period of linear growth and has ended with a transition from Gompertz Function growth to linear growth. This suggests that each of these outbreak cycles ended with a transition to endemicity for the current dominant strain and that the normal seasonal respiratory virus periods will continue to see new outbreaks. It remains to be seen if widespread vaccination will disrupt this cyclicality. Because both Gompertz Function Growth and linear growth are accurately predictable, the forecasting problem is reduced to identifying the transition between these modes and to improving the performance in the early Gompertz Function growth phase where its predictive power is lowest. The dynamics of the Gompertz Function are determined by the Gumbel probability distribution. This is an exceptional distribution with respect to the geometry determined by the affine group on the line which is the key to the role of the Gumbel distribution as an Extreme Value Theory attractor. We show that this, together with the empirically observed asymmetry in epidemic data, makes the Gompertz Function growth essentially inevitable in epidemic models which agree with observations.","output":"Predicting the course of Covid-19 and other epidemic and endemic disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the acknowledged lack of success in Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development over the past two decades, the objective of this review was to derive key insights from the myriad failures to inform future drug development.

This is crucial for the development of social Internet of Things, which is an integral part of Cyber-Physical-Social systems. Online social media platforms, as the most active places where users act as social sensors, are responsive to real-world events and are useful for gathering situational information in real-time. Unfortunately, posts rarely contain structured geographic information, thus hindering their usage for contributing to various challenges, such as emergency response. We address this limitation by introducing a general approach for extracting place names from tweets, named GazPNE2. It combines global gazetteers (i.e., OpenStreetMap and GeoNames), deep learning, and pretrained transformer models (i.e., BERT and BERTweet), which requires no manually annotated data. It can extract place names at both coarse (e.g., city) and fine-grained (e.g., street and POI) levels and place names with abbreviations. To fully evaluate GazPNE2 and compare it with 11 competing approaches, we use 19 public tweet datasets, containing 38,802 tweets and 22,197 places across the world. The results show GazPNE2 achieves much higher F1 (0.8) than the other approaches. Furthermore, we apply GazPNE2 to three large unannotated tweet datasets related to over 20 crisis events (e.g., COVID-19), containing 560,040 tweets. An F1 of 0.84 is achieved on 3,000 tweets, which are randomly selected from the three datasets and then manually annotated.

Our objective was to determine if lipid profiles of vaginal swabs were different between postnatal gilts suckled by sow or fed milk replacer the first 48 h after birth, with or without a lard-based fat supplement. Gilts (>1.3 kg) were selected at birth across 8 litters and assigned to one of four treatments: 1) suckled by sow (S, n = 8); 2) suckled by sow plus administration of a fat supplement (SF, n = 5); 3) bottle-fed solely milk replacer (B, n = 8); or 4) bottle-fed solely milk replacer plus administration of a fat supplement (BF, n = 7). At 48 h postnatal, vaginal swabs of gilts were taken with a cytology brush, and lipids were extracted for analysis using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling. Lipids extracted from serum collected at 48 h from gilts, milk collected at 24 h from sows, and milk replacer were also analyzed with MRM-profiling. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found 18 lipids recovered from vaginal swabs that highly distinguished between S and B gilts [area-under-the-curve (AUC) > 0.9], including phosphatidylethanolamine with 34 carbons and four unsaturations in the fatty acyl residues [PE (34:4)]. Twelve lipids from vaginal swabs highly correlated (r > 0.6; p < 0.01) with nutrition source. Lipids with greater abundance in milk replacer drove association. For example, mean intensity of PE (34:4) was 149-fold higher in milk replacer than colostrum. Consequently, PE (34:4) was found to have 1.6- and 2.12-fold higher levels in serum and vaginal swab samples (p < 0.001), respectively, of B gilts as compared to S gilts.

Each of the phenotypes describes varying symptoms, inflammatory markers, and lung physiology - many of which require testing to diagnose. The two most common phenotypes, L-type and H-type, advance along a spectrum indicating an evolving illness. Recently, this physiology has been explained as a shift from an acute viral illness to progressive inflammatory response. The objective of this study is to identify differences in the SAMI Score between death and non-death cohorts, from data collected in a large, multi-center healthcare system for adult (age &gt;18) patients. Methods: All patients enrolled in this retrospective study were identified by a positive nasal or oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 PCR in the ED between March and September 2020. Symptomatic data was collected based on ED admission histories and prior medical records. The SAMI score was calculated based on duration of days from symptom onset to hospital admission (SA score), time to ICU admission (AM score), and time to intubation (MI score). Patient cohorts were separated by mortality. Results: Out of 510 patients, 227 patients met inclusion criteria for enrollment. In the death cohort (43 patients, mean age 75, 53% female), the mean SA score and AM score were 5.6d and 1.9d, respectively. The average MI score was 2.3d and the SAMI score was 11.6d among those intubated. In the non-death cohort (184 patients, mean age 60, 49% female), the mean SA score was 6.3d while the AM score was 1.3d. The average MI score and SAMI score were 0.4d and 6.0d, respectively. Overall, the mean MI score between the two groups (2.3d death group, 0.4d non-death group) was statistically significant, p = 0.045. Similarly, the mean SAMI score between the two groups (11.6d vs. 6.0d respectively) was also statistically significant, p = 0.026. There was no significant difference between the average SA score (p = 0.63) or AM score (p = 0.37). Conclusion: Patients who required rapid intubation after symptom onset (short SAMI score) are associated with less mortality than those requiring a prolonged time to intubation (long SAMI score). Physiologically, rapid intubation and a short MI score suggest a recoverable acute disease state. Conversely, prolonged time to intubation may be indicative of a progressive irreversible process. This research allows for further sub-group analysis to determine if inflammatory markers are higher in the group with longer SAMI scores.","output":"Sami score study (symptoms, admission, micu, and intubation) associates mortality with different phenotypes of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV N protein) packages the viral genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid (RNP) and plays a fundamental role during viral self-assembly.

Highlights of the progresses include uncovering the modular organization, determining the structures of the structural domains, realizing the roles of protein disorder in proteinCprotein and proteinCnucleic acid interactions, and visualizing the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) structure inside the virions.

When the goal is screening for infectious disease, one approach is group testing in which samples are initially tested in pools and individual samples are retested only if the initial pooled test was positive. Intuitively, if the prevalence of infection is small, this could result in a large reduction of the total number of tests required. Despite this, the use of group testing in medical studies has been limited, largely due to skepticism about the impact of pooling on the accuracy of a given assay. While there is a large body of research addressing the issue of testing errors in group testing studies, it is customary to assume that the misclassification parameters are known from an external population and/or that the values do not change with the group size. Both of these assumptions are highly questionable for many medical practitioners considering group testing in their study design. In this article, we explore how the failure of these assumptions might impact the efficacy of a group testing design and, consequently, whether group testing is currently feasible for medical screening. Specifically, we look at how incorrect assumptions about the sensitivity function at the design stage can lead to poor estimation of a procedure's overall sensitivity and expected number of tests. Furthermore, if a validation study is used to estimate the pooled misclassification parameters of a given assay, we show that the sample sizes required are so large as to be prohibitive in all but the largest screening programs.","output":"Is group testing ready for prime-time in disease identification?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social isolation has been recognized as a social problem with negative effects on psychological well-being.

This study also explored the moderating role of perceived neighborhood environment. Depressive symptoms were measured using the eight-item CES-D. The index of social isolation was generated using five indicators, including living alone, no social participation, and less than monthly contact with children, family members, and friends. The moderator assessed two aspects of the neighborhood environment, including physical disorder and social cohesion. The results of bivariate analyses showed that respondents who were affected by COVID-19 were younger, more likely to be female, Hispanic, and Non-Hispanic Black, and with lower levels of social isolation. The results of multiple regression analyses indicated that social isolation was associated with more depressive symptoms, but this relationship was found to be only significant among respondents who were affected by COVID-19. Perceived neighborhood environment significantly moderated the relationship, as the effect of social isolation on depressive symptoms was stronger for respondents with more neighborhood physical disorders and less social cohesion.

For the first time, we combine a clinical dataset, expert knowledge and machine intelligence to model the multi-dimensional associations between the potentially relevant factors and weight-loss activity in HD, specifically at the premanifest stage.

Therefore, an immunosuppressive effect of in utero infection has been suggested. The aim of the present study was to characterise the changes of leukocyte populations in piglets surviving in utero infection with PRRSV. A total of 27 liveborn uninfected control piglets and 22 piglets infected transplacentally with a Danish strain of PRRSV were included. At 2 and 4 weeks of age, 21 of 22 (96%) and 7 of 14 (50%) examined infected piglets were still viremic, whereas PRRSV could not be detected in the six infected piglets examined at 6 weeks of age. Flow cytometry analysis was used to determine the phenotypic composition of leukocytes in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 2-, 4- and 6-week-old infected piglets and age-matched uninfected controls. The key observation in the present study is that high levels of CD8(+) cells constitute a dominant feature in peripheral blood and BALF of piglets surviving in utero infection with PRRSV. In BALF, the average high level of CD8(+) cells in 2-week-old infected piglets (33.412.6%) was followed by a decline to 7.33.0 and 11.13.0% at 4 and 6 weeks of age. BALF of control piglets contained 1.60.9, 2.31.8 and 1.90.5% CD8(+) cells, only. In peripheral blood, however, the average number of CD8(+) cells remained at high levels in the infected piglets throughout the post-natal experimental period (2.81.9, 2.91.8 and 3.21.710(6) CD8(+) cells/ml at 2, 4 and 6 weeks, respectively). In the controls, the average levels of CD8(+) cells were 0.90.2, 1.91.7 and 1.60.510(6)/ml, respectively. Furthermore, the numbers of CD2(+), CD4(+)CD8(+) and SLA-classII(+) cells, respectively, in peripheral blood, together with the levels of CD2(+) and CD3(+) cells in BALF were increased in the infected piglets infected in utero compared to the uninfected controls. The kinetic analyses carried out in the present study reflect that in utero infection with PRRSV modulates immune cell populations in peripheral blood and BALF of surviving piglets. The observed changes are characterised by high levels of CD8(+) cells supporting an important role of these cells in PRRSV infection. The present results, however, do not support the existence of post-natal immunosuppression following in utero infection with PRRSV.","output":"In utero infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus modulates leukocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar fluid of surviving piglets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the fragility of global supply chains arising from raw material scarcity, production and transportation disruption, and social distancing.

In Cuba, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 11. Elderly with multiple comorbidities have been the most risky population. Although most patients present a mild to moderate disease, some have developed severe symptoms. One of the possible mechanisms underlying rapid disease progression is a cytokine storm, in which interleukin (IL) -6 seems to be a major mediator. Itolizumab is a humanized recombinant anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody (MAb), with the ability of reducing serum interferon gamma (INF-?3), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) and IL-6. Based on these previous results in patients with psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, an expanded access clinical trial was approved by the Cuban regulatory agency for COVID-19 critically, severely and moderately ill patients. RESULTS: We show here a short kinetic of IL-6 serum concentration in the first 24 COVID-19 patients treated with itolizumab. Most of patients were elderly with multiple comorbidities. We found that with one itolizumab dose, the circulating IL-6 decreased in critically and severely ill patients, whereas in moderately ill patients the values didn't rise as compared to their low baseline levels.

More than half (56.95%) sought help from colleagues. Less than 20% acted on intuition or adopted a wait and see strategy. About 40% participants (n = 238) were classified into the group of low openness and collaborativeness in coping with diagnostic uncertainty. They were more likely to prescribe antibiotics for the recorded illness without an indication for antibiotics (AOR = 1.013 for all antibiotics, p = 0.024; AOR = 1.047 for broad-spectrum antibiotics, p < 0.001), as well as for the recorded illness with a conditional indication for antibiotics (AOR = 1.226 for all antibiotic, p < 0.001; AOR = 1.257 for broad-spectrum antibiotics, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Low tolerance with diagnostic uncertainty is evident in primary care. Inappropriate and over antibiotic prescribing is shaped by physicians' coping methods of diagnostic uncertainty. Physicians' openness and collaborativeness in responding to diagnostic uncertainty is associated with lower antibiotic prescribing in primary care. Interventions targeting on better management of diagnostic uncertainty may offer a promising approach in reducing antibiotic use in primary care.","output":"Coping With Diagnostic Uncertainty in Antibiotic Prescribing: A Latent Class Study of Primary Care Physicians in Hubei China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: One-year analysis of same-day discharge (SDD) coronary catheterizations, interventions and device replacement procedures during the covid-19 pandemic at the Complex Cardiovascular Center of the University Hospital in Pilsen. Methods: In 2021, 53 to 87 patients were admitted monthly and 817 in total to the SDD specialized Radial Lounge at the Department of Cardiology. Coronary angiography (CAG) was performed in 729 patients and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 176 (24%). Fiftyfive patients were admitted for permanent pacemaker exchange and in 33 of them an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator exchange. Results: Out of 729 transradial CAGs 621 were performed by using the conventional proximal radial approach and 108 (15%) via the distal radial approach, 90 % of all procedures (n = 655), were performed from the nondominant left hand. Only one asymptomatic postprocedural radial artery occlusion was diagnosed by the reverse Barbeau test on the wrist (1/729 = 0.1%). No other relevant complications occured. The distal radial approach was associated with a shorter compression with time in comparison to the proximal puncture site at the wrist C 75  26 min vs. 92  24 (p < 0.05) and there were only four superficial hematomas smaller than 2 cm. In the proximal radial approach subcutaneous hematomas also did not require any specific treatment. Of the total of 817 patients, 90% (n = 732) were discharged home on the same day of admission in the afternoon and none of them was readmitted within the next 24 hours. The remaining 10% of the patients (n = 85) were hospitalized after the procedure, mostly because of severe findings on the coronary arteries. Conclusions: Coronary catheterizations and interventions together with device replacement procedures in the SDD program at the University Hospital in Pilsen were associated with a one-year saving of more than 700 overnight stays, minimal complications, and 99.9% radial artery patency rate after transradial procedures.

Our aims were to assess participation and the factors associated with participation of rural residents in clinical trials. METHODS: Using geocoding, the residential address of participants enrolled into clinical trials at Mayo Clinic locations in Arizona, Florida, and the Midwest between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017, was categorized as urban or rural. The distance travelled by participants and trial characteristics was compared between urban and rural participants. Ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate whether study location and risks were associated with rural participation in trials. RESULTS: Among 292 trials, including 136 (47%) cancer trials, there were 2313 participants. Of these, 731 (32%) were rural participants, which is greater than the rural population in these 9 states (19%, P < 0.001). Compared to urban participants, rural participants were older (65  12 years vs 64  12 years, P = 0.004) and travelled further to the medical center (103  104 vs 68  88 miles, P < 0.001).

Here, we reconstruct 90 new HIV-1 subtype and CRF consensus sequences from 3,470 high-quality, representative, full genome sequences in the LANL HIV database. While subtypes and CRFs are unevenly spread across the world, in total 89 countries were represented. For consensus sequences that were based on at least 20 genomes, we found that on average 2.3% (range 0.8C10%) of the consensus genome site states changed from 2002 to 2021, of which about half were nucleotide state differences and the rest insertions and deletions. Interestingly, the 2021 consensus sequences were shorter than in 2002, and compared to 4,674 HIV-1 worldwide genome sequences, the 2021 consensuses were somewhat closer to the worldwide genome sequences, i.e., showing on average fewer nucleotide state differences. Some subtypes/CRFs have had limited geographical spread, and thus sampling of subtypes/CRFs is uneven, at least in part, due to the epidemiological dynamics.

PSS and PSQI levels were positively correlated in both groups with r values of 0.975 for Doctors and 0.544 for other staff, respectively. Conclusions: Doctors were found to have higher PSS and PSQI levels as compared to the control group. PSS levels were found to be positively correlated with PSQI levels and more so among doctors.","output":"A study of perceived stress level and sleep quality among physicians in a hospital of West Bengal, during the second wave of the present coronavirus disease-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 Pandemic is unique in its near universal scope and in the way that it has changed our lives. These facts suggest that it might also be unique in its effects on memory. A framework outlined in this article, Transition Theory, is used to explicate the mnemonically relevant ways in which the onset of the Pandemic differs from other personal and collective transitions and how the Pandemic Period might differ from other personally-defined and historically-defined autobiographical periods. Transition Theory also provides the basis for several predictions. Specifically, it predicts (a) a COVID bump (an increase in availability of event memories at the outset of the Pandemic) followed by (b) a lockdown dip (a decrease in availability of event memories from lockdown periods compared to other stable periods). It also predicts that (c) people may consider the Pandemic an important chapter in their life stories, but only when there is little continuity between their pre-Pandemic and post-Pandemic lives. Time will tell whether these predictions pan out. However, it is not too soon to highlight those aspects of the COVID-19 Pandemic that are likely to shape our personal and collective memories of this very unusual historical period.","output":"The possible effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the contents and organization of autobiographical memory: A Transition-Theory perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health care systems in transitional countries have witnessed unprecedented challenges related to adequate and continuous health care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic. In many countries, including Libya, institutions and organizations have begun to implement telehealth technology for the first time. This serves to establish an alternative modality for direct physician-patient interviews to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the usability of telehealth services in Libya and to provide an overview of the current COVID-19 scenario. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, an anonymous web-based survey was administered to Libyan residents between April and May 2020. Participants were contacted through text messaging, emails, and social media. The survey items yielded information on the sociodemographic characteristics, availability and accessibility of health care services, effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care services, mental health status, and the feasibility and application of the telehealth system. RESULTS: We obtained 2512 valid responses, of which 1721 (68.5%) were from females. The participants were aged 28.2 (SD 7.6) years, of whom 2333 (92.9%) were aged <40 years, and 1463 (58.2%) were single. Regarding the health care services and their accessibility, 786 (31.1%) participants reported having a poor health status in general, and 492 (19.6%) reported having a confirmed diagnosis of at least one chronic disease. Furthermore, 498 (19.9%) participants reported varying degrees of difficulty in accessing health care centers, and 1558 (62.0%) could not access their medical records. Additionally, 1546 (61.6%) participants experienced problems in covering medical costs, and 1429 (56.9%) avoided seeking medical care owing to financial concerns. Regarding the feasibility of the telehealth system, approximately half of the participants reported that telehealth services were useful during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 1545 (61.5%) reported that the system was an effective means of communication and of obtaining health care services. Furthermore, 1435 (57.1%) participants felt comfortable using the telehealth system, and 1129 (44.9%) felt that they were able to express themselves effectively. Moreover, 1389 (55.3%) participants found the system easy to understand, and 1354 (53.9%) reported having excellent communication with physicians through the telehealth system. However, only 1018 (40.5%) participants reported that communication was better with the telehealth system than with traditional methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed high levels of usability and willingness to use the telemedicine system as an alternative modality to in-person consultations among the Libyan residents in this study. This system is advantageous because it helps overcome health care costs, increases access to prompt medical care and follow-up evaluation, and reduces the risk of COVID-19 transmission. However, internet connectivity and electricity issues could be a substantial barrier for many resource-limited communities, and further studies should address such obstacles.","output":"Utilization of Telehealth Services in Libya in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the gender differences in covid-19 patients with arterial hypertension. Design and method: This is a retrospective observational study comparing the association by gender of hypertensive status and with mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19.All patients admitted to our Hospitals, from 12 March to 12 April 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Patients with COVID-19 included in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance. Patients' demographic characteristics and clinical data (symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory findings, and outcomes) during hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality by gender during hospitalization. Other endpoints included the time elapsed between onset of symptoms and discharge, the rates of use of invasive mechanical ventilation, and the differences by gender in the treatment. The diagnosis of hypertension was given by the patient's physician prior to the infection with SARS-CoV-2. Results: In total, 877 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. The median time from symptom onset to hospitalization was 4.6 for men and 2.6 days for women (p&lt;0.05). Among these patients, 58% had a medical history of hypertension (57% men and 46% for women), p &lt;0.05. The spectrum of symptoms of COVID-19 at admission between the two cohorts did not differ significantly. A total of (15.0%) patients died in the hypertension cohort (14% for men and 16% for women;p ns) In particular, patients with hypertension had the propensity to develop more severe/ critical COVID-19 disease (P for trend &lt; 0.001) and were more likely to receive invasive mechanical ventilation (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 and hypertension have been reported to have an increased risk of adverse outcomes. In particular female patients with hypertension require intensive care (16% vs 11% for men, p &lt;0.05) but no differences by gender for mortality rate we report. As described above, these data showed that hypertensive patients are at the highest risk for outcomes adverse.

The study group comprised 916 persons with myopia, while the control group comprised 187 persons without refractive error. Volunteers underwent routine eye examinations and completed a set of questionnaires about anxiety and depression. Then, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores were compared between groups, and the relationships between anxiety and the degree of myopia and between depression and the degree of myopia were analyzed. RESULTS There was a significant difference in anxiety rate between the students with normal vision and those with myopia. The SAS scores among students with mild, moderate, and severe myopia were also significantly different. However, compared with the students with normal vision, the rate of depression was not significantly increased in the students with myopia, except in cases of severe myopia. Additionally, the SAS scores correlated closely with the diopters of the participants' glasses (r = 0.43, p = .045), while the relationship between SDS scores and the diopters of glasses was not significant (r = 0.19, p = .325).

METHODS AND RESULTS The lactobacilli putative probiotic (SynForU-HerCare; two capsules/day of 9.5 log CFU/capsule) or placebo was administered for 8-weeks in a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study. Subjects were assessed for vaginal and gut health conditions at baseline, week-4 and week-8 via questionnaires. The vulvovaginal symptom questionnaire not only covered aspects pertaining to vulvovaginal symptoms but also the quality of life impacts such as emotional, social and sexual. The administration of lactobacilli reduced symptoms of irritation (P=0.023) and discharge (P=0.011) starting week-4 and continued after week-8 (P<0.05), accompanied by reduced symptoms for burning after week-8 (P=0.046) as compared to the placebo. Patients consuming lactobacilli also showed reduced concern about symptoms after week-4 (P=0.010) and continued after week-8 (P=0.001), accompanied by reduced impairment of daily activities attributed to vulvovaginal symptoms (P=0.012) and continued after week-8 (P=0.026). Insignificant differences were observed for sexual impacts between treatment groups. The administration of lactobacilli also reduced recurrences of both emotional and social stress as compared to the placebo at both week-4 and week-8 (P<0.05). Patients consuming lactobacilli showed higher defecation times per week at week-4 (P=0.010) and week-8 (P=0.001) as compared to the placebo group, indicating potential to reduce risks of pregnancy-induced constipation. CONCLUSIONS Lactobacilli probiotics are beneficial towards pregnant women, especially in reducing vulvovaginal symptoms and recurrences of VC, accompanied by improved emotional and social distress attributed to VC. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY The study demonstrated the preventive and modulatory roles of lactobacilli strains against VC in pregnant women.

Recent advances in HIV-1 immunogen design demonstrated that native-like HIV-1 Envelope (Env) trimers that mimic the structure of virion-associated Env induce neutralization breadth in rabbits and macaques. Here, we describe the development of an IDLV-based HIV-1 vaccine expressing either soluble ConSOSL.UFO.664 or membrane-tethered ConSOSL.UFO.750 native-like Env immunogens with enhanced bNAb epitopes exposure. We show that IDLV can be pseudotyped with properly folded membrane-tethered native-like UFO.750 trimers. After a single IDLV injection in BALB/c mice, IDLV-UFO.750 induced a faster humoral kinetic as well as higher levels of anti-Env IgG compared to IDLV-UFO.664. IDLV-UFO.750 vaccinated cynomolgus macaques developed unusually long-lasting anti-Env IgG antibodies, as underlined by their remarkable half-life both after priming and boost with IDLV. After boosting with recombinant ConM SOSIP.v7 protein, two animals developed neutralization activity against the autologous tier 1B ConS virus mediated by V1/V2 and V3 glycan sites responses. By combining the possibility to display stabilized trimeric Env on the vector particles with the ability to induce sustained humoral responses, IDLVs represent an appropriate strategy for delivering rationally designed antigens to progress towards an effective HIV-1 vaccine.","output":"Persistent immunogenicity of integrase defective lentiviral vectors delivering membrane-tethered native-like HIV-1 envelope trimers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this section of the journal, in the midst of a pandemic crisis it seemed incongruous to publish on any topic except Coronavirus At the time of writing, many health professionals who are members of CoramBAAF are at the frontline of the fight with the virus and some medical advisers and health professionals working with looked after children have been redeployed from their substantive roles to work in other areas of health care provision Health service interventions and assessments are critical components of adoption and fostering work These assessments are usually reliant on face-to-face, clinical contacts with children, carers and families How can these tasks be completed in a world where direct contact is not advised?

A 27-question e-survey was sent through the International Psoriasis Council (IPC) to its 114 dermatologist councilors worldwide. The survey assessed demographics, general and DR prescription behaviour, and motivations for and barriers against application of DR. Of 57 respondents, 53 respondents who prescribed biologics were included for analysis. Thirty-seven (69.8%) applied DR (i.e., 'DR dermatologists'), and 16 (30.2%) did not (i.e., 'Non-DR dermatologists'). DR strategies varied among respondents. Regarding criteria for starting DR, differences were reported in required treatment duration, and interpretation and duration of stable low disease activity. In addition, the prolongation of intervals between injections varied between respondents. For most 'DR dermatologists' (n = 32/37, 86.5%), cost savings were one of the main reasons to apply DR. Fifteen out of 16 'Non-DR dermatologists' (94%) did not apply DR due to lack of scientific evidence. In conclusion, DR of biologics for psoriasis is part of clinical practice in psoriasis experts globally. Barriers for applying DR included lack of evidence or guidelines, and uncertainty on DR effects and risks. Although growing evidence shows DR feasibility, future studies are needed to accumulate and broaden evidence, along with development of (inter)national guidelines on DR strategies.","output":"Attitudes and behaviour regarding dose reduction of biologics for psoriasis: a survey among dermatologists worldwide."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ivermectin and Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Keeping Rigor in Times of Urgency.","output":"Ivermectin and COVID-19: Keeping Rigor in Times of Urgency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic will exert a devastating and destructive impact on the South African tourism economy with its ramifications felt countrywide Nevertheless, the negative local impacts of the pandemic will be particularly harsh for those parts of South Africa where tourism is a critical sector in the local economy The objective in this article is to identify the tourism spaces of vulnerability in South Africa Use is made of the IHS Global Insight data base for 2016 to analyse at a local authority scale the most vulnerable localities to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic Indicators used to isolate tourism spaces of vulnerability are total tourism spend;tourism spend as a proportion of local GDP;domestic and international tourism (trips and bednights);and, leisure, business and VFR (visiting friends and relatives) travel The analysis discloses those local authorities that are the most vulnerable to the downturn/collapse of tourism as a whole as well as to the hollowing out of specific forms of tourism, namely domestic as opposed to international travel, leisure as opposed to business or VFR travel ? 2020 AJHTL /Author(s)","output":"COVID-19 and tourism spaces of vulnerability in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Whilst Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) wreaked havoc, an expected increase in exacerbations of asthma did not materialize There was significant improvement in quality of air during lockdown period due to reduced traffic and industrial activity as per local metrological data The aim of this study was to determine the impact of enforced social distancing (i e lockdown) and air pollution on patients with severe asthma taking biologic therapy over 12 weeks' period Methods A cross-sectional survey of 60 patients with severe asthma receiving biologic therapy was performed with ethical approval Results Fifty six (56) patients participated (F39;mean age 47 4 years;response rate 93 3%) Mean time since diagnosis was 19 6 years (SD 11 5 years) All had been on biologic therapy Omalizumab (45), Mepolizumab (7), or Dupilumab (2) for at least three months (mean 38 4 months  SD 26 5 months) subjectively thirty, 30 (53 6%) patients reported improvement in their asthma symptoms and attributed it to reduced traffic activity Objective Stratified asthma control test (ACT) scores are detailed in table 1 There was an increase in the proportion of patients who were controlled before and after 12 weeks of the lockdown [23 (41%) vs 34 (60 7%)] When all participants whose ACT scores increased were compared with those whose did not, no statistically significant differences in age, gender, employment status, level of education, marital status, access to medications, oral steroid use, ED visits, or failure to receive scheduled biologic therapy were found None were admitted to hospital and 38 patients did not escalate their treatment during the 12 weeks' period Eighteen (32 1%) patients' ACT scores improved-3 points The absolute difference in the proportion of patients with controlled asthma was 19 6% (95%CI 1 5%-37 8%) Conclusions During the COVID-19 lockdown period there were significant subjective and objective improvement in asthma symptoms based on ACT Scores over 12 weeks' period We believe that the major reason for this improvement is a reduction in air pollution due to reduced traffic and industrial activity, though other factors (psychological, behavioral) were beyond the scope of this study","output":"The effects of the covid-19 lockdown on severe Asthma in patients taking biologic therapy and Air pollution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ivermectin is one among several potential drugs explored for its therapeutic and preventive role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Profession, gender, age and date of diagnosis were matched for 186 case-control pairs. Cases and controls were healthcare workers who tested positive and negative, respectively, for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Exposure was defined as the intake of ivermectin and/or hydroxychloroquine and/or vitamin-C and/or other prophylaxis for COVID-19. Data collection and entry was done in Epicollect5, and analysis was performed using STATA version 13. Conditional logistic regression models were used to describe the associated factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Ivermectin prophylaxis was taken by 76 controls and 41 cases. Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis (AOR 0.27, 95% CI, 0.15-0.51) was associated with a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers for the following month.

While care aides provide most of this support they are rarely empowered to lead quality improvement (QI) initiatives. Researchers have shown that care aide-led teams can successfully participate in a QI intervention called Safer Care for Older Persons in Residential Care Environments (SCOPE). In preparation for a large-scale study, we conducted a 1-year pilot to evaluate how well coaching strategies helped teams to enact this intervention. Secondarily, we measured if improvements in team cohesion and communication, and resident quality of care, occurred. METHODS This study was conducted using a prospective single-arm study design, on 7 nursing homes in Winnipeg Manitoba belonging to the Translating Research in Elder Care research program. One QI team was selected per site, led by care aides who partnered with other front-line staff. Each team received facilitated coaching to enact SCOPE during three learning sessions, and additional support from quality advisors between these sessions. Researchers developed a rubric to evaluate how well teams enacted their interventions (i.e., created actionable aim statements, implemented interventions using plan-do-study-act cycles, and used measurement to guide decision-making). Team cohesion and communication were measured using surveys, and changes in unit-level quality indicators were measured using Resident Assessment Instrument-Minimum Data Set data. RESULTS Most teams successfully enacted their interventions. Five of 7 teams created adequate-to-excellent aim statements. While 6 of 7 teams successfully implemented plan-do-study-act cycles, only 2 reported spreading their change ideas to other residents and staff on their unit. Three of 7 teams explicitly stated how measurement was used to guide intervention decisions. Teams scored high in cohesion and communication at baseline, and hence improved minimally. Indicators of resident quality care improved in 4 nursing home units; teams at 3 of these sites were scored as 'excellent' in two or more enactment areas, versus 1 of the 3 remaining teams. CONCLUSIONS Our coaching strategies helped most care aide-led teams to enact SCOPE. Coaching modifications are needed to help teams more effectively use measurement. Refinements to our evaluation rubric are also recommended.","output":"SCOPE: safer care for older persons (in residential) environments-a pilot study to enhance care aide-led quality improvement in nursing homes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To explore the association between blood pressure (BP) levels after endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) and the clinical outcomes of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO). METHODS A study was eligible if it enrolled AIS patients older than 18 years, with an LVO treated with either successful or unsuccessful EVT, and provided either individual or mean 24-hour systolic BP values after the end of the EVT procedure. Individual patient data from all studies were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed-effects model. RESULTS A total of 5874 patients (mean age: 6914 years, 50% women, median NIHSS on admission: 16) from 7 published studies were included. Increasing mean systolic BP levels per 10 mm Hg during the first 24 hours after the end of the EVT were associated with a lower odds of functional improvement (unadjusted common OR=0.82, 95%CI:0.80-0.85; adjusted common OR=0.88, 95%CI:0.84-0.93) and modified Ranking Scale score2 (unadjusted OR=0.82, 95%CI:0.79-0.85; adjusted OR=0.87, 95%CI:0.82-0.93), and a higher odds of all-cause mortality (unadjusted OR=1.18, 95%CI:1.13-1.24; adjusted OR=1.15, 95%CI:1.06-1.23) at 3 months. Higher 24-hour mean systolic BP levels were also associated with an increased likelihood of early neurological deterioration (unadjusted OR=1.14, 95%CI:1.07-1.21; adjusted OR=1.14, 95%CI:1.03-1.24) and a higher odds of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (unadjusted OR=1.20, 95%CI:1.09-1.29; adjusted OR=1.20, 95%CI:1.03-1.38) after EVT. CONCLUSION Increased mean systolic BP levels in the first 24 hours after EVT are independently associated with a higher odds of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, early neurological deterioration, three-month mortality, and worse three-month functional outcomes.","output":"Blood Pressure After Endovascular Thrombectomy and Outcomes in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke: An Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We assessed dental service utilization in very old Germans. METHODS: A comprehensive sample of 404,610 very old ( 75 years), insured at a large statutory insurer (Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse Nordost, active in the federal states Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania), was followed over 6 years (2012C2017). Our outcome was the utilization of dental services, in total (any utilization) and in five subgroups: (1) examinations and associated assessment or advice, (2) restorations, (3) surgery, (4) prevention, (5) outreach care. Association of utilization with (1) sex, (2) age, (3) region, (4) social hardship status, (5) ICD-10 diagnoses, and (6) German modified diagnosis-related groups (GM-DRGs) was explored. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the sample was 81.9 (5.4) years. The utilization of any dental service was 73%; utilization was highest for examinations (68%), followed by prevention (44%), surgery (33%), restorations (32%), and outreach care (13%). Utilization decreased with age for nearly all services except outreach care. Service utilization was significantly higher in Berlin and most cities compared with rural municipalities, and in individuals with common, less severe, and short-term conditions compared with life-threatening and long-term conditions. In multi-variable analysis, social hardship status (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.12-1.16), federal state (Brandenburg 0.85; 0.84C0.87; Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: 0.80; 0.78C0.82), and age significantly affected utilization (0.95; 0.95C0.95/year), together with a range of co-morbidities according to ICD-10 and DRG. CONCLUSIONS: Social, demographic, regional, and general health aspects were associated with the utilization of dental services in very old Germans. Policies to maintain access to services up to high age are needed. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The utilization of dental services in the very old in northeast Germany showed significant disparities within populations. Policies to allow service utilization for sick, economically disadvantaged, rural and very old populations are required. These may include incentives for outreach servicing, treatment-fee increases for specific populations, or referral schemes between general medical practitioners and dentists.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) strains can be classified into two major genetic groups, P1 type 1 (P1-1) and P1 type 2 (P1-2). It remains unknown if clinical manifestations of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children differ between the two genotypes. We aimed to determine if M. pneumoniae P1 genotype is associated with severity of LRTI in children. Methods. Medical charts of 420 children ( 15 years-old) with signs of acute LRTI who were PCR-positive for M. pneumoniae from pharyngeal swabs in a recent M. pneumoniae epidemic were analyzed. We used a culture and pyrosequencing approach for genotyping PCR-positive samples. We compared epidemiological and clinical data of children with either P1-1 or P1-2 LRTI. Results. P1-2-infected children presented with a significantly higher median baseline C-reactive protein level and were admitted to the hospital more often. P1 genotype had a significant predictive value in a multiple linear regression model predicting C-reactive protein levels in our study sample. Moreover, P1 genotype significantly affected the likelihood of hospital admission in a logistic regression model. Our modelling results were also confirmed on an additional, independent sample of children with M. pneumoniae LRTI. Conclusions. Results from our large patient group indicate that the two M. pneumoniae P1 genotypes may have different pathogenic potential and that LRTI with P1-2 strains may have a more severe disease course than those with P1-1 strains in children. P1 genotyping is not routinely performed, but could be used as a predictor of M. pneumoniae LRTI severity, enabling patient-tailored treatments.","output":"Mycoplasma pneumoniae P1 genotype indicates severity of lower respiratory tract infections in children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current context of restricted movement due to COVID-19, I have found myself reflecting upon my connection to friends and collaborators in Palestine. This article proposes my use of a performance score - Skill-less Tricks - as a method of cultivating an ongoing connection with those friends and collaborators. As many western nation states have spent much of the last year policing their borders in ways anathema to the freedom of movement expected by global tourism, my time and relationships in Palestine have been brought into sharp relief. This article begins with a discussion of my connection to Palestine and how I came to be regularly working with communities in the West Bank. It explains the personal and political impulse for crossing the wall between Israel and Palestine, and the bodily experience of what it takes to cross a border (Noeth 2019). The main reason for my ongoing work in Palestine is due to working with the SkatePal charity in the West Bank who build skateparks and teach children to skateboard. This article reflects on the role SkatePal take within this specific political context. The history and current context of the Palestine/Israel conflict have been well documented in numerous sources including Elizabeth Matthewss edited collection with David Newman and Mohammed Dajani Daoudi (2011). This source presents a range of viewpoints on central aspects of the conflict from sixteen contributors and offers a balanced introduction. Instead of repeating work that has been done elsewhere, this article reflects on aspects of the current state of the conflict from my own personal perspective captured in journal entries, which are scattered throughout the main body of the text. This selection of journal entries is - more or less - as they were written during the three weeks I spent with SkatePal in the summer of 2015. I have selected material from my journal that is most directly associated with experiences of the wall, of crossing checkpoints and borders and about expressive movement practice. The decision I made to journal my experience was inspired by reflective practice in performance and dance broadly as a research method, and by anthropologist Michael Taussigs own reflections and experience of Palestine in his article, Two weeks in Palestine (2013).

Rapid diagnostic testing methods can alleviate some of these challenges by providing definitive diagnoses earlier in the clinical course, leading to appropriate targeted therapy, cost savings, and improved patient outcomes. The BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 plus (RP2plus; bioMrieux, Marcy lEtoile, France) is a multiplexed nucleic acid test for detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and 14 common viral and 4 bacterial respiratory pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from those meeting MERS-CoV epidemiological criteria. The aim of this study was to verify the FilmArray RP2plus for use in our biocontainment unit. Of note, the RP2plus is FDA approved but not currently available for sale in the United States. Eight patient samples were tested with known results (GenMark Respiratory Virus Panel [RVP] or Cepheid Xpert Flu/RSV). We had concordant results between the platforms for samples containing influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 2, rhinovirus, and a negative sample. We evaluated two influenza B samples from two different patients. The FilmArray RP2plus did not detect influenza B in one of the patient samples. The sample was exhausted and repeat testing could not be performed. A second rhinovirus sample was not detected by the RP2plus, but Coronavirus 229E was detected in this sample, a virus not detected by the RVP. The sample was repeated and again did not detect rhinovirus. Further investigation into this discrepancy revealed that rhinovirus was originally detected by RVP at a signal of 34.4 nA (repeat of 46.9 nA). The concordant rhinovirus sample had a signal of 226.7 nA by RVP, which was much higher than the discrepant sample. Because of the low signal by RVP in the discrepant sample, perhaps the viral load was below the limit of detection of the RP2plus. All other quality control sample pools passed verification testing, including day-to-day and operator variance. It is not uncommon for a person under investigation (PUI) for a highly communicable disease to be evaluated in our facility. The performance of the RP2plus test on clinical samples showed acceptable concordance with our current means of testing for respiratory pathogens. The RP2plus will eliminate challenges implicated in storing and transporting specimens to an off-site lab, facilitate quicker turnaround time, and streamline the often cumbersome, complex protocols and practices required to work up a serious communicable disease.","output":"Verification of a Novel Multiplex PCR Respiratory Virus Panel in a US Biocontainment Unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction. Previous priming with avian influenza vaccines results in more rapid and more robust neutralizing antibody responses upon revaccination, but the role CD4(+) T cells play in this process is not currently known. Methods. Human subjects previously enrolled in trials of inactivated influenza A(H5N1) vaccines and naive subjects were immunized with an inactivated subunit influenza A/Indonesia/5/05(H5N1) vaccine. Neutralizing antibody responses were measured by a microneutralization assay, and hemagglutinin (HA)-specific and nucleoprotein (NP)-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses were quantified using interferon  enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays. Results. While vaccination induced barely detectable CD4(+) T-cell responses specific for HA in the previously unprimed group, primed subjects had readily detectable HA-specific memory CD4(+) T cells at baseline and mounted a more robust response to HA-specific epitopes after vaccination. There were no differences between groups when conserved NP-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses were examined. Interestingly, neutralizing antibody responses following revaccination were significantly higher in individuals who mounted a CD4(+) T-cell response to the H5 HA protein, a correlation not observed for NP-specific responses. Conclusions. These findings suggest that prepandemic vaccination results in an enriched population of HA-specific CD4(+) T cells that are recruited on rechallenge with a drifted vaccine variant and contribute to more robust and more rapid neutralizing antibody responses.","output":"Effect of Influenza A(H5N1) Vaccine Prepandemic Priming on CD4(+) T-Cell Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With Census X-12 model and ARIMA model, this paper quantitatively analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the latent emissiveness of Chinese residents which happened at the end of 2019.

To initiate infection, the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 requires proteolytic processing mediated by host proteases. Among the host proteases proposed to carry out this activation is the cysteine protease cathepsin L. Inhibiting cathepsin L has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for treating COVID-19. SLV213 (K777) is an orally administered small molecule protease inhibitor that exhibits in vitro activity against a range of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. To confirm efficacy in vivo, K777 was evaluated in an African green monkey (AGM) model of COVID-19. A pilot experiment was designed to test K777 in a prophylactic setting, animals were pre-treated with 100mg/kg K777 (N=4) or vehicle (N=2) before inoculation with SARS-CoV-2. Initial data demonstrated that K777 treatment reduced pulmonary pathology compared to vehicle-treated animals. A second study was designed to test activity in a therapeutic setting, with K777 treatment (33 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg) initiated 8 hours after exposure to the virus. In both experiments, animals received K777 daily via oral gavage for 7 days. Vehicle-treated animals exhibited higher lung weights, pleuritis, and diffuse alveolar damage. In contrast, lung pathology was reduced in K777-treated monkeys, and histopathological analyses confirmed the lack of diffuse alveolar damage. Antiviral effects were further demonstrated by quantitative reductions in viral load of samples collected from upper and lower airways. These preclinical data support the potential for early SLV213 treatment in COVID-19 patients to prevent severe lung pathology and disease progression.","output":"An Orally Available Cathepsin L Inhibitor Protects Lungs Against SARS-CoV-2-Induced Diffuse Alveolar Damage in African Green Monkeys"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organizations global action plan on workers health establishes that occupational health services should carry out lifestyle interventions within the workplace, to prevent the development of non-communicable diseases.

Its addition to the treatment of neuropathic pain may reduce pain intensity and improve overall quality of life. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed to investigate the addition of ketamine to the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain. Patients and Methods: GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used to rate the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Eighteen (18) randomized controlled trials including 706 participants were included for further analysis. Results: Ketamine addition to standard treatment of neuropathic pain (NP) resulted in a statistically significant reduction of pain intensity at one week after the end of treatment with ketamine (MD -2.14, 95% CI -2.65 to -1.63; p<0.00001) and after 30 days after the end of treatment with ketamine (MD -1.68, 95% CI -2.25 to -1.12; p<0.00001) and a statistically significant increase in discomfort (RR 4.06; 95% CI 1.18 to 13.95; p=0.03), and psychedelic effects (RR 4.94; 95% CI 2.76 to 8.84; p<0.00001). Conclusion: There is a statistically significant pain reduction by adding ketamine to the treatment of chronic NP when compared to the standard treatment. However, such pain reduction comes at the expense of adverse outcomes, especially psychedelic effects related to the administration of ketamine. However, the overall quality of certainty of evidence is low due to the clinical heterogeneity among the intervention characteristics of the trials analyzed (different administration routes, dosing regimen, therapy durations, different clinical characteristics of the population investigated).

As initial teacher educators at a public University in South Africa we noted that the sudden move to working online has presented various challenges to first year students overall well-being which has further exacerbated issues of exclusion and marginalization for many. We argue that it is against this backdrop that this paper explores how the move to online learning has affected first year students overall well-being, at one teacher education institution. The Index for Inclusive Education was used as a theoretical lens to explore students perceptions of the institutions policy, teaching and learning practices, and the institutional culture during this period. One hundred and eighty-seven purposively selected first year students participated in this qualitative, phenomenological research study. Data were collected by means of open-ended questionnaires. Responses were categorized by means of an emergent thematic analysis. The findings indicated that online learning compromised various aspects of well-being including physical, emotional, psycho-social and financial well-being for many students. The experiences of online learning and impact on well-being did, however, differ across students depending on their individual contexts and circumstances indicating that considerations of well-being need to take contextual realities into account to support the well-being and learning of all.

Metapopulation epidemic modeling studies in the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) style have played important roles in informing public health policy making to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. These models typically rely on a key assumption on the homogeneity of the population. This assumption certainly cannot be expected to hold true in real situations; various geographic, socioeconomic, and cultural environments affect the behaviors that drive the spread of COVID-19 in different communities. What's more, variation of intracounty environments creates spatial heterogeneity of transmission in different regions. To address this issue, we develop a human mobility flow-augmented stochastic SEIR-style epidemic modeling framework with the ability to distinguish different regions and their corresponding behaviors. This modeling framework is then combined with data assimilation and machine learning techniques to reconstruct the historical growth trajectories of COVID-19 confirmed cases in two counties in Wisconsin. The associations between the spread of COVID-19 and business foot traffic, race and ethnicity, and age structure are then investigated. The results reveal that, in a college town (Dane County), the most important heterogeneity is age structure, while, in a large city area (Milwaukee County), racial and ethnic heterogeneity becomes more apparent. Scenario studies further indicate a strong response of the spread rate to various reopening policies, which suggests that policy makers may need to take these heterogeneities into account very carefully when designing policies for mitigating the ongoing spread of COVID-19 and reopening.","output":"Intracounty modeling of COVID-19 infection with human mobility: Assessing spatial heterogeneity with business traffic, age, and race"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerged disease with various clinical manifestations and imaging features.

Qualitative assessment of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was based on four assays: Abbott Architect SARS-Cov-2 IgG assay (target nucleocapsid) (Abbott-NP) and three in-house IgG ELISA assays (target spike glycoprotein (Spike), spike receptor binding domain (RBD), and nucleocapsid (NP)). Seroprevalence was estimated using multiple composite reference standards (CRS) and by a series of Bayesian Latent Class Models (BLCM) (using uninformative, weakly, and informative priors). Results: 8999 blood samples were tested. The Abbott-NP assay consistently estimated seroprevalence to be lower than the ELISA-based assays. Discordance between assays was common, 13 unique diagnostic phenotypes were observed. Only 32 samples (0.4%) were positive by all four assays. BLCM using uninformative priors predicted seroprevalence increased from 0.7% (95% credible interval (CrI); 0.4, 1.0%) in April/May to 0.8% (95% CrI 0.5, 1.2%) in June/July to 1.1% (95% CrI 0.7, 1.6) in August/September.

A cross-sectional phase in this study will gather more evidence concerning this topic. A longitudinal phase will explore the efficacy of a biofeedback intervention based on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in adolescents with ASD. Finally, a feasibility study will focus on a non-supervised RSA biofeedback intervention in this population. METHODS: The cross-sectional phase includes the comparison of adolescents with ASD (n=38) and age- and gender-matched typically developing peers. A standardized assessment will be used which contains physiological, cortisol, and behavioral measurements. The longitudinal phase contains a randomized, single-blinded, and sham-controlled design to determine the efficacy of supervised RSA biofeedback in adolescents with ASD (n=128). A follow-up phase of 5 weeks is included to evaluate the presence of retention effects. During the latter, a feasibility study will focus on a non-supervised intervention (n=64). Assessments as described previously are scheduled after the intervention and the follow-up phase. DISCUSSION: First, more conclusive evidence will be provided for the presence of lower cardiac vagal modulation in adolescents with ASD as well as the association between these lower values and physiological and behavioral indices. Second, the supervised intervention in adolescents with ASD is hypothesized to upregulate this cardiac vagal modulation and positively change behavioral and physiological parameters. Third, evidence regarding the feasibility and acceptability of a non-supervised intervention may open novel avenues for home-based interventions in this population.

These tumors can cause symptoms including abdominal pain, obstruction, intussusception, volvulus, GI bleeding, or amass and should be resected if symptomatic. Open surgical resection is considered the standard for removing these tumors. However, recent improvements in endoscopic and laparoscopic equipment have made it possible to utilize minimally invasive techniques of tumor removal including complete endoscopic resection or endoscopic-assisted laparoscopic resection. We present the case of an adolescent female with a large mass located at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) causing GI bleeding. Given the location of the mass near the GEJ and the morbidity associated with surgical resection, we performed laparoscopic-assisted complete endoscopic resection of tumor. In addition, this tumor had an unusual immunohistochemical-staining pattern, with focal expression of markers more often seen in GI stromal tumors, elucidating a gray area between these two tumor classes with potential implications for patient follow-up.

How this is related to legislation remains underassessed. This study explored change over time in public support for standardised packaging in countries with varying degrees of legislative provisions. METHODS We used data from 27 European countries, collected from 2017 (n=28, 300) and 2020 (n=27, 901) waves of the Eurobarometer survey, to assess self-reported support for standardised packaging regulations among both smokers and non-smokers. Countries were grouped into three categories of policy adoption (policy implemented; policy legislated; no legislation) and changes in support were assessed using multilevel Poisson regression models. RESULTS In 2020, public support for standardised packaging was 71% (95% CI 68% to 74%) in countries that implemented standardised packaging legislation, 57% (55% to 60%) in countries that had legislated but not yet implemented legislation and 41% (40%to 42%) in countries with no legislation. Compared with 2017, this represented a relative change of +8% (1% to 15%), +12% (5% to 21%) and -5% (95% CI -2% to -8%), respectively, in the three country categories. Among smokers, there was no indication of change in support across the three groups. Among non-smokers, support increased in countries with existing legislation (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]=1.14, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.23) and decreased in countries with no legislation (aPR=0.93, 0.90 to 0.97).

Aspiring neurosurgeons can contribute to the academic neurosurgery workforce by taking care of less technical and time-consuming research tasks. Fortunately, global neurosurgery institutions have also made efforts to increase research exposure and scholarly output in academic global neurosurgery. The Association of Future African Neurosurgeons (AFAN) created a research incubator for aspiring academic global neurosurgeons in Africa to provide enrollees with mentorship, skills, and experience. This study assesses and reports the activities and results of the research incubator. Methods: Aspiring academic global neurosurgeons were enrolled in the AFAN Research Incubator Program (ARIP), whose primary objective was to provide enrollees with foundational skills in all aspects of the research cycle. ARIP enrollees participated in didactic and practical activities with the aim of publishing 1 article and presenting 1 abstracts at international conferences in one year. Results: Fifteen AFAN members aged 25.0  3.0 years enrolled in ARIP: 7 (46.7%) medical students, 4 (26.7%) general practitioners, and 4 (26.7%) residents. Eleven (73.3%) were male, 6 (40.0%) were from Cameroon and 6 (40.0%) had no previous research experience. Two (13.3%) enrollees dropped out. ARIP enrollees published a total of 28 articles, and enrollees published a median of 1.0 (IQR = 2) first-author articles on neurosurgical system strengthening. Additionally, ARIP enrollees presented 20 abstracts with a median of one abstract (IQR = 3.0). Conclusion: South-South research collaborations like ARIP can contribute to improving global neurosurgery research capacity and output.

Herein, we aim to describe features of pediatric visits to the ED of Salerno University Hospital and to evaluate parental reasons behind the decision to walk in. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study evaluating ED encounters for children from January 2014 to December 2019. The appropriateness of visits was measured with a national tool assessing every ED encounter, namely, the Mattoni method, which consists of the combination of the triage code assigned, the diagnostic resources adopted, and the consultation outcomes. Moreover, 64 questionnaires were collected from a sample of parents in the waiting rooms in January 2020. Results: A total number of 42,507 visits were recorded during the study period (19,126 females; mean age  SD: 4.3  3.8 years), the majority of whom were inappropriate (75.8% over the considered period; 73.6% in 2014; 74.6% in 2015; 76.3% in 2016; 76.7% in 2017; 77.9% in 2018; 75.5% in 2019). Most of the inappropriate consultations arrived at the ED by their own vehicle (94.4%), following an independent decision of the parents (97.2%), especially in the evening and at night on Saturdays/Sundays/holidays (69.7%). A multivariate analysis revealed the following: patients of younger age (OR: 1.11, 95% C.I. 1.06C1.16; p < 0.0019), night visits (OR 1.39; 95% C.I.: 1.32C1.47; p < 0.001), patients living in the municipality of Salerno (OR 1.28; 95% C.I.: 1.22C1.34; p < 0.001), weekend day visits (OR 1.48; 95% C.I.: 1.41C1.56; p < 0.001), and independent parental decision without previous contact with primary care pediatrician (OR 3.01; 95% C.I.: 2.64C3.44; p < 0.001) were all significant independent predictors of inappropriate consultation. The most frequent trigger of ED encounters was fever (51.4%). Hospital admission made up 17.6% of all consultations. The questionnaire showed that most parents were aware of the lack of urgency (20.3%) or minor urgency (53.1%) of the visit. The reasons for walking in were the impossibility to receive a home consultation (70%), the difficulty of contacting their family pediatrician during weekends and holidays (54.4%), as well as the search for a quick, effective, diagnosis and therapy (48.4%). Conclusions: The study suggests a highly inappropriate use of ED for children in our region.

However, little is known about this practice, including potential motivating factors. Objective: To examine individual reasons for accessing medication abortion through an online telemedicine service as well as associations between state- and county-level factors and the rate of requests. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cross-sectional study examined all requests for self-managed medication abortion through an online consultation form available from Aid Access, a telemedicine service in the US, between March 20, 2018, and March 20, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Individual-level reasons for accessing the telemedicine service were examined as well as the rate of requests per 100a?000 women of reproductive age by state. Zip code data provided by individuals making requests were used to examine county-level factors hypothesized to be associated with increased demand for self-managed abortion: distance to a clinic (calculated using location data for US abortion clinics) and the population proportion identifying as a member of a racial/ethnic minority group, living below the federal poverty level, and having broadband internet access (calculated using census data). Results: During the 2-year study period, 57a?506 individuals in 2458 counties in 50 states requested self-managed medication abortion; 52.1% were aged 20 to 29 years (mean [SD] age, 25.9 [6.7] years), 50.0% had children, and 99.9% were 10 weeks' pregnant or less. The most common reasons cited by individuals making requests were the inability to afford in-clinic care (73.5%), privacy (49.3%), and clinic distance (40.4%). States with the highest rate of requests were Louisiana (202.7 per 100a?000 women) and Mississippi (199.9 per 100a?000 women). At the county level, an increase of 1 SD (47 miles) in distance to the nearest clinic was significantly associated with a 41% increase in requests (incidence rate ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.31-1.51; P < .001), and a 10% increase in the population living below the federal poverty level was significantly associated with a 20% increase in requests (incidence rate ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.13-1.28; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, clinic access barriers were the most commonly cited reason for requesting self-managed medication abortion using an online telemedicine service. At the county level, distance to an abortion clinic and living below the federal poverty level were associated with a higher rate of requests. State and federal legislation could address these access barriers.","output":"Factors Associated With Use of an Online Telemedicine Service to Access Self-managed Medical Abortion in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the association between diet quality and cost for foods purchased for consumption at home and away from home. DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis. Multivariable linear regression models evaluated the association between diet quality and cost for all food, food at home, and food away from home. SETTING Daily food intake data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2005-2016). Food prices were derived using data from multiple, publicly available databases. Diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index-2015 and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010. PARTICIPANTS 30,564 individuals 20 y with complete and reliable dietary data. RESULTS Mean per capita daily diet cost was $14.19 (95% CI: $13.91-14.48), including $6.92 ($6.73-7.10) for food consumed at home and $7.28 ($7.05-7.50) for food consumed away from home. Diet quality was higher for food at home compared to food away from home (P<0.001). Higher diet quality was associated with higher food costs overall, at home, and away from home (P<0.001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate that higher diet quality is associated with higher costs for all food, food consumed at home, and food consumed away from home.

We conducted a nationally representative online survey of 5500 American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Black/African American, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Latino (English and Spanish speaking), White, and multiracial adults from December 2020 to February 2021. Associations between sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19-related discrimination were estimated via multinomial logistic regression. Results. A total of 22.1% of the participants reported experiencing discriminatory behaviors, and 42.7% reported that people acted afraid of them. All racial/ethnic minorities were more likely than White adults to experience COVID-19-related discrimination, with Asian and American Indian/Alaska Native adults being most likely to experience such discrimination (discriminatory behaviors: adjusted odd ratio [AOR] = 2.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.73, 3.89; and AOR = 2.67; 95% CI = 1.76, 4.04; people acting afraid: AOR = 1.54; 95% CI = 1.15, 2.07; and AOR = 1.84; 95% CI = 1.34, 2.51).

Objective: To analyze how the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes input by medical students at the Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine into the Clinical Rotation Evaluation and Documentation Organizer (CREDO) patient encounter logging system could act as a new syndromic surveillance tool. Methods: A CREDO database query was conducted for ICD-10 codes entered between November 1, 2019 and March 13, 2020 using the World Health Organization's 2011 revised case definitions for Influenza Like Illness (ILI). During that period, medical students had an approximated mean of 3,000 patient encounters per day from over 1,500 clinical sites. A cumulative sum technique was applied to the data to generate alert thresholds. Breast cancer, a disease with a stable incidence during the specified timeframe, was used as a control. Results: Total ILI daily ICD-10 counts that exceeded alert thresholds represented unusual levels of disease occurred 11 times from November 20, 2020 through February 28, 2020. This analysis is consistent with the COVID-19 pandemic timeline. The first statistically significant ILI increase occurred nine days prior to the first laboratory confirmed case in the country. Conclusion: Syndromic surveillance can be timelier than traditional surveillance methods, which require laboratory testing to confirm disease.

Until now, the intermediate host and mechanisms of interspecies jump of this virus are unknown. METHODS: Phylogenetic analysis of all available bat coronavirus (CoV) complete genomes was performed in order to analyze the relationships between bat CoV and SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. In order to suggest a possible intermediate host, another phylogenetic reconstruction of CoV genomes obtained from animals which were hypothetically commercialized in the Chinese markets was also carried out. Moreover, mutation analysis was executed to suggest genomic regions which may have permitted the adaptation of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 to the human host. RESULTS: The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 formed a cluster with the bat CoV isolate RaTG13. Possible CoV interspecies jumps among bat isolates were also observed. The phylogenetic tree reconstructed from CoV strains belonging to different animals demonstrated that SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, bat RaTG13 and pangolin CoV genomes formed a monophyletic cluster, demonstrating that pangolins may be suggested as SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 intermediate hosts. Three AA substitutions localized in the S1 portion of the S gene were observed, some of which have been correlated to structural modifications of the S protein which may facilitate SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 tropism to human cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows the tight relationship between SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and bat SARS\\\\like strains. It also hypothesizes that pangolins might have been possible intermediate hosts of the infection. Some of the observed AA substitutions in the S binding protein may serve as possible adaptation mutations in humans but more studies are needed to elucidate their function.

Herein, we present a de novo method to evaluate inter-amino acid interactions based on the concept of accurately evaluating the amino acid bond pairs (AABP). The results obtained enabled the identification of complex 3d long-range interconnected AA interacting network in proteins. The method is applied to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We show that although nearest-neighbor AAs in the primary sequence have large AABP, other nonlocal AAs make substantial contribution to AABP with significant participation of both covalent and hydrogen bonding. Detailed analysis of AABP in RBD reveals the pivotal role they play in sequence conservation with profound implications on residue mutations and for therapeutic drug design. This approach could be easily applied to many other proteins of biomedical interest in life sciences.","output":"Amino acid interacting network in the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 infection can cause a severe pneumonia which, in some cases, can lead to admission in intensive care unit for respiratory support.(1) In severe cases, systemic thrombotic complication has been described, including cerebrovascular disease (5.7\\\\23% of cases).(2,3)","output":"Concomitant brain arterial and venous thrombosis in a COVID\\\\19 patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We postulate that similar to bacteria, adult stem cells may also exhibit an altruistic defense mechanism to protect their niche against external threat. Herein, we report mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based altruistic defense against a mouse model of coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus-1 (MHV-1) infection of lung. MHV-1 infection led to reprogramming of CD271+ MSCs in the lung to an enhanced stemness phenotype that exhibits altruistic behavior, as per previous work in human embryonic stem cells. The reprogrammed MSCs exhibited transient expansion for 2 weeks, followed by apoptosis and expression of stemness genes. The conditioned media of the reprogrammed MSCs exhibited direct antiviral activity in an in vitro model of MHV-1-induced toxicity to type II alveolar epithelial cells by increasing their survival/proliferation and decreasing viral load. Thus, the reprogrammed MSCs can be identified as altruistic stem cells (ASCs), which exert a unique altruistic defense against MHV-1. In a mouse model of MSC-mediated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) dormancy, MHV-1 infection in the lung exhibited 20-fold lower viral loads than the MTB-free control mice on the third week of viral infection, and exhibited six-fold increase of ASCs, thereby enhancing the altruistic defense. Notably, these ASCs exhibited intracellular replication of MTB, and their extracellular release. Animals showed tuberculosis reactivation, suggesting that dormant MTB may exploit ASCs for disease reactivation.","output":"Coronavirus Activates an Altruistic Stem Cell-Mediated Defense Mechanism that Reactivates Dormant Tuberculosis: Implications in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To describe the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on HIV testing in Brighton and Hove, United Kingdom. METHODS All HIV tests performed in Brighton and Hove from January 2016 to June 2021 were extracted, de-duplicated and anonymized. Analysis was performed to compare the monthly numbers of tests and diagnoses before and during the pandemic across different services. RESULTS The number of patients having tests for HIV in sexual health services (SHS) decreased by 64% in April 2020, followed by a recovery to baseline levels by the start of 2021. Similarly, the monthly number of diagnoses decreased drastically after April 2020, with almost half of diagnoses made by SHS in 2020 occurring in the three pre-pandemic months of the year. 'Self-sampling', used more by women and younger patients, has contributed significantly to the recovery. The number of patients tested in secondary care was seemingly unaffected by the pandemic. However, testing numbers were reduced in specialist services, whereas in the emergency department (ED) testing increased four-fold (most notably in the elderly) without finding any cases. General practice saw decreases in both the number of HIV tests performed and the number of new diagnoses made, which had not returned to baseline by June 2021. DISCUSSION The COVID-19 pandemic has had a large impact on the number of HIV tests performed in Brighton and Hove with sizeable decreases in the number of patients tested likely leading to 'missed' diagnoses.

Viral infection initiates when the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) binds to the ACE2 receptor, and thus, inhibiting RBD is a promising therapeutic for blocking viral entry. In this study, the structure of lead antiviral candidate binder (LCB1), which has three alpha-helices (H1, H2, and H3), is used as a template to design and simulate several miniprotein RBD inhibitors. LCB1 undergoes two modifications: structural modification by truncation of the H3 to reduce its size, followed by single and double amino acid substitutions to enhance its binding with RBD. We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations supported by ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Complete binding profiles of all miniproteins with RBD have been determined. The MD investigations reveal that the H3 truncation results in a small inhibitor with a ?1.5 kcal/mol tighter binding to RBD than original LCB1, while the best miniprotein with higher binding affinity involves D17R or E11V + D17R mutation.

It was hypothesized that total volume of online media content, measured in posts and mentions, varied measurably over the phases of the disasters. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that the anatomy of the disaster, specifically the number and timing/dates, of posts and mentions varied inside versus outside impacted zones/geographies. Social media content, in sheer volume, related to hurricanes was larger than that devoted to fires. A mismatch between the time periods that people post about natural disasters on social media and the times when aid is needed to rebuild was found. Mentions fell rapidly after landfall for hurricanes, and long before fires were officially contained or extinguished. This rapid fall in media attention may leave directly impacted populations without help and support during the rebuilding process.

The utility of rapid antigen-based methods for detection of common respiratory viruses and to confirm the cause of outbreaks is well established. However, nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) offer some benefits above antigen or culture-based procedures, with the main advantages being sensitivity and range of pathogens detectable. It is important to understand how changes in our testing methodology alter respiratory virus detection and information for epidemiological studies. For viruses such as influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus, NATs offer enhanced sensitivity above antigen assays but still identify the seasonal peaks important for predicting disease and managing time-sensitive prophylaxis. For other viruses, such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, human bocavirus and parainfluenza virus type 4, culture and antigen-based procedures are not available and/or lack sensitivity. Thus such targets would be missed if NATs were not included in testing for surveillance and outbreak investigation. As more respiratory viruses are identified there is a need to expand surveillance and further evaluate new technologies and automation beyond currently-available diagnostics to address detection of a broad range of potential pathogens.","output":"Respiratory virus surveillance and outbreak investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics along with outcomes of hospitalized Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with and without diabetes.

Demographic data, clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings were collected and compared between patients based on diabetes status. Complications and clinical outcomes were followed up until April 4, 2020. Results From among the 595 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55 years and 401 (67.4%) were male. The most common symptoms included fever (419 [70.4%]), dry cough (368 [61.8%]) and dyspnea (363 [61%]). A total of 148 patients (24.9%) had diabetes, and compared with patients without diabetes, these patients had more comorbidities (eg, hypertension [48.6% vs. 22.3%; P <.001]); had higher levels of white blood cell count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood urea nitrogen, and had a higher proportion of patchy ground-glass opacity in chest computed tomography findings (52.7% vs. 25.7%; P <.001). Significantly, patients with diabetes had more complications and needed more respiratory support than those without diabetes (P <.001). At the end of the follow-up, treatment failure and death was significantly higher in patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (17.8% vs. 8.7%; P = 0.003).

This study estimated, from the payer's perspective, the lifetime costs among patients diagnosed with UC according to stage at diagnosis. Methods: This retrospective analysis of the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database identified patients &#8805;66 years with newly diagnosed UC from 2004-2013. Patients were followed from UC diagnosis to death or last follow-up to estimate lifetime costs. Costs were allocated to 3 phases: diagnosis (&#8804;3 months after diagnosis), terminal (&#8804;3 months before death), and continuation (months between diagnosis and terminal phases). Survival-adjusted lifetime costs (total and major UC-related) were estimated for patients with UC based on stage at diagnosis (stages 0 through IV) and in a subgroup of patients receiving &#8805;1 systemic line of chemotherapy (LOC). Results: The sample included 15,588 patients: 3,446 stage 0 (8% &#8805;1 LOC; median [IQR] follow-up in months: 44 [23-71]); 3,902 stage I (12% &#8805;1 LOC; 33 [15-62]); 4,301 stage II (26% &#8805;1 LOC; 17 [7-39]); 1,612 stage III (25% &#8805;1 LOC; 17 [7-42]); and 2,327 stage IV (33% &#8805;1 LOC; 8 [3-18]). Median age was 78 years and 72% were male. Mean lifetime costs were lowest for stage IV patients (stage 0, $151,626; stage 1, $150,123; stage II, $149,728; stage III, $190,996; stage IV, $117,503). Hospitalizations not involving a cystectomy contributed about half of lifetime costs across all stages. Cystectomy contributed 2-13% of the total lifetime UC costs ($3,356 stage 0; $7,011 stage I; $11,855 stage II; $25,509 stage III; $11,693 stage IV). UC-related office visits contributed 8-15% of lifetime costs ($11,717 stage 0; $14,611 stage I; $19,882 stage II; $21,480 stage III; $17,820 stage IV). Conclusion: UC continues to be a costly cancer with stage III patients having highest lifetime costs. Hospitalizations drive most of the lifetime costs across all stages; most of these hospitalizations did not involve costs related to cystectomy.

In Japan, cancer screenings were halted and the numbers of endoscopies and surgeries were restricted in some hospitals based on the state of emergency declared. Herein, we investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the characteristics of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in facilities that are on the frontline of both COVID-19 and cancer treatments. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the cases of all of the CRC patients (n = 123) who underwent surgery at our regional cancer treatment center and tertiary emergency hospital in Japan during a 120-day period ranging from before to after the state of emergency declaration. CRC patients during the corresponding period in the previous year were also examined. RESULTS: Although the number of CRC patients did not show a significant change related to the pandemic, the incidence of obstructive CRCs significantly increased after the pandemic's start. The numbers of outpatients and colonoscopies both decreased, which could have resulted in the decrease of CRC patients detected by cancer screening during the pandemic. The numbers of symptomatic CRC patients and emergency admissions both increased significantly during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate the possibility that the discovery of CRCs in patients could be delayed due to the halt in screenings caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the increase of obstructive CRCs. These results highlight the importance of cancer screening and suggest that the screening system for cancers should be reorganized before future pandemics.","output":"The number of obstructive colorectal cancers in Japan has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective single-center cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An RT-PCR-hybridization was developed that amplified genetic material from the M protein gene of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43.

The overall objective of this study was to determine whether sleep-disordered breathing and its sequelae of intermittent hypoxemia and recurrent arousals are associated with mortality in a community sample of adults aged 40 years or older. METHODS AND FINDINGS We prospectively examined whether sleep-disordered breathing was associated with an increased risk of death from any cause in 6,441 men and women participating in the Sleep Heart Health Study. Sleep-disordered breathing was assessed with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) based on an in-home polysomnogram. Survival analysis and proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios for mortality after adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking status, body mass index, and prevalent medical conditions. The average follow-up period for the cohort was 8.2 y during which 1,047 participants (587 men and 460 women) died. Compared to those without sleep-disordered breathing (AHI: <5 events/h), the fully adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in those with mild (AHI: 5.0-14.9 events/h), moderate (AHI: 15.0-29.9 events/h), and severe (AHI: >or=30.0 events/h) sleep-disordered breathing were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.80-1.08), 1.17 (95% CI: 0.97-1.42), and 1.46 (95% CI: 1.14-1.86), respectively. Stratified analyses by sex and age showed that the increased risk of death associated with severe sleep-disordered breathing was statistically significant in men aged 40-70 y (hazard ratio: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.31-3.33). Measures of sleep-related intermittent hypoxemia, but not sleep fragmentation, were independently associated with all-cause mortality. Coronary artery disease-related mortality associated with sleep-disordered breathing showed a pattern of association similar to all-cause mortality.

Practices that promote mindfulness, reflection and gratitude have been shown to reduce burnout. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Framework for Improving Joy In Work provides an approach to restore joy and engagement by first identifying elements that \\"matter most to healthcare workers. The objective of this study was to identify common themes and associations that contribute to EM provider and staff (1) joy in work, (2) gratitude, and (3) personal wellness. Methods: This descriptive study used an electronic survey tool with open-ended questions adapted from the IHI framework to assess what matters most. Q1: What brings you joy in your work? Q2: Thinking back to what matters most, what are you grateful for? Q3: What do you do to maintain your personal wellness? In Nov. 2020, email listservs were used to recruit a voluntary sample of emergency physicians, advanced practice providers (APPs), residents, fellows, nurses and staff from 10 academic and community hospitals. Data were managed in Qualtrics and Excel. Qualitative analysis used inductive thematic coding by two authors independently, with verification by a third. Information redundancy signaled saturation for common themes. Pivot tables examined themes across demographics, and associations were analyzed with 2x2 contingency tables using chi-square, Fishers exact tests, and odds ratios (95% CI). Results: Of 254 respondents, 63% were female and 89% identified as White. Roles were 32% physicians, 8% APPs, 16% residents/fellows, and 44% nurses/staff. Response rates were 39-54% for providers. Common themes for joy in work were patient care (47%) and teamwork/camaraderie (43%), followed by feeling valued/appreciated (13%), making a difference (13%), and teaching/mentoring (9%). EM providers at academic sites were more likely to find joy in teaching/mentoring than those in the community (p=0.01;OR 10.5, 95% CI 1.3-82.6). For gratitude, themes were teamwork/ camaraderie (13%), family (12%), health (7%), and supportive work environment (7%). Themes for maintaining personal wellness were physical exercise (46%), time with family and friends (32%), hobbies (15%), and self-care (13%). Conclusions: Results of this study reveal common themes for EM providers and staff surrounding joy, gratitude, and wellness.

A healthy pregnancy can have significant impacts on the life chances of children. The objective of this review was to understand the association between individual-level and household-level measures of socioeconomic status and adverse pregnancy outcomes. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Nine databases were searched (Medline, Embase, Scopus, ASSIA, CINAHL, PsycINFO, BNI, MIDRIS and Google Scholar) for articles published between 1999 and August 2019. Grey literature searches were also assessed. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies reporting associations between individual-level or household socioeconomic factors on pregnancy outcomes in the UK or Ireland. RESULTS: Among the 82 353 search results, 53 821 titles were identified and 35 unique studies met the eligibility criteria. Outcomes reported were neonatal, perinatal and maternal mortality, preterm birth, birth weight and mode of delivery. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. There were significantly increased odds of women from lower levels of occupation/social classes compared with the highest level having stillbirth (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.59, I2 98.62%), neonatal mortality (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.57, I2 97.09%), perinatal mortality (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.57, I2 98.69%), preterm birth (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.50, I2 70.97%) and low birth weight (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.61, I2 99.85%). Limitations relate to available data, unmeasured confounders and the small number of studies for some outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified consistent evidence that lower occupational status, especially manual occupations and unemployment, were significantly associated with increased risk of multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes. Strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes should incorporate approaches that address wider determinants of health to provide women and families with the best chances of having a healthy pregnancy and baby and to decrease pregnancy-related health inequalities in the general population.

This commentary examines how Special Operations Forces operating within four different regions worldwide leveraged the challenges presented by the onset of this pandemic in maintaining stability, sustaining a ready force, and operating forward deployed. Deployed forces face constant difficulties with logistical support, varied medical resources access and a medical system predominantly focused on trauma care. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic there was little guidance specific to these circumstances which required an improvised adaptation of the recommendations set by national and Department of Defense medical authorities. Plans were constantly revised to match the ever changing medical and operational environment. Strategies such as the \\"Bubble Philosophy\\" and tiered force protection measures helped our units to maintain a rigorous training cycle. New methods of communication and training with our host nation partners such as the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) platforms to survey host nation training became standard.

AIMS: To assess the presence of emotional disorders in Spain and the association to sociodemographic characteristics and CERS during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: Cross-sectional survey administered through an online platform. Sociodemographic variables and CERS (CERQ-Short) were collected and possible diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD, GAD-7), major depression disorder (MDD; Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), panic attacks (PA; PHQ-PD), and panic disorders (PD; PHQ-PD) were assessed. Sociodemographic risk factors and CERS association to the possible diagnosis of emotional disorders were reported with hierarchical multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 1,753 respondents completed the questionnaire in Spain. Of these, most (76.8%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 40.4 years (12.9). A high proportion of participants met diagnostic criteria for emotional disorders: 15.3% for GAD, 12.2% for MDD, 17.2% for PD, and 25.7% had experienced a PA. The contribution of sociodemographic variables to diagnoses of emotional disorders was modest, explaining from 3.1% to 5.7% of the variance; however, when CERS were added, the combination of sociodemographic and CERS explained from 15% to 29% of the variance. Rumination and catastrophizing were the most transdiagnostic maladaptive strategies and positive refocusing was another adaptive strategy. DISCUSSION: Although results from convenience samples should be handled with caution, the high prevalence of emotional disorders in this study suggests that the demand of mental health interventions will probably increase in Spain. Also, CERS play a clear role in the presence of these disorders. CONCLUSION: Intervention programs should focus on training CERS in populations at high risk, focusing on the reduction of maladaptive CERS and the reinforce of other more adaptive CERS.","output":"Emotional Disorders During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Spain: The Role of Sociodemographic Risk Factors and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to estimate the prevalence of loneliness and identify the key sociodemographic, employment, living, and health-related risk factors for loneliness among middle-aged and older adults during the early COVID-19 pandemic in the US, when shelter-in-place and social distancing restrictions were in place for much of the country. Data were collected from online questionnaires in the COVID-19 Coping Study, a national study of 6,938 US adults aged 55-110 years, from April 2nd through May 31st, 2020. We estimated the population-weighted prevalence of loneliness (scores of 6/9 on the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale), overall and according to sociodemographic, employment, living, and health-related factors. We used population-weighted modified Poisson regression models to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between these factors and loneliness, adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and education. Overall, 29.5% (95% CI: 27.9%, 31.3%) of US adults aged 55-110 were considered high in loneliness in April and May, 2020. In population-weighted, adjusted models, loneliness was most frequent among those with depression, those who were divorced or separated, those who lived alone, those diagnosed with multiple comorbid conditions, and individuals who were unemployed prior to the pandemic. In conclusion, we identified subpopulations of middle-aged and older US adults that were highly affected by loneliness during a period when COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders were in place across most of the country.

The number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise which is a global burden on the health care system worldwide. Efforts are continuing to come up with a solution either to develop a small molecular inhibitor or vaccine, but still no success. In the fight against SARS-CoV-2, targeting a different protein of the SARS-CoV-2 is the need of the hour to impede and relinquish the current pandemic. Therefore, in this study, computational modelling and simulation approaches are used to target the N-terminal domain of the phosphor-nucleoprotein (RNA binding protein), which is primarily responsible for binding and packing the viral genome to get ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP). Our multi-step drug screening approach shortlisted potential drugs. These top hits were confirmed by re-docking which revealed that the interacting molecules block the key residues i.e. Thr57, His59, Ser105, Arg107, and Arg177 and thus ultimately block the NTD from RNA recognition. Furthermore, the activity of the top four hits was also confirmed by using molecular dynamics simulation and free energy calculation. Our analysis suggests that these top hits possess strong inhibitory properties and should be tested experimentally. In conclusion, we hope these top hits would abrogate the binding of RNA and the NTD of the SARS-CoV-2, which might be helpful to combat COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

We aimed to assess the immune persistence of a two-dose schedule of CoronaVac, and the immunogenicity and safety of a third dose of CoronaVac, in healthy adults aged 18 years and older. METHODS: In the first of two single-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trials, adults aged 18C59 years in Jiangsu, China, were initially allocated (1:1) into two vaccination schedule cohorts: a day 0 and day 14 vaccination cohort (cohort 1) and a day 0 and day 28 vaccination cohort (cohort 2); each cohort was randomly assigned (2:2:1) to either a 3 g dose or 6 g dose of CoronaVac or a placebo group. Following a protocol amendment on Dec 25, 2020, half of the participants in each cohort were allocated to receive an additional dose 28 days (window period 30 days) after the second dose, and the other half were allocated to receive a third dose 6 months (window period 60 days) after the second dose. In the other phase 2 trial, in Hebei, China, participants aged 60 years and older were assigned sequentially to receive three injections of either 15 g, 3 g, or 6 g of vaccine or placebo, administered 28 days apart for the first two doses and 6 months (window period 90 days) apart for doses two and three. The main outcomes of the study were geometric mean titres (GMTs), geometric mean increases (GMIs), and seropositivity of neutralising antibody to SARS-CoV-2 (virus strain SARS-CoV-2/human/CHN/CN1/2020, GenBank accession number MT407649.1), as analysed in the per-protocol population (all participants who completed their assigned third dose). Our reporting is focused on the 3 g groups, since 3 g is the licensed formulation. The trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04352608 and NCT04383574. FINDINGS: 540 (90%) of 600 participants aged 18C59 years were eligible to receive a third dose, of whom 269 (50%) received the primary third dose 2 months after the second dose (cohorts 1a-14d-2m and 2a-28d-2m) and 271 (50%) received a booster dose 8 months after the second dose (cohorts 1b-14d-8m and 2b-28d-8m). In the 3 g group, neutralising antibody titres induced by the first two doses declined after 6 months to near or below the seropositive cutoff (GMT of 8) for cohort 1b-14d-8m (n=53; GMT 39 [95% CI 31C50]) and for cohort 2b-28d-8m (n=49; 68 [52C88]). When a booster dose was given 8 months after a second dose, GMTs assessed 14 days later increased to 1379 (95% CI 999C1904) for cohort 1b-14d-8m and 1431 (1108C1847) 28 days later for cohort 2b-28d-8m. GMTs moderately increased following a primary third dose, from 218 (95% CI 173C276) on day 28 after the second dose to 458 (357C589) on day 28 after the third dose in cohort 1a-14d-2m (n=54), and from 381 (284C511) to 497 (399C619) in cohort 2a-28d-2m (n=53). GMTs had decayed to near the positive threshold by 6 months after the third dose: GMT 92 (95% CI 71C120) in cohort 1a-14d-2m and 100 (73C137) in cohort 2a-28d-2m. Similarly, in adults aged 60 years and older who received booster doses (303 [87%] of 350 participants were eligible to receive a third dose), neutralising antibody titres had declined to near or below the seropositive threshold by 6 months after the primary two-dose series. A third dose given 8 months after the second dose significantly increased neutralising antibody concentrations: GMTs increased from 429 (95% CI 310C594) on day 28 after the second dose to 1585 (966C2592) on day 28 following the third dose (n=29). All adverse reactions reported within 28 days after a third dose were of grade 1 or 2 severity in all vaccination cohorts. There were three serious adverse events (2%) reported by the 150 participants in cohort 1a-14d-2m, four (3%) by 150 participants from cohort 1b-14d-8m, one (1%) by 150 participants in each of cohorts 2a-28d-2m and 2b-28d-8m, and 24 (7%) by 349 participants from cohort 3-28d-8m. INTERPRETATION: A third dose of CoronaVac in adults administered 8 months after a second dose effectively recalled specific immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which had declined substantially 6 months after two doses of CoronaVac, resulting in a remarkable increase in the concentration of antibodies and indicating that a two-dose schedule generates good immune memory, and a primary third dose given 2 months after the second dose induced slightly higher antibody titres than the primary two doses.

However, these optimizations tend to ignore the impact of thermal history that depends on the specimen size and print path selection. Here, we investigate the effect of size print path (raster angle and build orientation) and print sequence on the mechanical properties of polycarbonate (PC) and polypropylene (PP). Examination of parallel and series printing of flat (XY) and stand-on (YZ) orientation of Type V specimens demonstrated that to observe statistical differences in the mechanical response that the interlayer time between printed roads should be approximately 5 s or less. The print time for a single layer in XY orientation is much longer than that for a single layer in YZ orientation, so print sequence only impacts the mechanical response in the YZ orientation. However, the specimen size and raster angle did influence the mechanical properties in XY orientation due to the differences in thermal history associated with intralayer time between adjacent roads. Moreover, all of these effects are significantly larger when printing PC than PP. These differences between PP and PC are mostly attributed to the mechanism of interface consolidation (crystallization vs. glass formation), which changes the requirements for a strong interface between roads (crystals vs. entanglements). These results illustrate how the print times dictated by the print path layout impact observed mechanical properties. This work also demonstrated that the options available in some standards developed for traditional manufacturing will change the quantitative results when applied to 3D printed parts.

Thirty-nine (95%) of subjects successfully participated in coaching sessions; on average, 11 (91.9%) sessions per subject were completed. Participants provided positive anecdotal feedback and stated the need for continued health coaching. Consequently, n=30 (75%) of the original sample consented to continued health coaching during the 2020C2021 COVID-19 pandemic (Phase 2). All study subjects were examined at baseline (Time 1), 3-month (Time 2), covid-baseline (Time 3), and 3-months postcovid-baseline (Time 4). Repeated Measures ANOVAs were done to examine Time and Time*Memory Status effects. RESULTS: There was a total risk reduction at Phase 1 (F=9.26; p=.004; effect size=.19). At Phase 2, alcohol use decreased (p=.05), quadratic time effects were observed in physical activity (p=.01C.02), and cubic time effects were observed in depression (p=.02). Overall, total risk reduction in Phase 2 was observed at F=5.05; p=.03 effect size=.16. Pre/post-test analyses indicated improvement in Memory Problem Time Interaction (p=.007), AD knowledge (p=.01C.03), and Tired Days (p=.04) across Phase 1. There was also improvement in Social Isolation Time Interaction (p=.03); Tobacco Addiction (p=.001); Poor Mental Health Days (p=.05), and Worried Days Time Interaction (p=.02?.01) across Phase 2. Between subject Memory Status effects, indicating poorer baseline levels for individuals reporting memory problems had greater improvement seen in memory complaints (p=.001), poor mental health days (.02), and tired days (.003?.01). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary work creates the impetus for future large-scale lifestyle AD risk reduction investigations to mitigate and improve modifiable AD risk among low-income, diverse older adults, including individuals reporting memory problems. Our findings surrounding participant engagement and positive trends in AD risk reduction support the hypothesis that telephone-based health coaching is a practical and feasible AD risk reduction intervention.","output":"Alzheimers Disease Prevention Health Coaching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Clustering DNA sequences into functional groups is an important problem in bioinformatics. We propose a new alignment-free algorithm, mBKM, based on a new distance measure, DMk, for clustering gene sequences. This method transforms DNA sequences into the feature vectors which contain the occurrence, location and order relation of k-tuples in DNA sequence. Afterwards, a hierarchical procedure is applied to clustering DNA sequences based on the feature vectors. RESULTS: The proposed distance measure and clustering method are evaluated by clustering functionally related genes and by phylogenetic analysis. This method is also compared with BlastClust, CD-HIT-EST and some others. The experimental results show our method is effective in classifying DNA sequences with similar biological characteristics and in discovering the underlying relationship among the sequences.

Methods: Forty male Wistar rats were randomized into control, low dose rohypnol-treated, high dose rohypnol-treated, low dose rohypnol-treated recovery and high dose rohypnol-treated recovery groups. Results: Rohypnol caused significant rise in gastric malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), nitric oxide (NO), tumour necrotic factor- (TNF-), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Also, rohypnol caused reductions in gastric reduced glutathione (GSH) (as well as GSH/GSSG), and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), cyclo-oxygenase (COX-2). Furthermore, rohypnol upregulated caspase 3 activity and induced gastric DNA damage, evident by a rise in 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and DNA fragmentation index (DFI) in gastric tissue. These alterations were coupled with reduced gastric weight and distorted gastric cytoarchitecture. Cessation of rohypnol caused a significant but not complete reversal of rohypnol-induced gastric damage. Conclusion: This study revealed that rohypnol induced gastric injury by suppressing glutathione content and COX-2 activity, and upregulating caspase 3-dependent apoptosis, which was partly reversed by rohypnol withdrawal.","output":"Suppression of glutathione system and upregulation of caspase 3-dependent apoptosis mediate rohypnol-induced gastric injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The following case report features a middle-aged female patient, previously diagnosed with Cowden syndrome, who presented to the hospital with symptoms of headaches and changes in vision that began with no apparent cause and persisted for almost a month.

Almost all dental procedures carry a high infection risk for providers and patients due to the spread of aerosols. As a consequence, public health agencies and professional associations have issued guidelines for enhanced infection control and personal protection equipment and have also limited care to urgent or emergency services. However, there is no dental service concept for pandemic disaster preparedness or response that might be applied. Moreover, pathways to dental care provision in a post-pandemic future with persisting risks are needed. We propose Safer Aerosol-Free Emergent Dentistry (SAFER Dentistry) as one approach to dental services during and emerging from the pandemic. The concept's starting point is the identification of the most common patient needs. The next step is to replace common treatments addressing the most frequent needs with alternative interventions involving a lower infection risk because they do not generate aerosols. SAFER Dentistry is innovative, avoids risk, and responds to the requirements of a pandemic and post-pandemic emergency where the risk of airborne disease transmission remains high. SAFER Dentistry thereby ensures continuity of dental services while protecting providers and patients from infectious pathogens. Moreover, SAFER Dentistry allows dental service providers to remain operational and generate income even under pandemic conditions. Potential implementation and policy options for SAFER Dentistry include universal availability without co-payments by patients and a uniform bundled payment scheme for providers to simplify budgeting, reimbursement, and administration during a pandemic. Adaptations and adjustments of the concept are possible and encouraged as long as the principle of avoiding aerosol-generating procedures is maintained.","output":"A Dental Response to the COVID-19 PandemicSafer Aerosol-Free Emergent (SAFER) Dentistry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This paper is prepared to reveal about an urgent industrial scheme for a fast and facile total synthesis of umifenovir (arbidol) (by one-pot stages) as an antiviral agent for treating 2019-nCoV virus via inhibiting its viral replication in the human cells. As COVID-19, takes thousands of lives all around the world, it seems that the medicinal resources would not be enough to supply billions of peoples, currently living on the planet earth. Thus, this pandemic and its subsequent impacts on the natural order of our life, would be one of the most important threats against the entire human race. Aims & Objective: Due to this, in this project, we have made attempts to find an operative approach for synthesizing this compound as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), which showed it could be effective in inhibiting the newly emerged coronavirus. RESULTS: The designed scheme uses relatively cheap precursors, and contains one pot stages, instead of seven time consuming, and more costly, linear steps. Also, it is tried to use safe and cheap solvents like water, and ethanol, instead of toxic ones like methanol, and pyridine which could cause rejection of the API in the organic volatile impurities (OVI) test of pharmacopeia analysis, as well as increasing the concern of inflammability, explosive, and carcinogenic properties of those common solvents. CONCLUSION: The most important pharmaceutical analytical methods containing OVI test (mainly ethanol (about 171 ppm) much lower than the limits, by gas chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) instrument), Assay content (about 99.6% by potentiometric titration), and related purity analysis (by High performance liquid chromatography-Ultraviolet Detector (HPLC-UV)) (about 99.8%) were performed and described to give a more clear industrial scheme.","output":"An Urgent Industrial Scheme both for Total Synthesis, and for Pharmaceutical Analytical Analysis of Umifenovir as an Anti-Viral API for Treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND To date, COVID-19 has been mainly investigated concerning the acute and subacute phase implications and management. Meanwhile, few studies focused on the mid-term sequelae, which still remain largely unknown. AIM To assess the physical performance of COVID-19 survivors at 3 to 6 months from Hospital discharge. DESIGN A cross-sectional study focused on mid-term functional outcomes evaluation in COVID-19 survivors. SETTING Outpatients who had been previously hospitalized due to COVID-19 from March to May 2020 at the University Hospital of Novara (Italy). POPULATION We enrolled 204 patients, of which 60% were men, with the mean age of 57.9 years. METHODS Patients firstly underwent the Short Physical Performance Battery test (SPPB), which is composed of a series of physical tests assessing the lower limb function and the functional status of the subjects. Subsequently, based on SPPB results, patients' cardiorespiratory fitness performance was further investigated. Patients with normal SPPB score (SPPB > 10) underwent the 2-Minute Walking test (2MWT) whereas, in order to safely test the cardiorespiratory function, in patients with abnormal SPPB score (SPPB  10) the 1-Minute-Sit-to-Stand Test (1MSTST) was performed. It should be noted that the 1MSTST can be safely performed even by subjects with compromised walking ability. RESULTS Overall, 66 patients (32% of our sample) showed an impaired physical performance at 3 to 6 months after hospital discharge. In particular, 29 patients presented an SPPB score  10, and the 1MSTST confirmed this status in the whole group (100%) compared to the reference values for age and sex. Besides, among patients with a normal SPPB score, 37 showed a lower sex- and age-matched 2MWT score. Finally, a significant association between Intensive Care Unit hospitalization or mechanical ventilation and physical impairment was observed together with a significant association between the walking ability (measured with SPPB and 2MWT) and the number of comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS A residual physical and functional impairment was observed in COVID-19 survivors at mid-term evaluation after hospitalization. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT Considering the current COVID-19 epidemiology, we might expect a tremendous burden of disability in the next future.

In low- and middle- income countries, they may be particularly impacted by underfunded health systems, lack of personal protective equipment, challenging working conditions and barriers in accessing personal healthcare. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, occupational health screening was implemented at the largest public sector medical centre in Harare, Zimbabwe, during the first wave of the countrys COVID-19 epidemic. Clients were voluntarily screened for symptoms of COVID-19, and if present, offered a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection assay. In addition, measurement of height, weight, blood pressure and HbA1c, HIV and TB testing, and mental health screening using the Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ-14) were offered. An interviewer-administered questionnaire ascertained client knowledge and experiences related to COVID-19. RESULTS: Between 27(th) July and 30(th) October 2020, 951 healthcare workers accessed the service; 210 (22%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 12 (5.7%) tested positive. Clients reported high levels of concern about COVID-19 which declined with time, and faced barriers including lack of resources for infection prevention and control. There was a high prevalence of largely undiagnosed non-communicable disease: 61% were overweight or obese, 34% had a blood pressure of 140/90mmHg or above, 10% had an HbA1c diagnostic of diabetes, and 7% had an SSQ-14 score consistent with a common mental disorder. Overall 8% were HIV-positive, with 97% previously diagnosed and on treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers mirrored the national epidemic curve. Implementation of comprehensive occupational health services during a pandemic was feasible, and uptake was high. Other comorbidities were highly prevalent, which may be risk factors for severe COVID-19 but are also important independent causes of morbidity and mortality.

Averaged over all responses, the global stress level varied substantially between professions, ranging between 2.8 for administration and 6.8 for RTTs. The global stress level was highest for in-hospital work with patient contact with an average of 4.7, whereas stress was similar for in-hospital work without patient contact and home-office with 3.5 and 3.8, respectively. Concerns about health were highest about family & friends with 4.0 on average compared to concerns about the own health and of the patients with average values of 3.1 and 3.5, respectively. Changes of global stress level over the 47 weeks were strongly associated with development of the pandemic (figure). Averaged over all employees, the global stress level stated with 4.8 on average in March 2020 and dropped continuously in the spring and summer months until the second COVID-19 wave started in September 2020 with two peaks in November and December with 5.5 and 5.7 on average, respectively. Interventions against high stress levels were performed for all professions and especially the RTT subgroup with highest stress levels (workshops;meditation room;detailed information about hospital-specific infection rates;information about hospital wide possibilities for coping mechanisms, effectiveness of PPE;team meetings).","output":"PO-1514 Prospective assessment of employees stress during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Substance abuse has been a public health concern, and even after detoxification treatment, the relapse rate is still high. Family function is closely related to substance dependence. However, studies on psychological mechanisms between them are rare. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to explore the mediating role of self-esteem and resilience in the pathway that family function impacts the relapse tendency among patients with substance use disorder (SUD). METHODS: A total of 282 SUD patients were recruited, and standard questionnaires were administered for each patient. The relapse tendency, family function, self-esteem and resilience were assessed by the family care index questionnaire, the Connor-Davidson resilience scale, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale and the relapse tendency questionnaire. Bootstrap method was conducted for mediation analysis to test the effects of how family function affects relapse tendency mediated through self-esteem and resilience. RESULTS: The average score of relapse tendency of the patients was 28.47 (SD = 11.89). Intermediary analysis found that self-esteem played an intermediary role in the relationship between family function and relapse tendency. Resilience plays an intermediary role in the relationship between family function and relapse tendency. Further, the path analysis showed that family function not only had a direct association with relapse tendency, but also indirectly related to relapse tendency through self-esteem and resilience. CONCLUSIONS: Self-esteem and resilience are the key factors in the relationship between family function and relapse tendency of SUD patients.","output":"Family Function Impacts Relapse Tendency in Substance Use Disorder: Mediated Through Self-Esteem and Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explores the return and volatility spillovers between S and P 500 and cryptocurrencies [Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)] during the pre-COVID-19 period and COVID-19 period using the VAR-BEKK-AGARCH model on hourly data Furthermore, this study also quantifies the optimal portfolio weights and hedge ratios during both sample periods The findings of study show that the return and volatility spillovers between the US stock and cryptocurrency markets are not significant during the pre-COVID-19 period However, the study finds unidirectional return transmission from S and P 500 to all the cryptocurrencies during the COVID-19 period During the COVID-19 period, the volatility spillover is unidirectional from S and P 500 to Litecoin, whereas the volatility transmissions are not significant for the pairs of S and P 500-Bitcoin and S and P 500-Ethereum Based on optimal weights, the portfolio managers are recommended to slightly decrease their investments in S and P 500 for the portfolios of S and P 500/BTC, S and P 500/ETH and S and P 500/LTC during the COVID-19 period Finally, during the COVID-19 period, all hedge ratios were found to be higher, implying higher hedging costs during the COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID-19 period Our research offers valuable insights to the fund managers, investors and policymakers regarding diversification opportunities, hedging, optimal asset allocation and risk management ? 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company","output":"Linkages between Stock and Cryptocurrency Markets during the Covid-19 Outbreak: An Intraday Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is one of the most common infectious diseases in infants and young children globally. This study aimed to determine the virus profile in children with ARI presenting with different severities. METHODS Clinical specimens collected from children with ARI in Beijing from September 2010 to March 2011 were investigated for 18 respiratory viruses using an xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel Fast (RVP Fast) assay. The Pearson chi-square analysis was used to identify statistical significance. RESULTS Of 270 cases from three groups of ARI patients, including Out-patients, In-patients and patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), viruses were detected in 176 (65.2%) specimens with the RVP Fast assay. The viral detection rate from the Out-patients group (50.0%) was significantly lower than that from the In-patients (71.1%) and ICU-patients (74.4%) groups. The virus distribution was different between the Out-patients group and the other hospitalized groups, while the virus detection rate and distribution characteristics were similar between the In-patients and ICU-patients groups. The co-infection rates of the Out-patients group, the In-patients group, and the ICU-patients group were 15.6%, 50.0% and 35.8%, respectively. In addition to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus (ADV), human rhinovirus (HRV) was frequently detected from children with serious illnesses, followed by human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV) and coronaviruses. Parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3) was detected in children with lower respiratory illness, but rarely from those with serious illnesses in the ICU-patient group. CONCLUSION In addition to so-called common respiratory viruses, virus detection in children with ARI should include those thought to be uncommon respiratory viruses, especially when there are severe ARI-related clinical illnesses.","output":"Virus profile in children with acute respiratory infections with various severities in Beijing, China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the years, various techniques have been utilized to study the function and phenotype of antigen-binding B cells in the primary repertoire following immunization, infection, and development of autoimmunity. Due to the low frequency of antigen-reactive B cells (<0.05% of lymphocytes) in the periphery, preliminary enrichment of cells is necessary to achieve sufficient numbers for statistically sound characterization, especially when downstream analytic platform use, e.g., CyTOF, is low throughput. We previously described a method to detect and enrich antigen-reactive B cells from peripheral blood and tissues using biotinylated antigens in conjunction with magnetic nanoparticles, preparative to a downstream analysis by ELISPOT and flow cytometry. While mass cytometry (CyTOF) enables high dimensional immunophenotyping of over 40 unique parameters on a single-cell level, its low throughput compared to flow cytometry and requirement for removal of metal contaminants, such as nanoparticles, made it particularly unsuitable for studies of rare cells in a mixed population. Here we describe a novel CyTOF-compatible approach for multiplexed enrichment of antigen-reactive B cells, e.g., insulin and tetanus toxoid, using cleavable magnetic nanoparticles. This method allows improved monitoring of the phenotype and function of antigen-reactive B cells during the development of disease or after immunization while minimizing the amount of sample and run times needed.","output":"Enrichment and Detection of Antigen-Binding B Cells for Mass Cytometry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Vaccination is a worldwide public health practice that requires high uptake levels in order to effectively reduce the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases.

Debate about EU policies always entails debate about the appropriate role and powers granted to the EU. Description From some angles, the EU looks more like a federation (ex EUA), deeply entrenched in its citizens' lives. It has a powerful shared culture among leaders and strong, entrepreneurial, and statelike political institutions. Its legal system is entwined with member state law to such an extent that member state courts have driven legal integration and change as much as EU institutions, both in general and in health. From another angle, it still looks like an international organization (ex WHO) or a regional trade block (ex Mercosur). We ask what policy a member state might make, but, in the case of the EU, many ask if the EU should have a policy at all. Should it respond, and, if so, how and to whose benefit? Results Like international organizations or confederations, though, the EU responds primarily to and is shaped by the demands of its member states. They have actively maintained this dichotomous structure so as to prevent transfer of power and loss of sovereignty. Member states ultimately determine the direction of the EU, and they have supported EU expansion only when they require a European rescue of the nation state. Lessons The EU's weak public health and social policy responses to the crisis reflect this effort on the part of member states to limit its role over the decades, whereas the major expansion in its role over the summer of 2020 reflects the perceived interests of member states, which now seek another European rescue of the nation state.

Since then, there have been 458 confirmed infection cases and 177 deaths. The virus contains several human-adapted markers, indicating that H7N9 has pandemic potential. The outbreak of this new influenza virus highlighted the need for the development of universal influenza vaccines. Previously, we demonstrated that a tetrameric peptide vaccine based on the matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) of the H5N1 virus (H5N1-M2e) could protect mice from lethal infection with different clades of H5N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses. In this study, we investigated the cross-protection of H5N1-M2e against lethal infection with the new H7N9 virus. Although five amino acid differences existed at positions 13, 14, 18, 20, and 21 between M2e of H5N1 and H7N9, H5N1-M2e vaccination with either Freund's adjuvant or the Sigma adjuvant system (SAS) induced a high level of anti-M2e antibody, which cross-reacted with H7N9-M2e peptide. A mouse-adapted H7N9 strain, A/Anhui/01/2013m, was used for lethal challenge in animal experiments. H5N1-M2e vaccination provided potent cross-protection against lethal challenge of the H7N9 virus. Reduced viral replication and histopathological damage of mouse lungs were also observed in the vaccinated mice. Our results suggest that the tetrameric H5N1-M2e peptide vaccine could protect against different subtypes of influenza virus infections. Therefore, this vaccine may be an ideal candidate for developing a universal vaccine to prevent the reemergence of avian influenza A H7N9 virus and the emergence of potential novel reassortants of influenza virus.","output":"An H5N1-based matrix protein 2 ectodomain tetrameric peptide vaccine provides cross-protection against lethal infection with H7N9 influenza virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) generated from human cardiac biopsies have been shown to have disease-modifying bioactivity in clinical trials. Paradoxically, CDCs cellular origin in the heart remains elusive. We studied the molecular identity of CDCs using single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNAseq) in comparison to cardiac non-myocyte and non-hematopoietic cells (cardiac fibroblasts/CFs, smooth muscle cells/SMCs and endothelial cells/ECs). We identified CDCs as a distinct and mitochondria-rich cell type that shared biological similarities with non-myocyte cells but not with cardiac progenitor cells derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. CXCL6 emerged as a new specific marker for CDCs. By analysis of sc-RNAseq data from human right atrial biopsies in comparison with CDCs we uncovered transcriptomic similarities between CDCs and CFs. By direct comparison of infant and adult CDC sc-RNAseq data, infant CDCs revealed GO-terms associated with cardiac development. To analyze the beneficial effects of CDCs (pro-angiogenic, anti-fibrotic, anti-apoptotic), we performed functional in vitro assays with CDC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). CDC EVs augmented in vitro angiogenesis and did not stimulate scarring. They also reduced the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax in NRCMs. In conclusion, CDCs were disclosed as mitochondria-rich cells with unique properties but also with similarities to right atrial CFs. CDCs displayed highly proliferative, secretory and immunomodulatory properties, characteristics that can also be found in activated or inflammatory cell types. By special culture conditions, CDCs earn some bioactivities, including angiogenic potential, which might modify disease in certain disorders.

GapmeR is a cell-permeating antisense single-stranded DNA molecule that can be designed to specifically target intracellular severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Once internalized into host cells, such as lung alveolar cells, GapmeR molecules can bind to the viral RNA. This RNA/DNA hybrid will then be degraded by the RNase H enzyme abundantly present in the host cells. GapmeRs can be delivered to COVID-19 patients through inhalation or via nebulization. SARS-CoV-2-targeted GapmeR can also be given to frontline healthcare workers as a prophylactic protection. The recombinant ACE2 protein, the efficacy of which is being evaluated in clinical trials, will bind to the spike (S) glycoprotein of extracellular SARS-CoV-2 and potentially block viral infectivity. We propose that combining inhalable SARS-CoV-2-targeted GapmeRs with recombinant ACE2 could provide a viable and rapidly implementable more effective therapeutic approach for eradicating SARS-CoV-2 and save millions of lives.","output":"Combination Therapy Using Inhalable GapmeR and Recombinant ACE2 for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND GPS alarms aim to support users in independent activities. Previous systematic reviews have reported a lack of clear evidence of the effectiveness of GPS alarms for the health and welfare of users and their families and for social care provision. As GPS devices are currently being implemented in social care, it is important to investigate whether the evidence of their clinical effectiveness remains insufficient. Standardized evidence frameworks have been developed to ensure that new technologies are clinically effective and offer economic value. The frameworks for analyzing existing evidence of the clinical effectiveness of GPS devices can be used to identify the risks associated with their implementation and demonstrate key aspects of successful piloting or implementation. OBJECTIVE The principal aim of this study is to provide an up-to-date systematic review of evidence based on existing studies of the effects of GPS alarms on health, welfare, and social provision in the care of older adults compared with non-GPS-based standard care. In addition, the study findings were assessed by using the evidence standards framework for digital health technologies (DHTs) established by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom. METHODS This review was conducted according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Primary studies published in peer-reviewed journals and gray literature from January 2005 to August 2020 were identified through searches in 13 databases and several sources of gray literature. Included studies had individuals (aged 50 years) who were receiving social care for older adults or for persons with dementia; used GPS devices as an intervention; were performed in Canada, the United States, European Union, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, South Korea, or Japan; and addressed quantitative outcomes related to health, welfare, and social care. The study findings were analyzed by using the NICE framework requirements for active monitoring DHTs. RESULTS Of the screened records, 1.6% (16/986) were included. Following the standards of the NICE framework, practice evidence was identified for the tier 1 categories Relevance to current pathways in health/social care system and Acceptability with users, and minimum evidence was identified for the tier 1 category Credibility with health, social care professionals. However, several evidence categories for tiers 1 and 2 could not be assessed, and no clear evidence demonstrating effectiveness could be identified. Thus, the evidence required for using DHTs to track patient location according to the NICE framework was insufficient. CONCLUSIONS Evidence of the beneficial effects of GPS alarms on the health and welfare of older adults and social care provision remains insufficient. This review illustrated the application of the NICE framework in analyses of evidence, demonstrated successful piloting and acceptability with users of GPS devices, and identified implications for future research.","output":"Mobile Safety Alarms Based on GPS Technology in the Care of Older Adults: Systematic Review of Evidence Based on a General Evidence Framework for Digital Health Technologies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Global gene expression analysis is beginning to move from the laboratories of basic investigators to large-scale clinical trials.

Accurate risk assessment is an integral component of this prioritization process. Adjuvant studies such as MINDACT showed that up to 46% of clinically high risk tumors were classified as genomic Low Risk with MammaPrint, and still have excellent outcomes at 8-yrs with endocrine therapy alone, highlighting the potential for overtreatment if using clinical-risk alone. Here, gene expression results with MammaPrint (MP) and BluePrint (BP) were compared between pre-operative core needle biopsy (CNB) and postoperative surgical resection (SR) specimens to evaluate test performance across specimen type. Methods: 10,574 routine diagnostic samples from outside the US submitted to Agendia between Jan 2017 and Oct 2020 were included in this study.MP and BP testingwere processed according to standard FFPE microarray procedures. MP was used to stratify samples into Ultra LowRisk (UL), LowRisk (LR), and High Risk (HR). BPwas used to classify samples into Basal, Luminal or HER2-type. MP Index (MPI) distribution on BP defined Luminal-type tumors were compared between CNB and SR samples. Comparative logistics metrics (avg. turnaround time [TAT] and success rate) were also assessed between these specimen types. Results: 10% of samples were CNB and 90% were SR (Table 1). BP Basal, Luminal and HER2-type distributions were 2%, 97%, and 1% respectively for CNB samples and 1%, 98.6%, and 0.4% respectively for SR samples. Within Luminal-type tumors (majority of the samples), the frequency of UL, LR, and HR results were 14%, 61%, and 39% for CNB, and 13%, 58%, and 42% for SR, respectively. Overall, MP Index distributions were similar between samples tested from CNB vs. SR. Average TAT and success rate % between CNB and SR were similar (Table 2).(Table Presented)Definitions: Turnaround Time (TAT) is calculated from the time a specimen is received at the laboratory to the time a result is available. Success % excludes test failures due to insufficient RNA yield % and sub-optimal RNA quality, and evaluates the total number of specimens that have met the pre-requisite 30% minimum invasive tumor requirement that have a valid result. Conclusion(s): The frequency of each MP risk group as well as the distribution pattern of MP Index were essentially identical between CNB and SR samples, indicating comparable performance regardless of specimen type.

Forty-one HCW recovering from mild or asymptomatic infection were evaluated on the day of first-dose vaccination (T1_inf) and 21 days later (T2_inf). Sixteen uninfected HCW were evaluated 20 days after the first dose (T2_uninf) and 20 days after the second dose of vaccine (T3_inf). RESULTS: At T2_inf, but not at T1_inf, there was a significant correlation between days from diagnosis (median [IQR] 313 [285-322]) and NtAb levels (p = 0.011).

The pathology of many neurological diseases remains an enigma, and the exact etiology and underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. Viral infections spread and develop much more quickly than does the corresponding research needed to prevent and combat these infections; the present and most relevant outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, which originated in Wuhan, China, illustrates the critical and immediate need to improve drug design and development techniques.

ACE2 exerts antihypertensive and cardioprotective effects and reduces lung inflammation. ACE2 is subjected to extensive transcriptional and post-transcriptional modulation by epigenetic mechanisms and microRNAs. Also, ACE2 expression is regulated post-translationally by glycosylation, phosphorylation, and shedding from the plasma membrane. ACE2 protein is ubiquitous across mammalian tissues, prominently in the cardiovascular system, kidney, and intestine. ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract is of particular interest, in light of the discovery that ACE2 serves as the initial cellular target of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronaviruses, including the recent SARS-CoV2, responsible of the COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an intense effort has been made to elucidate the biochemical determinants of SARS-CoV2-ACE2 interaction. It has been determined that SARS-CoV2 engages with ACE2 through its spike (S) protein, which consists of two subunits: S1, that mediates binding to the host receptor; S2, that induces fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane and delivery of the viral genome. Owing to the role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV2 pathogenicity, it has been speculated that medical conditions, i.e., hypertension, and/or drugs, i.e., ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, known to influence ACE2 density could alter the fate of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The debate is still open and will only be solved when results of properly designed experimental and clinical investigations will be made public. An interesting observation is, however that, upon infection, ACE2 activity is reduced either by downregulation or by shedding. These events might precipitate the so-called cytokine storm that characterizes the most severe COVID-19 forms. As evidence accumulates, ACE2 appears a druggable target in the attempt to limit virus entry and replication. Strategies aimed at blocking ACE2 with antibodies, small molecules or peptides, or at neutralizing the virus by competitive binding with exogenously administered ACE2, are currently under investigations. In this review, we will present an overview of the state-of-the-art knowledge on ACE2 biochemistry and pathophysiology, outlining open issues in the context of COVID-19 disease and potential experimental and clinical developments.","output":"ACE2 in the Era of SARS-CoV-2: Controversies and Novel Perspectives"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/31.md","filePath":"drive/31.md"}'),R={name:"drive/31.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[w(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
