Objectives included: 1) Evaluate maternal COVID-19 vaccine intent for child(ren) and associated predictors of stated intent; 2) Describe attitudes related to hypothetical vaccination policies; 3) Summarize themes associated with intention to vaccinate child(ren) for COVID-19. Methods Mothers enrolled in Heath eMoms, a longitudinal survey project, were recruited for this electronic COVID-19 survey. Chi-square analysis was used to compare proportions of respondent characteristics based on vaccination intent. Population survey logistic regression was used for multivariable modeling to assess the independent association between vaccine intent and demographics. Results The response rate was 65.3% (n= 1884); 44.2% would choose vaccination, 20.3% would not choose vaccination, and 35.5% are unsure whether to have their child(ren) vaccinated for COVID-19. Black mothers (AOR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13, 0.54), respondents with less than high school education (AOR 0.26, 95% 0.12, 0.56) and those in rural areas (AOR 0.28, 95% CI 0.16, 0.48) were less likely to choose vaccination. Commonly cited reasons for vaccine hesitancy include belief the vaccine will not have been tested enough, is not safe and worry regarding side effects. Conclusions Over 50% of respondents do not intend or are unsure about their intent to vaccinate their child(ren) for COVID-19 with variability noted by demographics.

However, data from latinamerican patients is still scarce. In order to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with rheumatic diseases in our country and contribute to the global knowledge about the effect of immunosuppressive therapies in this group, the Argentine Society of Rheumatology has developed the National Registry of Patients with Rheumatic Diseases and COVID-19 (SAR-COVID). Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical characteristics and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with rheumatic diseases, treated or not with immunomodulators and/or immunosuppressants. Methods: SAR-COVID is a national, multicenter, prospective and observational registry, in which patients, 18 years of age, with a diagnosis of a rheumatic disease who had SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR or positive serology) are consecutively included between August 13, 2020 and January 17, 2021. Sociodemographic data, comorbidities, underlying rheumatic disease and treatment, clinical characteristics, complications, laboratory and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 infection were recorded. Hospitalization, mechanical ventilation requirements and death were assessed to evaluate COVID-19 outcome. Statistical analysis: Descriptive analysis. Chi2 or Fischer test and T test or Mann-Whitney U test or ANOVA, as appropriate. Multiple logistic regression. Results: A total of 525 patients were included, 80.4% were female, with a median age of 52 years (IQR 40-62). Comorbidities were reported in half of them (53.3%). The most frequent rheumatological diseases were rheumatoid arthritis (40.4%) and systemic lupus erythematosus (14.9%). At the time of the infection, most of them were in remission or in minimal/low disease activity (68.2%) and 72.9% were receiving immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment. Symptoms were present in 96% of the patients, the most frequent being fever (56.2%), cough (46.7%) and headache (39.2%). During infection, 35.1% received some pharmacological treatment, dexamethasone (20%) the most frequently used. One third (35.1%) of the patients were hospitalized, 11.6% were admitted to the ICU, 10.1% needed mechanical ventilation and 6.9% died due to COVID-19. Complications were reported in 12.4%, being acute respiratory distress syndrome the most prevalent (8.8%). Patients over 65 years of age were more frequently hospitalized, admitted to the ICU, needed mechanical ventilation and died due to COVID-19 (50% vs 31.4%, 22% vs 9%, 16.3% vs 5.2%, 14% vs 5%, respectively;p<0.001 in all cases). Similar results were seen in patients with vasculitis (57.7% vs 33.9%, 46.2 vs 9.8%, 34.6% vs 6 %;30.8% vs 5.6%, respectively;p< 0.001 in all cases) and those with moderate/high disease activity (55.7% vs 26.5%, 21.3 vs 7.8%, 17.2% vs 4.2 %;17.2% vs 4.2 %, respectively;p< 0.001 in all cases). Patients with APS were more frequently admitted to the ICU (29.4% vs 11%, p= 0.037). The presence of comorbidities was associated with higher hospitalization (46% vs 22.6%, p<0.001), admission to the ICU (17.2% vs 5.9%, p<0.001) and mechanical ventilation (10.2% vs 4.6%, p= 0.028). Immunosuppressive treatment was not associated with worse outcomes. Conclusion: In this cohort of patients with a wide distribution of rheumatic diseases, we have found clinical characteristics similar to those reported by other international cohorts. Compared with national data, the mortality reported in these patients is higher. However, it should be noted that these are early data collected during isolation and that there may be an underreporting of asymptomatic patients or with mild symptoms who do not attend the rheumatologist. Older patients, those with comorbidities, with vasculitis and with higher disease activity showed poor COVID-19 outcomes.","output":"Epidemiology and outcomes of patients with rheumatic diseases and SARS-CoV-2 infection: Data from the argentinean SAR-COVID registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The move came after a U turn by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, which had initially deemed the Innova test not fit for use among asymptomatic people in the community but changed its guidance for this purpose on 23 December 1 Plans to test communities for the virus were detailed in the governments Moonshot documents, revealed by The BMJ in September 2 Iain Buchan, executive dean and chair in public health and clinical informatics at the University of Liverpool, who led the analysis of a pilot of community testing in the city,4 said that the Innova test had become a valuable tool within a wider public health intervention that was popular with the public [ ]Christina Pagel, professor of operational research at University College Member and a member of the Independent Scientific and Advisory Group of Experts, said that regular repeated testing reduced the chances of a false negative result and could play an important role in reducing transmission among people who cannot work at home In the Liverpool pilot, they said, the test missed infection in 60% of people, and most worryingly it missed 30% of those in people with very high viral loads, who are at the highest risk of spreading the virus to others 3 False reassurance Writing in BMJ Opinion, Jon Deeks, who leads the Cochrane Collaborations covid-19 test evaluation activities, Angela Raffle, a health screening expert from the University of Bristol, and Mike Gill, a former member of the UK National Screening Committee, said that the government was misleading the public about the performance of the Innova test 4 Results from government studies have been selectively reported and some have not been reported at all","output":"Covid-19: Controversial rapid test policy divides doctors and scientists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought catastrophic impact on the world since the beginning of December 2019.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created substantial stress for pregnant women. PURPOSE: To understand whether stress experienced by women pregnant at the beginning of the pandemic was associated with a greater prevalence of adverse perinatal outcomes. METHODS: Pregnant women across the USA aged &#8805;18 years old enrolled in a prospective cohort study during the pandemic onset (T1) in April-May 2020. This report focuses on the 1,367 participants who gave birth prior to July-August 2020 (T2). Hierarchical logistic regression models predicted preterm birth, small for gestational age infants, and unplanned operative delivery from T1 stress, sociodemographic, and medical factors. RESULTS: After controlling for sociodemographic and medical factors, preterm birth was predicted by high prenatal maternal stress, delivering an infant small for gestational age was predicted by interpersonal violence and by stress related to being unprepared for birth due to the pandemic, and unplanned cesarean or operative vaginal delivery was predicted by prenatal appointment alterations, experiencing a major stressful life event, and by stress related to being unprepared for birth due to the pandemic. Independent of these associations, African American women were more likely than other groups to deliver preterm. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women who are experiencing high stress during the COVID-19 pandemic are at risk of poorer perinatal outcomes. A longitudinal investigation is critical to determine whether prenatal maternal stress and resulting outcomes have longer-term consequences for the health and well-being of children born in the midst of the current pandemic.","output":"Adverse Perinatal Outcomes Predicted by Prenatal Maternal Stress Among U.S. Women at the COVID-19 Pandemic Onset"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While vaccines and antivirals are now being deployed for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we require additional antiviral therapeutics to not only effectively combat SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, but also future coronaviruses. All coronaviruses have relatively similar genomes that provide a potential exploitable opening to develop antiviral therapies that will be effective against all coronaviruses. Among the various genes and proteins encoded by all coronaviruses, one particularly druggable or relatively easy-to-drug target is the coronavirus Main Protease (3CLpro or Mpro), an enzyme that is involved in cleaving a long peptide translated by the viral genome into its individual protein components that are then assembled into the virus to enable viral replication in the cell. Inhibiting Mpro with a small-molecule antiviral would effectively stop the ability of the virus to replicate, providing therapeutic benefit. In this study, we have utilized activity-based protein profiling (ABPP)-based chemoproteomic approaches to discover and further optimize cysteine-reactive pyrazoline-based covalent inhibitors for the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Structure-guided medicinal chemistry and modular synthesis of di- and tri-substituted pyrazolines bearing either chloroacetamide or vinyl sulfonamide cysteine-reactive warheads enabled the expedient exploration of structure-activity relationships (SAR), yielding nanomolar potency inhibitors against Mpro from not only SARS-CoV-2, but across many other coronaviruses.

Disturbed amygdala-frontal network functions are central to the pathophysiology of SAD, marked by hypoactivity of the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hypersensitivity of the medial PFC and the amygdala. The objective of this study was to determine whether modulation of the dorsolateral and medial PFC activity with a novel intensified stimulation protocol reduces SAD core symptoms, improves treatment-related variables, and reduces attention bias to threatening stimuli. METHODS In this randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind trial, we assessed the efficacy of an intensified stimulation protocol (20 min, twice-daily sessions with 20 min intervals, 5 consecutive days) in two intensities (1 vs 2 mA) compared to sham stimulations. 45 patients with SAD were randomized in three tDCS arms (1-mA, 2-mA, sham). SAD symptoms, treatment-related variables (worries, depressive state, emotion regulation, quality of life), and attention bias to threatening stimuli (dot-probe paradigm) were assessed before and right after the intervention. SAD symptoms were also assessed at 2-month follow-up. RESULTS Both 1-mA and 2-mA protocols significantly reduced fear/avoidance symptoms, worries and improved, emotion regulation and quality of life after the intervention compared to the sham group. Improving effect of the 2-mA protocol on avoidance symptoms, worries and depressive state was significantly larger than the 1-mA group. Only the 2-mA protocol reduced attention bias to threat-related stimuli, the avoidance symptom at follow-up, and depressive states, as compared to the sham group. CONCLUSIONS Modulation of lateral-medial PFC activity with intensified stimulation can improve cognitive control, motivation and emotion networks in SAD and might thereby result in therapeutic effects. These effects can be larger with 2-mA vs 1-mA intensities, though a linear relationship between intensity and efficacy should not be concluded. Our results need replication in larger trials.","output":"Intensified electrical stimulation targeting lateral and medial prefrontal cortices for the treatment of social anxiety disorder: A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-comparison study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the evolution of US mortgage credit supply during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus 2) often requires intensive care follow-up. As well as respiratory failure, the SARS-CoV-2 may cause central nervous system (CNS) involvement. The pandemic has raised many challenges in managing critically ill older adults, a population preferentially killed by COVID-19. The mortality and morbidity rates are extremely high in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Recent studies have reported the potential development of a hypercoagulable state in COVID-19. Viral infections and hypoxia may cause these state. It is increasingly reported that thromboembolic events are associated with a poor prognosis. Due to these thromboembolic complications, COVID-19 patients often have neurological symptoms. These symptoms may not be observed in intensive care patients who are sedated. We report one case who was sedated COVID-19 pneumonia and who was later diagnosed with cerebral venous thrombosis with cranial imaging when he could not awaken even though sedation was discontinued. Since COVID-19 causes intense thrombotic susceptibility due to cytokine storm, cerebrovascular thromboembolic complications associated with COVID-19 infection should be considered first and foremost for unconsciousness ventilated patients.

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted on 63 infants with AHRF and PH after congenital heart surgery in our cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) from January 2020 to March 2021. A total of 24 infants in the A group were treated with HFOV combined with iNO, and 39 infants in the B group were treated with HFOV. Relevant clinical data were collected. RESULTS Comparing the two groups, the improvement of the oxygenation index, PaO2 and PaO2 /FiO2 was more obvious for patients in the A group than for those in the B group after intervention (p < .05). Reexamination on the third day after the initiation of HFOV treatment indicated that the systolic pulmonary artery pressure in the A group was significantly lower than that in the B group (p < .05). In addition, the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of CICU stay in the A group were shorter than those in the B group (p < .05). However, complications between the two groups were not statistically significant. No important adverse effects arose.

At the time of the analysis neither the pandemic nor its economic consequences had fully run their course. It is not, therefore, a definitive analysis but it is important to try to draw important lessons as soon as possible. The main focus of the study was the initial impact on labour markets. The analysis was based on World Bank enterprise surveys undertaken before the outbreak of Covid-19 and follow-up surveys on the effects of the pandemic, also undertaken by the World Bank. These were combined with data on government containment measures and on morbidity and mortality rates. The use of enterprise data to analyse labour market issues has some limitations but also many strengths. The data is useful for analysing the consequences for gender equality in employment. Since the demand for labour is a derived demand firm level data provides a clear link to labour market effects. The pandemic has caused a significant loss in sales for many firms, This creates a loss of liquidity which, in turn, has caused some firms to reduce employment, working hours and wages. Government containment measures necessary to save lives such as temporary workplace closures have added to the burden for both firms and employees. The study starts by using the surveys to identify the important stylised facts. Although some issues are already well documented anecdotally through media reports this provides a more evidence based approach. It also helps identify several issues, such as the impact on gender equality which have received less journalistic attention. The study is further supported by a regression analysis (OLS and SURE) of several key outcomes (changes in sales, employment, the share of females in employment and firm expectations of survival). A limitation of such analysis with any enterprise level is heterogeneity and, in consequence, a risk of sample selection bias. To provide robustness checks we use a matching approach. The results suggest that a significant proportion of surviving firms are vulnerable to permanent closure. The ability of firms to retain labour depends on sales which are affected by both the pandemic itself and the government containment measures. Only a small proportion of firms have received government support and there is evidence that it could help both firm survival and the retention of labour. There is some doubt whether the four countries have the institutional capacity to provide effective support. If such doubts prove well founded then support may need to be externally driven.","output":"The Effects of Covid-19 on Employment, Labour Markets and Gender Equality in Central America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Antimicrobial resistance is a leading global public health threat, with inappropriate use of antimicrobials in healthcare contributing to its development. Given this urgent need, we developed a complex ePrescribing-based Anti-Microbial Stewardship intervention (ePAMS+). Methods and analysis: ePAMS+ includes educational and organisational behavioural elements, plus guideline-based clinical decision support to aid optimal antimicrobial use in hospital inpatients. ePAMS+ particularly focuses on prompt initiation of antimicrobials, followed by early review once test results are available to facilitate informed decision-making on stopping or switching where appropriate. A mixed-methods feasibility trial of ePAMS+ will take place in two NHS acute hospital care organisations. Qualitative staff interviews and observation of practice will respectively gather staff views on the technical component of ePAMS+ and information on their use of ePAMS+ in routine work. Focus groups will elicit staff and patient views on ePAMS+; one-to-one interviews will discuss antimicrobial stewardship with staff and will record patient experiences of receiving antibiotics and their thoughts on inappropriate prescribing. Qualitative data will be analysed thematically. Fidelity Index development will enable enactment of ePAMS+ to be measure objectively in a subsequent trial assessing the effectiveness of ePAMS+. Quantitative data collection will determine the feasibility of extracting data and deriving key summaries of antimicrobial prescribing; we will quantify variability in the primary outcome, number of antibiotic defined daily doses (to inform the future larger-scale trial design.

Undergoing subsequent diagnostic MRI examinations poses a safety concern due to the possibility of radiofrequency heating of the metallic braid incorporated into the microcatheter. Heating of nitinol, tungsten, and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) braided microcatheters was assessed and compared using a phantom model. METHODS Microcatheters coupled with fluoroptic temperature probes were embedded in a polyacrylamide gel within a head and torso phantom. Experiments were performed at 1.5 T and 3 T, analyzing the effects of different catheter immersion lengths, specific absorption rate (SAR) levels, short clinical scans, long clinical scans, and microcatheter fragment lengths. RESULTS The maximal increase in temperature for the nitinol braided microcatheter during a 15 min scan was 3.06C using the T1 fast spin echo sequence at 1.5 T and 0.45C using the balanced steady state free precession sequence at 3 T. The same scans for fragment lengths of 9, 18, 36, and 72 cm produced maximal temperature rises of 0.68, 0.80, 1.70, and 1.07C at 1.5 T, respectively. The temperature changes at 3 T for these fragment lengths were 0.66, 0.83, 1.07, and 0.72C, respectively. The tungsten and PEEK braided microcatheters did not demonstrate heating. CONCLUSIONS Substantial heating of nitinol braided microcatheters occurred and was a function of SAR level and geometric considerations. SAR and time limitations on MR scanning are proposed for patients with this microcatheter entrapped in their vasculature. In contrast, tungsten and PEEK braided microcatheters showed potential safe use in MRI.","output":"Safety of retained microcatheters: an evaluation of radiofrequency heating in endovascular microcatheters with nitinol, tungsten, and polyetheretherketone braiding at 1.5 T and 3 T."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an ongoing pandemic that profoundly challenges healthcare systems all over the world.

Healthcare provision for vulnerable older adults has also been affected by lockdowns and suspension of selected medical services worldwide. In our tertiary cancer center, the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS), our Geriatric Oncology (GO) service for older adults with cancer was halted for five months. In this paper, we describe the adoption of a hybrid telemedicine model by our GO service to continue care provision for older adults in the midst of the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comprehensive geriatric assessments (CGA) were done via telemedicine and virtual multidisciplinary discussions were held prior to the patients' clinic visits. A hybrid telemedicine consultation allowed geriatricians and oncologists, segregated in different sites during the pandemic, to provide a hybrid physical and video geriatric oncology consultation. Scheduled phone follow ups by GO nurses helped to monitor patients for treatment-related toxicities and geriatric syndromes. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty patients were enrolled in the program from July 2020 to August 2021. All were assessed with a CGA, with 240 receiving interventions in the one-stop clinic. The average amount of time spent per visit was shortened from four hours to two and a half hours with an average of three interventions on the same day, versus one previously. Of the patients who received interventions, 84.8% were satisfied with the hybrid telemedicine model and 80.8% of them had reported a maintained or improved quality of life after being enrolled in the program. DISCUSSION: Telemedicine has been widely adopted during the pandemic, but older adults with limited digital literacy may find it a challenge. Our hybrid telemedicine model has allowed us to continue to provide cancer care, identify issues brought about by social isolation, and render timely assistance. It has become imperative to adapt, prepare and plan for the challenges we may face amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and similar future outbreaks. Only by doing so can we remain agile and resilient, to continue providing quality care to our older patients with cancer.","output":"Remaining Agile in the COVID-19 pandemic healthcare landscape C How we adopted a hybrid telemedicine Geriatric Oncology care model in an academic tertiary cancer center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, currently poses an urgent global medical crisis for which there remains a lack of affordable point-of-care testing (POCT). In particular, resource-limited areas need simple and easily disseminated testing solutions to manage the outbreak. In this work, a microfluidic-integrated lateral flow recombinase polymerase amplification (MI-IF-RPA) assay was developed for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2, which integrates the reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) and a universal lateral flow (LF) dipstick detection system into a single microfluidic chip. The single-chamber RT-RPA reaction components are mixed with running buffer, and then delivered to the LF detection strips for biotin- and FAM-labelled amplified analyte sequences, which can provide easily interpreted positive or negative results. Testing requires only a simple nucleic acid extraction and loading, then incubation to obtain results, approximately 30 minutes in total. SARS-CoV-2 armored RNA particles were used to validate the MI-IF-RPA system, which showed a limit of detection of 1 copy per L, or 30 copies per sample. Chip performance was further evaluated using clinically diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and revealed a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 100%, highly comparable to current reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based diagnostic assays. This MI-IF-RPA assay is portable and comprises affordable materials, enabling mass production and decreased risk of contamination. Without the need for specialized instrumentation and training, MI-IF-RPA assay can be used as a complement to RT-PCR for low-cost COVID-19 screening in resource-limited areas.","output":"A microfluidic-integrated lateral flow recombinase polymerase amplification (MI-IF-RPA) assay for rapid COVID-19 detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now being investigated for its distinctive patterns in the course of disease development which can be indicated with miscellaneous immune responses in infected individuals.

Six studies were included, comprising 1431 patients. All six studies included patients at high risk of COVID-19, and five studies explicitly reported that they included only symptomatic patients. Mean prevalence of COVID-19 was 47.9% (range, 27.6-85.4%). High or potential risk of bias was present throughout all QUADAS-2 domains in all six studies. Sensitivity ranged from 92.9% to 97.0%, and specificity ranged from 25.0% to 71.9%, with pooled estimates of 94.6% (95% CI, 91.9-96.4%) and 46.0% (95% CI, 31.9-60.7%), respectively.

In federal emergencies, reuse of PPE after disinfection can occur by processes, like vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), recommended by the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention. We identified a vacant animal holding facility at our institution to repurpose into a regional VHP decontamination center. METHODS: The facility is a multiroom, 20 000 ft(2) building with control of HVAC to adjust to VHP conditional requirements. H(2)O(2) was delivered to rooms using robotic HaloFoggers, dispersing H(2)O(2) vapor and increasingly concentrated microdroplets as a fog for a timed period based on cubic footage of rooms. RESULTS: Fogging cycles eliminated 6-log Geobacillus stearothermophilus up to 7 days postcycle. Functional efficacy of treated N95s was confirmed by fit tests of institutional personnel. Signage, process flow mapping, and training materials facilitated ease of workflow and adherence to safety expectations within the building. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our study determined that a variety of N95 respirator types and sizes were able to be cleared of potential bacterial and viral agents using VHP in a controlled fog/dwell/exhaust cycle. This repurposed animal facility has the capacity to decontaminate up to 6700 respirators daily, which will address the predicted surge of COVID-19 cases in the state, and ultimately allow each respirator to be reused multiple times.

AIMS: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and phenotypic categorisation of infertile PCOS women and to assess ovulatory response and pregnancy rates of PCOS phenotypes with sequential letrozole dose escalation. STUDY SETTING AND DESIGN: This was a prospective observational study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy-five infertile PCOS women were enrolled. One hundred fifty-six women received ovulation induction as per the protocol with sequential letrozole dose escalation in each subsequent cycle (2.5 mg, 5 mg and 7.5 mg). Responses were assessed by ovulation and/or pregnancy. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Descriptive statistics were elaborated by means, medians, frequencies and percentages. Group comparisons and linear correlation between two continuous variables were done using appropriate statistical tests. RESULTS: Eighty-seven (49.7%) women were Phenotype A; 11 (6.3%) were Phenotype B; 20 (11.4%) were Phenotype C and 57 (32.6%) were Phenotype D in our study. After excluding the lost to follow up participants in each induction cycle, 33.3% (2.5 mg dose); 62.8% (5 mg dose) and 78.9% (7.5 mg dose) women responded to letrozole.

Lightweight portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) are a valid alternative to traditional systems such as portable compressed oxygen cylinders. However, patient preference and the possible psychological implications related to the use of both devices have been poorly assessed. We sought to evaluate patient preference between the ambulatory oxygen systems (ie, a POC or a small cylinder) for patients with COPD and interstitial lung disease experiencing exertional desaturation in a rehabilitation setting. Furthermore, the use of one device in comparison with the other was related to specific mechanical characteristics and related to perceived quality of life, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. METHODS: 30 subjects with COPD and interstitial lung disease, who demonstrated exertional desaturation on room air during 6-min walk test (6MWT), were recruited. Each subject performed 2 6MWTs, in random order: one breathing oxygen via a POC and one with a portable compressed oxygen cylinder. Both devices were set up to ensure oxyhemoglobin saturation between 92% and 95% during the 6MWTs. All subjects completed a questionnaire assessing anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Each device was randomly assigned to each subject for 1 week, and then replaced with the other in the following week. At the end of the trial period, all subjects completed a questionnaire evaluating several aspects of the oxygen therapy devices. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in oxygen saturation or the mean distances achieved during the 6MWTs between the 2 portable oxygen devices. The subjects expressed greater preference for the POC (73.3%), basing their choice mainly on ease of transport and lower weight. Subjects' age also correlated with preferences: younger subjects were more negatively focused on the weight of the portable compressed oxygen cylinder, whereas older subjects considered the POC easier to manage. No significant differences in preferences were present between COPD and interstitial lung disease. CONCLUSIONS: The POC and the portable compressed oxygen cylinder performed in a comparable manner during 6MWT for subjects with COPD and interstitial lung disease and exertional desaturation. Subjects preferred the POC because it was associated with better mobility.","output":"Subject Preferences and Psychological Implications of Portable Oxygen Concentrator versus Compressed Oxygen Cylinder in Chronic Lung Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019 quickly stretched health care system across the globe.

Previous studies show a gap in the notification of leishmaniasis. The purpose of the present study was to determine the Knowledge, attitudes and practice of medical officers regarding leishmaniasis. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Anuradhapura district which reported the highest case load of leishmaniasis. Medical officers from public and private health care institutes in the area filled a self-administered questionnaire in the presence of the investigators. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-eight (188) medical officers completed the questionnaire. Of them, 95.7% were aware of leishmaniasis as a parasitic infection and 84.7% correctly identified Leishmania donovani as the causative organism in Sri Lanka. From the respondents, 181 (96.8%) knew that the vector of leishmaniasis is sand fly. Cutaneous leishmaniasis was reported as the most prevalent form of leishmaniasis in the country by 176 (94.1%). Nearly half of the respondents (98, 54.1%) were aware of the fact that the Anuradhapura district has the highest disease burden. Many of them had the idea that leishmaniasis is an emerging disease (155, 84.3%,) and early diagnosis is important in controlling the disease (163, 89.1%). Although about three fourth (123, 73.7%,) of the participants mentioned that leishmaniasis should be notified at first clinical suspicion, only 74 (42.5%) were aware that it is a legal requirement. Some medical officers (39, 22%) believed that the current notification system in the country is not effective.

However, evidence supporting this notion is currently lacking. In this study, we conducted a survey on the risk of COVID-19 in patients with MS and NMOSD. METHODS: The survey was conducted through the Chinese Medical Network for Neuroinflammation. Patients in 10 MS centers from 8 cities including Wuhan were included. Information about MS and NMOSD disease duration and the usage of DMDs were collected. Data of suspected cases of COVID-19 were obtained from hospital visits, questionnaires, and patient self-reporting. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was confirmed through clinical evaluation by a panel of experts in conjunction with chest CT and viral RNA detection. RESULTS: Eight hundred eighty-two of 1,804 (48.89%) patients with MS and 2,129 of 3,060 (69.58%) patients with NMOSD were receiving DMDs. There were no alterations in the patients' DMD regimen during January 15, 2020, to March 15, 2020, the 3-month period. None of the patients with MS treated with DMDs had COVID-19. However, 2 patients with relapsing NMOSD were diagnosed with COVID-19-related pneumonia. After treatment, both patients recovered from pneumonia and neither patient experienced new attacks due to predisposing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the following 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: No increased risk of COVID-19 infection was observed in patients with MS or NMOSD, irrespective of whether these patients received DMDs.

METHODS: Nine students participated in a formal curriculum of high-value critical care medicine topics designed to meet the learning objectives of the in-person experience. Students obtained patient histories and directed physical examinations virtually via telemedicine. They followed assigned patients, submitted clinical documentation, and practiced electronic order entry using a non-production EHR copy. At conclusion these students completed the same evaluation used for \\"in-person\\" CCM rotations earlier in the year. RESULTS: Students rated the virtual rotation comparably to the traditional rotation in most evaluated criteria. Lower rated areas included \\"perform minor procedures\\", \\"patient counseling\\", and \\"interprofessional experiences\\".

However, our understanding of transcriptional and repertoire changes following full vaccination remains incomplete. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and functional assays to compare humoral and cellular responses to two doses of mRNA vaccine with responses observed in convalescent individuals with asymptomatic disease. Our analyses revealed enrichment of spike-specific B cells, activated CD4 T cells, and robust antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4 T cell responses in all vaccinees. On the other hand, CD8 T cell responses were both weak and variable. Interestingly, clonally expanded CD8 T cells were observed in every vaccinee, as observed following natural infection. TCR gene usage, however, was variable, reflecting the diversity of repertoires and MHC polymorphism in the human population. Natural infection induced expansion of larger CD8 T cell clones occupied distinct clusters, likely due to the recognition of a broader set of viral epitopes presented by the virus not seen in the mRNA vaccine. Our study highlights a coordinated adaptive immune response where early CD4 T cell responses facilitate the development of the B cell response and substantial expansion of effector CD8 T cells, together capable of contributing to future recall responses.","output":"Single cell profiling of T and B cell repertoires following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Magnetic chitosan beads (MCSB), prepared from solution by using an external magnet, and the adsorption of Ni(II) ions from wastewater by MCSB and its cross-linked derivative with glutaraldehyde (GLU-MCSB) was investigated in an adsorption system. The GLU-MCSB sorbents are insoluble in aqueous acidic solution and improve adsorption capacity. The adsorption process was carried out by considering various parameters, viz. adsorbent dose, contact time, pH and temperature. Thermogravimetric analysis of beads shows that degradation takes place in two stages. Fourier transform infra-red spectra of magnetic beads exhibit an absorption band at 606 cm-1 for Fe-O. The elemental analysis (energy dispersive X-ray analysis) and scanning electron microscopy were used to analyze the structure and characteristics of MCSB and GLU-MCSB. The Ni(II) removal efficiency attains a highest value of 95.12% with cross-linked GLU-MCSB in comparison to 79.5% with MCSB. Adsorption processes follow the pseudo-second-order rate kinetics model, which suggested that the rate-limiting step may be the chemical adsorption rather than the mass transport. The experimental data of adsorption fitted well with the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms with a high correlation coefficient (R2 > 0.9), showing that monolayer adsorption took place on the surface of GLU-MCSB absorbents. The negative values of entropy change, -175.64 and -163.30 J/(molK), and enthalpy change, -54.75 and -49.58 kJ/mol, for MCSB and GLU-MCSB suggest that the process is spontaneous and exothermic in nature.","output":"Adsorption of nickel (II) ions from wastewater using glutaraldehyde cross-linked magnetic chitosan beads: isotherm, kinetics and thermodynamics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Virus-specific memory T cell populations demonstrate plasticity in antigenic and functional phenotype, in recognition of antigen, and in their ability to accommodate new memory T cell populations.

Mice vaccinated with our prototype vaccine NVX-CoV2373 (rS-WU1) or rS-B.1.351 alone, in combination, or as a heterologous prime boost, were protected when challenged with live SARS-CoV-2/B.1.1.7 or SARS-CoV-2/B.1.351. Virus titer was reduced to undetectable levels in the lungs post-challenge in all vaccinated mice, and Th1-skewed cellular responses were observed. A strong anamnestic response was demonstrated in baboons boosted with rS-B.1.351 approximately one year after immunization with NVX-CoV2373 (rS-WU1). An rS-B.1.351 vaccine alone or in combination with prototype rS-WU1 induced protective antibody- and cell-mediated responses that were protective against challenge with SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses.","output":"Immunogenicity and In vivo protection of a variant nanoparticle vaccine that confers broad protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Unstructured text, including medical records, patient feedback, and social media comments, can be a rich source of data for clinical research. Natural language processing (NLP) describes a set of techniques used to convert passages of written text into interpretable datasets that can be analysed by statistical and machine learning (ML) models. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to contemporary techniques for the analysis of text-data, using freely-available software. METHODS: We performed three NLP experiments using publicly-available data obtained from medicine review websites. First, we conducted lexicon-based sentiment analysis on open-text patient reviews of four drugs: Levothyroxine, Viagra, Oseltamivir and Apixaban. Next, we used unsupervised ML (latent Dirichlet allocation, LDA) to identify similar drugs in the dataset, based solely on their reviews. Finally, we developed three supervised ML algorithms to predict whether a drug review was associated with a positive or negative rating. These algorithms were: a regularised logistic regression, a support vector machine (SVM), and an artificial neural network (ANN). We compared the performance of these algorithms in terms of classification accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Levothyroxine and Viagra were reviewed with a higher proportion of positive sentiments than Oseltamivir and Apixaban. One of the three LDA clusters clearly represented drugs used to treat mental health problems. A common theme suggested by this cluster was drugs taking weeks or months to work. Another cluster clearly represented drugs used as contraceptives. Supervised machine learning algorithms predicted positive or negative drug ratings with classification accuracies ranging from 0.664, 95% CI [0.608, 0.716] for the regularised regression to 0.720, 95% CI [0.664,0.776] for the SVM. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we present a conceptual overview of common techniques used to analyse large volumes of text, and provide reproducible code that can be readily applied to other research studies using open-source software.

The program was positioned within a stepped-care model for primary mental health care and adopted a collaborative regional approach. In addition to improved mental health outcomes for face-to-face and online program participants, we have documented numerous referrals to specialist services and extensive diffusion of mindfulness skills, mostly to family members, within each community. Community partnerships were critical to community engagement. Training workshops to build the skills of the bilingual health and community workforce increased the programs reach. In immigrant nations such as Australia, mainstream mental health promotion must be complemented by activities that target specific population groups.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that COVID-19 is a pandemic having a higher spread rate rather than the mortality. Identification of a potential approach or therapy against COVID-19 is still under consideration. Therefore, it is essential to have an insight into SARS-CoV-2, its interacting partner, and domains for an effective treatment. The present study is divided into three main categories, including SARS-CoV-2 prominent receptor and its expression levels, other interacting partners, and their binding domains. The first section focuses primarily on coronaviruses' general aspects (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses (MERS-CoV)) their structures, similarities, and mode of infections. The second section discusses the host receptors which includes the human targets of coronaviruses like dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), CD147, CD209L, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), and other miscellaneous targets (type-II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), furin, trypsin, cathepsins, thermolysin, elastase, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5-kinase, two-pore segment channel, and epithelium sodium channel C-&#945; subunit). The human cell receptor, ACE2 plays an essential role in the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) pathway and COVID-19. Thus, this section also discusses the ACE2 expression and risk of COVID-19 infectivity in various organs and tissues such as the liver, lungs, intestine, heart, and reproductive system in the human body. Absence of ACE2 protein expression in immune cells could be used for limiting the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The third section covers the current available approaches for COVID-19 treatment. Overall, this review focuses on the critical role of human cell receptors involved in coronavirus pathogenesis, which would likely be used in designing target-specific drugs to combat COVID-19.","output":"Human cell receptors: potential drug targets to combat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: High intake of added sugar is linked to weight gain and cardiometabolic risk. In 2018, the US National Salt and Sugar Reduction Initiative (NSSRI) proposed government supported voluntary national sugar reduction targets. This intervention's potential health and equity impacts, and cost-effectiveness are unclear. Methods: A validated microsimulation model, CVD-PREDICT, coded in C++, was used to estimate incremental changes in type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs and cost-effectiveness of the NSSRI policy. The model was run at the individual-level, incorporating the annual probability of each person's transition between health status based on their risk factors. The model incorporated national demographic and dietary data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey across 3 cycles (2011-2016), added sugar-related diseases from meta-analyses, and policy costs and health-related costs from established sources. A simulated nationally representative US population was created and followed until age 100 years or death, with 2019 as the year of intervention start. Findings were evaluated over 10 years and a lifetime from healthcare and societal perspectives. Uncertainty was evaluated in a one-way analysis by assuming 50% industry compliance, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses via a second-order Monte Carlo approach. Model outputs included averted diabetes cases, CVD events and CVD deaths, QALYs gained, and formal healthcare cost savings, stratified by age, race, income and education. Results: Achieving the NSSRI sugar reduction targets could prevent 2.48 million CVD events, 0.49 million CVD deaths, and 0.75 million diabetes cases; gain 6.67 million QALYs; and save $160.88 billion net costs from a societal perspective over a lifetime. The policy became cost-effective (<150K/QALYs) at 6 years, highly cost-effective (< 50K/QALYs) at 7 years, and cost-saving at 9 years. Results were robust from a healthcare perspective, with lower (50%) industry compliance, and in probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The policy could also reduce disparities, with greatest estimated health gains per million adults among Black and Hispanic, lower income, and less educated Americans.

The COVID-19 pandemic required an unprecedented shutdown in our institutional LDCT program. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on lung cancer screening and subsequent cancer diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed our prospective institutional LDCT screening database, which began in 2012. In all, 2,153 patients have participated. Monthly mean number of LDCTs were compared between baseline (January 2017 to February 2020) and COVID-19 periods (March 2020 to July 2020). RESULTS: LDCT was suspended on March 13, 2020 and 818 screening visits were cancelled. Phased reopening began on May 5, 2020 and full opening on June 1, 2020. Total monthly mean  SD LDCTs (146  31 vs 39  40; p < 0.01) and new patient monthly LDCTs (56  14 vs 15  17; p < 0.01) were significantly decreased during the COVID-19 period.

These interactions are especially prevalent for patients with underlying pathologies, such as cardiovascular diseases. However, there has been limited work to uncover the range of responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. Thus, our objective was to investigate how endothelial cell pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory responses are altered after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 spike, nucleocapsid, and membrane-envelope proteins. We hypothesized that after a short duration exposure, endothelial cells would have a heightened thrombotic and inflammatory potential. With longer exposures, this may lead to altered disease progression and the observed increased mortality and morbidity rates in patients with underlying vascular pathologies. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, human endothelial cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. After the exposure, the expression of thrombomodulin, PECAM-1, connexin-43, and gC1qR were assessed. In parallel, standard cell culture readouts were assessed to determine if these incubations altered cell growth and metabolism. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We observed significant increases in thrombotic and inflammatory marker expression, with no change to the cell culture parameters (with the exception of a reduction in cell density in response to one SARS-CoV-2 structural protein). Importantly, these observations were dependent on the viral structural protein the cells were exposed to, suggesting that the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with innate cells is complex and must be uncovered. Combined, this suggests that SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins can regulate inflammatory and thrombotic responses that underlie common pathologies observed during COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Structural Proteins Exposure Alter Thrombotic and Inflammatory Responses in Human Endothelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Low back pain is one of the most common conditions occurring in the golfing population. Many approaches have been utilized throughout the years to address this condition including the concept of regional interdependence. The purpose of this case report is to describe the evaluation process and treatment approach of a golfer with low back pain using the principles of regional interdependence. CASE DESCRIPTION: A thirty-year-old male with right-sided low back pain was evaluated using a comprehensive approach including golf specific movement screening and a swing evaluation. The patient had mobility restrictions in his thoracic spine and hips that appeared to be contributing to a hypermobility in the lower lumbar spine. Based on the evaluation, he was placed into the treatment-based classification (TBC) of stabilization but would also benefit from mobilization/manipulation techniques. OUTCOMES: After seven visits over a four-week span, the patients mobility and core stability both improved and he was able to play golf and workout pain free. His outcome measures also improved, including the revised Oswestry Disability index from 26% disabled to 10%, the Fear Avoidance Behavior Questionnaire (FABQ) Work from 10/42 to 3/42, and the FABQ Physical Activity from 19/24 to 6/24.

Contact tracing is usually performed manually by authorized personnel. Manual contact tracing is an inefficient, error-prone, time-consuming process of limited utility to the population at large as those in close contact with infected individuals are informed hours, if not days, later. This paper introduces an alternative way to manual contact tracing. The proposed Smart Contact Tracing (SCT) system utilizes the smartphone's Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals and machine learning classifier to accurately and quickly determined the contact profile. SCT's contribution is two-fold: a) classification of the user's contact as high/low-risk using precise proximity sensing, and b) user anonymity using a privacy-preserving communications protocol. SCT leverages BLE's non-connectable advertising feature to broadcast a signature packet when the user is in the public space. Both broadcasted and observed signatures are stored in the user's smartphone and they are only uploaded to a secure signature database when a user is confirmed by public health authorities to be infected. Using received signal strength (RSS) each smartphone estimates its distance from other user's phones and issues real-time alerts when social distancing rules are violated. The paper includes extensive experimentation utilizing real-life smartphone positions and a comparative evaluation of five machine learning classifiers. Reported results indicate that a decision tree classifier outperforms other states of the art classification methods in terms of accuracy.

RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing and co-segregation analysis showed that all affected members of this pedigree have carried a heterozygous missense c.253A>G (p.Cys85Arg) variant in exon 4 of the IRF6 gene, which has co-segregated with the phenotype and was not found among the 100 unrelated healthy individuals. CONCLUSION: The missense c.253A>G variant in exon 4 of the IRF6 gene probably underlay the NSCLP in this pedigree.","output":"[Identification of pathogenic variant in a Chinese pedigree affected with non-syndromic cleft lip and palate]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Why don't we make disease cures that are themselves infectious?","output":"Contagious cures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper incorporates the players risk attitudes into a green supply chain (GSC) consisting of a supplier and a retailer.

Our results show that, for the centralized GSC, risk aversion lowers the green level and the retail price, while for the decentralized GSC, risk aversion lowers the wholesale price and the retail price, but it may induce the supplier to increase the green level given a high-risk tolerance of the supplier. Meanwhile, the risk-averse decentralized GSC may obtain more expected profit than the risk-neutral decentralized GSC. Furthermore, this paper designs a revenue-and-cost-sharing joint contract to coordinate the risk-neutral GSC, and such a contract can improve the risk-averse GSC under specific conditions.","output":"Green supply chain game model and contract design: risk neutrality vs. risk aversion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter discusses the various aspects of the clinical virology of rhinoviruses.

The influence of possible demographic covariates such as sex, age, smoking, or educational level are analyzed, and the items that best discriminate are studied. In addition, the internal structure validity of the blue and purple versions is studied as a parallel measure, and a cultural adaptation of the purple version is carried out. For this, three independent samples of normosmic healthy volunteers were studied. To obtain normative values, the sample was of 417 participants (18-89 years). For the internal structure validity study of both versions, the sample was 226 (18-70 years), and for familiarity of the purple version, the sample was 75 participants (21-79 years). Results indicated that men and women and smokers and non-smokers perform equally. However, differences were found as age progresses, being more pronounced after 60 years old in all three measurements of the identification test. This research also provides the items that best discriminate in the blue version and a cultural adaptation for the purple version.

To inform future disease prevention and control, we analyzed global data to exam the relationship between state vulnerabilities and COVID-19 incidences and deaths. METHODS: : Vulnerability was measured using the Fragile States Index (FSI). FSI is created by the Fund for Peace to assess levels of fragility for individual countries. Total FSI score and scores for 12 specific indicators were used as the predictor variables. Outcome variables were national cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths up to September 16, 2020, derived the World Health Organization. Cumulative incidence rates were computed using 2019 National population derived from the World Bank, and case fatality rates were computed as the ratio of deaths/COVID-19 cases. Countries with incomplete data were excluded, yielding a final sample of 146 countries. Multivariate regression was used to examine the association between the predictor and the outcome measures. RESULTS: : There were dramatic cross-country variations in both FSI and COVID-19 epidemiological measurements. FSI total scores were negatively associated with both COVID-19 cumulative incidence rates ( = -0.0135, P < 0.001) and case fatality rates ( = -0.0147, P < 0.05). Of the 12 FSI indicators, three negatively associated with COVID-19 incidences were E1(Economic Decline and Poverty), E3 (Human Flight and Brain Drain), and S2 (Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons); two positively associated were P1 (State Legitimacy) and X1 (External Intervention). With regard to association with case fatality rates, C1 (Security Apparatus) was positive, and P3 (Human Rights and Rule of Law) and X1 was negative. CONCLUSIONS: : With FSI measures by the Fund of Peace, overall, more fragile countries are less likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and even if affected, death rates were lower. However, poor in state legitimacy and lack of external intervention are risk for COVID-19 infection and lack of security apparatus is risky for COVID-19 death. Implications of the study findings are discussed and additional studies are needed to examine the mechanisms underpinning these relationships.","output":"State fragility and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: an ecologic analysis of data from 146 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Families with dependent children are among the social groups most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic This paper examines the development of measures applied by the Czech national government for compensating families with children during the COVID-19 crisis It summarizes the aims of the measures as announced by the government or its ministries This is supplemented by a summary of the available opinions of experts and other policy stakeholders Based on this, the paper discusses the adequacy of the adopted measures and points out lessons for the future policymaking in the given area A relatively high number of measures were identified This suggests that the government strived for proactive policy to address families as a vulnerable social group However, a rapid and sometimes unrestrained legislative process seems to have come at the expense of a proper public debate on the need for and impact of the new measures Given the uncertain time horizon of the epidemic, the apparent lack of consideration regarding the budgetary implications of the measures seems worrying ?

Characterization of the immunological mechanisms involved in disease symptomatology and protective response is important to progress in disease control and prevention. Humans evolved by losing the capacity to synthesize the glycan Gal&#945;1-3Gal?1-(3)4GlcNAc-R (&#945;-Gal), which resulted in the development of a protective response against pathogenic viruses and other microorganisms containing this modification on membrane proteins mediated by anti-&#945;-Gal immunoglobulin M (IgM)/IgG antibodies produced in response to bacterial microbiota. In addition to anti-&#945;-Gal antibody-mediated pathogen opsonization, this glycan induces various immune mechanisms that have shown protection in animal models against infectious diseases without inflammatory responses. In this study, we hypothesized that the immune response to &#945;-Gal may contribute to the control of COVID-19. To address this hypothesis, we characterized the antibody response to &#945;-Gal in patients at different stages of COVID-19 and in comparison with healthy control individuals. The results showed that while the inflammatory response and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Spike) IgG antibody titers increased, reduction in anti-&#945;-Gal IgE, IgM, and IgG antibody titers and alteration of anti-&#945;-Gal antibody isotype composition correlated with COVID-19 severity. The results suggested that the inhibition of the &#945;-Gal-induced immune response may translate into more aggressive viremia and severe disease inflammatory symptoms. These results support the proposal of developing interventions such as probiotics based on commensal bacteria with &#945;-Gal epitopes to modify the microbiota and increase &#945;-Gal-induced protective immune response and reduce severity of COVID-19.","output":"The antibody response to the glycan -Gal correlates with COVID-19 disease symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses have caused several zoonotic infections in the past two decades, leading to significant morbidity and mortality globally. Balanced regulation of cell death and inflammatory immune responses is essential to promote protection against coronavirus infection; however, the underlying mechanisms that control these processes remain to be resolved. Here we demonstrate that infection with the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and inflammatory cell death in the form of PANoptosis. Deleting NLRP3 inflammasome components or the downstream cell death executioner gasdermin D (GSDMD) led to an initial reduction in cell death followed by a robust increase in the incidence of caspase-8C and receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)Cmediated inflammatory cell deathafter coronavirus infection. Additionally, loss of GSDMD promoted robust NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, the amounts of some cytokines released during coronavirus infection were significantly altered in the absence of GSDMD. Altogether, our findings show that inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, is induced by coronavirus infection and that impaired NLRP3 inflammasome function or pyroptosis can lead to negative consequences for the host. These findings may have important implications for studies of coronavirus-induced disease.","output":"Impaired NLRP3 inflammasome activation/pyroptosis leads to robust inflammatory cell death via caspase-8/RIPK3 during coronavirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New strategies are needed to master infectious diseases. The so-called passive vaccination, i.e., prevention and treatment with specific antibodies, has a proven record and potential in the management of infections and entered the medical arena more than 100 years ago. Progress in the identification of specific antigens has become the hallmark in the development of novel subunit vaccines that often contain only a single immunogen, frequently proteins, derived from the microbe in order to induce protective immunity. On the other hand, the monoclonal antibody technology has enabled biotechnology to produce antibody species in unlimited quantities and at reasonable costs that are more or less identical to their human counterparts and bind with high affinity to only one specific site of a given antigen. Although, this technology has provided a robust platform for launching novel and successful treatments against a variety of devastating diseases, it is up till now only exceptionally employed in therapy of infectious diseases. Monoclonal antibodies engaged in the treatment of specific cancers seem to work by a dual mode; they mark the cancerous cells for decontamination by the immune system, but also block a function that intervenes with cell growth. The availability of the entire genome sequence of pathogens has strongly facilitated the identification of highly specific protein antigens that are suitable targets for neutralizing antibodies, but also often seem to play an important role in the microbes life cycle. Thus, the growing repertoire of well-characterized protein antigens will open the perspective to develop monoclonal antibodies against bacterial infections, at least as last resort treatment, when vaccination and antibiotics are no options for prevention or therapy. In the following chapter we describe and compare various technologies regarding the identification of suitable target antigens and the foundation of cognate monoclonal antibodies and discuss their possible applications in the treatment of bacterial infections together with an overview of current efforts.","output":"The Antigenome: From Protein Subunit Vaccines to Antibody Treatments of Bacterial Infections?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Existe una clara relacion entre la infeccion por el nuevo coronavirus 2 y el diagnostico de enfermedad tromboembolica venosa, como consecuencia del desarrollo de un sindrome de respuesta inflamatoria sistemica debido a la activacion de la cascada de la coagulacion Se presenta en el 90% de los pacientes con formas graves de la infeccion, lo que revela la presencia de microtrombosis y macrotrombosis intravascular pulmonar Esto sugiere un posible beneficio clinico de la aplicacion de una tromboprofilaxis adecuada al riesgo clinico de cada paciente Asimismo, la sospecha de enfermedad tromboembolica venosa en el contexto de esta pandemia representa un reto diagnostico debido a la existencia de similitudes entre ambas alteraciones en varios aspectos Debe tenerse en cuenta que el diagnostico de tromboembolismo pulmonar agudo no excluye la posibilidad de infeccion viral La valoracion de pacientes con sospecha de tromboembolismo pulmonar agudo en el contexto de la pandemia debe ser eficaz para establecer un diagnostico y tratamiento con rapidez, a fin de reducir la morbilidad y mortalidad adjuntas, sin que ello eleve el riesgo de infeccion para los profesionales de la salud y otros pacientes","output":"[Tromboembolismo pulmonar agudo en tiempos de SARS-CoV-2: diagnostico y tratamiento]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Since January 2020, 3 months ago, when the pathogen causing the Coronavirus-disease was identified in humans, the literature on COVID-19 has grown exponentially to over 4000 publications.

Methods A review of the MEDLINE database was performed on April 13th, 2020. Search terms included COVID-19, neurosurgery, and surgery. A review of documents published on the web-page of the WFNS and of the 5 continental associations of neurosurgical societies AANS, AASNS, CAANS, EANS, and FLANC representing the 119 national Neurosurgical Societies around the world was performed.

As a public good, it should be more commonplace in more homogeneous and altruistic societies. However, for healthy people, observing social distancing has private benefits, too. If sick individuals are more likely to stay home, healthy ones have fewer incentives to do so, especially if the asymptomatic transmission is perceived to be unlikely. Theoretically, we show that this interplay may lead to a stricter observance of social distancing in more diverse and less altruistic societies. Empirically, we find that, consistent with the model, the reduction in mobility following the first local case of COVID-19 was stronger in Russian cities with higher ethnic fractionalization and cities with higher levels of xenophobia. For identification, we predict the timing of the first case using pre-existing patterns of internal migration to Moscow. Using SafeGraph data on mobility patterns, we confirm that mobility reduction in the United States was also higher in counties with higher ethnic fractionalization.

METHODS Between August 2011 and April 2014, a total of 194 patients with colon cancer were recruited from seven hospitals in Korea. Patients were randomly allocated into the SPLS group (n = 99) or MPLS group (n = 95). The primary endpoint was postoperative complications. Operative, postoperative, and pathologic outcomes were analyzed after 50% of the patient study population had been recruited. RESULTS The patients' demographic characteristics, operative times, estimated blood volume losses, numbers of harvested lymph nodes, and lengths of both resection margins were not significantly different between groups. In the SPLS group, the rates of conversion to MPLS and open surgery were 12.9 and 2.2%, respectively. Postoperative complications occurred in 10.8% of the SPLS, and 12.5% of the MPLS patients (p = 0.714). Times to functional recovery, pain scores, and amounts of analgesia were similar between groups.

We measured the inhibitory action of CQ, HCQ, and HCQ with 30 M azithromycin (AZ) on six ion currents (fast [INa] and late [INa,L] components of the sodium current, L-type calcium current [ICa,L], rapid [IKr/hERG], and slow [IKs] components of delayed rectifier potassium, and inward rectifier potassium [IK1]) over a wide range of concentrations using the automated patch-clamp system. Using the concentration-inhibition relationship that was thus obtained, we simulated the drug effects while increasing the concentration until the life-threatening arrhythmia, torsade de pointes (TdP), was observed.

In both disasters, the emergency operating centers (EOCs) could not effectively integrate associated agencies to deal with the incident. The coordination and utilization of resources were inefficient, which caused difficulty in command structure operation and casualty evacuation. METHODS This study was designed to create a survey questionnaire with problem items using disaster management phases mandated by Taiwan's Emergency Medical Care Law (EMCL), use statistical methods (t test) to analyze the results and issues the EOCs encountered during the operation, and propose solutions for those problems. RESULTS Findings showed that EOCs lacked authority to intervene or coordinate with associated agencies. Also, placing emphasis on the recovery phase should improve future prevention and response mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS To improve the response to MCIs, the EMCL needs to be amended to give EOCs the lead during disasters; use feedback from the recovery phase to improve future disaster management and operation coordination; and establish an information-sharing platform across agencies to address all aspects of relief work.(Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2014;0:1-6).","output":"Operation of emergency operating centers during mass casualty incidents in taiwan: a disaster management perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is important for decision making prior to surgery in otolaryngology. An understanding of current and developing testing methods is important for interpreting test results. METHODS: We performed a literature review of current evidence surrounding SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing highlighting its utility, limitations, and implications for otolaryngologists. RESULTS: The currently accepted RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 has varying sensitivity according to which subsite of the aerodigestive tract is sampled. Nasal swab sensitivities appear to be about 70%. Chest CT imaging for screening purposes is not currently recommended. CONCLUSION: Due to the current sensitivity of RT-PCR based testing for SARS-CoV-2, a negative test cannot rule out COVID-19. Full PPE should be worn during high-risk procedures such as aerosol generating procedures even if testing is negative.

This study examines the incidence of diagnosed OUD, opioid agonist use, and excess mortality among persons with OUD in South Africa's private healthcare sector. Methods: We conducted a cohort study of beneficiaries (11 years or older) of a South African medical insurance scheme using reimbursement claims from Jan 1, 2011, to Jul 1, 2020. Beneficiaries were classified as having OUD if they received opioid agonists (buprenorphine or methadone), an ICD-10 F11 diagnosis for a mental and behavioural disorder due to opioid use, or an ICD-10 T40 diagnosis for opioid poisoning. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for factors associated with OUD, estimated the cumulative incidence of opioid agonist use after receiving an ICD-10 F11 diagnosis, and examined excess mortality among beneficiaries with OUD. Results: Of 1,251,458 beneficiaries, 1,313 (0.1%) had OUD. Between 2011 and 2020, the incidence of OUD increased by 12% (95% CI 9%-14%) per year. Men, young adults in their twenties, and beneficiaries with co-morbid mental health or other substance use disorders were at increased risk of OUD. The cumulative incidence of opioid agonist use was 10.6% (95% CI 8.3-13.2) at 3 years after receiving an F11 diagnosis. After adjusting for age, sex, year, medical insurance coverage, and population group, OUD was associated with an increased risk of mortality (aHR 2.29, 95% CI 1.85-2.82). OUD was associated with a 7.63-year shorter life expectancy (95% CI 4.08-10.70). Conclusions: The incidence of patients diagnosed with or treated for OUD in the private sector is increasing rapidly. People with OUD in the private sector are a vulnerable population with substantial psychiatric comorbidity who often die prematurely. Evidence-based management of OUD is urgently needed to improve the health outcomes of people with OUD.","output":"Diagnosis and treatment of opioid use disorder in a South African private sector medical insurance scheme: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) disease in the general population in Alberta, Canada, has been steadily increasing.

We aimed to investigate the association between history of anemia and 12-year mortality rate due to infections, and compare it with that among non-anemic individuals. METHODS: Data from the National Health Insurance Service Health Screening Cohort were used in this population-based cohort study. Adults who underwent standardized medical examination between and 2002C2003 were included, and the mortality rate due to infection between 2004 and 2015 was analyzed. Individuals were considered to have a history of anemia if the serum hemoglobin level in 2002C2003 was < 12 g/dL for women and < 13 g/dL for men. The severity of anemia at that time was categorized as mild (12 g/dL > hemoglobin 11 g/dL in women and 13 g/dL > hemoglobin 11 g/dL in men), moderate (hemoglobin 8C10.9 g/dL), or severe (hemoglobin < 8 g/dL). Propensity score (PS) matching and Cox regression analysis were used as statistical methods. RESULTS: Overall, 512,905 individuals were included in this study. The mean age of the participants was 54.5 years old (range: 40C98), and 49,042 (9.6%) individuals were classified in the anemic group, which comprised of 36,383 (7.1%), 11,787 (2.3%), and 872 (0.2%) participants in the mild, moderate, and severe sub-groups, respectively. After PS matching, 49,039 individuals in each group were included in the analysis. The risk of mortality due to infection in the anemic group was 1.77-fold higher (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.52C2.60; P < 0.001) than that in the non-anemic group. In the subgroup analysis, the mild and moderate anemia groups had 1.38-fold (HR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.55; P < 0.001) and 2.02-fold (HR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.62 to 2.50; P < 0.001) risk of mortality due to infection compared to that of the non-anemic group, respectively.

METHODS: Participants of the present cross-sectional, multicenter study were parental couples of children suspected to have COVID-19 who underwent testing with nasopharyngeal swabbing. All subjects were assessed by means of the: Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in order to evaluate Post-traumatic stress (PTSS), anxiety, and depressive symptoms, respectively. OUTCOMES: Results evidenced that parents whose children tested positive for COVID-19 were more prone to developing PTSS, anxiety and depressive symptoms. The same results emerged for parents who had quarantined as opposed to those who had not. Moreover, patients who suffered economic damage showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas PTSS was more common among unemployed subjects and among mothers.

Here, we demonstrate that a succinct type I IFN response promotes GC formation and associated IgG subclass distribution primarily through signaling in cDCs and B cells. Type I IFN signaling in cDCs, distinct from cDC1, stimulates development of separable Tfh and Th1 cell subsets. However, Th cell-derived IFN- induces T-bet expression and IgG2c isotype switching prior to this bifurcation and has no evident effects once GCs and bona fide Tfh cells developed. This pathway acts in synergy with early B cell-intrinsic type I IFN signaling, which reinforces T-bet expression in B cells and leads to a selective amplification of the IgG2c+ GC B cell response. Despite the strong Th1 polarizing effect of type I IFNs, the Tfh cell subset develops into IL-4 producing cells that control the overall magnitude of the GCs and promote generation of IgG1 + GC B cells. Thus, type I IFNs act on B cells and cDCs to drive GC formation and to coordinate IgG subclass distribution through parallel Th1 and Tfh cell-dependent pathways.","output":"Type I interferons promote germinal centers through B cell intrinsic signaling and dendritic cell dependent Th1 and Tfh cell lineages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: We aimed to determine the genetic polymorphisms and serum level of interleukin 18 in Fars ethnic groups.Material and methods: 226 Fars ethnic groups were participated.

Recent studies using advanced imaging techniques have yielded new insights into the mechanisms by which neutrophils contribute to defense against bacterial infections and also against sterile injury. In these settings, neutrophils are recruited by various mechanisms depending on the situation. We also describe how these processes may be disrupted in systemic infections, with a particular emphasis on mouse models of sepsis. Neutrophils are often immobilized in the lungs and liver during systemic infections, and this immobilization may be a mechanism through which bacteria can evade the innate immune response or allow neutrophils to form neutrophil extracellular traps that trap and kill bacteria in blood. The platelet is also an important player in sepsis, and we describe how it collaborates with neutrophils in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was added to the panel of viral testing by polymerase chain reaction for the first 2 patients with ILI seen at one of the sentinel sites. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1) virus co-infection with mild symptoms detected through routine ILI surveillance in Egypt. OBJECTIVE: This report aims to describe how the case was identified and the demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes of the patient. METHODS: The case was identified by Central Public Health Laboratory staff, who contacted the ILI sentinel surveillance officer at the Ministry of Health. The case patient was contacted through a telephone call. Detailed information about the patient's clinical picture, course of disease, and outcome was obtained. The contacts of the patient were investigated for acute respiratory symptoms, disease confirmation, and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 510 specimens collected from patients with ILI symptoms from October 2019 to August 2020, 61 (12.0%) were COVID-19-positive and 29 (5.7%) tested positive for influenza, including 15 (51.7%) A(H1N1), 11 (38.0%) A(H3N2), and 3 (10.3%) influenza B specimens. A 21-year-old woman was confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1) virus coinfection. She had a high fever of 40.2 C and mild respiratory symptoms that resolved within 2 days with symptomatic treatment. All five of her family contacts had mild respiratory symptoms 2-3 days after exposure to the confirmed case, and their symptoms resolved without treatment or investigation. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the possible occurrence of SARS-CoV-2/influenza A(H1N1) coinfection in younger and healthy people, who may resolve the infection rapidly. We emphasize the usefulness of the surveillance system for detection of viral causative agents of ILI and recommend broadening of the testing panel, especially if it can guide case management.","output":"Coinfection With SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A(H1N1) in a Patient Seen at an Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Site in Egypt: Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted minorities in the United States. John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH) is a tertiary care hospital within the safety-net system for Cook County in Chicago, Illinois. In this study we report demographics, clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted with COVID-19 in our hospital during the spring surge of 2020. METHODS: A retrospective study was done including patients > 18 years of age admitted to JSH with positive PCR for SARS-CoV2 from March 18 to May 30th, 2020. Outcomes, clinical and demographic characteristics were extracted from the electronic medical record. Moderate and severe disease were defined as radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates and SpO2 > 94% on room air or SpO2< 94% on room air, respectively. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were performed to assess for risk factors for admission to the intensive care unit and mortality. RESULTS: 625 patients were included, 424 (68%) were male. Median age was 44 years (44,63). 364 (58%) were Hispanic and 222 (36%) non-Hispanic Blacks. 113 (18%) of patients presented with mild disease, 204 (33%) with moderate disease, 298 (48%) with severe disease. 73 patients (12%) died. 153 (24%) required ICU admission, 84 (13%) required intubation [Table 1]. In bivariate analysis, increasing age and diabetes (DM) were associated with increased mortality and ICU admission (p=0.001, Tables 2 and 3). Race/ethnicity was not associated with increased mortality or ICU admission. In the multivariate analysis, elevated glucose on admission regardless of DM and CKD were associated with mortality (p < 0.001). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: JSH is a safety net hospital that provides care for the most vulnerable population of Chicago. The proportion of Hispanic patients increased in the later weeks of the pandemic until they represented most of the inpatient population and presented with more severe disease (Figure 1). Although race was not associated with mortality or ICU admission, the high prevalence of chronic diseases such as hypertension and DM in our population may explain the higher rate of admissions. Strengthening of preventive medicine and social engagement with minorities must be a crucial effort to decrease the burden of COVID-19 in this population.

We find that the incidence of infectious COVID-19 individuals has a concave effect on contagion, as would be expected if people have inter-related social networks. We also demonstrate that social distancing and population density have large effects on the rate of contagion. The social distancing in late March and April substantially reduced the number of COVID-19 cases. However, the concave contagion pattern means that when social distancing measures are lifted, the growth rate is considerable but will not be exponential as predicted by standard SIR models. Furthermore, counties with the lowest population density could likely avoid high levels of contagion even with no social distancing. We forecast rates of new cases for COVID-19 under different social distancing norms and find that if social distancing is eliminated there will be a massive increase in the cases of COVID-19, about double what would occur if the US only restored to 50% of the way to normalcy.","output":"Forecasting the Spread of COVID-19 under Different Reopening Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dimethoate is an organophosphorus pesticide used against agricultural insects, which causes oxidative stress and damage in many organs, including the reproductive ones. Cherry laurel (Laurocerasus officinalis Roem.) fruit is rich in vitamins and phenolic compounds with antioxidant effect. The aim of this study was to investigate how effective its extract would be against dimethoate-induced testis and sperm damage in rats. Sixty animals were divided in six groups of 10. Group 1 (control) received only 1 mL of saline (0.9 % NaCl). Group 2 received 7 mg/kg of dimethoate in 1 mL of saline. Group 3 received 4 mg/kg of extract in 1 mL of saline. Group 4 received the extract 30 min before dimethoate administration. Group 5 received vitamin C (positive control, 100 mg/kg in 1 mL of saline) 30 min before dimethoate administration. Group 6 received only dimethoate for the first four weeks and then a combination of dimethoate and extract for another four weeks. All doses were administered daily by oral gavage. After eight weeks of treatment, the rats were euthanised and their reproductive organs removed. We took their body and reproductive organ weights and evaluated testicular oxidative stress, semen characteristics, sperm DNA damage, testicular apoptosis, and histopathological changes. Dimethoate significantly decreased body and reproductive organ weights, sperm motility and concentration, testicular superoxide dismutase, and glutathione-peroxidase activities and significantly increased lipid peroxidation, abnormal sperm rate, sperm DNA damage, testicular apoptosis, and caused histopathological lesions. Cherry laurel extract significantly countered many dimethoate-induced adverse effects, both as pre- and post-treatment, including reproductive organ weight, semen parameters, oxidant-antioxidant balance, sperm DNA integrity, testicular apoptosis, and histological structure. Our findings clearly suggest that the beneficial effects of the extract are associated with countering oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation in particular.","output":"Cherry laurel fruit extract counters dimethoate-induced reproductive impairment and testicular apoptosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guidelines of scientific societies and associations (including the Polish Ophthalmological Society) do not constitute binding laws and do not determine the only correct procedures;they are only an opinion of a group of experts from a given field The opinion reflects the current state of knowledge based on available scientific research results The guidelines do not exempt healthcare workers from personal liability with regard to making the correct decisions for individual patients Personal responsibility for the used therapeutic methods rests with all individuals who practise medicine It should be based on thorough knowledge and practical skills, while observing necessary safety measures with regard to oneself and the patient Readers of this paper are obliged to make themselves familiar with current information on the presented treatments and pharmacotherapies with special attention paid to manufacturers information on doses, time, and administration as well as side effects of the used drugs The publishers and editors of the paper shall not be responsible for any damages that could in any way be connected to the contents of this paper ? 2020 Termedia Publishing House Ltd All rights reserved","output":"Recommendations of the Polish Ophthalmological Society for contact-lens wearers in the COVID-19 era*"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We measured severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein subunits S1/S2 antibodies by using capillary electrophoresis and a chemiluminescence immunoassay for 5,444 active healthcare workers in Italy.

While respiratory and cardiac complications have been described as high\\\\risk manifestations in patients with COVID\\\\19, neurological complications can also enhance mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of neurological complications arises from SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and assess the mortality rate from neurological complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Literature review was conducted by searching in PubMed/Medline, Web of Sciences, and Embase. After performing search strategies with relevant terms, a number of articles were excluded, including review articles, systematic review or meta\\\\analysis, duplicate publication of same researchers, congress abstracts, animal studies, case reports, case series, and articles reporting a history of neurological features prior to COVID\\\\19 infection. After retrieving the data, statistical analysis was performed using the STATA Version 14 software. RESULTS: From 4455 retrieved publications, 20 articles were selected for further analysis. Among 18,258 included patients, 2791 showed neurological symptoms, which were classified into different groups. Headache, confusion, and fatigue were reported as the most non\\\\specific neurological features in confirmed COVID\\\\19 patients. Psychiatric symptoms, CNS disorders, cerebrovascular disorders, CNS inflammatory disorders, PNS disorders, neuromuscular disorders, etc., were defined as specific neurological manifestations. The pooled prevalence of neurological manifestations and mortality rate of COVID\\\\19 patients with neurological features were estimated to be 23.0% (95% CI: 17.8C29.2) and 29.1% (95% CI: 20.3C39.8), respectively. CONCLUSION: Neurological manifestations may commonly happen in patients with COVID\\\\19.

However, the effect of lockdown on outcomes of STEMI patients admitted during the COVID-19 crisis has not been prospectively evaluated. Methods: A prospective, observational study on STEMI patients admitted to our tertiary care center during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. Outcomes of patients admitted during lockdown were compared to those patients admitted before and after pandemic-related lockdown. Results: A total of 147 patients were enrolled in our study, including 57 patients in the pre-lockdown group (November 1, 2019 to March 20, 2020), 16 patients in the lockdown group (March 21 to April 19, 2020), and 74 patients in the post-lockdown group (April 20 to September 30, 2020). Patients admitted during lockdown had significantly longer time to first medical contact, longer door-to-needle-time, higher serum troponin T levels, worse left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and higher need for circulatory support. After a median follow-up of 142 days, survival was significantly worse in STEMI patients of the lockdown group (log-rank: p = 0.0035). Conclusions: This is the first prospective study on outcomes of STEMI patients admitted during public lockdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results suggest that lockdown might deteriorate outcomes of STEMI patients. Public health strategies to constrain spread of COVID-19, such as lockdown, have to be accompanied by distinct public instructions to ensure timely medical care in acute diseases such as STEMI.","output":"Outcomes of Patients With ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Admitted During COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown in Germany C Results of a Single Center Prospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The important role of proper sanitation in maintaining good public health has been confirmed in the past years.

We formulated recommendations to meet the urgent need for a consensus for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD. METHODS: Systematic literature reviews were performed to evaluate: (a) outcomes in PRD with COVID-19; (b) efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccination; and (c) published guidelines/recommendations for non-live, non-COVID-19 vaccinations in PRD. Recommendations were formulated based on the evidence and expert opinion according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. RESULTS: The consensus comprises 2 overarching principles and 7 recommendations. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD should be aligned with prevailing national policy and should be individualized through shared decision between the healthcare provider and patient. We strongly recommend that eligible PRD and household contacts be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. We conditionally recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered during quiescent disease if possible. Immunomodulatory drugs, other than rituximab, can be continued alongside vaccination. We conditionally recommend that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered prior to commencing rituximab if possible. For patients on rituximab, the vaccine should be administered a minimum of 6 months after the last dose and/or 4 weeks prior to the next dose of rituximab. Post-vaccination antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 need not be measured. Any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines may be used, with no particular preference.

In a similar manner to an epidemic, it spreads between humans via digital and physical information systems. It makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. OBJECTIVE: A World Health Organization (WHO) technical consultation on responding to the infodemic related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic was held, entirely online, to crowdsource suggested actions for a framework for infodemic management. METHODS: A group of policy makers, public health professionals, researchers, students, and other concerned stakeholders was joined by representatives of the media, social media platforms, various private sector organizations, and civil society to suggest and discuss actions for all parts of society, and multiple related professional and scientific disciplines, methods, and technologies. A total of 594 ideas for actions were crowdsourced online during the discussions and consolidated into suggestions for an infodemic management framework. RESULTS: The analysis team distilled the suggestions into a set of 50 proposed actions for a framework for managing infodemics in health emergencies. The consultation revealed six policy implications to consider. First, interventions and messages must be based on science and evidence, and must reach citizens and enable them to make informed decisions on how to protect themselves and their communities in a health emergency. Second, knowledge should be translated into actionable behavior-change messages, presented in ways that are understood by and accessible to all individuals in all parts of all societies. Third, governments should reach out to key communities to ensure their concerns and information needs are understood, tailoring advice and messages to address the audiences they represent. Fourth, to strengthen the analysis and amplification of information impact, strategic partnerships should be formed across all sectors, including but not limited to the social media and technology sectors, academia, and civil society. Fifth, health authorities should ensure that these actions are informed by reliable information that helps them understand the circulating narratives and changes in the flow of information, questions, and misinformation in communities. Sixth, following experiences to date in responding to the COVID-19 infodemic and the lessons from other disease outbreaks, infodemic management approaches should be further developed to support preparedness and response, and to inform risk mitigation, and be enhanced through data science and sociobehavioral and other research. CONCLUSIONS: The first version of this framework proposes five action areas in which WHO Member States and actors within society can apply, according to their mandate, an infodemic management approach adapted to national contexts and practices. Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related infodemic require swift, regular, systematic, and coordinated action from multiple sectors of society and government.

This open-label randomized controlled trial study was conducted at El-Abbasia Mental Hospital and Osana family wellness elderly nursing home at Maadi, Cairo. It included 60 elderly patients suffering insomnia sleep problems randomized into two equal groups: one group received a Sleep Hygiene Education (SHE) intervention, the other had a form of Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) adapted for use with insomnia (EFT-I). A self-administered questionnaire with tools for sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), depression, and life satisfaction was used to collect data. The fieldwork was from January to March 2021. The two groups had equal median age (70 years), and almost similar gender and place of residence distribution. After the intervention, 73.3% of the EFT group had good sleep quality, compared to 100.0% in the SHE group (P = 0.005); the median score of depression (3.00) was higher in the EFT group compared with 0.00 in the SHE group (P < 0.001); as for life satisfaction, the difference was not statistically significant. The multivariate analyses identified the study intervention as the main statistically significant negative predictor of PSQI and depression scores, and a positive predictor of life satisfaction. Being in the SHE group was a negative predictor of PSQI and depression scores.

Based on data reported by the manufacturer for Pfzier/BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2, this critical appraisal shows: relative risk reduction, 95.1%; 95% CI, 90.0% to 97.6%; p = 0.016; absolute risk reduction, 0.7%; 95% CI, 0.59% to 0.83%; p < 0.000.

In ARDS lungs without MV support, the mechanisms and evolution of lung tissue deformation remain understudied. In this work, we quantify the progression and heterogeneity of regional strain in injured lungs under spontaneous breathing and under MV. METHODS: Lung injury was induced by lung lavage in murine subjects, followed by 3 h of spontaneous breathing (SB-group) or 3 h of low V(t) mechanical ventilation (MV-group). Micro-CT images were acquired in all subjects at the beginning and at the end of the ventilation stage following induction of lung injury. Regional strain, strain progression and strain heterogeneity were computed from image-based biomechanical analysis. Three-dimensional regional strain maps were constructed, from which a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis was performed for the regional strain, the strain progression, and the strain heterogeneity. RESULTS: After 3 h of ventilation, regional strain levels were significantly higher in 43.7% of the ROIs in the SB-group. Significant increase in regional strain was found in 1.2% of the ROIs in the MV-group. Progression of regional strain was found in 100% of the ROIs in the SB-group, whereas the MV-group displayed strain progression in 1.2% of the ROIs. Progression in regional strain heterogeneity was found in 23.4% of the ROIs in the SB-group, while the MV-group resulted in 4.7% of the ROIs showing significant changes. Deformation progression is concurrent with an increase of non-aerated compartment in SB-group (from 13.3%  1.6% to 37.5%  3.1%), being higher in ventral regions of the lung. CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous breathing in lung injury promotes regional strain and strain heterogeneity progression. In contrast, low V(t) MV prevents regional strain and heterogeneity progression in injured lungs.","output":"Progression of regional lung strain and heterogeneity in lung injury: assessing the evolution under spontaneous breathing and mechanical ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Many aspects of innate immune responses to SARS viruses remain unclear. Of particular interest is the role of emerging neutralizing antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in complement activation and opsonization. To overcome challenges with purified virions, here we introduce pseudovirus-like nanoparticles with 70 copies of functional recombinant RBD to map complement responses. Nanoparticles fix complement in an RBD-dependent manner in sera of all vaccinated, convalescent, and na?ve donors, but vaccinated and convalescent donors with the highest levels of anti-RBD antibodies show significantly higher IgG binding and higher deposition of the third complement protein (C3). The opsonization via anti-RBD antibodies is not an efficient process: on average, each bound antibody promotes binding of less than one C3 molecule. C3 deposition is exclusively through the alternative pathway. C3 molecules bind to protein deposits, but not IgG, on the nanoparticle surface. Lastly, pseudovirus-like nanoparticles promote complement-dependent uptake by granulocytes and monocytes in the blood of vaccinated donors with high anti-RBD titers. Using nanoparticles displaying SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we demonstrate subject-dependent differences in complement opsonization and immune recognition.","output":"Antibody-Dependent Complement Responses toward SARS-CoV-2 Receptor-Binding Domain Immobilized on Pseudovirus-like Nanoparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Germany, the scarcity of donor organs has persisted over decades and reached an historical low point in the year 2017. A thorough analysis of the causes revealed structural deficits in the identification and registration of possible donors as one of the central reasons for the low donation rate. This prompted the political authorities to act and resulted in two new laws, which led to a modification of the German Transplantation Act. On 1 April 2019, the Act on Improvement of the Cooperation and the Structural Framework for Organ Donation came into force. This Act strengthens the role of the transplant coordinators in the harvesting hospitals and establishes adequate reimbursement of the organ donation-related costs in the harvesting hospitals. Furthermore, it fosters the cooperation of the transplant coordinators with the German organ procurement organization. On 16 January 2020, the existing opt-in legislation was modified. While the general principle of the opt-in legislation stayed unchanged, different measures were introduced that aim to repeatedly inform all citizens about organ donation and thereby motivate them to make a decision on organ donation. In order to enable a reliable and transparent documentation an organ donor registry will be established. The practical implementation of the various measures of both Acts is supported by a multi-institutional collaborative initiative plan for organ donation.

The objectives of this study were to compare the antiviral activity between monomeric catechin and dimeric procyanidin B2 (PB2) using cultivable human norovirus surrogates (feline calicivirus (FCV-F9) and murine norovirus (MNV-1)) and to understand their potential antiviral mechanism using virus-like particles (VLPs) and the P domain of human norovirus GII (HNoV GII.4). Surrogate viruses at 5 log PFU/mL were treated with 0.5C5 mg/mL monomeric catechin monohydrate, PB2 or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2; control) at 37 C over 24 h. Infectivity was determined using plaque assays and data from triplicate experiments were statistically analyzed. PB2 at 0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL reduced FCV-F9 to undetectable levels after 3 h and MNV-1 by 0.21 and 1.23 log PFU after 24 h, respectively. Monomeric catechins at 1 mg/mL reduced FCV-F9 to undetectable levels after 6 h and MNV-1 titers to undetectable levels after 24 h. In addition, PB2 was shown to directly bind the P domain, the main capsid structure of HNoVs in the ratio of 1:1 through spontaneous interactions. Electrostatic interactions played a dominant role between PB2 and the P domain. PB2 significantly altered tertiary but not secondary structures of VLPs. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that PB2 aggregated VLPs, further indicating interactions between them. These findings indicate that PB2 causes structural changes of the P domain of VLPs, mainly through direct interaction leading to HNoV inactivation.","output":"Monomeric catechin and dimeric procyanidin B2 against human norovirus surrogates and their physicochemical interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Palliative and end-of-life care in care homes is often inadequate, despite high morbidity and mortality. Residents can experience uncontrolled symptoms, poor quality deaths and avoidable hospitalisations. Care home staff can feel unsupported to look after residents at the end of life. Approaches for improving end-of-life care are often education-focused, do not triage residents and rarely integrate clinical care. This study will adapt an evidence-based approach from Australia for the UK context called Palliative Care Needs Rounds (Needs Rounds). Needs Rounds combine triaging, anticipatory person-centred planning, case-based education and case-conferencing; the Australian studies found that Needs Rounds reduce length of stay in hospital, and improve dying in preferred place of care, and symptoms at the end of life. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This implementation science study will codesign and implement a scalable UK model of Needs Rounds. The Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework will be used to identify contextual barriers and use facilitation to enable successful implementation. Six palliative care teams, working with 4C6 care homes each, will engage in two phases. In phase 1 (February 2021), stakeholder interviews (n=40) will be used to develop a programme theory to meet the primary outcome of identifying what works, for whom in what circumstances for UK Needs Rounds. Subsequently a workshop to codesign UK Needs Rounds will be run. Phase 2 (July 2021) will implement the UK model for a year. Prospective data collection will focus on secondary outcomes regarding hospitalisations, residents quality of death and care home staff capability of adopting a palliative approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Frenchay Research Ethics Committee (287447) approved the study. Findings will be disseminated to policy-makers, care home/palliative care practitioners, residents/relatives and academic audiences.

To better understand the pandemic's influence on pre-medical students' professional trajectories, this study draws on 48 interviews with freshmen and sophomore pre-medical students at a private university in the northeastern United States. For many students, witnessing physicians' role during the pandemic made them more aware of both the vulnerability of physicians and the limits of their power in the medical field and society at large. Notably, students primarily explained the risks that physicians confronted as an individual professional expectation rather than a structural concern in the medical system. Despite acknowledging these risks, students emphasized that the pandemic had reinforced their interest in becoming a physician by validating their perception of the vital role that physicians play in society. Additionally, they expressed greater concern about meeting expectations for admission to medical school in light of additional barriers due to COVID-19. This study builds upon existing literature on the medical profession by both centering earlier stages of education and examining processes of socialization during times of crisis.

Many have speculated on the pathogenesis and clinical characteristics of these disturbances; however, no definite answers have been produced on the topic. With this systematic review, we aimed to collect all the available evidence regarding the prevalence of OGD, the timing of their onset and their resolution, their rate of recovery and their role as diagnostic and prognostic tools for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods: A systematic review comprising all the observational studies that reported the prevalence and/or the longitudinal trajectories of OGD in COVID-19 patients, as self-reported by patients or measured through objective psychophysical tests. Results: After the selection process, 155 studies were included, with a total of 70920 patients and 105291 not-infected individuals. Prevalence reports were extremely variable across studies, with wide ranges for OD (0% - 98%) and GD (0-89%) prevalence. OGD occurred early during the disease course and only rarely preceded other symptoms; out of 30 studies with a follow-up time of at least 20 days, only in 5 studies OGD fully resolved in more than 90% of patients. OGD had low sensitivity and high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accuracy of OD and GD for infection identification was higher than 80% in 10 out of 33 studies and in 8 out of 22 studies considered, respectively. 28 out of 30 studies that studied the association between OGD and disease severity found how OGD were associated with lower rates of severe pneumonia, hospitalization and mortality. Conclusions: OGD seem to be highly prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This subsequently directs sequence-specific, homology dependent, Watson-Crick base-pairing post-transcriptional gene silencing by binding to its complementary RNA and initiating its elimination through degradation or by persuading translational inhibition. In plants, worms, and insects, RNAi is the main and strong antiviral defense mechanism. It is clear that RNAi silencing, contributes in restriction of viral infection in vertebrates.

These negative emotions are strengthened due to the obligatory lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this research is to analyze the loneliness, depression and stress levels among international students, based on the use of social media and the role of the host university. Methods: The research was focused on survey data from international students In a total of 248 valid responses, we collected 171 from female students and 71 from males. 105 students are freshmen, 94 in their second year of study, 27 at the third, 20 at the fourth and 2 students graduated last summer. The dominant nationality is the Dutch (n=62) and Vietnamese (n=37). Results: Previous research indicates association among the use of social media, university satisfaction, and aforementioned emotions. The results indicate strong correlations between anxiety, loneliness, and COVID-19-related stress with university satisfaction, together with social capital.

The core of the paper are transformations of family institutions seen as crucial for family-targeted policy. Design/Methodology/Approach: The article contains a systematic review of previous research on family and family policies in Poland, published in Polish and international literature on the subject, the institutional-legal method (analysis of Polish legal regulations) and the historical method. Findings: A significant increase in the intervention of the Polish state in family matters falls on the period of financial or economic crises (after 2008 and 2020). This situation provides arguments for the thesis that such crises do not have to hamper (pro)social activities of the state or be an obstacle to the continuation and implementation of important social programs It also may indicate an attempt to move away from the increasingly criticized - since the global financial crisis of 2008 - neoliberal model, towards which Poland has been heading since 1989. Practical implications: As one of the post-communist countries and an EU member state, Polands case is special, as it shows that often in spite of difficult systemic or external conditions, the state may increase the scope of its intervention in social issues (including family-related ones) and thus diversify the scope of family policy instruments. changes in the scope of financial (monetary) allowances should be particularly interesting, but also solutions concerning child care leaves or social services for families with young children. Due to the limited scope of this paper, the analyses are not exhaustive, but they should be an important starting point for comparisons of the presented changes in the international context or for future research on the model offamily policy in Poland.","output":"Transformations of State Family Policy in Poland from 1989 to the Pandemic Period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Clinical observership programs have existed for many years as both formal initiatives organized at the institutional or professional society level and informal arrangements between individual physicians and prospective mentors. However, few programs longitudinally assess their impact on patient care and require implementation of a postobservership project to demonstrate learning. In 2018, the Harvard Medical School Office for External Education launched the International Clinical Leaders Observership Program (ICLOP) as an opportunity for midcareer physicians to shadow Harvard Medical School faculty in one of three specialty areas: oncology, cardiology, or diabetology. The culminating activity for each participant was presentation of a capstone project and commitment to implement it on returning home. METHODS We summarize here the initial cohort and results from a follow-up survey measuring the impact of the program on their subsequent patient care, academic activities, and achievements. RESULTS At 1 year of follow-up, 90% of survey respondents had implemented their project. Improvements were reported in areas of clinical, surgical, therapeutic, system, patient education, and team innovation, as well as personal benefits to the participants.

Factors influencing the risk of infection may include the suture material for skin closure, and closure of the subcutaneous fascia. We assessed the effect of skin closure with absorbable versus non-absorbable suture, and closure versus non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia on risk of wound infection following Caesarean section. METHODS Women undergoing caesarean birth at an Adelaide maternity hospital were eligible for recruitment to a randomised trial using a 2  2 factorial design. Women were randomised to either closure or non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia and to subcuticular skin closure with an absorbable or non-absorbable suture. Participants were randomised to each of the two interventions into one of 4 possible groups: Group 1 - non-absorbable skin suture and non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia; Group 2 - absorbable skin suture and non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia; Group 3 - non-absorbable skin suture and closure of the subcutaneous fascia; and Group 4 - absorbable skin suture and closure of the subcutaneous fascia. The primary outcomes were reported wound infection and wound haematoma or seroma within the first 30 days after birth. RESULTS A total of 851 women were recruited and randomised, with 849 women included in the analyses (Group 1: 216 women; Group 2: 212 women; Group 3: 212 women; Group 4: 211 women). In women who underwent fascia closure, there was a statistically significant increase in risk of wound infection within 30 days post-operatively for those who had skin closure with an absorbable suture (Group 4), compared with women who had skin closure with a non-absorbable suture (Group 3) (adjusted RR 2.17; 95% CI 1.05, 4.45; p = 0.035). There was no significant difference in risk of wound infection for absorbable vs non-absorbable sutures in women who did not undergo fascia closure. CONCLUSION The combination of subcutaneous fascia closure and skin closure with an absorbable suture may be associated with an increased risk of reported wound infection after caesarean section.

Genomic technologies are vital for enhancing the understanding and development of intervention approaches against these pathogens, including Ebola and the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DISCUSSION: Africa has contributed few genomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to the global pool in growing open access repositories. To bridge this gap, the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ACDC) is coordinating continent-wide initiatives to establish genomic hubs in selected well-resourced African centres of excellence. This will allow for standardisation and efficient and rapid data generation and curation. However, the strategy to ensure capacity for high-throughput genomics at selected hubs should not overshadow the deployment of portable, field-friendly and technically less demanding genomics technologies in all affected countries. This will enhance small-scale local genomic surveillance in outbreaks, leaving validation and large-scale approaches to be taken at central genomic hubs. CONCLUSION: The ACDC needs to scale-up its campaign for government support across African Union countries to ensure the sustainable financing of its strategy for increased pathogen genomic intelligence and other interventions in current and inevitable future epidemics in Africa.","output":"Translation of genomic epidemiology of infectious pathogens: Enhancing African genomics hubs for outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to mandatory social distancing brought about by COVID-19 and observed inefficiency of the current barcode-based payment systems, there is a pressing need to alleviate the current condition of overcrowding of the cashier area in shops and supermarkets This study proposed a model that primarily aims to shorten queuing time in scanning individual items With the use of a mobile application, shoppers can obtain product information such as prices, discounts, expiration date, nutrition facts, etc through barcodes or QR codes These items are placed in a virtual cart and view the invoice prior to payment This information is sent to the cashier and identified by a transaction ID The cashier scans the transaction ID and deactivates all the RFID associated with the products purchased In case of intentional or unintentional carrying out of unscanned products, the RFID kiosk prompts the shopper either to pay or to return them ? 2020 IEEE","output":"\\"do It Yourself\\" Product Scanning System for Supermarket Customers with Anti-Theft Feature: A Proposed Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapidly expanding cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have exposed vulnerable populations, including pregnant women to an unprecedented public health crisis Recent data show that pregnancy in COVID-19 patients is associated with increased hospitalization, admission of the intensive care unit, and intubation However, very few resources exist to guide the multidisciplinary team in managing critically ill pregnant women with COVID-19 We report our experience with managing a morbidly obese pregnant woman at 36 weeks' gestation with history of asthma and malignancy who presented with persistent respiratory symptoms at an outside hospital after being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Early in the course of the hospitalization, patient received remdesivir, convalescent plasma, bronchodilator, systemic steroids, and IV heparin for COVID-19 and concomitant asthma exacerbation and pulmonary embolism Due to increasing oxygen requirements, she was eventually intubated and transferred to our institution for higher level of care Respiratory acidosis, severe hypoxemia, and vent asynchrony were managed with vent setting adjustment and paralytics After 12 hours from spontaneous rupture of her membranes and with stabilization of maternal status, patient underwent a term cesarean delivery for nonreassuring fetal heart tracing The neonate was discharged on the 2nd day of life, while the patient was extubated on the 6th postpartum day and was discharged to acute inpatient rehabilitation facility on the 19th hospital day This report highlights the disease progression of COVID-19 in a pregnant woman, the clinical challenges in the critical care aspect of patient management, and the proposed multidisciplinary strategies utilizing an algorithmic approach to optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Case Reports in Critical Care is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Severe COVID-19 in Third Trimester Pregnancy: Multidisciplinary Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Economics is inextricably linked with HIV/AIDS.

The different etiologies require different management strategies. Thus, understanding detailed of the etiologies of urticaria in children would help pediatricians to perform appropriate initial treatment. METHODS: A cross-sectional epidemiological study of all patients aged under 18-year-old with the diagnosis of urticaria from any causes entered in the emergency department during January 1st, 2016 to December 31st, 2019 by collecting the data from the Health Object Program?, an authorized electronic medical records program, at the Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Thailand. RESULTS: There were total of 515 urticaria patients aged under 18 years old at the emergency department. The ages of patients ranged from 8 months to 18 years with a median age of 7 years (IQR 3.17-12.08). The majority of the patients were in the preschool-aged group (40.97%), followed by the school-aged (28.16%), adolescent (22.14%), and infant (8.74%). Six major etiologic categories were identified in the present study. The most common cause of urticaria was infection (51.26%), followed by idiopathic urticaria (34.37%), inhalants (6.99%), drugs (4.08%), foods (2.52%), and insect stings (0.78%). CONCLUSIONS: Having underlying allergic diseases had a strong association with all identified causes of urticaria in the study population, of which, food and inhalation etiologies had a significant difference when compared to the other identified causes. The present study has found that infection was the most common cause of acute urticaria in children. This etiology (infection-induced urticaria) usually presents concurrent with fever, however, non-febrile symptoms were also presented. Therefore, in the pediatric population, pediatricians should always look for infection as the cause of urticaria even in patients without pyrexia.","output":"Etiological and predictive factors of pediatric urticaria in an emergency context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter describes the factors involved in the disease prognosis, parameters of outcome evaluations, principles and techniques for progression prevention. In last section, the future perspectives in both basic and clinical investigations towards unmet medical needs in AECHB and HBV ACLF are discussed. 1. Factors affecting the prognosis of patients with severe hepatitis B include those related to the virus (including viral load, HBeAg expression, and gene mutation), patient age, co-morbidity, TBil, INR, serum Cr, and the host genetic background. Indicators associated with patient prognosis include TBil, total cholesterol, albumin and prealbumin, hepatic encephalopathy, kidney damage, alpha-fetoprotein and vitamin D binding protein, blood sodium level, virus HBeAg expression and genotype, and blood glucose. 2. In addition to TBil, INR, hepatic encephalopathy, Cr level and AFP as indicators for prognosis of severe hepatitis, some other parameters such as clinical signs, symptoms, serum levels of total cholesterol and albumin and natrium, and coagulation factors are all valuable in assessment. The roles of cell apoptosis, liver regeneration and immunological parameters in assessing patient prognosis are under study. Prognostic evaluating systems include MELD score, MELD-Na score, iMELD score, KCI and CTP score. 3. Prevention of severe hepatitis B should be started in asymptomatic patients. Close observation, sufficient rest, adequate nutrition, meticulous nursing and psychological care, preventing and removing exacerbating factors, treating concomitant diseases, reasonable antiviral and comprehensive therapies are helpful to prevent CHB patients from developing to severe hepatitis. For patients who already have severe hepatitis B, the prevention and management of complications is important for lowering mortality rate. 4. New research directions in acute-on-chronic liver failure include: (1) Additional well controlled studies using present or new liver systems are warranted. Other approaches include the use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor to treat infections as well as the potential of use of stem cells to restore immune integrity and enhance liver regeneration. (2) Using new cell lines and animal models to understand the molecular biology of HBV, the immune response and to develop novel therapies.

STUDY DESIGN: Multi-institutional retrospective analysis of resident surgical case logs. SETTING: Accredited residency training programs in otolaryngology head and neck surgery. METHODS: Resident surgical case logs were combined from 6 residency training programs from different regions of the United States. Case volumes were compared between the calendar year before March 1, 2020, and the year afterward. Subgroup analyses were performed for the type of hospital (university, pediatric, veteran, county) and the key index cases by subspecialty. RESULTS: All 6 participating residency programs had a decrease in resident operative case volume. Surgical volume decreased from a mean of 6014 to 4161 (P < .05). There were decreases observed in key index cases in every subspecialty (P < .01), without statistical differences seen among subspecialties. There were decreases observed in every hospital type (university, pediatric, veteran, county) without statistical differences among types. Postgraduate year 5 residents were the most affected by volume reductions (51.6%), and postgraduate year 3 residents were the least affected (1.4%). CONCLUSION: In the year following initiation of COVID-19-related restrictions, there was a significant decrease in trainee surgical case volumes within residencies for otolaryngology-head and neck surgery.

SARS-CoV-2 is a Betacoronavirus, one of four genera belonging to the Coronaviridae subfamily Orthocoronavirinae. Coronaviridae, in turn, are members of the order Nidovirales, a group of enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses. Here we present a systematic phylogenetic and evolutionary study based on protein domain architecture, encompassing the entire proteomes of all Orthocoronavirinae, as well as other Nidovirales. This analysis has revealed that the genomic evolution of Nidovirales is associated with extensive gains and losses of protein domains. In Orthocoronavirinae, the sections of the genomes that show the largest divergence in protein domains are found in the proteins encoded in the amino-terminal end of the polyprotein (PP1ab), the spike protein (S), and many of the accessory proteins. The diversity among the accessory proteins is particularly striking, as each subgenus possesses a set of accessory proteins that is almost entirely specific to that subgenus. The only notable exception to this is ORF3b, which is present and orthologous over all Alphacoronaviruses. In contrast, the membrane protein (M), envelope small membrane protein (E), nucleoprotein (N), as well as proteins encoded in the central and carboxy-terminal end of PP1ab (such as the 3C-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and Helicase) show stable domain architectures across all Orthocoronavirinae.

By leveraging edge computing with the 5G RAN, management of epidemic diseases such as COVID-19 can be conducted efficiently. Deploying a hierarchical edge computing architecture offers several benefits such as scalability, low latency, and privacy for the data and the training model, which enables analysis of COVID-19 by a local trusted edge server. However, existing deep learning (DL) algorithms suffer from two crucial drawbacks: first, the training requires a large COVID-19 dataset on various dimensions, which is difficult for any local authority to manage. Second, the DL results require ethical approval and explanations from healthcare providers and other stakeholders in order to be accepted. In this article, we propose a B5G framework that supports COVID-19 diagnosis, leveraging the low-latency, high-bandwidth features of the 5G network at the edge. Our framework employs a distributed DL paradigm where each COVID-19 edge employs its own local DL framework and uses a three-phase reconciliation with the global DL framework. The local DL model runs on edge nodes while the global DL model runs on a cloud environment. The training of a local DL model is performed with the dataset available from the edge; it is applied to the global model after receiving approval from the subject matter experts at the edge. Our framework adds semantics to existing DL models so that human domain experts on COVID-19 can gain insight and semantic visualization of the key decision-making activities that take place within the deep learning ecosystem.

Methods: We compared genetically predicted circulating nitric oxide, proxied by three relevant NOS3 functional variants (rs2070744, rs1799983 and rs3918226), and genetically predicted platelets, proxied by a functional variant related to platelet reactivity from GRK5 (rs10886430) and by platelet count (based on 243 variants), because they share a phenotype, in people with severe COVID-19 with the general population (cases=536, non-cases=329,391) largely based on studies from Northern Europe. We made a similar comparison for any COVID-19.

The tissue specificity for this regulatory module appears to be localized exclusively to renal proximal tubules. Gross deletion of these segments in mice has severe consequences on skeletal health, and directly affects Cyp27b1 expression in the kidney. Deletion of both the M1 and M21 submodules together almost completely eliminates basal Cyp27b1 expression in the kidney, creating a renal specific pseudo\\\\null mouse, resulting in a systemic and skeletal phenotype similar to that of the Cyp27b1\\\\KO mouse caused by high levels of both 25\\\\hydroxyvitamin D(3) [25(OH)D(3)] and PTH and depletion of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Cyp24a1 levels in the double KO mouse also decrease because of compensatory downregulation of the gene by elevated PTH and reduced FGF23 that is mediated by an intergenic module located downstream of the Cyp24a1 gene. Outside of the kidney in nonrenal target cells (NRTCs), expression of Cyp27b1 in these mutant mice was unaffected. Dietary normalization of calcium, phosphate, PTH, and FGF23 rescues the aberrant phenotype of this mouse and normalizes the skeleton. In addition, both the high levels of 25(OH)D(3) were reduced and the low levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) were fully eliminated in these mutant mice as a result of the rescue\\\\induced normalization of renal Cyp24a1.

This study aimed to present long-term clinical results of POEM over 10 years and evaluate the technique and outcomes at the institution where it was first used in clinical settings. Patients and methods Questionnaire-based surveys were sent to patients who received POEM in our institution from September 2008 to May 2010. Patient demographics and procedural outcomes and open-ended questions were posed about the postoperative courses, including symptom improvement and recurrence, additional treatments, and post-POEM gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. Achalasia symptoms and post-POEM GERD symptoms were evaluated with Eckhardt scores and GerdQ systems, respectively. Results Thirty-six consecutive POEMs were performed in that period and 10-year follow-up data were obtained from 15 patients (41.7 %). Although four cases (26.7 %) required additional pneumatic balloon dilatation (PBD), reduction in post-Eckardt scores were observed in 14 cases (93.3 %). GerdQ score was positive in one patient (6.7 %). Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) were taken by four patients (26.7 %) and their symptoms were well-controlled.

The burden of COVID-19 varies between and within countries due to differences in contextual and individual factors, transmission rates, and clinical and public health interventions. Objectives: To identify high-risk areas, between April and October, on a weekly basis and at the municipality level, and to assess the temporal evolution of COVID-19, considering municipalities classified by incidence levels. Methods: This is an ecological study following a 3-step approach, i.e., (1) calculation of the relative risk (RR) of the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases, weekly, per municipality, using a spatial scan analysis;(2) classification of the municipalities according to the European Centre for Disease Control incidence categorization on November 19;and (3) characterization of RR temporal evolution by incidence groups. Results: Between April and October, the mean RR was 0.53, with a SD of 1.44, varying between 0 and 46.4. Globally, the north and Lisbon and Tagus Valley (LVT) area were the regions with the highest number of municipalities with a RR above 3.2. In April and beginning of May, most of the municipalities with an RR above 3.2 were from the north, while between May and August most municipalities with an RR above 3.2 were from LVT area. Comparing the incidence in November and retrospectively analyzing the RR showed the huge variation, with municipalities with an RR of 0 at a certain time classified as extremely high in November. Conclusions: Our results showed considerable variation in RR over time and space, with no consistent \\"better\\"or \\"worst\\"municipality. In addition to the several factors that influence COVID-19 transmission dynamics, there were some outbreaks over time and throughout the country and this may contribute to explaining the observed variation. Over time, on a weekly basis, it is important to identify critical areas allowing tailored and timely interventions in order to control outbreaks in early stages. ? 2021 S. Karger AG.

This study aims to provide evidence of the importance of governance by spirits as a prerequisite for protecting biophysical resources. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and observation. The respondents were selected through a purposive sampling approach. The author also attended a funeral that was held at one of the SNS discussed in this article. The collected data were analysed through a thematic content analysis. The study shows that, for biodiversity to be protected, there should be a good relationship between humankind and the spirits. The spirits place behavioural demands on humankind involving the performance of rituals. Ritual behaviour empowers the spirits to be placed as owner of SNS and to guard against intruders. In return, humankind receives blessings, protection, patronage and governance. The governance by spirits is complemented by traditional practices.

It has caused various health problems to majority of countries in the world. Several researchers have examined and developed studies regarding concerns on air pollution being considered a major risk factor causing respiratory infections. Such infections are carried out by microorganisms, thus further affecting the immune system. The present study involves the relationship between air pollutants and the total COVID-19 infections along with the estimation of death rates in several regions of Saudi Arabia. The major goal of this study comprises the analysis of the relationship between air pollutants concentration, such as PM10, NO(2), CO, SO(2), and O(3), and the widespread outbreak of COVID-19. This scenario involves the transmission, number of patients, critical cases, and death rates. Results show that the estimation of recorded COVID-19 cases was in the most polluted regions; the mortality rate and critical cases were also more distinct in these regions than in other regions in Saudi Arabia. The finding of this study demonstrates a positive correlation between the mean values of PM10, NO(2), CO, and SO(2) pollutants. The results represent the significant relationship between air pollution resulting from a high concentration of NO(2) and COVID-19 infections and deaths. In addition, a null hypothesis of the relation between other pollutants and COVID-19 infections cannot be rejected. The study also indicates a significant correlation between the means of NO(2) and CO and the total number of critical cases. Negative correlations are obtained between the mean of O(3) and the total number of cases, total deaths, and critical case per cumulative days.

Despite the pandemic is raging in most parts of the world, in a few countries COVID-19 epidemics subsided due to successful implementations of intervention measures. A unifying perspective of the beginnings, middle stages, and endings of such completed COVID-19 epidemics is developed based on the order parameter and eigenvalue concepts of nonlinear physics, in general, and synergetics, in particular. To this end, a standard susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model is used. It is shown that COVID-19 epidemic outbreaks follow a suitably defined SEIR order parameter. Intervention measures switch the eigenvalue of the order parameter from a positive to a negative value, and in doing so, stabilize the COVID-19 disease-free state. The subsiding of COVID-19 epidemics eventually follows the remnant of the order parameter of the infection dynamical system. These considerations are illustrated for the COVID-19 epidemic in Thailand from January to May 2020. The decay of effective contact rates throughout the three epidemic stages is demonstrated. Evidence for the sign-switching of the dominant eigenvalue is given and the order parameter and its stage-3 remnant are identified.

The present study aimed to investigate behavioral patterns in the online health-related searches and Cyberchondria (CYB) during the COVID-19 pandemic time, in order to explore socio-demographic and psychopathological factors related to CYB. Methods: During the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, a cross-sectional online survey collected the main socio-demographic variables and habits related to Internet use of 572 participants. CYB was measured by the Cyberchondria Severity Scale-Short Version and different psychopathological factors were measured by specific questionnaires: the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Short Health Anxiety Inventory, the Meta-Cognitions about Health Questionnaire, the Internet Addiction Test, the Maudsley Obsessional-Compulsive Questionnaire-Short Version, the Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale, and the WHO Quality of Life-BREF. Descriptives, non-parametric ANOVAs, and Spearman correlations were performed. Results: In the present sample, the Internet was the main source participants used to search for health-related information and nearly one-third increased this habit during the pandemic. Higher expression of CYB emerged in females, in younger participants, in students, and in those suffering from a physical/psychiatric illness. CYB showed a positive correlation with different phenomenology of anxiety (i.e., anxiety about COVID-19, health anxiety, general anxiety, metacognitive believes about anxiety) and with depression, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and problematic usage of the Internet. Conversely, quality of life and self-esteem showed a negative correlation with CYB. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of the Internet for health-related information and CYB contribute to the psychological stress affecting individuals and society.

There are four identified factors that puts one at high-risk for infection and/or mortality creating a disparity: age, comorbidities, race/ethnicity, and gender. Data indicate that the older a person is, and/or the presence of obesity and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease place one at higher risk for COVID-19. In the United States, specific race/ethnicities, particularly African Americans and Native Americans, are strong COVID-19 risk components. Male gender has also emerged as a severity risk factor. For age and racial/ethnicities, the accumulation of health comorbidities are common precipitating mechanisms. In particular, underlying socioeconomic structures in the United States likely drive development of comorbidities, putting affected populations at higher risk for severe COVID-19. Sudden cardiac death triggered by a common sodium channel variant in African Americans with COVID-19 has not been evaluated as a cause for racial disparity. There is no evidence that racial/ethnic differences for COVID-19 are caused by ABO blood groups, use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or from amino acid substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There is growing evidence that androgen-enabled expression of ACE2 receptors and the serine protease TMPRSS2, two permissive elements engaging the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for infection, may contribute to severe COVID-19 in men.

Sampling methods included convenience, online panels, and population-representative. Primary outcomes included sexual behaviors, partner violence, and SRH service utilization, and we compared three months prior to and three months after policy measures to mitigate COVID-19. We used established indicators and analyses pre-specified in our protocol. We conducted meta-analyses for primary outcomes and graded the certainty of the evidence using Cochrane methods. Descriptive analyses included 22,724 individuals in 25 countries. Five additional countries with sample sizes <200 were included in descriptive meta-analyses. ResultsRespondents were mean age 34 years; most identified as women (15160; 66.7%), cis-gender (19432; 86.6%) and heterosexual (16592; 77.9%). Among 4546 respondents with casual partners, condom use stayed the same for 3374 (74.4%) people and 640 (14.1%) people reported a decline. Fewer respondents reported physical or sexual partner violence during COVID-19 measures (1063/15144, 7.0%) compared to the period before COVID-19 measures (1469/15887, 9.3%). COVID-19 measures impeded access to condoms (933/10790, 8.7%), contraceptives (610/8175, 7.5%), and HIV/STI testing (750/1965, 30.7%). Pooled estimates from meta-analysis indicate during COVID-19 measures, 32.3% (95% CI 23.9-42.1) of people needing HIV/STI testing had hindered access, 4.4% (95% CI 3.4-5.4) experienced partner violence, and 5.8% (95% CI 5.4-8.2) decreased casual partner condom use (moderate certainty of evidence for each outcome).

Although the antileishmanial activity of amentoflavone has already been reported in vitro, the mechanisms involved in the parasite death, as well as its action in vivo, remain unknown. Amentoflavone demonstrated activity on intracellular amastigotes in macrophages obtained from BALB/c mice (IC(50) 2.3  0.93 M). No cytotoxicity was observed and the selectivity index was estimated as greater than 10. Using BALB/c mice infected with L. amazonensis we verified the effect of an intralesional treatment with amentoflavone (0.05 mg/kg/dose, in a total of 5 doses every 4 days). Parasite quantification demonstrated that amentoflavone reduced the parasite load in treated footpads (46.3% reduction by limiting dilution assay and 56.5% reduction by Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction). Amentoflavone decreased the nitric oxide production in peritoneal macrophages obtained from treated animals. The treatment also increased the expression of ferritin and decreased iNOS expression at the site of infection. Furthemore, it increased the production of ROS in peritoneal macrophages infected in vitro. The increase of ROS in vitro, associated with the reduction of NO and iNOS expression in vivo, points to the antioxidant/prooxidant potential of amentoflavone, which may play an important role in the balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory patterns at the infection site.

Respondents who were unemployed, compared with those who were employed, forwent care more often (121 of 186 respondents [65%] vs 251 of 503 respondents [50%]; P = .01) and were more likely to attribute forgone care to fear of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (78 of 186 respondents [42%] vs 120 of 503 respondents [24%]; P = .002) and financial concerns (36 of 186 respondents [20%] vs 28 of 503 respondents [6%]; P = .001). Respondents lacking health insurance were more likely to attribute forgone care to financial concerns than respondents with Medicare or commercial coverage (19 of 88 respondents [22%] vs 32 of 768 respondents [4%]; P < .001). Frequency of and reasons for forgone care differed in some instances by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and health status. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This survey study found a high frequency of forgone care among US adults from March to mid-July 2020. Policies to improve health care affordability and to reassure individuals that they can safely seek care may be necessary with surging COVID-19 case rates.","output":"Reports of Forgone Medical Care Among US Adults During the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article analyses how physical activity reinforces each of the dimensions (mental, physical, social, etc.) of the health-related quality of life concept.

The empirical part was based on data obtained from a cross-sectional survey carried out in the Casablanca neighbourhood (Zaragoza, Spain). The sample comprised 1083 participants aged between 25 and 84 years residing in the three residential areas of this neighbourhood: Vi?edo Viejo, Las Nieves and Fuentes Claras. These three areas exhibit significant socio-economic differences in their population.

The main results obtained from the descriptive statistics and regression systems were added. Playing a sport or undertaking some physical activity brings many health benefits, both physical and mental. The educational level and area of residence affect this relationship, such that the effects of physical activity are greater for those residents of Casablanca who have a higher educational level and/or live in more favoured areas of this neighbourhood.

Few existing models have the potential to be extensively used by healthcare providers in low-resource settings since many require laboratory and imaging predictors. Therefore, we sought to develop and validate a multivariable prediction model of death in Mexican patients with COVID-19, by using demographic and patient history predictors. We conducted a national retrospective cohort study in two different sets of patients from the Mexican COVID-19 Epidemiologic Surveillance Study. Patients with a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and complete unduplicated data were eligible. In total, 83 779 patients were included to develop the scoring system through a multivariable Cox regression model; 100 000, to validate the model. Eight predictors (age, sex, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, immunosuppression, hypertension, obesity and chronic kidney disease) were included in the scoring system called PH-Covid19 (range of values: ?2 to 25 points). The predictive model has a discrimination of death of 0.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.796C0.804).

In several recent studies, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been demonstrated to be the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2 as it was previously well known as the receptor of SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 can bind with high affinity to human ACE2 and engages it as an entry receptor. It seems that the genetic, notably epigenetic variations of ACE2 are less known in different populations, indicating the need for its further investigation. These variations have the potential to affect its contribution to the pathogenicity of COVID-19. The contribution of epigenetics in the interindividual variability of ACE2 merits more attention because epigenetic processes can play important roles in ACE2 alterations in various tissues and different people and populations. Analyzing different DNA methylation patterns and microRNAs, contributing to the ACE2 modulation in the lungs will have a high priority. The epigenetic and genetic variations of ACE2 become even more important when considering that some people have mild clinical symptoms despite having COVID-19. The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is complex; therefore, a better understanding of the underlying pathobiology, especially binding the virus to its receptors, could help improve therapeutic and preventive approaches.

The regular practice of physical activity (PA) is a time cue that decreased during SDIST. However, it is unknown if decreased PA may be associated with increase of eveningness preference. This study aimed to investigate if PA changes might be associated with changes in the morningness-eveningness preference of individuals practicing SDIST in Brazil. For this, 322 adults (18-89 years-old) regularly living in Brazil between March and October 2020 answered an online survey including questions considering the before and during SDIST period on PA (min/week) and morningness-eveningness questionnaire score. Sociodemographic, SDIST, anthropometric, and health characteristics were also included in the online survey.

One of these variants, first identified in the United Kingdom, B.1.1.7 (also called VUI202012/01), contains eight Spike mutations with potential to impact antibody therapy, vaccine efficacy and risk of reinfection. Here we employed a lentivirus-based pseudovirus assay to show that variant B.1.1.7 remains sensitive to neutralization, albeit at moderately reduced levels (~2-fold), by serum samples from convalescent individuals and recipients of two different vaccines based on ancestral Spike: mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and protein nanoparticle NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax). Some monoclonal antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike were less effective against the variant while others were largely unaffected.

Consequently, there has never been a more important time for clinicians to engage patients in advance care planning (ACP) discussions about their goals, values, and preferences in the event of critical illness. An evidence-based communication tool-the Serious Illness Conversation Guide-was adapted to address COVID-related ACP challenges using a user-centered design process: convening relevant experts to propose initial guide adaptations; soliciting feedback from key clinical stakeholders from multiple disciplines and geographic regions; and iteratively testing language with patient actors. With feedback focused on sharing risk about COVID-19-related critical illness, recommendations for treatment decisions, and use of person-centered language, the team also developed conversation guides for inpatient and outpatient use. These tools consist of open-ended questions to elicit perception of risk, goals, and care preferences in the event of critical illness, and language to convey prognostic uncertainty. To support use of these tools, publicly available implementation materials were also developed for clinicians to effectively engage high-risk patients and overcome challenges related to the changed communication context, including video demonstrations, telehealth communication tips, and step-by-step approaches to identifying high-risk patients and documenting conversation findings in the electronic health record. Well-designed communication tools and implementation strategies can equip clinicians to foster connection with patients and promote shared decision making.

Consequently, the development of an appropriate technological solution to address the current challenge of reconfiguring common physical environments with prescribed physical distancing measures is much needed. To do this, we propose a design optimization methodology which takes the dimensions, as well as the constraints and other necessary requirements of a given physical space to yield optimal redesign solutions on the go. The methodology we propose here utilizes the solution to the well-known mathematical circle packing problem, which we define as a constrained mathematical optimization problem. The resulting optimization problem is solved subject to a given set of parameters and constraints C corresponding to the requirements on the social distancing criteria between people and the imposed constraints on the physical spaces such as the position of doors, windows, walkways and the variables related to the indoor airflow pattern. Thus, given the dimensions of a physical space and other essential requirements, the solution resulting from the automated optimization algorithm can suggest an optimal set of redesign solutions from which a user can pick the most feasible option.

These telehealth visits facilitated care that would have otherwise been unavailable to employees. Patients reported that the appointments were helpful, addressed their concerns, and provided a safe method to see their doctor. Regular interprofessional teamwork and relations between the clinic operator and client company were key contributors to operationalizing this service in our integrated healthcare environment.

These reductions were not explained by changes in the community rates. However, the one case-control study reported odds ratio favouring no eye protection (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.99, 3.0). The high heterogeneity between studies precluded any meaningful meta-analysis. None of the studies adjusted for potential confounders such as other protective behaviours, thus increasing the risk of bias, and decreasing the certainty of evidence to very low. InterpretationCurrent studies suggest that eye protection may play a role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers. However, robust comparative trials are needed to clearly determine effectiveness of eye protections and wearability issues in both healthcare and general populations. FundingThere was no funding source for this study. All authors had full access to all data and agreed to final manuscript to be submitted for publication.","output":"The effect of eye protection on SARS-CoV-2 transmission: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Oncotype Dx (ODx) is a genomic assay which estimates the risk of distant recurrence and predicts adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in early stage breast cancer patients. Most ODx data is derived from excisional specimens. AIM: We assess the utility of ODx on core needle biopsies (CNB) and measure its impact on neoadjuvant treatment decisions, particularly in patients with clinically complicated situations. METHODS: Consecutive ODx results on breast CNBs with invasive carcinoma from 2012-2020 at 3 tertiary care hospitals with dedicated Breast Health Centers were reviewed. Clinical indications to perform ODx on CNB were recorded through a review of patients electronic medical records. Clinicopathologic features, surgical or oncologic modalities and follow-up data were recorded. RESULTS: Three distinct clinical indications for performing ODx on CNB in 85 ER+ invasive breast carcinomas were identified: 1) Excisions with insufficient tissue to perform ODx, 2) adjudicate neoadjuvant therapy versus primary surgical resection, and 3) select neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) versus neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET). Primary surgery was selected in patients with low score RS (<18), and NET was preferred in patients with intermediate or high RS (>18). NET was preferred over NAC in patients with low RS (<18). CONCLUSION: This study shows that CNB ODx RS helps guide treatment decisions in a neoadjuvant setting along with other contributing factors such as the presence of pathogenic mutations, node positivity, patient age, and comorbidities. The use of ODx on CNB is furthermore valuable in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic for early breast cancer patients to administer effective therapy in a timely manner.","output":"How Does Invasive Breast Cancer Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score on Core Needle Biopsies Influence Neoadjuvant Treatment Decision?

We evaluated the effect of cryopreservation of grafts on allogeneic transplant outcomes using related, unrelated and haploidentical donors, including 958 patients, age 18-74 years (median 55) and using PBSC for various hematologic malignancies. Fresh grafts were received by 648 (68%) patients, 310 (32%) received cryopreserved. There was no difference between fresh versus cryopreserved grafts for neutrophil engraftment (p=0.09), platelet engraftment (p=0.11), graft failure (5.6% versus 6.8%, p=0.46) and grade II-IV acute GVHD (p=0.71), moderate/severe chronic GVHD was observed in 176 (27%) versus 123 (40%) patients, respectively (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated no difference between fresh versus cryopreserved for OS (p=0.39) and CIR (p=0.08) while fresh grafts demonstrated borderline increased NRM (HR 1.27, 95%CI 1.02-1.59, p=0.04). Of note, for patients with no or mild chronic GVHD, CIR was less for fresh compared to cryopreserved (HR=0.67 for fresh, 95% CI 0.48-0.92, p=0.01). We conclude there were no differences in engraftment and survival between fresh and cryopreserved grafts for allogeneic HCT, thus establishing cryopreservation to be a safe option for allogeneic HCT.

Its 2060 carbon neutrality goal will require coal-fired electricity generation to shrink dramatically, with or without carbon capture and storage technology. Two macroeconomic areas in which the socioeconomic impact of this decline is felt are losses in jobs and tax revenues supported by thermal coal mining, transport and power generation. At the national level, under a baseline (B) scenario consistent with Chinas carbon neutrality goal, labour productivity growth in coal mining implies that significant job losses will occur nationally in the medium term, even if all coal plants continue operating as planned. Jobs supported by the coal power industry would decline from an estimated 2.7 million in 2021, to 1.44 million in 2035 and 94,000 in 2050, with jobs losses from mining alone expected to exceed 1.1 million by 2035. Tax revenues from thermal coal would total approximately CNY 300 billion annually from 2021C2030, peaking in 2023 at CNY 340 billion. This is significantly less than estimated subsidies of at least CNY 480 billion, suggesting coal is likely a net fiscal drain on Chinas public finances, even without accounting for the costs of local pollution and the social cost of carbon. As coal plant retirements accelerate, from 2034 onwards, fiscal revenues begin to fall more rapidly, with rates of decline rising from 1% in the 2020s to over 10% a year by the 2040s. More aggressive climate policy and technology scenarios bring job and tax losses forward in time, while a No Transition policy, in which all currently planned coal plants are built, delays but does not ultimately prevent these losses. At the provincial level, Chinas major coal-producing provinces will likely face challenges in managing the localised effects of expected job losses and finding productive alternative uses for this labour. Governments of coal-producing provinces like Inner Mongolia, with an industry highly dependent on exports to other provinces, are more exposed than others to declining tax revenues from coal, and more insulated from job losses, given their high current degree of labour efficiency. Although their provincial revenues are likely to remain stable until the early 2030s under the B scenario, the possibility of increasing policy stringency underlines the need for revenue and skill base diversification. At the firm level, Chinas Big Five state-owned power companies were responsible for over 40% of both jobs and tax revenues in 2021. The number of jobs supported by the activities of each of the largest ten firms, with one exception, will decline by 71C84% by the early 2040s, with the tax contribution of each declining by 43C69% in the same period.","output":"Estimating the Employment and Fiscal Consequences of Thermal Coal Phase-Out in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, implementation and development of whole slide scanning lead to an active growth of digital pathology and image analysis (IA). In the present study, we retrospectively conducted a global evaluation of three Breast cancer markers: ER, PR and Ki67 with the aim to study the correlation between pathologist conventional semi quantitative scoring method on glass and scanned slides versus artificial intelligence-based IA. Methods: Study samples were scored independently either by five independent pathologists on scanned images and glass slides, or using supervised IA algorithms (IA results validated by pathologists). The readout for the three markers was the percentage of tumor positives stained cells. The correlation between the pathologist evaluation on glass slides versus scanned images was calculated using Pearsons correlation coefficient. Pathologists evaluations and IA results were compared using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Additionally, the average time spent by the pathologist per sample was measured for each evaluation method. Results: The correlation of pathologist evaluation between glass slide and scanned image showed a Pearsons correlation coefficient  0.90 for each marker. The ICC between IA algorithm and pathologist was on average over 0.8 for the three markers, showing a good agreement between the different scoring method. However, some challenges were identified related to the detection of tumor area that needed some additional pathologist review for specific complex cases. Overall, time required by the pathologist for a complete evaluation decreased by roughly 3 times when supported by image analysis tools. Conclusions: Based on the Pearsons correlation coefficient and the ICC results, we observe an equivalence in the pathologist conventional scoring (Image or glass slides) and the use of IA. In an era where regulations are still being discussed for the use of algorithm by the FDA (AI-Based or not), we can mitigate regulatory requirements by having pathologists reviewing the results of a digital analysis. We conclude here to a benefit from the combination of pathologist evaluation and IA in terms of time with at least equivalent results in terms of accuracy.

At time of writing, positive detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains the only method for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. Rapid upscaling of national SARS-CoV-2 genome testing presented challenges: 1) Unpredictable supply chains of reagents and kits for virus inactivation, RNA extraction and PCR-detection of viral genomes 2) Rapid time to result of <24 hours is required in order to facilitate timely infection control measures. We evaluated whether alternative commercially available kits provided sensitivity and accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 genome detection comparable to those used by regional National Healthcare Services (NHS), and asked if detection was altered by heat inactivation, an approach for rapid one-step viral inactivation and RNA extraction without chemicals or kits. Using purified RNA, we found the CerTest VIASURE kit to be comparable to Altona RealStar system currently in use, and further showed that both diagnostic kits performed similarly in the BioRad CFX96 and Roche LightCycler 480 II machines. Additionally, both kits were comparable to a third alternative using a combination of Quantabio qScript 1-step qRT-PCR mix and CDC-accredited N1 and N2 primer/probes when looking specifically at borderline samples. Importantly, when using the kits in an extraction-free protocol, following heat inactivation, we saw differing results, with the combined Quantabio-CDC assay showing superior accuracy and sensitivity. In particular, detection using the CDC N2 probe following the extraction-free protocol was highly correlated to results generated with the same probe following RNA extraction and reported clinically (n=127; R2=0.9259). Our results demonstrate that sample treatment can greatly affect the downstream performance of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic kits, with varying impact depending on the kit. We also showed that one-step heat inactivation methods could reduce time from swab receipt to outcome of test result. Combined, these findings present alternatives to the protocols in use and can serve to alleviate any arising supply chain issues at different points in the workflow, whilst accelerating testing, and reducing cost and environmental impact.","output":"Comparative effects of viral transport medium heat inactivation upon downstream SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1094 (LINC01094) plays a vital role in the oncogenicity of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. However, its expression profile and detailed roles in glioblastoma (GBM) remain unknown. In this study, we mainly investigated the expression and roles of LINC01094 in GBM and focused on the mechanism by which LINC01094 regulates the malignant characteristics of GBM. Patients and Methods LINC01094 expression in GBM was determined with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo of GBM cells were evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometry analysis, migration assay, invasion assay, and tumor xenograft models, respectively. Results LINC01094 was overexpressed in GBM tissues and cell lines. Moreover, increased LINC01094 expression was associated with adverse clinicopathological parameters in patients with GBM. Loss of LINC01094 inhibited GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; promoted cell apoptosis; and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Mechanically, LINC01094 functioned as a molecular sponge for microRNA-577 (miR-577) and consequently enhanced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in GBM cells. Both miR-577 inhibition and BDNF expression enhancement reversed LINC01094 deficiency-mediated inhibition of malignant processes in GBM cells. Conclusion Our results verified the involvement of the LINC01094/miR-577/BDNF pathway in GBM cells and its enhancing effects on the aggressive behaviors of GBM cells in vitro and in vivo. This pathway may be a novel and promising focus for the future development of targeted therapies for GBM.","output":"Long Intergenic Non-Protein Coding RNA 1094 Promotes Initiation and Progression of Glioblastoma by Promoting microRNA-577-Regulated Stabilization of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In two speech production experiments, we investigated the link between phonetic variation and the scope of advance planning at the word form encoding stage. We examined cases where a word has, in addition to the pronunciation of the word in isolation, a context-specific pronunciation variant that appears only when the following word includes specific sounds. To the extent that the speaker uses the variant specific to the following context, we can infer that the phonological content of the upcoming word is included in the current planning scope. We hypothesize that the time alignment between selection of the phonetic variant in the currently-being-encoded word and retrieval of segmental details of the upcoming word is variable from moment to moment depending on current task demands and the dynamics of lexical access for each word involved. The results showed that the use of a context-sensitive phonetic variant of /t/ (flapping) by English speakers reliably increased under conditions which favor advance planning. Our hypothesis was supported by evidence compatible with its three key predictions: an increase in flapping in phrases with a higher frequency following word, more flapping in a procedure with a response delay relative to a speeded response, and an attenuation of the following word frequency effect with delayed responses. This reveals that within speakers, the degree of advance planning varies continuously from moment to moment, reflecting (in part) the accessibility of form properties of individual words in the utterance.","output":"Variable pronunciations reveal dynamic intra-speaker variation in speech planning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The utilization management of laboratory tests in a large community hospital is similar to academic and smaller community hospitals.

In this study, we used an online survey to assess the mediation effect of resilience and self-efficacy on the overall psychological well-being of Lebanese people during the crises of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Beirut explosion. Methods: Overall, 567 Lebanese people participated in an online survey between March 17C28, 2021. The survey included the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 items (SAVE-6), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), ConnorCDavidson Resilience Scale-2 items, WHO-5 Well-being Index, General Self-Efficacy scale, and a single item on insomnia. We also assessed their risk perception regarding exposure to COVID-19 or explosions. Results: About 53% of participants were assessed as having depression (PHQ-9  10) in the recent crisis. About half of participants (53.2%) reported feeling more stressed by COVID-19 than by the Beirut explosion, and 23.4% felt more stressed by the Beirut explosion than by COVID-19. Only the SAVE-6 score differed significantly between groups with greater stress responses to COVID-19 and the Beirut explosion. Self-efficacy mediated the influence of depression on people's psychological well-being, and self-efficacy and resilience mediated the influence of viral anxiety on psychological well-being.

Here, using anonymous and privacy-enhanced cell phone data from Italy, we investigate the determinants of spatial variations of reductions in mobility and co-location in response to the adoption and the lift of restrictions, considering both provinces and city neighbourhoods. In large urban areas, our analysis uncovers the desertification of historic city centres, which persisted after the end of the lockdown.

Understanding outcomes of such children will help risk-stratify and guide optimisation prior to congenital heart surgery. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to determine whether convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 children undergoing congenital heart surgery have any worse mortality or post-operative outcomes. DESIGN: Consecutive children undergoing congenital heart surgery from Oct 2020 to May 2021 were enrolled after testing for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or rapid antigen test and immunoglobulin G antibody prior to surgery. Convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 was defined in any asymptomatic patient positive for immunoglobulin G antibodies and negative for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or rapid antigen test anytime 6 weeks prior to surgery. Control patients were negative for any of the three tests. Mortality and post-operative outcomes were compared among the groups. RESULTS: One thousand one hundred and twenty-nine consecutive congenital heart surgeries were stratified as convalescence and control. Coronavirus disease 2019 Convalescent (n = 349) and coronavirus disease 2019 control (n = 780) groups were comparable for all demographic and clinical factors except younger and smaller kids in control. Convalescent children had no higher mortality, ventilation duration, ICU and hospital stay, no higher support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, high flow nasal cannula, no higher need for re-intubations, re-admissions, and no higher infections as central line-associated bloodstream infection, sternal site infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia on comparison with coronavirus disease 2019 control children.

Together with SFSV NSs, eIF2B exhibits normal nucleotide exchange activity even in the presence of eIF2(P). A genome-wide ribosome profiling analysis clarified that SFSV NSs in human cultured cells attenuates the ISR. Furthermore, SFSV NSs exhibited neuroprotective effects against the ISR-inducing stress.

The new data often differs from the previously seen data due to a domain shift, that is, a change of the input-target distribution. While several methods perform well on small domain shifts like new target classes with similar inputs, larger domain shifts are still challenging. Large domain shifts may result in high-level concepts that are not shared between the original and the new domain. However, low-level concepts like edges in images might still be shared and useful. For cross-domain few-shot learning, we suggest representation fusion to unify different abstraction levels of a deep neural network into one representation. We propose Cross-domain Hebbian Ensemble Few-shot learning (CHEF), which achieves representation fusion by an ensemble of Hebbian learners acting on different layers of a deep neural network that was trained on the original domain. On the few-shot datasets miniImagenet and tieredImagenet, where the domain shift is small, CHEF is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. On cross-domain few-shot benchmark challenges with larger domain shifts, CHEF establishes novel state-of-the-art results in all categories. We further apply CHEF on a real-world cross-domain application in drug discovery. We consider a domain shift from bioactive molecules to environmental chemicals and drugs with twelve associated toxicity prediction tasks. On these tasks, that are highly relevant for computational drug discovery, CHEF significantly outperforms all its competitors.

MATERIALS & METHODS The records of the patients who underwent our modified laparoscopic partial nephrectomy technique were evaluated retrospectively. The patients' medical records, including tumor complexity calculated via R.E.N.A.L nephrometry scores, operation time, estimated blood loss, blood transfusions, hospital stay, pre- and postoperative serum creatinine levels, complications via the Clavien classification system, pathological status of surgical margin, and follow-up times, were documented. RESULTS The data of 55 patients with 58 renal units were evaluated. Almost all tumors were in the low complex group (91%), with a mean size of 31.74  7.38 mm (range: 12-46 mm). Mean operation time, estimated blood loss, and transfusion rates were 138.62  38.45 minutes (range: 90-240 min), 242.24  107.12 mL (range: 100-500 mL), and 19%, respectively. The hemoglobin level decreased by a mean of 2.05  0.87 g/dL.

Some argue that animal experiments are essential to medical progress, while others believe that this practice is unethical and does not produce results that can be reliably translated to people. A growing range of modern techniques can replace the use of animals and provide results that are more relevant to human patients. These include the use of human cells and tissues, and computer-based methods. Our work aimed to explore the societal benefits of accelerating the replacement of animals with these new research methods. We found that this approach would benefit animal welfare, public health and the economy. We also found that the British public is generally in favor of efforts to replace animals, and that focusing on this area would help to support the British Governments policy and economic goals. We suggest that the British Government could greatly expedite the replacement of animal experiments by appointing a new minister to take responsibility for this transition.In the context of widespread public and political concern around the use of animals in research, we sought to examine the scientific, ethical and economic arguments around the replacement of animals with New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) and to situate this within a regulatory context. We also analyzed the extent to which animal replacement aligns with British public and policymakers priorities and explored global progress towards this outcome. The global context is especially relevant given the international nature of regulatory guidance on the safety testing of new medicines. We used a range of evidence to analyze this area, including scientific papers;expert economic analysis;public opinion polls and the Hansard of the UK Parliament. We found evidence indicating that replacing animals with NAMs would benefit animal welfare, public health and the economy. The majority of the British public is in favor of efforts to replace animals and focusing on this area would help to support the British Governments current policy priorities. We believe that this evidence underlines the need for strong action from policymakers to accelerate the transition from animal experiments to NAMs. The specific measure we suggest is to introduce a new ministerial position to coordinate and accelerate the replacement of animals with NAMs.","output":"Modernizing Medical Research to Benefit People and Animals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Automated contact tracing is a key solution to control the spread of airborne transmittable diseases: it traces contacts among individuals in order to alert people about their potential risk of being infected. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic put a heavy strain on the healthcare system of many countries. Governments chose different approaches to face the spread of the virus and the contact tracing apps were considered the most effective ones. In particular, by leveraging on the Bluetooth Low-Energy technology, mobile apps allow to achieve a privacy-preserving contact tracing of citizens. While researchers proposed several contact tracing approaches, each government developed its own national contact tracing app. In this paper, we demonstrate that many popular contact tracing apps (e.g., the ones promoted by the Italian, French, Swiss government) are vulnerable to relay attacks. Through such attacks people might get misleadingly diagnosed as positive to SARS-CoV-2, thus being enforced to quarantine and eventually leading to a breakdown of the healthcare system. To tackle this vulnerability, we propose a novel and lightweight solution that prevents relay attacks, while providing the same privacy-preserving features as the current approaches. To evaluate the feasibility of both the relay attack and our novel defence mechanism, we developed a proof of concept against the Italian contact tracing app (i.e., Immuni). The design of our defence allows it to be integrated into any contact tracing app.","output":"Contact Tracing Made Un-relay-able"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No abstract.","output":"Indirect and Potential Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Public Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In data analytics, missing data is a factor that degrades performance.

Safe and efficacious COVID-19 antivirals are needed urgently. Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332), the first orally bioavailable, SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor against the coronaviridae family, has demonstrated potent preclinical antiviral activity and benign safety profile. Methods: We report safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data of nirmatrelvir with and without ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, from an accelerated randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 study . Two interleaving single-ascending dose (SAD) cohorts were evaluated in a 3-period crossover. Multiple-ascending dose (MAD) with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir twice daily (BID) dosing was evaluated over 10 days in 5 parallel cohorts. Safety was assessed, including in a supratherapeutic exposure cohort. Dose and dosing regimen for clinical efficacy evaluation in phase 2/3 clinical trials were supported by integrating modelling and simulations of SAD/MAD data with nonclinical data and a quantitative systems pharmacology model (QSP). Results: In SAD, MAD, and supratherapeutic exposure cohorts, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was safe and well tolerated. Nirmatrelvir exposure and half-life were considerably increased by ritonavir, enabling selection of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir dose and regimen for phase 2/3 trials (300/100 mg BID), to achieve concentrations continuously above those required for 90% inhibition of viral replication in vitro. The QSP model suggested that a 5-day regimen would significantly decrease viral load in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and prevent development of severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Conclusions: An innovative and seamless trial design expedited establishment of phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, enabling high confidence in phase 2/3 dose selection and accelerated pivotal trials initiation.

Physiotherapists, like other rehabilitation professionals, have been involved in this crisis. One way to protect both the clients and physiotherapists from getting infected and provide physiotherapy services effectively is tele-physiotherapy (TPT). This study investigated the physiotherapists' perception of TPT and the barriers to its practical application during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive study was adopted in December 2020, using a newly designed checklist. The checklist had four sections, consisting of physiotherapists' knowledge and awareness, satisfaction, attitude, and also barriers to the use of TPT during the COVID-19 outbreak. The checklist was uploaded to social physiotherapy networks across Iran, and the descriptive data were analyzed statistically. Results: In this study, 192 physiotherapists participated as follows. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, 48.96% of the participants used TPT, while this rate grew to 64.06% during the outbreak. The majority of the participants (65.1%) believed that the use of TPT would improve the relationship among the physiotherapists and their patients. They also had the lowest level of knowledge (27.08%) about one item in the checklist, i.e., how to consult with TPT. Based on the participants' views, lack of proper familiarity with the use of this method (87.5%), a lack of high-speed internet access (86.45 %), and a lack of awareness of this method and its benefits (84.37%) had the highest frequencies compared to other barriers. Conclusion: The results indicate that during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran, a significant increase in the use of TPT has developed. The overall physiotherapists' attitude towards TPT was positive, but it was necessary to minimize or eliminate the barriers to applying this effective method. Major recommendations from the participants were: continue to seek physiotherapists' and patients' perspectives, introduce proper educational programs for new students enrolled in professional associations and universities, and support the infrastructures, such as telecommunication and financial assistance from insurance companies. ? 2022 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

By extending from 45% to 90% of invoicing-items the application of the current general VAT-rate of 19%, about 2% of GPD could be raised;the use of more progressive income-tax rates and lowering the level of application of the current wealth-tax on households would increase tax collections in about 0.5% of GDP;and, finally, the reversion of some tax-exemptions recently granted to firms (under Law 2010 of 2019) could increase tax-revenue by 1.2% of GDP.Perhaps the best form to impulse this tax-reform is to envision it as an instrument to improve not only the debt sustainability of Colombia, but as an efficient instrument to improve income equality and to provide better formal opportunities for a labor market facing open unemployment at double-digit rates.","output":"Proposal of Tax-Reform for Colombia (2021-2022)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"B-cell epitopes play a key role in stimulating B-cells, triggering the primary immune response which results in antibody production as well as the establishment of long-term immunity in the form of memory cells.

Vitamin D has garnered interest since it is known to modulate immune function and vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased risk of respiratory infections and adverse health outcomes in severely ill patients. There are no population representative data on the direct relationship between vitamin D status and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection risk and severity of COVID-19. Data from intervention studies are limited to four studies. Here we summarise findings regarding vitamin D status and metabolism and their alterations during severe illness, relevant to COVID-19 patients. Further, we summarise vitamin D intervention studies with respiratory disease outcomes and in critically ill patients and provide an overview of relevant patient and population guidelines. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in hospitalised patients, particularly when critically ill, including those with COVID-19. Acute and critical illness leads to pronounced changes in vitamin D metabolism and status, suggestive of increased requirements. This needs to be considered in the interpretation of potential links between vitamin D status and disease risk and severity and for patient management. There is some evidence that vitamin D supplementation decreases the risk of respiratory tract infections, while supplementation of intensive care unit patients has shown little effect on disease severity or length of treatment. Considering the high prevalence of deficiency and low risks associated with supplementation, pro-actively applying current population and patient management guidelines to prevent, monitor and correct vitamin D deficiency is appropriate.","output":"Vitamin D and acute and severe illness - a mechanistic and pharmacokinetic perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2020 will be remembered a battle for existence of mankind against a super spreading virus Covid-19.

COVID-19 Symptoms: Feve ? shortness of breath Medication:  Clinical Procedure:  Specialty: Hematology ? Infectious Diseases OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a newly emerging disease that is not yet fully understood. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus that is easily transmitted from human to human through the respiratory route. Usually, it presents with fever, headache, fatigue accompanied by respiratory symptoms like cough and dyspnea, and other systemic involvements. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common lymphoproliferative neoplasm characterized by absolute lymphocytosis and demonstration of clonality unlike other causes of lymphocytosis. Patients with CLL are considered immunocompromised because of impaired humoral immunity (mainly) and cellular immunity. Therefore, they are vulnerable to various infections including COVID-19. Little is known about the COVID-19 infection when it unmasks CLL. CASE REPORT: A 49-year-old man with no significant previous illnesses, and an unremarkable family history, presented with a moderate COVID-19 infection. He initially presented to the emergency department with fever and mild shortness of breath. A complete blood count showed a high white blood cell count with absolute lymphocytosis. Flow cytometry revealed the clonality of the lymphocytes confirming the diagnosis of CLL. Despite having CLL, he developed a moderate COVID-19 infection and recovered in a few days. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CLL, which presented with a COVID-19 infection as the initial presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocytosis is an unexpected finding in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and the elevated lymphocytes may be indicative of other conditions.

In December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread worldwide. While diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure are the main features of COVID-19, other organs may be involved, and the incidence of AKI is not well described. We assessed the incidence and clinical characteristics of AKI in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and its effects on clinical outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, observational study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to two general hospitals in Wuhan from 5 January 2020 to 21 March 2020. Demographic data and information on organ dysfunction were collected daily. AKI was defined according to the KDIGO clinical practice guidelines. Early and late AKI were defined as AKI occurring within 72 h after admission or after 72 h, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 116 patients, AKI developed in 21 (18.1%) patients. Among them, early and late AKI were found in 13 (11.2%) and 8 (6.9%) patients, respectively. Compared with patients without AKI, patients with AKI had more severe organ dysfunction, as indicated by a higher level of disease severity status, higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score on admission, an increased prevalence of shock, and a higher level of respiratory support. Patients with AKI had a higher SOFA score on admission (4.5  2.1 vs. 2.8  1.4, OR 1.498, 95% CI 1.047-2.143 ) and greater hospital mortality (57.1% vs. 12.6%, OR 3.998, 95% CI 1.088-14.613) than patients without AKI in both the univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients with late AKI, but not those with early AKI, had a significantly prolonged length of stay (19.6 vs. 9.6 days, p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Our findings show that admission SOFA score was an independent risk factor for AKI in COVID-19 patients, and patients with AKI had higher in-hospital mortality. Moreover, AKI development after 72 h of admission was related to prolonged hospitalization time.","output":"Acute Kidney Injury in Patients with the Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Multicenter Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical epidemiology, the basic science for clinical medicine(1), has changed substantially over the last fifty years, moving its focus from clinician driven research and clinical settings to large cohorts and trials, NIH funding, and practice guidelines.

Addressing these challenges reunited clinicians and researchers in collaborative efforts to inform decisions about disease risk, prevention, prognosis and treatment, at least in part because of the shared sense of the need to ration scarce resources, the rapid evolution of understanding of the clinical syndrome, the recognition of widespread uncertainty, and the emphasis on the common good over individual credit.

We compared the prevalence of brain injury between patients undergoing venoarterial and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. DATA SOURCES PubMed and six other databases from inception to April 2020. STUDY SELECTION Observational studies and randomized clinical trials in adult patients undergoing venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation reporting brain injury. DATA EXTRACTION Two independent reviewers extracted the data from the studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to pool data. DATA SYNTHESIS Seventy-three studies (n = 16,063) met inclusion criteria encompassing 8,211 patients (51.2%) undergoing venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and 7,842 (48.8%) undergoing venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients had more overall brain injury compared with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (19% vs 10%; p = 0.002). Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients had more ischemic stroke (10% vs 1%; p < 0.001), hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (13% vs 1%; p < 0.001), and brain death (11% vs 1%; p = 0.001). In contrast, rates of intracerebral hemorrhage (6% vs 8%; p = 0.35) did not differ. Survival was lower in venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (48%) than venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (64%) (p < 0.001). After excluding studies that included extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation, no significant difference was seen in the rate of overall acute brain injury between venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (13% vs 10%; p = 0.4). However, ischemic stroke (10% vs 1%; p < 0.001), hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (7% vs 1%; p = 0.02), and brain death (9% vs 1%; p = 0.005) remained more frequent in nonextracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation compared with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS Brain injury was more common in venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation compared with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. While ischemic brain injury was more common in venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients, the rates of intracranial hemorrhage were similar between venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

The European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) aimed to evaluate surgeons experiences and perspectives, to identify gaps in knowledge, to record shortcomings in resources and to register research priorities. METHODS: An ad hoc web-based survey of EAES members and affiliates was developed by the EAES Research Committee. The questionnaire consisted of 69 items divided into the following sections: () demographics, (II) institutional burdens and management strategies, and (III) analysis of resource, knowledge, and evidence gaps. Descriptive statistics were summarized as frequencies, medians, ranges,, and interquartile ranges, as appropriate. RESULTS: The survey took place between March 25th and April 16th with a total of 550 surgeons from 79 countries. Eighty-one percent had to postpone elective cases or suspend their practice and 35% assumed roles not related to their primary expertise. One-fourth of respondents reported having encountered abdominal pathologies in COVID-19-positive patients, most frequently acute appendicitis (47% of respondents). The effect of protective measures in surgical or endoscopic procedures on infected patients, the effect of endoscopic surgery on infected patients, and the infectivity of positive patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery were prioritized as knowledge gaps and research priorities. CONCLUSIONS: Perspectives and priorities of EAES members in the era of the pandemic are hereto summarized.

Objective The review intended to examine the relationship of COVID-19 infections in individuals to lost expression of CD28 on naive CD4+/CD8+-mediated, vaccine-specific, neutralizing antibody responses. Design The research team performed a narrative review by searching eight databases: Medline, Elsevier, Cochrane, PubMed, Google Scholar, Mendeley, and Springer Nature. The search used the following key terms: SARS CoV-2, clinical aspects and pathology of SARS CoV-2, involvement of viral spike (S) protein in SARS CoV-2, immunological changes in COVID-19 infection, basic overview of CD28 immuno-molecule ligand, reduction of vaccine therapeutic efficacy in COVID-19 infection, and immunomodulatory response of lost CD28 ligand. Setting This study was done in a Maharishi Arvind College of Pharmacy, Jaipur, India. Results In COVID-19 patients, particularly those with severe disease, had increased levels of IL-2 or IL-2R. Given IL-2's supportive role in the expansion and differentiation of T cells, the authors exhibiting that lymphopenia, particularly in severe COVID-19, could be attributed to nonfunctional and dysfunctional differentiation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as a result of low CD28 immuno-molecule expression on naive T cells. Conclusions The literature review found that independent, early immunological prognostic markers for a poor prognosis, in addition to higher levels of IL-6, include a substantial proportion of large inflammatory monocytes and a small proportion of chronic CD28+ CD4+T cells. The current findings suggest that a combination of COVID-19 vaccination with SARS CoV-2-reactive naive T cells with the CD28 immune-molecule may be a viable method for establishing T-cell-based, adaptive cellular immunotherapy against COVID-19 infection.

This program addresses the need for an agile testing strategy during the current pandemic. We disclose the number of patients evaluated as \\"persons under investigation\\" (PUI) and the proportion with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) results from these sites. We describe how the programs were applied to patient care and include considerations on how additional staffing, scalability, and flexibility of these services may be applied to future patient and healthcare crises. METHODS: This is a descriptive report of the implementation of MIH/CP test sites in our healthcare system's early response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Retrospective data on the number of patients and their associated demographics are reported here as raw data. No statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Between March 15, 2020 and April 15, 2020, our six MIH/CP test sites evaluated 4342 patients. Of these, 401 patients (9.2%) had test results positive, 62.8% of whom were women.

The paramedics were able to perform a brief history, specific physical examination, and screening for signs of hypoxemic respiratory failure. There were no cases of accidental exposure or failure of PPE for the MIH/CP paramedics. CONCLUSIONS: In our healthcare system, we pivoted the traditional MIH/CP model to rapidly initiate remote drive-through testing for COVID-19 in pre-screened individuals.

A possible solution in this setting is telemedicine (TM). AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the utilisation and provider perceptions of TM in rheumatology in Queensland and explore the challenges faced when using TM before and during COVID-19. METHODS: A sequential mixed-methods study design was used. Rheumatologists completed a questionnaire on demographics, clinical practice, TM uptake, models of care and clinician perceptions of TM. The qualitative phase utilised purposeful sampling of active users of TM through in-depth semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: Thirty rheumatologists participated with 76.7% identifying as active TM users. Use of TM was limited prior to COVID-19 with 80.9% seeing less than 5 patients per week. Patient populations served by TM included capital city (53.3%), regional (63.3%) and rural/remote (23.3%). Most rheumatologists prescribed conventional or biologic disease modifying agents (90% and 55%) through TM consultations. Barriers to TM use included low confidence in joint assessments, limited distribution of technology, access to administrative and peripheral clinical staff and lack of financial incentives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant expansion of TM via telephone calls occurred and rheumatologists reported low confidence and satisfaction with this model. CONCLUSIONS: Familiarity with TM exists in this rheumatologist cohort, however its use in routine practise is limited due to multiple barriers.

Using kinetic labeling experiments, we show that the full-length and subgenomic-length replicative form RNAs rapidly accumulate and then saturate with label, suggesting that the subgenomic-length negative strands are the principal mediators of positive-strand synthesis. Using cycloheximide, which preferentially inhibits negative-strand and to a lesser extent positive-strand synthesis, we demonstrate that cycloheximide treatment equally inhibits full-length and subgenomic-length negative-strand synthesis.

Some RASs can be termed as complete, having renin and ACE involved in the biosynthesis of angiotensin II peptide, i.e. in a renin and/or ACE-dependent manner which is exemplified in the circulating RAS. On the other hand, some RAS can be termed as partial, having alternate enzymes to renin and ACE, such as chymase and ACE2 (see Section 4.3, Chapter 4) available for the generation of angiotensin II and other bioactive angiotensin peptides in the biosynthetic cascade, i.e. in a renin and/or ACE-independent manner. Complete vs. partial RASs can be exemplified in the so-called intrinsic angiotensin-generating system or local RAS; for example, a local and functional RAS with renin and ACE-dependent but a renin-independent pathway have been indentified in the pancreas and carotid body, respectively. In the past two decades, local RASs have gained increasing recognition especially with regards to their clinical importance. Distinct from the circulating RAS, these functional local RASs exist in such diverse tissues and organs as the pancreas, liver, intestine, heart, kidney, vasculature, carotid body, and adipose, as well as the nervous, reproductive, and digestive systems.

Due to the use of small and homogeneous cohorts of participants, it is uncertain whether the findings reported in those studies generalize to a broader population of individuals with the MDD symptoms. In the present study, we examined the relationship between overall severity of the depressive symptoms, as assessed by the eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ - 8), and median daily home stay over the two weeks preceding the completion of a questionnaire in individuals with MDD. We used questionnaire and geolocation data of 164 participants collected in the observational Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse - Major Depressive Disorder (RADAR - MDD) study. Participant age and severity of the MDD symptoms were found to be significantly related to home stay, with older and more severely affected individuals spending more time at home. The association between home stay and symptom severity appeared to be stronger on weekdays than on weekends. Furthermore, we found a significant modulation of home stay by occupational status, with employment reducing home stay.

Forkhead box protein P1 (Foxp1) is a large multi-domain transcriptional regulator belonging to the Fox family with winged helix DNA-binding protein, which plays critical roles in cardiovascular homeostasis and disorders. The broad distribution of Foxp1 and alternative splicing isoforms implicate its distinct functions in diverse cardiac and vascular cells and tissue types. Foxp1 is essential for diverse biological processes and has been shown to regulate cellular proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, fibrosis, angiogenesis, cardiovascular remodeling, and dysfunction. Notably, both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches have defined critical roles of Foxp1 in CVD. Genetic deletion of Foxp1 results in pathological cardiac remodeling, exacerbation of atherosclerotic lesion formation, prolonged occlusive thrombus formation, severe cardiac defects, and embryo death. In contrast, activation of Foxp1 performs a wide range of physiological effects, including cell growth, hypertrophy, differentiation, angiogenesis, and cardiac development. More importantly, Foxp1 exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects in controlling coronary thrombus formation and myocardial infarction (MI). Thus, targeting for Foxp1 signaling has emerged as a pre-warning biomarker and a novel therapeutic approach against progression of CVD, and an increased understanding of cardiovascular actions of the Foxp1 signaling will help to develop effective interventions.

Based on the real-time COVID-19 datasets by prefecture-level cities and date, this paper is aimed at exploring the multifractal scaling in spatial diffusion pattern of COVID-19 pandemic and its evolution characteristics in Chinese mainland. The ArcGIS technology and box-counting method are employed to extract spatial data and the least square calculation is used to calculate fractal parameters. The results show multifractal distribution of COVID-19 pandemic in China. The generalized correlation dimension spectrums are inverse S-shaped curves, but the fractal dimension values significantly exceeds the Euclidean dimension of embedding space when moment order q<<0. The local singularity spectrums are asymmetric unimodal curves, which slant to right. The fractal dimension growth curves are shown as quasi S-shaped curves. From these spectrums and growth curves, the main conclusions can be drawn as follows. First, self-similar patterns developed in the process of Covid-19 pandemic, which seem be dominated by multi-scaling law. Second, the spatial pattern of COVID-19 across China can be characterized by global clustering with local disordered diffusion. Third, the spatial diffusion process of COVID-19 in China experienced four stages, i.e., initial stage, the rapid diffusion stage, the hierarchical diffusion stage, and finally the contraction stage.

A hexasaccharide composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S repeating units was identified as the minimal binding epitope. Surface plasmon resonance showed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with a much higher affinity to heparin (KD = 55 nM) compared to the RBD (KD = 1 M) alone. It was also found that heparin does not interfere in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding or proteolytic processing of the spike. However, exogenous administered heparin or a highly sulfated HS oligosaccharide inhibited RBD binding to cells. Furthermore, an enzymatic removal of HS proteoglycan from physiological relevant tissue resulted in a loss of RBD binding. The data support a model in which HS functions as the point of initial attachment allowing the virus to travel through the glycocalyx by low-affinity high-avidity interactions to reach the cell membrane, where it can engage with ACE2 for cell entry.

Recent cases with prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA have been successively reported and the phenomenon of false-negative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or repositive was also described in patients with COVID-19. Case presentation A 69-year-old female with hypertension, total hysterectomy for hysteromyoma and suspected lung tumor presented with moderate COVID-19 symptoms was testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR when she travelled from USA to China. The patient required second and third re-hospitalization due to repositive SARS-CoV-2 test results of throat swaps during post-charge solitary isolation and observation. The serum SARS-CoV-2-IgG decayed rapidly and disappeared on illness day 139 when the throat swab was still positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Finally the virus shedding lasted at least146 days (the last positive test result of throat swap on illness day 146 and the first true-negative test result on illness day 151) from her initial positive test. Conclusions: Prolonged viral shedding of SARS-CoV RNA is prone to occur in an immunocompromised host. With the change of host immune status, SARS-CoV-2 detection can be repeatedly positive. The SARS-CoV-2-IgG may decrease rapidly and disappear before the virus removal, indicating there may be certain limitations on the protective effect of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 which deserves attention of clinicians.","output":"A Case of Prolonged Shedding of SARS-Cov-2 with Rapid Decay of IgG Antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several human pathologies including neurological, cardiac, infectious, cancerous, and metabolic diseases have been associated with altered mitochondria morphodynamics.

Biochemical analyses reveal that Mito-C is a member of a new class of heterocyclic compounds that target the NEET protein family, previously reported to regulate mitochondrial iron and ROS homeostasis. One of the NEET proteins, NAF-1, is identified as an important regulator of mitochondria morphodynamics that facilitates recruitment of DRP1 to the ER-mitochondria interface. Consistent with the observation that certain viruses modulate mitochondrial morphogenesis as a necessary part of their replication cycle, Mito-C counteracts dengue virus-induced mitochondrial network hyperfusion and represses viral replication. The newly identified chemical class including Mito-C is of therapeutic relevance for pathologies where altered mitochondria dynamics is part of disease etiology and NEET proteins are highlighted as important therapeutic targets in anti-viral research.","output":"Chemical targeting of NEET proteins reveals their function in mitochondrial morphodynamics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected many behaviours and aspects of society.

Tunicamycin completely inhibited the production of infectious virus particles and significantly reduced the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into viral glycoproteins. In the presence of monensin, reduced amounts of infectious virus particles were produced, which was mainly due to inhibition of virus release, rather than virus production. Monensin only slightly inhibited viral glycoprotein synthesis. The effects of these compounds on infectivity indicated that glycosylation is required for the production of infectious virus, though complete processing of the glycoproteins is not essential. In addition, egress of the virions from infected cells probably requires a functional Golgi complex. In the presence of tunicamycin or monensin various degrees of glycosylation of the major glycoproteins occurred, consequently their rates of migration differed from that of the normal glycoproteins. Tunicamycin completely blocked glycosylation of GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7. In contrast, GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b were partially glycosyaated in the presence of tunicamycin. These results indicated that GVP 6/11a/16 and GVP 7 are N-linked glycoproteins, but GVP 3/9 and GVP 11b contain both N- and O-linked oligosaccharide side chains. Tunicamycin blocked the transport of all viral glycoproteins to the cell surface, suggesting that glycosylation is required for this process. In the presence of monensin, the viral glycoproteins were transported and expressed on the cell surface indicating that transport does not require complete processing of the glycoproteins and may occur via a Golgi-independent pathway. In addition, monensin-treated BHV-1 infected cells could act as target cells in an antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity assay. Thus, complete glycosylation may not be essential for maintenance of antigenicity and participation in immune destruction.","output":"Effect of tunicamycin and monensin on biosynthesis, transport, and maturation of bovine herpesvirus type-1 glycoproteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has created unprecedented medical challenges. There remains a need for validated risk prediction models to assess short-term mortality risk among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a 7-day and 14-day mortality risk prediction model for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study with a separate multicenter cohort for external validation using two hospitals in New York, NY, and 9 hospitals in Massachusetts, respectively. A total of 664 patients in NY and 265 patients with COVID-19 in Massachusetts, hospitalized from March to April 2020. RESULTS: We developed a risk model consisting of patient age, hypoxia severity, mean arterial pressure and presence of kidney dysfunction at hospital presentation. Multivariable regression model was based on risk factors selected from univariable and Chi-squared automatic interaction detection analyses. Validation was by receiver operating characteristic curve (discrimination) and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit (GOF) test (calibration). In internal cross-validation, prediction of 7-day mortality had an AUC of 0.86 (95%CI 0.74-0.98; GOF p = 0.744); while 14-day had an AUC of 0.83 (95%CI 0.69-0.97; GOF p = 0.588). External validation was achieved using 265 patients from an outside cohort and confirmed 7- and 14-day mortality prediction performance with an AUC of 0.85 (95%CI 0.78-0.92; GOF p = 0.340) and 0.83 (95%CI 0.76-0.89; GOF p = 0.471) respectively, along with excellent calibration. Retrospective data collection, short follow-up time, and development in COVID-19 epicenter may limit model generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-AID risk tool is a well-calibrated model that demonstrates accuracy in the prediction of both 7-day and 14-day mortality risk among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. This prediction score could assist with resource utilization, patient and caregiver education, and provide a risk stratification instrument for future research trials.","output":"Development and external validation of a prediction risk model for short-term mortality among hospitalized U.S. COVID-19 patients: A proposal for the COVID-AID risk tool"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Visit the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center where our experts help to advance understanding of the virus, inform the public, and brief policymakers in order to guide a response, improve care, and save lives","output":"Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"the NOVEL (COVID-19) coronavirus has recently grown into a pandemic in the world due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARSCoV-2) According to studies in this area, about 34, 440, 235 people are infected with COVID-19, 1, 023, 430 is the number of deaths, and around 25, 633, 956 patients are being subjected to treatment worldwide In this paper researchers used five pre-trained models They are: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, AlexNet, VGG11, and SqueezeNetV-1 0 DTL (deep transfer learning) is used to diagnose the NOVEL (COVID-19) by training the COVID-19 coronavirus dataset with 32-batch size and 25 epochs In training, ResNet-50 gives the best value in loss rate (0 22) with an accuracy of 93 2%, whereas, VGG11 showed the worst value (0 38) Also, in validation, the results showed that ResNet-50 (0 28) is the best, and VGG11 achieved (0 39) as the worst value ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Covid-19 Diagnosis Based on CT Images Using Pre-Trained Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This book answers the following general question: when it comes to the impact of socio-economic status (SES) on student results in the context of the so-called Nordic model, what can we learn from large-scale international student assessments?

As the pandemic has continued to evolve over a period of several months, many cases of unusual presentations are now emerging, which pose a greater challenge for physicians in terms of quickly identifying COVID-19 patients based on initial signs and symptoms. In this report, we present one such unusual presentation in a patient with sudden intraperitoneal hemorrhage and spontaneous splenic rupture with COVID-19 as the likely etiology and contributing factor. The patient was a 75-year-old Caucasian woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of severe left-sided abdominal pain for several days without any preceding trauma. A CT of the abdomen/pelvis revealed a large amount of fluid in the abdomen, which raised suspicion of bleeding. An exploratory laparotomy revealed splenic rupture with hemoperitoneum, and the patient subsequently underwent an emergent splenectomy. The patient's COVID-19 antigen test returned positive during the surgery and was subsequently confirmed with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. COVID-19 has been found to result primarily in respiratory symptoms through its ability to invade endothelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 affinity. It is speculated that this mechanism may cause a predisposition to micro-thromboses, which can eventually lead to manifestations such as large lymphoid organ thrombosis.

Our study was performed aiming to determine the predictors that contributed to unfavorable clinical efficacy among patients with DLS after LIF according to the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. METHODS: A total of 157 patients with single-segment DLS were recruited and performed LIF in our hospital from January 1, 2015 to October 1, 2020. Postoperative functional evaluation, including ODI and VAS were, performed, and endpoint events were defined as significant relief of symptom in the short term (2 weeks postoperatively) and long term (1 year postoperatively). General patient information and radiological data were selected and analyzed for statistical relationships with the endpoint events. The SVM method was used to establish the predictive model. RESULTS: Among the 157 consecutive patients, a postoperative unfavorable clinical outcome was reported in 26 patients (16.6%) for a short-term cohort and nine patients (5.7%) for a long-term cohort. Based on univariate and multivariate regression analysis, increased disc height (DH), enlarged facet angle (FA), and raised lateral listhesis (LLS) grade were confirmed as the risk factors that hindered patients' short-term functional recovery. Furthermore, long-term functional recovery was significantly associated with DH alone. In combination with the SVM method, a prediction model with consistent and superior predictive performance was achieved with average and maximum areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88 and 0.96 in the short-term cohort, and 0.78 and 0.82 in the long-term cohort.

In response to this crisis, governments and humanitarian organizations worldwide have mobilized targeted social assistance programs2. Targeting is a central challenge in the administration of these programs: given available data, how does one rapidly identify the individuals and families with the greatest need3? This challenge is particularly acute in the large number of LMICs that lack recent and comprehensive data on household income and wealth4C6. Here we show that non-traditional big data from satellites and mobile phone networks can improve the targeting of anti-poverty programs. Our approach uses traditional survey-based measures of consumption and wealth to train machine learning algorithms that recognize patterns of poverty in non-traditional data;the trained algorithms are then used to prioritize aid to the poorest regions and mobile subscribers. We evaluate this approach by studying Novissi, Togos flagship emergency cash transfer program, which used these algorithms to determine eligibility for a rural assistance program that disbursed millions of dollars in COVID-19 relief aid. Our analysis compares outcomes C including exclusion errors, total social welfare, and measures of fairness C under different targeting regimes. Relative to the geographic targeting options considered by the Government of Togo at the time, the machine learning approach reduces errors of exclusion by 4-21%. Relative to methods that require a comprehensive social registry (a hypothetical exercise;no such registry exists in Togo), the machine learning approach increases exclusion errors by 9-35%.

However, through a series of remote sensing algorithm optimizations from spectral calibration to retrieval, we successfully retrieved global gaseous pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), and formaldehyde (HCHO), from EMI during the pandemic. The abrupt drop in NO(2) successfully captured the time for each city when effective measures were implemented to prevent the spread of the pandemic, for example, in January 2020 in Chinese cities, February in Seoul, and March in Tokyo and various cities across Europe and America. Furthermore, significant decreases in HCHO in Wuhan, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Seoul indicated that the majority of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions were anthropogenic. Contrastingly, the lack of evident reduction in Beijing and New Delhi suggested dominant natural sources of VOCs.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are particularly at risk of infec- tion when caring for such patients. Demonstration of antibodies especially IgG helps to identify the prevalence of SARS - CoV2 infection. Methods:The study was conducted in a 212 bed hospital in Mumbai with a 52 bed isolation facility for COVID 19 pa- tients which included 16 intensive care monitoring beds. The study was conducted between the 3rd and 4th week of July 2020. SARS-CoV2 Total (IgA, IgM & IgG) and IgG antibodies were performed from serum samples using the chemilu- minescence on the VITROS 3600 (Orth clinical diagnostics, USA). The target antigen was the spike protein. Past history of SARS-CoV2 infection by way of PCR was also noted. The cut off optical density (OD) value used for both antibodies was greater than 1. Results:A total of 473 HCWs were tested for total and IgG antibodies. Of these, 294 (62.15%) had been previously tested for SARS-CoV2 PCR either as symptomatic HCWs or as those in high risk contact with positive cases.179 (37.85%) HCWs never went through a PCR. Of these, 28/179(15.64%) HCWs seroconverted indicating asymptomatic past infection. Among the 294 HCWs who were tested by PCR, 88(29.93%) were positive. 22.72% (20/88) PCR positive HCWs did not seroconvert and produce either antibodies. Of the 207 HCWs who were PCR negative, 52(25.12%) seroconverted with either one of the antibodies. Conclusions:The study observed high rates of seroconversion among those who had never tested (15.64%) and those who were PCR negative (25.12%) indicating a high prevalence of infection among HCWs. Another concern observed was that 22.72% of the PCR positive HCWs did not produce antibodies even after 4 weeks.","output":"Seroprevelance Survey of Healthcare Workers in a Covid Care Hospital in Mumbai, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the changes in end-expiratory lung volume during an oxygenation-guided stepwise recruitment procedure in elective high-frequency ventilation. We hypothesized that high continuous distending pressure impedes pulmonary blood flow as evidenced by reduced lung volume measurements using respiratory inductive plethysmography. Changes in oxygenation, ventilation, and peripheral perfusion were evaluated as secondary outcomes. DESIGN A prospective, single center, observational, nonrandomized study. SETTING The study was conducted in a neonatal ICU in Italy. PATIENTS High-frequency ventilated preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS During the recruitment procedure, end-expiratory lung volume measured by respiratory inductive plethysmography, oxygen saturation, perfusion index, regional cerebral and perirenal tissue oxygenation, heart rate, transcutaneous PCO2, and tidal volume were simultaneously recorded at each airway pressure step. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS In 12 preterm newborns (gestational age, 27.4  0.2 wk; birth weight, 979  198 g), high-frequency ventilation was initiated at a continuous distending pressure of 10 cm H2O and incrementally increased by 1-2 cm H2O every 2-5 minutes until FIO2 was less than or equal to 0.25. End-expiratory lung volume progressively increased during the initial recruitment, but decreased at the maximum airway pressure in nine patients, indicative of a reduction in pulmonary perfusion. At the end of recruitment, tidal volume was significantly higher (p = 0.002) and oxygenation was significantly improved (p = 0.002); however, mean perfusion index, postductal saturation, and mean renal tissue oxygenation values were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) compared with baseline. Mean cerebral tissue oxygenation and mean transcutaneous PCO2 values were reduced but failed to reach significance. CONCLUSIONS High distending lung pressures increased oxygenation but decreased peripheral perfusion with no adverse cerebral side effects. Coupled with the reduction in respiratory inductive plethysmography-derived lung volume, high continuous distending pressure had adverse cardiopulmonary effects. Incorporation of lung volume and hemodynamic and oxygenation variables may guide optimum lung volume determination during high-frequency ventilation recruitment procedure while preventing adverse effects on the pulmonary circulation.","output":"Determination of Lung Volume and Hemodynamic Changes During High-Frequency Ventilation Recruitment in Preterm Neonates With Respiratory Distress Syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer has been widely accepted, but laparoscopic total gastrectomy has still not gained popularity because of technical difficulty and unsolved safety issue. We conducted a single-arm multicenter phase II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and the feasibility of laparoscopic total gastrectomy for clinical stage I proximal gastric cancer in terms of postoperative morbidity and mortality in Korea. The secondary endpoint of this trial was comparison of surgical outcomes among the groups that received different methods of esophagojejunostomy (EJ). METHODS The 160 patients of the full analysis set group were divided into three groups according to the method of EJ, the extracorporeal circular stapling group (EC; n = 45), the intracorporeal circular stapling group (IC; n = 64), and the intracorporeal linear stapling group (IL; n = 51). The clinicopathologic characteristics and the surgical outcomes were compared among these three groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the early complication rates among the three groups (26.7% vs. 18.8% vs. 17.6%, EC vs. IC vs. IL; p = 0.516). The length of mini-laparotomy incision was significantly longer in the EC group than in the IC or IL group. The anastomosis time was significantly shorter in the EC group than in the IL group. The time to first flatus was significantly shorter in the IL group than in the EC group. The long-term complication rate was not significantly different among the three groups (4.4% vs. 12.7% vs. 7.8%; EC vs. IC vs. IL; p = 0.359), however, the long-term incidence of EJ stenosis in IC group (10.9%) was significantly higher than in EC (0%) and IL (2.0%) groups (p = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS The extracorporeal circular stapling and the intracorporeal linear stapling were safe and feasible in laparoscopic total gastrectomy, however, intracorporeal circular stapling increased EJ stenosis.","output":"Comparison of surgical outcomes among different methods of esophagojejunostomy in laparoscopic total gastrectomy for clinical stage I proximal gastric cancer: results of a single-arm multicenter phase II clinical trial in Korea, KLASS 03."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: . The occurrence of trans-placental transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains highly debated. Placental positivity for SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in selected cases, but infection or virus-associated disease of fetal tissues or newborns remains to be demonstrated. METHODS: We screened for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein expression placentas from 101 women who delivered between February 7 and May 15, 2020, including 15 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 34 tested negative, and 52 not evaluated as they did not meet testing criteria (32), or delivered before COVID-19 pandemic declaration (20). Immunostain for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) was performed in the placentas of all COVID-19 positive women. One placenta resulted positive for the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins, which was further studied by RNA-in situ hybridization and RT-PCR for S transcripts, and by electron microscopy. A comprehensive immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis of the placental inflammatory infiltrate completed the investigations. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins were strongly expressed in the placenta of a COVID-19 pregnant woman whose newborn tested positive for viral RNA and developed COVID-19 pneumonia soon after birth. SARS-CoV-2 antigens, RNA and/or particles morphologically consistent with coronavirus were identified in villous syncytiotrophoblast, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, in maternal macrophages, and in Hofbauer cells and fetal intravascular mononuclear cells. The placenta intervillous inflammatory infiltrate consisted of neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages expressing activation markers. Absence of villitis was associated with an increase in the number of Hofbauer cells, which expressed PD-L1. Scattered neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were identified by immunofluorescence. INTERPRETATION: We provide first-time evidence for maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, likely propagated by circulating virus-infected fetal mononuclear cells. Placenta infection was associated with recruitment of maternal inflammatory cells in the intervillous space, without villitis. PD-L1 expression in syncytiotrophoblast and Hofbaeur cells, together with limited production of NETs, may have prevented immune cell-driven placental damage, ensuring sufficient maternal-fetus nutrient exchanges.","output":"SARS-CoV2 vertical transmission with adverse effects on the newborn revealed through integrated immunohistochemical, electron microscopy and molecular analyses of Placenta"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Specific groups have historically been, and continue to be, underrepresented in the biomedical research workforce, especially academia.

METHOD: CNKI, Wanfang, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Baidu Scholar, and Google Scholar were searched up to early June 2020 for articles in English or Chinese reporting mental illness symptoms of SARS patients. Main outcome measures include SCL-90, SAS, SDS, and IES-R scales. 29 papers met the inclusion criteria. The longest follow-up time included in the analysis was 46 months. FINDINGS: The systematic meta-analysis indicated that mental health problems were most serious before or at hospital discharge and declined significantly during the first 12 months after hospital discharge. Nevertheless, average symptom levels remained above healthy norms even at 12 months and continued to improve, albeit slowly, thereafter. INTERPRETATION: The adverse mental health impact of being hospitalized with coronavirus infection long outlasts the physical illness. Mental health issues were the most serious for coronavirus infected patients before (including) hospital discharge and improved continuously during the first 12 months after hospital discharge.

We identified a total of 461 articles and 147 were eligible for review. Nine out of 147 articles (6.12%) reported 13 patients with information on diabetic retinopathy. Glycemic fluctuations were present at onset in 10 patients (77%) and retinopathy was present in nine of them (69.23%). The degree of retinopathy was reported in four patients. Two had severe, bilateral proliferative retinopathy, one had moderate-to-severe non-proliferative retinopathy and one had non-proliferative retinopathy. In the nine patients with retinopathy, hyperkinesia persisted, required higher doses of dopamine receptor antagonists or deep brain stimulation. Retinopathy was absent in four cases (30.77%). In these patients, hyperkinesia resolved spontaneously or with lower doses of dopamine receptor antagonists. Diabetic retinopathy could be an indirect marker of striatopallidal microangiopathy in patients with diabetes. The severity of retinopathy may be associated with increased risk or worse prognosis for patients who develop hyperkinetic disorders of the diabetic striatopathy spectrum.

Women were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection based on either universal testing on admission or testing because of COVID-19-related symptoms. Disease was classified as either 1) asymptomatic or mild or 2) moderate or severe based on dyspnea, tachypnea, or hypoxia. Clinical and demographic risk factors for moderate or severe disease were analyzed and calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Laboratory findings and associated symptoms were compared between those with mild or asymptomatic and moderate or severe disease. The clinical courses and associated complications of women hospitalized with moderate and severe disease are described. RESULTS: Of 158 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, 124 (78%) had mild or asymptomatic disease and 34 (22%) had moderate or severe disease. Of 15 hospitalized women with moderate or severe disease, 10 received respiratory support with supplemental oxygen and one required intubation. Women with moderate or severe disease had a higher likelihood of having an underlying medical comorbidity (50% vs 27%, OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.26-6.02).

Information that can help make sense of this uncertainty is offered by both official health-organizations as well as sources espousing misinformation and conspiracy theories. Individuals high in intolerance of uncertainty (IU) may be particularly impacted by the impoverished epistemic environment and may thus be more drawn to conspiratorial thinking (CT). In the present study we show that endorsement of COVID-19-specific conspiracy theories is associated with higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty as well as anxiety, delusion-proneness, and paranoid ideation. Furthermore, delusion-proneness and paranoia explained the relationship between IU and CT, and emerged as independent partial predictors of CT even when controlling for other facets of schizotypy. In contrast, anxiety did not explain the relationship between IU and CT, suggesting a stronger role of cognitive traits as opposed to affective factors. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of individual differences in IU, delusion proneness and paranoia in the development of CT in the context of the acute uncertainty of a global crisis, in which CT is more prevalent and salient.

OBJECTIVES To describe the process by which bedside nurses evaluate and determine the appropriate response to safety concerns expressed by patients or their families. METHODS A qualitative design was employed. We recruited inpatient bedside nurses in an 811-bed Midwest academic medical center. Nurses provided demographic information and participated in semistructured interviews designed to elicit narratives related to evaluation and response to patient- or family-expressed safety concerns. Data analysis and interpretation were guided by grounded theory. RESULTS We enrolled 25 nurses representing 22 units. Based on these nurses' experiences, we developed a grounded theory explaining how nurses evaluate a patient or family safety concern. Nurses make sense of the patient's or family's safety concern in order to take action. Achieving this goal requires evaluation of the meaningfulness and reasonableness of the concern, as well as the potential effect of the concern on the patient. Based on this nursing evaluation, nurses respond in ways designed to (a) manage emotions, (b) immediately resolve concerns, (c) involve other team members, and (d) address fear or uncertain grounding in reality. Nurses reported routinely handling safety concerns at the bedside without use of incident reporting. DISCUSSION Safety requires an interpersonal and evaluative nursing process with actions responsive to patient and family concerns. Safety interventions designed to be used by nurses should be developed with the dynamic, cognitive, sensemaking nature of nurses' routine safety work in mind. Being sensitive to the vulnerability of patients, respecting patient and family input, and understanding the consequences of dismissing patient and family safety concerns is critical to making sense of the situation and taking appropriate action to maintain safety. Measuring patient safety or planning improvement based on patient or family expression of safety concerns would be a difficult undertaking using only standard approaches. A more complex approach incorporating direct patient engagement in data collection is necessary to gain a complete safety picture.","output":"Nurse Sensemaking for Responding to Patient and Family Safety Concerns."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED xBxxaxcxkground. In addition to prevention guidelines already in place, the effectiveness of an antimicrobial dressing on the occurrence of surgical site infections (SSIs) among adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery was evaluated. METHODS A house-wide replacement of the plain postoperative gauze dressing with a sterile dressing impregnated with 0.2% polyhexamethylene biguanide directly on the incision after closure in the operation room was performed. From May 2005 to March 2007, 1658 patients were enrolled in this study. Surgical site infections were identified using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standard criteria. RESULTS Of the 1658 patients enrolled, 1399 patients were included in the analysis, 692 with the plain dressing and 707 with antimicrobial dressing. The overall and leg site infection rate was significantly higher in the plain dressing group compared to the antimicrobial group but similar in the sternal site. Overall, the antimicrobial dressings significantly reduced infection (OR 0.58 [0.38-0.89]). Obesity was also a strong independent predictor of SSI regardless of the site of surgery. Increasing age at surgery and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%-49% were also independent predictors of infection. CONCLUSION The antimicrobial dressing had a positive effect by reducing the infection rate, especially for leg incisions using conventional open techniques, and could be a worthwhile addition in conjunction with a strategic program. .","output":"Impact of an antimicrobial dressing in reducing surgical site infections in cardiac surgery patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the association of prevalent health conditions with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, the disease-modifying biomolecules and their pathogenetic mechanisms remain unclear.

Using the shared dysregulated genes, we identified key genetic determinants and signaling pathways that may involve in their shared pathogenesis. The COVID-19 showed significant upregulation of 93 genes and downregulation of 15 genes. Interestingly, it shares 28, 17, 6 and 7 genes with diabetes mellitus (DM), lung cancer (LC), myocardial infarction and hypertension, respectively. Importantly, COVID-19 shared three upregulated genes (i.e. MX2, IRF7 and ADAM8) with DM and LC. Conversely, downregulation of two genes (i.e. PPARGC1A and METTL7A) was found in COVID-19 and LC. Besides, most of the shared pathways were related to inflammatory responses. Furthermore, we identified six potential biomarkers and several important regulatory factors, e.g. transcription factors and microRNAs, while notable drug candidates included captopril, rilonacept and canakinumab. Moreover, prognostic analysis suggests concomitant COVID-19 may result in poor outcome of LC patients.

In this sense, identifying specificities of each location is essential to minimize the damage caused by the disease. Therefore, the aim of this research was to assess the vulnerability of 853 municipalities in the second most populous state in Brazil, Minas Gerais (MG), in order to direct public policies. An epidemiological study was carried out based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) using indicators with some relation to the process of illness and death caused by COVID-19. The indicators were selected by a literature search and categorized into: demographic, social, economic, health infrastructure, population at risk and epidemiological. The variables were collected in Brazilian government databases at the municipal level and evaluated according to MCDA, through the Program to Support Decision Making based on Indicators (PRADIN). Based on this approach, the study performed simulations by category of indicators and a general simulation that allowed to divide the municipalities into groups of 1C5, with 1 being the least vulnerable and 5 being the most vulnerable. The groupings of municipalities were exposed in their respective mesoregions of MG in a thematic map, using the software Tabwin 32. The results revealed that the mesoregion of Norte de Minas stands out with more than 40% of its municipalities belonging to group 5, according to economic, social and health infrastructure indicators. Similarly, the Jequitinhonha mesoregion exhibited almost 60% of the municipalities in this group for economic and health infrastructure indicators. For demographic and epidemiological criteria, the Metropolitana de Belo Horizonte was the most vulnerable mesoregion, with 42.9 and 26.7% of the municipalities in group 5, respectively. Considering the presence of a population at risk, Zona da Mata reported 42.3% of the municipalities in the most vulnerable group. In the joint analysis of data, the Jequitinhonha, Vale do Mucuri and Vale do Rio Doce mesoregions were the most vulnerable in the state of MG. Thus, through the outlined profile, the present study proved how socioeconomic diversity affects the vulnerability of the municipalities to face COVID-19 outbreak, highlighting the need for interventions directed to each reality.","output":"A Vulnerability Analysis for the Management of and Response to the COVID-19 Epidemic in the Second Most Populous State in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have changed into a global crisis.

Findings: The prevalence of elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), elevated serum creatinine (Scr), and decreased blood uric acid (BUA) at admission was 6.29%, 5.22%, 11.66%, respectively. The trajectories showed elevation of BUN level and Scr level, as well as a reduction of BUA level during 28 days after admission in death cases. Increased all-cause mortality risk was associated with elevated baseline levels of BUN and Scr, and decreased level of BUA.

Patchouli oil (PO) is a sort of food supplement with high medicinal value in hepatoprotection, but its ability against ethanol-induced liver failure has not been demonstrated. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the potential hepatoprotection of PO through an ethanol-induced hepatotoxicity rat model. Our results showed that PO pretreatment could dramatically decrease the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in serum, paralleled by an improvement of histopathology alterations. Additionally, PO could markedly suppress the content of reactive oxygen species (ROS), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), free fatty acid (FFA), and triglyceride (TG), while enhancing the activities of glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as the ratio of glutathione to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) in liver. The protective effect of PO against oxidative stress was interrelated with restraining the mRNA and protein expression of hepatic microsomal enzyme cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). What's more, PO pretreatment could also accelerate lipometabolism via up-regulating expressions of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR-), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1) and down-regulating expressions of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-B) p65, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1).

Self-management emphasises the patients central role in managing their illness. This is pertinent given the majority of care is provided by the individual themselves; yet how individuals make sense of self-management in everyday life is largely unseen. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to capture the strengths and concerns of individuals with RA in self-managing their illness, raise awareness of their lived experience and spark a dialogue among stakeholders. METHODS: A community-based participatory approach, Photovoice, was adopted. A purposive sample of participants were tasked with taking photographs to represent the challenges and solutions to living with RA. Group workshops and semi-structured interviews were conducted to facilitate reflection, dialogue and analysis. Data analysis followed Braun and Clarkes thematic analysis. Public exhibitions were held throughout the Autumn of 2019. RESULTS: Eight women and three men (n = 11) across suburban and urban regions of Ireland were recruited (mean age 57 years, disease duration 4C21 years). Participants identified four main themes which reflected the lived experience of self-managing RA: (i) Im Here but Im Not, (ii) Visible Illness, (iii) Medicine in All its Forms, (iv) Mind Yourself. These themes captured the challenge of reduced agency, limited contribution and participation, and a complex relationship between visible and invisible illness. Solutions focused on improving psychological and emotional resilience, particularly through personal reflection and increased agency. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that RA is experienced as a fluid relationship between states of masking and surfacing of illness shaped by contextual and situational factors. Photovoice was a highly effective tool to capture and communicate this complexity. Supporting increased agency among individuals with RA to control the (in)visibility of illness and disability can inform the development of future self-management support.","output":"(In)Visible illness: A photovoice study of the lived experience of self-managing rheumatoid arthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study equilibrium distancing during epidemics. Distancing reduces the individual's probability of getting infected but comes at a cost. It creates a single-peaked epidemic, flattens the curve and decreases the size of the epidemic. We examine more closely the effects of distancing on the outset, the peak and the final size of the epidemic. First, we define a behavioral basic reproduction number and show that it is concave in the transmission rate. The infection, therefore, spreads only if the transmission rate is in the intermediate region. Second, the peak of the epidemic is non-monotonic in the transmission rate. A reduction in the transmission rate can lead to an increase of the peak. On the other hand, a decrease in the cost of distancing always flattens the curve. Third, both an increase in the infection rate as well as an increase in the cost of distancing increase the size of the epidemic. Our results have important implications on the modeling of interventions. Imposing restrictions on the infection rate has qualitatively different effects on the trajectory of the epidemics than imposing assumptions on the cost of distancing. The interventions that affect interactions rather than the transmission rate should, therefore, be modeled as changes in the cost of distancing.","output":"Epidemics with Behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been giving the devastating impact on the current medical care system. There are quite many guidelines on COVID-19, but only a few on the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during COVID-19 pandemic. AIMS: We develop these recommendations to preserve adequate clinical practice for the management of HCC. METHODS: Experts of HCC in the Asia-Pacific region exchanged opinions via webinar, and these recommendations were formed. RESULTS: Close contact should be minimized to reduce possible exposure of both medical staff and patients to the novel coronavirus. To prevent transmission of the virus, meticulous hygiene measures are important. With the decrease in regular medical service, the medical staff may be mobilized to provide COVID-19-related patient care. However, diagnosis and treatment of HCC should not be delayed because of COVID-19 pandemic. The management of HCC should be the same as in non-pandemic circumstances. HCC is highly malignant, thus it is recommended not to delay curative treatment such as surgery and ablation. However, a kind of triage is necessary even among patients with HCC when resources are insufficient for all to be treated. Curative treatments should be periodized and cytoreductive or non-curative treatment such as vascular interventions and systemic therapy may be postponed until it can be performed safely with sufficient resources. For patients with confirmed or suspected to be infected with the novel coronavirus, diagnosis and treatment should be postponed until the virus is eliminated or they are confirmed as not being infected with it.

METHODS Adopting a qualitative design, purposeful sampling was employed to recruit 13 individuals with nonspecific musculoskeletal shoulder pain and 30 HCPs. Data were collected through 1:1 semi-structured interviews and analysed using an approach informed by Constructivist Grounded Theory. To facilitate analysis, two patient and public involvement (PPI) meetings were conducted. RESULTS Most participants (69%) had shoulder pain of 1-year duration. Biomechanical beliefs about shoulder pain predominated and were heavily influential in decision-making for both patients and HCPs.

Programmes must now however be delivered in a way that reduces patient exposure. Here we describe how we rapidly transitioned our previously fully face to face cardiovascular prevention/programme to a completely virtual platform adopting Fitbit as wearable technology. Methods: The previously face-to-face initial assessment (IA) conducted by the multidisciplinary team (MDT) - nurse, dietician and physiotherapist is now delivered via video/phone as per patient preference. Patients are provided with equipment kits (tape measures, blood pressure monitors (BP), Fitbit smartwatches and Fibricheck app as required. The virtual IA includes assessment of: Smoking habit, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, lipid profile and HbA1c (taken in community phlebotomy hub), cardioprotective medications, weight, BMI, waist circumference, Mediterranean Diet Score, functional capacity via the Duke Activity Status Index, habitual activity levels, risk stratification for exercise, hospital anxiety and depression scores (HADS) and quality of life (QOL). Patients receive education and tailored advice with SMART goals as well as a written care plan. The subsequent 12 programme is comprised of ? Weekly virtual meeting with cardiologist to optimise BP/lipids and medications ? Alternate weekly virtual coaching consultation by MDT for monitoring/ goal resetting ? Alternate weekly video group education sessions on key cardiovascular health topics ? Online educational videos filmed by the MDT Monitoring of physical activity (step count, active minutes) in real time via Fibit dashboard with personalised messages sent to patients via the Fitbit app ? Provision of Fibricheck app via Fibit for rhythm assessment ?

COVID-19 has drastically changed the medical landscape. Although predominantly impacting the respiratory system, COVID-19 has several non-respiratory symptoms associated with its presentation and course. Among these are gastrointestinal symptoms and thromboembolic events with stroke. Increasingly recognized, but often overlooked, are the coagulopathy phenomena occurring with COVID-19. The severe respiratory symptoms are the primary focus of clinical management. However, close inspection of patients demonstrates that patients often exhibit both thromboembolic and bleeding events, ranging from simple skin lesions to overt emergencies. CASE REPORT The author presents a case of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy resulting in compartment syndrome of the arm with volar forearm necrosis, requiring flap reconstruction and tendon transfer to salvage the upper extremity. CONCLUSIONS Massive rhabdomyolysis resulted in acute tubular necrosis with renal failure requiring hemodialysis. The timing of reconstruction of the sequelae of compartment syndrome in an acutely ill patient is challenging, but optimal timing can result in a successful outcome.","output":"Reconstruction of COVID-19-Related Compartment Syndrome With Massive Soft Tissue Necrosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Patients with pre-existing respiratory diseases in the setting of COVID-19 may have a greater risk of severe complications and even death. Methods A retrospective, multicenter, cohort study with 5847 COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals. Patients were separated in two groups, with/without previous lung disease. Evaluation of factors associated with survival and secondary composite end-point such as ICU admission and respiratory support, were explored. Results 1,271 patients (22%) had a previous lung disease, mostly COPD. All-cause mortality occurred in 376 patients with lung disease (29.5%) and in 819 patients without (17.9%) (p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patients with lung diseases had a worse 30-day survival (HR = 1.78; 95%C.I. 1.58-2.01; p < 0.001) and COPD had almost 40% mortality. Multivariable Cox regression showed that prior lung disease remained a risk factor for mortality (HR, 1.21; 95%C.I. 1.02-1.44; p = 0.02). Variables independently associated with all-cause mortality risk in patients with lung diseases were oxygen saturation less than 92% on admission (HR, 4.35; 95% CI 3.08-6.15) and elevated D-dimer (HR, 1.84; 95% CI 1.27-2.67). Age younger than 60 years (HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.21-0.65) was associated with decreased risk of death. Conclusions Previous lung disease is a risk factor for mortality in patients with COVID-19. Older age, male gender, home oxygen therapy, and respiratory failure on admission were associated with an increased mortality. Efforts must be done to identify respiratory patients to set measures to improve their clinical outcomes.","output":"Prevalence and 30-Day Mortality in Hospitalized Patients With Covid-19 and Prior Lung Diseases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the greatest challenges in biomedicine is to define the critical targets and network interactions that are subverted to elicit growth deregulation in human cells. Understanding and developing rational treatments for cancer requires a definition of the key molecular targets and how they interact to elicit the complex growth deregulation phenotype. Viral proteins provide discerning and powerful probes to understand both how cells work and how they can be manipulated using a minimal number of components. The small DNA viruses have evolved to target inherent weaknesses in cellular protein interaction networks to hijack the cellular DNA and protein replication machinery. In the battle to escape the inevitability of senescence and programmed cell death, cancers have converged on similar mechanisms, through the acquisition and selection of somatic mutations that drive unchecked cellular replication in tumors. Understanding the dynamic mechanisms through which a minimal number of viral proteins promote host cells to undergo unscheduled and pathological replication is a powerful strategy to identify critical targets that are also disrupted in cancer. Viruses can therefore be used as tools to probe the system-wide protein-protein interactions and structures that drive growth deregulation in human cells. Ultimately this can provide a path for developing system context-dependent therapeutics. This review will describe ongoing experimental approaches using viruses to study pathways deregulated in cancer, with a particular focus on viral cellular protein-protein interactions and structures.","output":"The critical protein interactions and structures that elicit growth deregulation in cancer and viral replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The quality of service in healthcare is constantly challenged by outlier events such as pandemics (i.e., Covid-19) and natural disasters (such as hurricanes and earthquakes). In most cases, such events lead to critical uncertainties in decision-making, as well as in multiple medical and economic aspects at a hospital. External (geographic) or internal factors (medical and managerial) lead to shifts in planning and budgeting, but most importantly, reduce confidence in conventional processes. In some cases, support from other hospitals proves necessary, which exacerbates the planning aspect. This paper presents three data-driven methods that provide data-driven indicators to help healthcare managers organize their economics and identify the most optimum plan for resources allocation and sharing. Conventional decision-making methods fall short in recommending validated policies for managers.

Preliminary reports suggest that the disease may present in diverse ways, including with neurological symptoms, but few published reports in the literature describe seizures in patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to characterize the risk factors, clinical features, and outcomes of seizures in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective case series. Cases were identified through a review of admissions and consultations to the neurology and neurocritical care services between April 1, 2020 and May 15, 2020. SETTING: The study setting was in a tertiary care, safety-net hospital in Boston, MA. PARTICIPANTS: Patients presenting with seizures and COVID-19 during the study period were included in the study. RESULTS: Seven patients met inclusion criteria (5 females, 71%). Patients ranged in age from 37 to 88a?years (median: 75a?years). Three patients had a prior history of well-controlled epilepsy (43%), while 4 patients had new-onset seizures, including 2 patients with prior history of remote stroke. Three patients had no preceding symptoms of COVID-19 prior to presentation (57%), and in all cases, seizures were the symptom that prompted presentation to the emergency department, regardless of prior symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Provoking factors for seizures in patients with COVID-19 may include metabolic factors, systemic illness, and possibly direct effects of the virus. In endemic areas with community spread of COVID-19, clinicians should be vigilant for the infection in patients who present with seizures, which may precede respiratory symptoms or prompt presentation to medical care.

What risk factors influence the severity of the disease is of considerable importance. Objectives: This research offers a systematic review and meta-analysis of the correlation between common clinical conditions and comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19. Methodology: Two independent researchers searched Europe PMC, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases for articles related to influence comorbidities have on the progress of the disease. A search engine was also created to screen a further 59,000 articles in COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). Random-effects modeling was used to pool 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and odds ratios (ORs). The significance of all comorbidities and clinical conditions to the severity of the disease was evaluated by employing machine-learning techniques. Publication bias was assessed by using funnel-plots and Eggers-test. Heterogeneity was tested using I2. Results: The meta-analysis incorporated 12 studies spanning 4,101 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Chinese hospitals. The prevalence of the most commonly associated co-morbidities and their corresponding odds ratio for disease severity were as follows: coronary heart disease (OR 2.97 [CI: 1.99-4.45], p < 0.0001), cancer (OR 2.65 [CI: 1.12-6.29], p < 0.03), cardiovascular disease (OR 2.89 [CI: 1.90-4.40], p < 0.0001), COPD (OR 3.24 [CI: 1.66-6.32], p = 0.0), and kidney disease (OR 2.2.4 [CI: 1.01-4.99], p = 0.05) with low or moderate level of heterogeneity. The most frequently exhibited clinical symptoms recorded during the course of admission were fever (OR 1.37 [CI: 1.01-1.86], p = 0.04), myalgia/fatigue (OR 1.31 [CI: 1.11-1.55], p = 0.0018), and dyspnea (OR 3.61, [CI: 2.57-5.06], p = <0.0001).

After observing variability in testing techniques, we otolaryngologists at a tertiary medical center initiated and evaluated the impact of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabbing training, including video instruction, to standardize sampling techniques and ensure high-quality specimens. METHODS: Participants in the training were employees (N = 40). Training consisted of an instructional video on how to perform nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and a live demonstration. Participants completed pre- and posttraining surveys assessing their knowledge and confidence in performing nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. They then performed swabbing on partners, which was graded per a standardized checklist. RESULTS: Mean scores for knowledge-based questions and confidence in swabbing were significantly higher after the training session (both P < .001). All participants scored 6 of 8 on the posttraining checklist. Ninety-five percent rated the video as very or extremely useful. DISCUSSION: Specialized instruction for nasopharyngeal swabbing improved participants knowledgespecifically, the appropriate head position and minimum swab time in nasopharynxand their confidence. After the training, their swabbing execution scores were high. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Video-assisted hands-on instruction for nasopharyngeal swab sampling can be used to standardize teaching. When prompt and accurate testing is paramount, this instruction can optimize procedural technique and should be used early and often.

Methods: Primary literature review included topics: COVID-19, SARS, MERS, gut micro-biota, probiotics, immune system, ACE2, and metformin. Results: Diabetes was prevalent (~11%) among COVID-19 patients and associated with increased mortality (about 3-fold) compared to patients without diabetes. COVID-19 could be associated with worsening diabetes control and new diabetes diagnosis that could be linked to high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors (coronavirus point of entry into the host) in the endocrine pancreas. A pre-existing gut microbiota imbalance (dysbiosis) could contribute to COVID-19Crelated complications in patients with diabetes. The COVID-19 virus was found in fecal samples (~55%), persisted for about 5 weeks, and could be associated with diarrhea, suggesting a role for gut dysbiosis. ACE2 expressed on enterocytes and colonocytes could serve as an alternative route for acquiring COVID-19. Experimental models proposed some probiotics, including Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, and L. salivarius, as vectors for delivering or enhancing efficacy of anti-coronavirus vaccines. These Lactobacillus probiotics were also beneficial for diabetes. The potential mechanisms for interconnections between coronavirus, diabetes, and gut microbiota could be related to the immune system, ACE2 pathway, and metformin treatment. There were suggestions but no proof supporting probiotics benefits for COVID-19 infection.

However, school closures due to COVID-19 have taken place under very different conditions, making the utility of such a literature debatable. Instead, this study is based on a rapid evidence assessment of research on learning disruption C extended and unplanned periods of school closure following unprecedented events, such as SARs or weather-related events. We argue that this literature provides clearer evidence on what helps children return to learning under similar conditions, and in this sense has more direct relevance for schools after COVID-19. A narrative synthesis of key recommendations is presented. Key findings are as follows: (i) that school leaders local knowledge is pivotal in leading a return to school, (ii) the curriculum needs to be responsive to childrens needs and (iii) that schools are essential in supporting the mental health of students. A discussion of the applicability and utility of these findings is provided in light of emerging evidence of challenges faced by schools in the context of an ongoing global pandemic and the disruption to education it continues to create.

In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of corneal stromal stem cell (CSSC)-derived secretome in a mechanical debridement mouse model of corneal scarring. CSSC secretome was able to promote scarless corneal wound healing. The mechanisms include 1) dampening inflammation with reduced CD45+, CD11b+/GR1+, and CD11b+/F4/80+ inflammatory cells in the wounded corneas; 2) reducing fibrotic extracellular matrix deposition such as collagen IV, collagen 3A1, SPARC, and -SMA; 3) rescuing sensory nerves. The proteomic analysis shows upregulated proteins related to wound healing and cell adhesion which boost scarless wound healing. It also shows upregulated neuroprotective proteins in CSSC secretome related to axon guidance, neurogenesis, neuron projection development, and neuron differentiation. Four unique complement inhibitory proteins CD59, vitronectin, SERPING1, and C1QBP found in CSSC secretome contribute to reducing a complement cascade mediating cell death and membrane attacking complex autoantibodies after corneal injury.

METHODS: Patients recovering from Covid-19 pneumonia who presented to our department with any or all of the following complaints: pain, watering, redness and decreased vision were identified. All relevant data were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Three patients with endogenous endophthalmitis were identified. All patients had been treated for Covid-19 pneumonia and had received Remdesivir and systemic steroids therefor; 2/3 received tocilizumab. All patients received vitreous biopsy, vitrectomy and intraocular antibiotic injection. Patient 1 demonstrated K.pneumoniae in blood culture, K.pneumoniae and E.coli in urine culture, and K.pneumoniae in vitreous fluid, while patients 2 and 3 demonstrated S.maltophilia and Methicillin Resistant S.Aureus in the blood and nasopharyngeal culture respectively. Correspondingly, the same organism was cultured from vitreous in patients 2 and 3. The visual acuity at last follow up in patients 1-3 was 20/100, 20/80 and 20/40 respectively. The probable source of infection was identified in each as renal calculi, dental caries and the pharynx respectively.

Here, we investigated the degree of cooperativity of ACE2 within both the SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV-1 membrane-bound S glycoproteins. We show that there exist differential inter-protomer conformational transitions between both spike trimers.

METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scirus, and Scielo were searched (to December 2008) for reports of accidental viral infections, written in English, Portuguese, Spanish, or German; the authors personal file of scientific articles and references from the articles retrieved in the initial search were also used. Systematic review was carried out with inclusion criteria of presence of accidental viral infection's cases information, and exclusion criteria of absence of information about the viral etiology, and at least probable mode of infection. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-one scientific articles were obtained, 66 of which were included in the analysis. For arboviruses, 84% of the laboratory infections had aerosol as the source; for alphaviruses alone, aerosol exposure accounted for 94% of accidental infections. Of laboratory arboviral infections, 15.7% were acquired percutaneously, whereas 41.6% of hospital infections were percutaneous. For airborne viruses, 81% of the infections occurred in laboratories, with hantavirus the leading causative agent. Aerosol inhalation was implicated in 96% of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections, 99% of hantavirus infections, and 50% of coxsackievirus infections, but infective droplet inhalation was the leading mode of infection for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the mucocutaneous mode of infection was involved in the case of infection with influenza B. For blood-borne viruses, 92% of infections occurred in hospitals and 93% of these had percutaneous mode of infection, while among laboratory infections 77% were due to infective aerosol inhalation. Among blood-borne virus infections there were six cases of particular note: three cases of acute hepatitis following hepatitis C virus infection with a short period of incubation, one laboratory case of human immunodeficiency virus infection through aerosol inhalation, one case of hepatitis following hepatitis G virus infection, and one case of fulminant hepatitis with hepatitis B virus infection following exposure of the worker's conjunctiva to hepatitis B virus e antigen-negative patient saliva. Of the 12 infections with viruses with preferential mucocutaneous transmission, seven occurred percutaneously, aerosol was implicated as a possible source of infection in two cases, and one atypical infection with Macacine herpesvirus 1 with fatal encephalitis as the outcome occurred through a louse bite. One outbreak of norovirus infection among hospital staff had as its probable mode of infection the ingestion of inocula spread in the environment by fomites. CONCLUSIONS: The currently accepted and practiced risk analysis of accidental viral infections based on the conventional dynamics of infection of the etiological agents is insufficient to cope with accidental viral infections in laboratories and to a lesser extent in hospitals, where unconventional modes of infection are less frequently present but still have relevant clinical and potential epidemiological consequences. Unconventional modes of infection, atypical clinical development, or extremely severe cases are frequently present together with high viral loads and high virulence of the agents manipulated in laboratories. In hospitals by contrast, the only possible association of atypical cases is with the individual resistance of the worker. Current standard precaution practices are insufficient to prevent most of the unconventional infections in hospitals analyzed in this study; it is recommended that special attention be given to flaviviruses in these settings.","output":"Viral infections in workers in hospital and research laboratory settings: a comparative review of infection modes and respective biosafety aspects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients awareness is critical in medical care, as it can serve as an input into the adjustment of interventions.

Currently, no efficacious therapy is available to relieve coronavirus infections. As new drug design and development takes much time, there is a possibility to find an effective treatment from existing antiviral agents. OBJECTIVE: In this case, there is a need to find out the relationship between possible drug targets and mechanism of action of antiviral drugs. This review discusses about the efforts to develop drug from known or new molecules. METHODS: Viruses usually have two structural integrities, proteins and nucleic acids, both of which can be possible drug targets. Herein, we systemically discuss the structural-functional relationships of the spike, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), papain like protease (PLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), as these are prominent structural features of corona virus. Certain antiviral drugs such as Remdesivir are RNA dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor. It has the ability to terminate RNA replication by inhibiting ATP. RESULTS: It is reported that ATP is involved in synthesis of coronavirus non-structural proteins from 3CLpro and PLpro. Similarly, mechanisms of action of many other antiviral agents has been discussed in this review. It will provide new insights into the mechanism of inhibition, and let us develop new therapeutic antiviral approaches against novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

Kidney dysfunction is common among patients with COVID-19, and patients who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) have inferior outcomes. There is a growing body of evidence that AKI occurs in a substantial number of patients with COVID-19 and that developing AKI is associated with significantly worse outcomes for COVID-19 patients. The risk for death was amplified when AKI resulted in kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Subject of Review: The Study of the Treatment and Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19 (STOP-COVID) conducted a multicenter retrospective observational study enrolling 3,099 critically ill adults with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) (J Am Soc Nephrol 2021;32:161-176). A total of 637 of 3,099 patients (20.6%) developed AKI treated with KRT (AKI-KRT) within 14 days of ICU admission, 350 of whom (54.9%) died within 28 days of ICU admission. Predictors of COVID-19 patients' progress to AKI-KRT were higher BMI, higher stages of CKD, lower ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen over the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2:FiO2 ratio) on ICU admission, and greater number of vasopressors received on ICU admission. Second Opinion: Recently, some investigations revealed that the independent predictors of COVID-19 with AKI include older age, Black race, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, mechanical ventilation, higher interleukin-6 level, and use of vasopressor medications. It seems that the underlying comorbidities with preexisting vascular endothelial damage and/or the more serious critically ill CO-VID-19 patients can contribute to the development of AKI and even AKI-KRT.","output":"Endothelial Dysfunction for Acute Kidney Injury in Coronavirus Disease 2019: How Concerned Should We Be?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myocarditis can present in many different forms and can be overlooked by more life-threatening conditions.

The patients presented with intermittent claudication (193/196) or ischemic rest pain (3/196) and were treated with nitinol stents for obstructive lesions of the SFA or PPA. Over a quarter of lesions (29.9%) were chronic total occlusions. The mean lesion length was 60.7 mm. Moderate to severe calcification was present in 91.0% of lesions. RESULTS A total of 225 stents were successfully implanted in 213 (99.5%) of 214 lesions. Acute lesion success (<30% residual stenosis) was achieved in 90.0%. There were no in-hospital major adverse events. Primary patency (defined as a peak systolic velocity ratio <2.0) at 12 months was 72.6%.

METHODSRESULTS: This uncontrolled, single-center, open-label pilot clinical study investigated 260 consecutively enrolled Caucasian women aged 18C69 years (BMI 25.0C50.9 kg/m(2)) after 31 days of an active stage VLCKD. Anthropometric measurements and PhA were assessed. hs-CRP levels were determined by nephelometric assay. Dietary compliance, physical activity recommendations, and ketosis status were tested weekly by telephone recall. At Day 31, BMI, WC, and hs-CRP levels were observed to have decreased (??7.3  2.9%, ??6.3  5.0%, and ??38.9  45.6%; respectively), while PhA had increased (?+8.6  12.5%).

CONCLUSION: This is the first study reporting how, along with the expected rapid effect on body weight, PhA changes during active stage VLKCD occurred very early on and independently of weight loss, and were negatively associated with hs-CRP levels. These findings further support the VLCKD as a first-line dietary intervention to obtain a rapid effect on the obesity-related inflammatory status. They also suggest the possible role of PhA as an easy diagnostic tool to detect inflammation, thereby avoiding blood sampling and expensive biochemical assays.

The BreastScreen Australia Remote Radiology Assessment Model (RRAM) is an initiative developed to address the challenges of inadequate access to a local radiological workforce in regional Australia. With the growth in telehealth innovations more broadly, the RRAM represents a departure from the traditional onsite model where a radiologist would be co-located with practice staff during assessment clinics. Understanding client satisfaction is an important consideration with new models. This article explores client perceptions of the RRAM including awareness, satisfaction with experiences, confidence in the quality of care being received, and preferences regarding models of service delivery. METHODS: Clients in four BreastScreen services across three Australian states and territories were invited to provide feedback on their experiences of the RRAM. Brief face-to-face interviews based on a survey were conducted at the conclusion of assessment clinic visits. Clients also provided feedback through surveys completed and returned by post, and online. RESULTS: 144 clients completed the survey regarding their experiences of the RRAM. The majority were aged between 50 and 59 years (55/144, 38.2%). Most had attended a BreastScreen service for either screening or assessment on a total of two to five occasions (85/142, 59.9%) in the past. Nearly all women who attended a RRAM clinic expressed satisfaction with their experience (142/143, 99.3%). Clients were aware that the radiologist was working from another location (131/143, 91.6%) and the majority believed there wouldnt be any difference in the care they received between the RRAM and the onsite model (120/142, 84.5%). Clients generally had no particular preference for either the onsite or RRAM model of service delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Clients high satisfaction with their clinic experiences, high confidence in care being received, and the majority having no preference for either the onsite or remote model indicates their acceptance of the RRAM. Client acceptance of the model supports continuation of the RRAM at these sites and expansion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS From June 2013 to June 2019, 35 patients with gastric cancer underwent TLDG with a modified DSG consisting of linear stapling and single-layer hand suturing in our institution. All anastomotic procedures were performed by the right hand of the operator positioned between the patient's legs. Linear stapling of the posterior walls of the remnant stomach and duodenum without creating a gap was performed using a 45-mm linear stapler, considering the prevention of intraoperative duodenal injury. The stapler entry hole was closed using a single-layer full-thickness hand suturing technique with knotted sutures and a knotless barbed suture. We described the clinical data and outcomes in the present retrospective patient series. RESULTS No intraoperative duodenal injury occurred in any of the 35 patients. The median staple length at linear stapling of the posterior walls of the remnant stomach and duodenum was 41.7  4.2 (30-45) mm, and 2 patients (5.7%) had a staple length of 30 mm. There were no incidences of postoperative anastomotic stenosis. CONCLUSIONS We suggest that a modified DSG consisting of linear stapling and single-layer hand suturing performed by an operator positioned between the patient's legs can be one option for B- reconstruction following TLDG because it can aid in preventing both intraoperative duodenal injury and postoperative anastomotic stenosis.","output":"Modified delta-shaped gastroduodenostomy consisting of linear stapling and single-layer suturing with the operator positioned between the patient's legs: A technique preventing intraoperative duodenal injury and postoperative anastomotic stenosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an urgent need for the identification of effective therapeutics for COVID-19 and we have developed a machine learning drug discovery pipeline to identify several drug candidates.

Training for WMD is considered a key part of public health policy and preparedness. Although such events are rare, when they do occur, they can cause mass casualties. In many models of mass casualty management, anesthesiology personnel are responsible for treating patients immediately on arrival at the hospital. We studied the extent of training offered to anesthesiology personnel in the use of WMD protective gear and patient management in United States (US) anesthesiology residency programs. Information was obtained via an online survey to all program directors and chair persons of anesthesiology programs. We polled all of the 135 US anesthesiology programs of which 90 (67%) responded. Only 37% had any form of training, and many of them did not repeat training after initial sessions. Twenty-eight percent of programs east of the Mississippi River reported some form of training whereas only 17% of programs west of it reported training available. The majority of anesthesia residency programs in the US that responded to our survey provided little or no training in the management of patients exposed to WMD. IMPLICATIONS In an attack involving weapons of mass destruction or toxic chemicals, anesthesiologists will provide care. Our survey of United States anesthesiology residency programs demonstrated that there is limited training of residents regarding the anesthetic management of patients injured by weapons of mass destruction.

Evidence suggests that transmission of the virus is primarily through respiratory droplets and contact routes, and airborne carriers such as atmospheric particulates and aerosols have also been proposed as important vectors for the environmental transmission of COVID-19. Sewage and human excreta have long been recognized as potential routes for transmitting human pathogens. The causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been detected in human feces and urine, where it could remain viable for days and show infectivity. Urban flooding, a common threat in summer caused by heavy rainfalls, is frequently reported in urban communities along with sewage overflows. With summer already underway and economy re-opening in many parts of the world, urban flooding and the often-accompanied sewage overflows could jeopardize previous mitigation efforts by posing renewed risks of virus spread in affected areas and communities. In this article, we present the up-to-date evidence and discussions on sewage-associated transmission of COVID-19, and highlighted the roles of sewage overflow and sewage-contaminated aerosols in two publicized events of community outbreaks. Further, we collected evidence in real-life environments to demonstrate the shortcuts of exposure to overflowed sewage and non-dispersed human excreta during a local urban flooding event. Given that communities serviced by combined sewer systems are particularly prone to such risks, local municipalities could prioritize wastewater infrastructure upgrades and consider combined sewer separations to minimize the risks of pathogen transmission via sewage overflows during epidemics.","output":"Urban flooding events pose risks of virus spread during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A large subset of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are experiencing symptoms well beyond the claimed 2-week recovery period for mild cases These long-term sequelae have come to be known as Long COVID Originating out of a dedicated online support group, a team of patients formed the Patient-Led Research Collaborative and conducted the first research on Long COVID experience and symptoms This article discusses the history and value of patient-centric and patient-led research;the formation of Patient-Led Research Collaborative as well as key findings to date;and calls for the following: the acknowledgement of Long COVID as an illness, an accurate estimate of the prevalence of Long COVID, publicly available basic symptom management, care, and research to not be limited to those with positive polymerase chain reaction and antibody tests, and aggressive research and investigation into the pathophysiology of symptoms","output":"Patient-Led Research Collaborative: embedding patients in the Long COVID narrative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The primary goal of this study was to evaluate a cross-linked acellular porcine dermal patch (APD), as well as platelet-rich plasma fibrin matrix (PRPFM), for repair of acute Achilles tendon rupture in a sheep model.

Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is one of the most effective interventions to improve child survival. The main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and duration of exclusive breastfeeding and the associated factors among women in Dubai and Sharjah, UAE. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in four hospitals and four healthcare centers in Dubai and Sharjah between September 2017 and December 2017. Hospitals and centers are governmental and provide maternal and child health services. A convenience sample of 858 Arab and Emirati mothers with children under the age of 2 years participated in the study. Face-to-face interviews were conducted by using structured questionnaires. The study was approved by the University Ethical Committee and the UAE Ministry of Health before data collection. Descriptive statistics were computed to describe all the questionnaire items. The chi-square test was used to compare the study's categorical variables. A binary logistic regression analysis was used to predict the relationship between BF and its associated factors. Statistical tests with P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean age of the participating mothers was 30.6 (SD 5.5) years. Results showed that the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among the study participants was 24.4% (31.1% in Sharjah and 22% in Dubai; P = 0.003). The binary logistic regression reported that mother's and father's education, skin-to-skin period, number of children, mothers' health, and place of living were significantly associated with exclusive breastfeeding (P < 0.05). The results reported a significant association between EB and duration of breastfeeding (OR = 6.9, P = 0.002), husband education (OR = 2.1, P = 0.015), mother education (OR = 1.3, P = 0.027), number of children (OR = 7.9, P = 0.045), having any health problem (OR = 1.2, P = 0.045), and living place (OR = 1.4, P = 0.033), and a non-significant positive effect of family size and family income. Furthermore, the result reported a significant association between mixed breastfeeding and duration of breastfeeding (OR = 0.1, P = 0.000), skin-to-skin period (OR = 0.3, P = 0.002), underweight (OR = 4.7, P = 0.034), last infant's sex (OR = 1.6, P = 0.010), having maid at home (OR = 2.1, P = 0.000), number of children (OR = 0.2, P = 0.013), and living place (OR =1.1, P = 0.014), and a non-significant association with family size and family income. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, a health promotion program for exclusive breastfeeding during antenatal health visits, together with initiating health policies in maternal hospitals to encourage the initiation of breastfeeding during the first hour of birth and the introduction of skin-to-skin contact during the first 5 min of birth are highly recommended.","output":"Determinants of Exclusive Breastfeeding and Mixed Feeding Among Mothers of Infants in Dubai and Sharjah, United Arab Emirates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Taiwan, high-risk patients have been identified and tested for preventing community spread of COVID-19.

The gap between the board and the building is only 0.2 cm (sealed with silicone sealant). ED personnel communicate with patients using a small two-way broadcast system. Medical waste is put in specific trashcans installed in the table outside the MSCS. With full physical protection, the personnel conducting the sampling procedure need to wear only their N95 mask and gloves.

The electrocardiogram showed diffuse ST elevation and PR depression, with sinus tachycardia. Cardiac biomarkers and D-dimer were negative; echocardiography showed no abnormalities and the absence of pericardial effusion. Her blood work revealed no sign of inflammation or bacterial infection (PCR and procalcitonin were normal); thyroid-stimulating hormone plasma levels were suppressed, showing decompensated thyrotoxicosis. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), EpsteinCBarr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, Enterovirus, Parvovirus B19, and Adenovirus tests were normal. Her past medical history was silent, apart from Graves disease on treatment with methimazole. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed and showed the presence of slightly increased density pericardial effusion, with a maximum thickness of 15 mm in the upper mediastinum. Finally, cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) identified a mass of 73  51 mm located in the upper mediastinum. The mass was subsequently biopsed with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and the histological analysis showed thymic hyperplasia.

AIM We investigated in patients with OSA whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy has a long-term effect on sexual function, including ED, in the presence of other risk factors for ED. METHODS Within a long-term observational design, we reassessed 401 male patients who had been referred for polysomnography, with respect to erectile and overall sexual function. Mean  standard deviation follow-up time was 36.5  3.7 months. Patients with moderate to severe ED were stratified according to the regular use of CPAP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Changes of sexual function were assessed by the 15-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15) questionnaire, including the domains erectile function (EF), intercourse satisfaction, orgasmic function (OF), sexual desire (SD), and overall satisfaction (OS). RESULTS Of the 401 patients, 91 returned a valid IIEF-15 questionnaire at follow-up. Their baseline characteristics were not different from those of the total study group. OSA (apnea-hypopnea index >5/hour) had been diagnosed in 91.2% of patients. In patients with moderate to severe ED (EF domain <17), CPAP users (N = 21) experienced an improvement in overall sexual function (IIEF-15 summary score; P = 0.014) compared with CPAP non-users (N = 18), as well as in the subdomains OF (P = 0.012), SD (P = 0.007), and OS (P = 0.033). Similar results were obtained in patients with poor overall sexual dysfunction (IIEF-15 summary score <44). In patients with moderate to severe ED and low mean nocturnal oxygen saturation (93%, median), also the EF subdomain improved in CPAP users vs. non-users (P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that long-term CPAP treatment of OSA and the related intermittent hypoxia can improve or preserve sexual function in men with OSA and moderate to severe erectile or sexual dysfunction, suggesting a certain reversibility of OSA-induced sexual dysfunctions.","output":"Long-term changes of sexual function in men with obstructive sleep apnea after initiation of continuous positive airway pressure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the last decades, the use of nanotechnology in medicine has effectively been translated to the design of drug delivery systems, nanostructured tissues, diagnostic platforms, and novel nanomaterials against several human diseases and infectious pathogens.

METHODS: A total of 649 Filipino answered the online questionnaire which contained of 63 questions. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was utilized to derive the causal relationships of latent variables construct. RESULTS: SEM showed that understanding of COVID-19 had significant direct effects on perceived vulnerability and perceived severity. In addition, perceived vulnerability and perceived severity had significant indirect effects on intention to follow. Intention to follow had significant direct effects on actual behavior and adapted behavior which subsequently lead to perceived effectiveness. Interestingly, understanding of COVID-19 was found to have a significant indirect effect on perceived effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The current study is one of the first studies that analyzed factors affecting perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention measures during the global pandemic. Finally, the integrated PMT and extended TPB of this study can be applied and extended to evaluate the perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 measures in other countries that currently dealing with COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Factors Affecting Perceived Effectiveness of COVID-19 Prevention Measures among Filipino during Enhanced Community Quarantine in Luzon, Philippines: Integrating Protection Motivation Theory and Extended Theory of Planned Behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is important for disease treatment and management Computed Tomography (CT) is a fast and easy modality for diagnosis and management plan of patients with COVID-19 In the literature, several studies were done to assess the sensitivity of CT for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in comparison to Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Some studies stated that CT was more sensitive diagnostic modality for COVID-19 than RT-PCR However, the sensitivity of CT for COVID-19 varies in these studies Aim: This literature review and meta-analysis was designed to determine the CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia, to verify the pooled sensitivity of CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to review the different reasons (e g , the disease stage or severity and the negative or positive RT-PCR results) for the variations in CT sensitivity Materials and Methods: This review analysed 31 articles selected from the Europe BMC, PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus databases Participant gender mean and median age, CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia were sought for and reviewed The data was analysed using Microsoft excel version 10 and OpenMeta (Analyst) software (http://www cebm brown edu/ openmeta/) to verify the pooled sensitivity of CT in detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia using meta-analyses forest plot, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, cumulative meta-analyses forest plot and leave one forest plot Results: The most common CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia were bilateral lung involvement, Ground Glass Opacity (GGO), and consolidation, and Crazy-paving pattern The CT finding is more prominent in symptomatic and severe cases than in a symptomatic and mild cases specifically the presence of consolidation and peripherals lesion distribution The pooled sensitivity of CT is 90% in diagnosis and detection of COVID- 19 pneumonia (ranged 60-100%) Conclusion: Combination of CT chest and laboratory tests along with clinical manifestation and epidemiological features should be considered to confirm the final diagnosis of COVID- 19 pneumonia [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Clinical & Diagnostic Research is the property of JCDR Research & Publications Private Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Sensitivity and Features of Computed Tomography in Diagnosis of COVID-19 Pneumonia: Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A number scales have been developed to measure conspiracist ideation, but little attention has been paid to the factorial validity of these scales. We reassessed the psychometric properties of four widely-used scales, namely the Belief in Conspiracy Theories Inventory (BCTI), the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS), and the One-Item Conspiracy Measure (OICM). Eight-hundred-and-three U.S. adults completed all measures, along with measures of endorsement of 9/11 and anti-vaccination conspiracy theories. Through both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we found that only the BCTI had acceptable factorial validity. We failed to confirm the factor structures of the CMQ and the GBCS, suggesting these measures had poor factorial validity. Indices of convergent validity were acceptable for the BCTI, but weaker for the other measures. Based on these findings, we provide suggestions for the future refinement in the measurement of conspiracist ideation.","output":"An examination of the factorial and convergent validity of four measures of conspiracist ideation, with recommendations for researchers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR)-type epidemiologic models, modeling unascertained infections latently, can predict unreported cases and deaths assuming perfect testing.

The number of unascertained cases and false negatives being unobservable in a real study, population-based serosurveys can help validate model projections. Applying our method to training data from Delhi, India, during March 15-June 30, 2020, we estimate the underreporting factor for cases at 34-53 (deaths: 8-13) on July 10, 2020, largely consistent with the findings of the first round of serosurveys for Delhi (done during June 27-July 10, 2020) with an estimated 22.86% IgG antibody prevalence, yielding estimated underreporting factors of 30-42 for cases. Together, these imply approximately 96-98% cases in Delhi remained unreported (July 10, 2020). Updated calculations using training data during March 15-December 31, 2020 yield estimated underreporting factor for cases at 13-22 (deaths: 3-7) on January 23, 2021, which are again consistent with the latest (fifth) round of serosurveys for Delhi (done during January 15-23, 2021) with an estimated 56.13% IgG antibody prevalence, yielding an estimated range for the underreporting factor for cases at 17-21. Together, these updated estimates imply approximately 92-96% cases in Delhi remained unreported (January 23, 2021).

METHOD: Ecological study based on population and death data for the months of March 2016 to 2020 in Castilla y Len. The general and provincial standardized rates, the relative risks of the year 2020 with respect to previous years and the risks adjusted by sex, periods and province, using Poisson regression, were calculated. Trend analysis was performed using joinpoint linear regression. RESULTS: An increase in mortality was observed in March 2020 with respect to previous years, with an increase of 39% for men (relative risk [RR]: 1.39; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.32-1.47) and 28% for women (RR: 1.28; 95%CI: 1.21-1.35). The model predicts excess mortality of 775 deaths. In the trend analysis there is a significant turning point in 2019 in men, globally and for almost all provinces. The increase in mortality is general, although heterogeneous by sex, age group and province.

These novel treatments, which focus either on pathophysiological aspects of influenza virus infection or the neutralization of virus with antibodies, are the subject of this review. Cytokine dysregulation has been observed in patients with severe influenza, such as avian influenza A (H5N1) and pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1pdm09) virus infections, but the role of immunomodulatory therapy is unclear, due to lack of data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Convalescent plasma appears to be useful as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of H5N1 and H1N1pdm09 infections. Until lately, data interpretation was limited to case reports and studies of non-randomized design, but a recent RCT found that patients with severe influenza A (H1N1pdm09) who were treated with hyperimmune immunoglobulin from persons who had survived the same disease had a lower peak viral load and lower mortality than controls, providing treatment was begun within 5 days of symptom onset. The efficacy of agents with potential immunomodulating effects, including intravenous immunoglobulin, N-acetylcysteine, acute use of statins, macrolides, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors agonists, celecoxib and mesalazine, and the role of plasmapheresis and hemoperfusion as rescue therapy, deserve more investigation and where feasible, studies by RCTs.

In the last decade recovery-oriented research and practice has increased greatly, however, a comprehensive model of recovery considering exclusively the perspectives of people with lived experience has not been devised. Aims: This review aimed to develop a framework and contextualize service users' and informal caregivers' understanding of recovery from severe mental health problems. Methods: We systematically searched 6 databases including key terms related to knowledge, experience and narratives AND mental health AND personal recovery. The search was supplemented with reference sourcing through gray literature, reference tracking and expert consultation. Data analysis consisted of a qualitative meta-synthesis using constant comparative methods. Results: Sixty-two studies were analyzed. A pattern emerged regarding the recovery paradigms that the studies used to frame their findings. The resulting recovery framework included the domains Social recovery; Prosperity (Legal, political, and economic recovery); Individual Recovery; and Clinical Recovery Experience (SPICE). Service users' definitions of recovery tended to prioritize social aspects, particularly being accepted and connecting with others, while caregivers focused instead on clinical definitions of recovery such as symptom remission. Both groups emphasized individual aspects such as becoming self-sufficient and achieving personal goals, which was strongly linked with having economic means for independence. Conclusions: The recovery model provided by this review offers a template for further research in the field and a guide for policy and practice. Predominant definitions of recovery currently reflect understandings of mental health which focus on an individual perspective, while this review found an important emphasis on socio-political aspects. At the same time, only a small number of studies took place in low-income countries, focused on minoritized populations, or included caregivers' perspectives.

The identity of these rMCs is still elusive. Among them, Axin2Pos mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs), which are expressing Fgf7, have been previously described. We propose that an additional population of rMCs, expressing Fgf10 (called rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos) are equally important to maintain AT2 stem cell self-renewal. The alveolosphere model, based on the AT2-rMC co-culture in growth factor reduced Matrigel, was used to test the efficiency of different rMC subpopulations isolated by FACS from adult murine lung to sustain the self-renewal and differentiation of AT2 stem cells. We demonstrate that rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells are efficient to promote the self-renewal and differentiation of AT2 stem cells. Co-staining of adult lung for Fgf10 mRNA and Sftpc protein respectively, indicate that 28% of Fgf10Pos cells are located close to AT2 cells. Co-ISH for Fgf7 and Fgf10 indicate that these two populations do not significantly overlap. Gene arrays comparing rMC-Sca1PosAxin2Pos and rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos support that these two cell subsets express differential markers. In addition, rMC function is decreased in diabetic and obese ob/ob mutant compared to WT mice with a much stronger loss of function in males compared to females. In conclusion, rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells play important role in supporting AT2 stem cells self-renewal and differentiation. This result sheds a new light on the subpopulations of rMCs contributing to the AT2 stem cell niche in homeostasis and in the context of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Key message What is already known about the subject? Resident mesenchymal cells (rMCs defined as Cd31NegCd45NegEpcamNeg) control the self-renewal and differentiation of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) stem cells in vitro. The identity of these rMCs is still elusive. Among them, Axin2Pos mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs), which are expressing Fgf7, have been previously described. What does this study add? Our study shows that an additional population of rMCs, expressing Fgf10 (called rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos) is equally important to maintain AT2 stem cell self-renewal. rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos are LipidToxHigh and are located close to AT2s. In addition, rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos cells support AT2 stem cell self-renewal and differentiation thereby identifying these cells as bone fide functional lipofibroblasts (LIFs). We have previously reported that LIF can transdifferentiate into activated MYF in the context of bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mice [1] and that activated MYF isolated from the lungs of end stage idiopathic fibrosis human patients can respond to Metformin to undergo transdifferentiation back to the LIF phenotype [2]. We also show that the function of rMCs-Sca1Pos is negatively impacted by gender and obesity, which represent two major aggravating factors for COVID-19 pathogenesis, leading to either death or major complications after infection recovery such as lung fibrosis. How might this impact on clinical practice and future development? By establishing that rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos are different from the MANCs, our study opens the way for a new key mesenchymal cell population that should be targeted to either prevent or reverse fibrosis. In addition, as this population maintains the AT2 stem cells self-renewal and differentiation, such targeting will also allow to progressively recover the loss in respiratory function.","output":"Characterization in mice of the stromal niche maintaining AT2 stem cell self-renewal in homeostasis and disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health experts have advocated for wearing protective face masks to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, yet some populations are resistant.

Those exposed to the religious message were more likely to see mask use as important and were more supportive of mask mandates. Republican evangelicals exposed to the patriotism message had similar responses.

Additionally, AIV has shown global epidemiological relevance owing to its pandemic potential. The epidemiological relevance of Chiropteran due to its multiple functional characteristics makes them ideal reservoirs for many viral agents. Recently, new influenza-like subtypes have been reported in Neotropical bats, but little is known about the relevance of bats as natural reservoirs of influenza viruses. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine the presence of AIV and new influenza-like subtypes in South American bats. For a better understanding of the drivers and interactions between AIV and bats, we used molecular assays with different gene targets (i.e., M, NP, and PB1) to identify AIV in New World bats. A housekeeping gene (CytB) PCR was used to check for nucleic acid preservation and to demonstrate the bat-origin of the samples. A total of 87 free-living bats belonging to 25 different species of the families Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae were collected in Casanare, Colombia.

distance between the peak of the R-wave and the peak of the previous R-wave in the same lead in milliseconds and converted to a heart rate by equation, 60,000/RR For correction of the QT, we used common formulas: QTc = QT/RR [Bazett formula], QTc = QT/?RR [Fridericia formula], QTc = QT + 0 154 (1-RR) [Framingham formula], QTc = QT + 1 75 (heart rate-60) [Hodges formula] QTc interval

that the longest QTc prolongation seen in this study was only 14 48 ms, using the Bazett formula With other formulas, this prolongation was significantly smaller and so was the proportion of patients meeting QTc prolongation criteria Not surprisingly, the Bazett formula again overestimated extend of QT prolongation We can only speculate that the differences are perhaps related to the fact that our population was nearly exclusively African American Common channels variation has been well documented to be a factor in QT prolongation, including drug-inducted QT prolongation In the African-American ethnic subgroup, Ser1103Tyr-SCN5A is seen in approximately 8 % of population and can certainly explain our data Furthermore, frequency of CAD and CHF was slightly higher than reported in other studies and both entities were associated with QT prolongation on our population Reassuringly, the presence of QT prolongation was not found to be a predictor of mortality in our cohort Categories Other:

focused on the clinical consequences of the Coronavirus pandemic. Epigenetic factors are increasingly recognized as important determinants of immune responses, and EZH2 is a prominent target due to the availability of highly specific and efficacious antagonists. However, very little is known about the role of EZH2 in the myeloid lineage. Here, we show EZH2 acts in macrophages to limit inflammatory responses to activation, and in neutrophils for chemotaxis. Selective genetic deletion in macrophages results in a remarkable gain in protection from infection with the prevalent lung pathogen, pneumococcus. In contrast, neutrophils lacking EZH2 showed impaired mobility in response to chemotactic signals, and resulted in increased susceptibility to pneumococcus. In summary, EZH2 shows complex, and divergent roles in different myeloid lineages, likely contributing to the earlier conflicting reports. Compounds targeting EZH2 are likely to impair mucosal immunity; however, they may prove useful for conditions driven by pulmonary neutrophil influx, such as adult respiratory distress syndrome.","output":"The histone methyltransferase Ezh2 restrains macrophage inflammatory responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study presents the first measurements of anthropogenic plutonium (239Pu and 240Pu) concentrations and atom ratios (240Pu/239Pu) for Tasmania, in sediment collected from Bathurst Harbour, in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, Australia.

Development of a maternal vaccine or therapeutic to prevent congenital infection has been hindered by limited knowledge of the immune responses that protect against placental HCMV transmission in maternal primary and nonprimary infection. To identify protective antibody responses, we measured anti-HCMV IgG binding and anti-viral functions in maternal and cord blood sera from HCMV transmitting (n=41) and non-transmitting (n=40) mother-infant dyads identified via a large U.S.-based public cord blood bank. In a predefined immune correlate analysis, maternal monocyte-mediated antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and high avidity IgG binding to HCMV envelope glycoproteins were associated with decreased risk of congenital HCMV infection. Moreover, HCMV-specific IgG engagement of Fc{gamma}RI and Fc{gamma}RIIA, which mediate non-neutralizing antibody responses, was enhanced in non-transmitting mother-infant dyads and strongly correlated with ADCP. These findings suggest that Fc effector functions including ADCP protect against placental HCMV transmission.

Considering that business activity is carried out on the basis of certain principles, the authors believe that the goals of sustainable development have an impact on the modernisation and the formation of new principles of business activity. Compliance with these principles contributes to the actualisation of the business (economic) turnover in modern reality. The aim of the article is to substantiate the formation of new principles of business activity of subjects as the main guiding principles of its implementation and appropriate regulation in the context of sustainable development. This study aims to prove that the following elements can be considered the new principles of management: a) ensuring the vital interests of entrepreneurs, consumers and society in information environment; b) corporate social responsibility; c) fair competition in entrepreneurship; d) corporate greening. To achieve this goal, the authors provided the characteristics of these principles and analysed the current state of their application. To solve the problem, first, the relationship between the listed principles and the goals of sustainable development is analysed. And secondly, the analysis of the influence of each of the principles on business activity is carried out. While conducting the scientific research, methods such as dialectical, system-structural analysis, formal-legal, comparative, as well as other methods and scientific approaches were used to achieve the goal of the study. In the course of the study, it was substantiated that the listed principles fully fit into the concept of sustainable development, which includes economic, social and environmental components. The conclusions summarise the characteristics of each of the new principles of business activity. Also, recommendations were formulated regarding the optimisation of the regulatory consolidation and the practical implementation of these economic principles, taking into account the European and Ukrainian experience. The results of the study are important for theory and practice, since they regard the presented principles as those that can be used to assess the activities of specific business entities, as well as the state of legislation and government policy. The obtained results of the assessment can be used to develop proposals for improving the legal regulation and state policy of the economic sphere (including business and entrepreneurial activity).","output":"Principles of Business Activity in the Context of Sustainable Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: We aimed to understand the early warning signs and symptoms of occupational burnout as red flags among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

RESULTS: Of the 62 COVID-19 patients, 48 cases of early stage and 14 cases of advanced stage were found in the CT data of the first diagnosis. These 62 cases were currently under follow-up (17-32 days): 18 cases in early stage-resorption stage, 25 cases in early stage-advanced stage-resorption stage, 12 cases in advanced stage-resorption stage, 5 cases in early stage -advanced stage-severe stage-resorption stage, and 2 cases in advanced stage-severe stage-resorption stage. Among them, the CT of 14 patients with advanced stage at the first diagnosis showed multiple stage lesions (advanced stage + early stage) at the same time. Patients presented with statistically significant changes in blood glucose at early stage-resorption stage, early stage-advanced stage-resorption stage, advanced stage-resorption stage, and early stage-advanced stage-severe stage-resorption stage (p<0.05). However, no statistically significant alterations were observed in the glucose level of patients with advanced stage-severe stage-resorption stage (p>0.05).

These repeats are important structural elements that assemble into the six-helix bundles characteristic of the fusion-activated envelope trimer. Peptides derived from these domains can be potent and specific inhibitors of membrane fusion and virus infection. To facilitate our understanding of retroviral entry, peptides corresponding to the two heptad repeat domains of the avian sarcoma and leukosis virus subgroup A (ASLV-A) TM subunit of the envelope protein were characterized. Two peptides corresponding to the C-terminal heptad repeat (HR2), offset from one another by three residues, were effective inhibitors of infection, while two overlapping peptides derived from the N-terminal heptad repeat (HR1) were not. Analysis of envelope mutants containing substitutions within the HR1 domain revealed that a single amino acid change, L62A, significantly reduced sensitivity to peptide inhibition. Virus bound to cells at 4 degrees C became sensitive to peptide within the first 5 min of elevating the temperature to 37 degrees C and lost sensitivity to peptide after 15 to 30 min, consistent with a transient intermediate in which the peptide binding site is exposed. In cell-cell fusion experiments, peptide inhibitor sensitivity occurred prior to a fusion-enhancing low-pH pulse. Soluble receptor for ASLV-A induces a lipophilic character in the envelope which can be measured by stable liposome binding, and this activation was found to be unaffected by inhibitory HR2 peptide. Finally, receptor-triggered conformational changes in the TM subunit were also found to be unaffected by inhibitory peptide. These changes are marked by a dramatic shift in mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, from a subunit of 37 kDa to a complex of about 80 kDa. Biotinylated HR2 peptide bound specifically to the 80-kDa complex, demonstrating a surprisingly stable envelope conformation in which the HR2 binding site is exposed. These experiments support a model in which receptor interaction promotes formation of an envelope conformation in which the TM subunit is stably associated with its target membrane and is able to bind a C-terminal peptide.","output":"Heptad repeat 2-based peptides inhibit avian sarcoma and leukosis virus subgroup a infection and identify a fusion intermediate."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O cenrio atual de crise sanitria, consequncia da pandemia da Covid-19, revela as dificuldades enfrentadas por popula??es no mundo inteiro quanto s garantias no acesso  gua para o combate  doen?a.

In particular, we investigate how their behaviors are affected by repeated displays over time. The analysis with 4241 participants finds that only a gain-framed altruistic message, emphasizing their behavioral adherence would protect the lives of people close to them, reduces their frequency of going out and contacting others. We do not find similar behavioral changes in messages that contain an altruistic element but emphasize it in a loss-frame or describe their behavioral adherence as protecting both ones own and others lives. Furthermore, the behavioral change effect of the gain-framed altruistic message disappears in the third and fourth waves, although its impact of reinforcing intentions remains. This message has even an adverse effect of worsening the compliance level of infection-prevention behaviors for the subgroup who went out less frequently before the experiment.

The study has revealed that understanding the information about COVID-19 increases social solidarity. Most importantly, it is concluded that social solidarity increases societys protective behaviors. Participants did not find COVID-19-related information to be comprehensible. Despite disease uncertainty in the early stage of the pandemic, participants had a high perception of the severity of COVID-19.","output":"The impact of comprehension of disease-related information and perceptions regarding effects and controllability on protective and social solidarity behaviors with regard to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the emerging and ever solution to the COVID-19 outbreak. This study proposes a theoretical framework based on literature and model to determined E-learning portal success. The study compared males and females to E-learning portal usage. The study objective is to check the difference between male and female E-learning portals' accessibility among the students' perspective. The study included service quality, system quality, information quality, user satisfaction, system use, and E-learning portal success. The empirical data of 280 students participated from the different universities of Malaysia through google surveys analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling. The study further divided the full model into two domains, which are female and male. In the male model, information quality and system quality have direct relationships with user satisfaction. Information quality also supported the relationship with system use. At the same time, there is a positive relationship between user satisfaction and E-learning portals. Likewise, in the female model, E-service quality and Information quality both are supported by system use and user satisfaction. Similarly, system quality has a positive relationship with user satisfaction, and user satisfaction has a positive relationship with E-learning portals. The study will be further helpful for the Malaysian universities policy-makers such as top management, ministry of higher education, Malaysian universities union in designing the policies and programs on E-learning Portal Success in the country.

As far as taxonomy is concerned, color may help observing various species characteristics in correlation with classification. However, choosing the number of subclasses to display is often a complex task: on the one hand, assigning a limited number of colors to taxa of interest hides the structure imbedded in the subtrees of the taxonomy; on the other hand, differentiating a high number of taxa by giving them specific colors, without considering the underlying taxonomy, may lead to unreadable results since relationships between displayed taxa would not be supported by the color code. In the present paper, an automatic color coding scheme is proposed to visualise the levels of taxonomic relationships displayed as overlay on any kind of data plot. To achieve this goal, a dimensionality reduction method allows displaying taxonomic distances onto a Euclidean two-dimensional space. The resulting map is projected onto a 2D color space (the Hue, Saturation, Brightness colorimetric space with brightness set to 1). Proximity in the taxonomic classification corresponds to proximity on the map and is therefore materialised by color proximity. As a result, each species is related to a color code showing its position in the taxonomic tree. The so called ColorPhylo displays taxonomic relationships intuitively and can be combined with any biological result. A Matlab version of ColorPhylo is available at http://sy.lespi.free.fr/ColorPhylo-homepage.html.

PF-07321332, whose chemical structure has been recently disclosed, is a promising oral antiviral clinical candidate with well-established anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro. The drug, currently in phase III clinical trials in combination with ritonavir, relies on the electrophilic attack of a nitrile warhead to the catalytic cysteine of the protease. Nonbonded interaction between the inhibitor and the residues of the binding pocket, as well as with water molecules on the protein surface, have been characterized using two different force fields and the two possible protonation states of the main protease catalytic dyad HIS41-CYS145. When the catalytic dyad is in the neutral state, the non-covalent binding is likely to be stronger. Molecular dynamics simulations seems to lend support for an inhibitory mechanism in two steps: a first non-covalent addition with the dyad in neutral form and then the formation of the thiolate-imidazolium ion pair and the ligand relocation for finalising the electrophilic attack.

METHODS: We carried out public involvement and pilot testing in 315 volunteers to improve usability. Feedback was obtained through online discussions, questionnaires, observations and interviews of people who tried the test at home. This informed the design of a nationally representative survey of adults in England using two LFIAs (LFIA1 and LFIA2) which were sent to 10,600 and 3,800 participants, respectively, who provided further feedback. RESULTS: Public involvement and pilot testing showed high levels of acceptability, but limitations with the usability of kits. Most people reported completing the test; however, they identified difficulties with practical aspects of the kit, particularly the lancet and pipette, a need for clearer instructions and more guidance on interpretation of results. In the national study, 99.3% (8,693/8,754) of LFIA1 and 98.4% (2,911/2,957) of LFIA2 respondents attempted the test and 97.5% and 97.8% of respondents completed it, respectively. Most found the instructions easy to understand, but some reported difficulties using the pipette (LFIA1: 17.7%) and applying the blood drop to the cassette (LFIA2: 31.3%). Most respondents obtained a valid result (LFIA1: 91.5%; LFIA2: 94.4%). Overall there was substantial concordance between participant and clinician interpreted results (kappa: LFIA1 0.72; LFIA2 0.89).

This study approaches three objectives related to consumer information needs for decision making when purchasing fruit: (1) Determine if consumers choice of packaged fruit rather than loose fruit is motivated by their interest in the information provided on packaging; (2) identify information gaps on fruit packaging labels; (3) identify those sensory attributes that consumers consider to be of major interest to be included in sensory labels of different fruit types. The study was based on an online questionnaire answered by 394 fruit consumers. Ninety percent of the participants stated having an interest in receiving information when purchasing fruit, but their choice between packaged or loose fruit was not conditioned by their information needs. Moreover, a gap between information interest and information use was detected as their final purchase decisions were not always based on the provided information. Harvest date, production method, percentage of the price received by the farmer, applied treatments, sensory characteristics, and environmental information were identified as the major information gaps, as these labels were unavailable for a high percentage of consumers, who stated their interest in them. According to consumers, sensory labels should include information about sweetness and flavor intensity irrespectively of fruit type. Sourness and juiciness attributes were particularly interesting for citrus, as sourness and firmness were for kiwi. Information about texture properties was required for pome and stone fruit.

Increased risk of pulmonary embolism and thrombosis has been identified in COVID-19 patients, alongside accompanying elevations in potential prognostic biomarkers, including D-dimer, IL-6 and cardiac specific troponins. Our aim was to provide a scoping review of the available literature regarding thrombosis risk, other cardiovascular implications, and their biomarkers in COVID-19 to highlight potential disease mechanisms.

Yet, little is known about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among PLHIV in high HIV burden countries, such as Nigeria. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine and identify predictors and reasons for vaccine hesitancy among patients living with HIV and attending a tertiary hospital in Kano, northern Nigeria. METHODS: Using a mixed-methods design, structured questionnaires were administered to a clinic- based sample of patients living with HIV (n = 344), followed by 20 in-depth interviews with a sub-sample. Logistic regression and the framework approach were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Less than half (46.2 %, n = 159) of the respondents were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine acceptance was higher among non-Muslim PLHIV (Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 1.26, 95 % Confidence Interval (95 % CI): 1.10-4.00), persons with high-risk perception (aOR = 2.43, 95 % CI:1.18-5.00), those who were not worried about infertility-related rumors (aOR = 13.54, 95 % CI:7.07-25.94) and persons who perceived antiretroviral drugs are protective against COVID-19 (aOR = 2.76, 95 % CI: 1.48-5.14). In contrast, vaccine acceptance was lower among persons who were not concerned about the potential effects of COVID-19-HIV co-infection (aOR = 0.20, 95 % CI:0.10-0.39). The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy included doubts about the existence of COVID-19, low-risk perception, anxiety about antiretroviral treatmentvaccine interactions, safety concerns, and infertility-related rumors. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 vaccine acceptance was low among PLHIV. COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was associated with respondents' faith, risk perception, perception of the protective effects of antiretroviral treatment, concerns about COVID-19-HIV co-infection, and infertility-related rumors.

ADP-ribosylation is a common post-translational modification of proteins; also nucleic acids and small molecules can be modified by the covalent attachment of ADP-ribose. This modification, important in cellular signalling and infection processes, is usually executed by enzymes from the large superfamily of ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs). Here, using bioinformatics approaches, we identify a novel putative ADP-ribosyltransferase family, conserved in eukaryotic evolution, with a divergent active site. The hallmark of these proteins is the ART domain nestled between flanking leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. LRRs are typically involved in innate immune surveillance. The novel family appears as putative novel ADP-ribosylation-related actors, most likely pseudoenzymes. Sequence divergence and lack of clearly detectable classical ART active site suggests the novel domains are pseudoARTs, yet atypical ART activity, or alternative enzymatic activity cannot be excluded. We propose that this family, including its human member LRRC9, may be involved in an ancient defense mechanism, with analogies to the innate immune system, and coupling pathogen detection to ADP-ribosyltransfer or other signalling mechanisms.","output":"A novel predicted ADP-ribosyltransferase-like family conserved in eukaryotic evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated not only by genomic enhancers and promoters, but also by covalent modifications added to both chromatin and RNAs. Whereas cellular gene expression may be either enhanced or inhibited by specific epigenetic modifications deposited on histones (in particular, histone H3), these epigenetic modifications can also repress viral gene expression, potentially functioning as a potent antiviral innate immune response in DNA virus-infected cells. However, viruses have evolved countermeasures that prevent the epigenetic silencing of their genes during lytic replication, and they can also take advantage of epigenetic silencing to establish latent infections. By contrast, the various covalent modifications added to RNAs, termed epitranscriptomic modifications, can positively regulate mRNA translation and/or stability, and both DNA and RNA viruses have evolved to utilize epitranscriptomic modifications as a means to maximize viral gene expression. As a consequence, both chromatin and RNA modifications could serve as novel targets for the development of antivirals. In this Review, we discuss how host epigenetic and epitranscriptomic processes regulate viral gene expression at the levels of chromatin and RNA function, respectively, and explore how viruses modify, avoid or utilize these processes in order to regulate viral gene expression.","output":"Epigenetic and epitranscriptomic regulation of viral replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Robust, reliable, and affordable analytical techniques are essential for screening and monitoring food and water safety from contaminants, pathogens, and allergens that might be harmful upon consumption.

Diversions were performed at the time of either robotic-assisted laparoscopic cystectomy for bladder cancer or urinary diversion for other indications. RESULTS A total of 10 patients underwent implantation of 20 ureters into the intestine via a robotic-assisted approach with intentional omission of stents. Median body mass index was 29.57 (first quartile 23.68, third quartile 34.69). Median American Society of Anesthesiologists score was 3 (range 2-3). Seven patients had intracorporeal ileal conduit reconstruction and 3 patients had an intracorporeal neobladder creation. There were no patients who developed a stricture of the ureter nor did any patient develop a leak at the ureteroenteric anastomosis. All patients had normal serum creatinine at least 4 weeks after surgery, and all patients had follow-up computed tomography of the kidneys, which were normal.

In Aotearoa New Zealand, there are long-standing ethnic inequalities in cervical-cancer screening, incidence, and mortality; particularly for indigenous M[a]ori women, as well as Pacific, and Asian women. Methods: We invited never- and markedly under-screened ([]5 years overdue) 30-69-year-old M[a]ori, Pacific, and Asian women to participate in an open-label, three-arm, community-based, randomised controlled trial, with a nested sub-study. We aimed to assess whether two specific invitation methods for self-sampling improved screening participation over usual care among the least medically served populations. Women were individually randomised 3:3:1 to: clinic-based self-sampling (CLINIC: invited to take a self-sample at their usual general practice); home-based self-sampling (HOME: mailed a kit and invited to take a self-sample at home); and usual care (USUAL: invited to attend a clinic for collection of a standard cytology sample). Neither participants nor research staff could be blinded to the intervention. In a subset of general practices, women who did not participate within three months of invitation were opportunistically invited to take a self-sample, either next time they attended a clinic or by mail. Findings: We randomised 3,553 women: 1,574 to CLINIC, 1,467 to HOME, and 512 to USUAL. Participation was highest in HOME (14.6% among M[a]ori, 8.8% among Pacific, and 18.5% among Asian) with CLINIC (7.0%, 5.3% and 6.9%, respectively) and USUAL (2.0%, 1.7% and 4.5%, respectively) being lower. In fully adjusted models, participation was statistically significantly more likely in HOME than USUAL: M[a]ori OR=9.7, (95%CI 3.0-31.5); Pacific OR=6.0 (1.8-19.5); and Asian OR=5.1 (2.4-10.9).

After 6 months,192 (6.9%) additional women had taken a self-sample. Interpretation: Using recruitment methods that mimic usual practice, we provide critical evidence that self-sampling increases screening among the groups of women (never and under-screened) who experience the most barriers in Aotearoa New Zealand, although the absolute level of participation through this population approach was modest.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Guinea led to the implementation of restrictive measures followed by the mitigating ones, but few of them have targeted stress and anxiety management in pregnant women. This study aimed to assess the psychological impact and its associated factors in pregnant women. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in three health centres in Conakry capital city. Pregnant women were interviewed during antenatal care visits. We used two tools for stress and anxiety assessment: Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), and followed three steps to seeking for factors associated with stress and anxiety: univariate analysis, regression tree (CART), and logistic regression. Results: We surveyed a total of 649 pregnant women. Most of them presented a state of stress (97.7%) and anxiety (52.7%). Gestational age was the main factor associated with stress and anxiety. Pregnant women with a gestational age  34 weeks had an odd of 0.09 times lower of being stressed compared to those with a gestational age greater than 34 weeks. Pregnant women living in Ratoma and Kaloum with a gestational age was  9 weeks had an odds of 15.1 times [95% CI: 8.76, 27.4] higher of being worried compared to those from Matoto, Matam and Dixinn with a gestational age greater than 9 weeks.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of CAP in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI), and the possible underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ALI was induced by intranasal administration of LPS (0.5 mg/kg), and CAP (1 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally 3 days before exposure to LPS. Then, the histopathological changes were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and qPCR were used to detect pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum and lung tissue. The expressions of HMGB1/NF-B, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways and apoptosis-associated molecules were determined by Western blot and/or qPCR. In addition, the lung cell apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining, and the expression and location of cleaved caspase-3 were detected by immunofluorescence analysis. RESULTS: CAP pretreatment significantly protected mice from LPS-induced ALI, with reduced lung wet/dry weight ratio, lung histological damage, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and significant increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. In addition, CAP pretreatment significantly inhibited the high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) expression, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) activation, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Furthermore, mice pre-treated with CAP exhibited reduced apoptosis of lung tissues, with associated down-regulation of caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, and BAX expression, and up-regulation of BCL-2. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that CAP can protect against LPS-induced ALI by inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and apoptosis through down-regulation of the HMGB1/NF-B and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways.","output":"Capsaicin Protects Against Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Acute Lung Injury Through the HMGB1/NF-B and PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The severity and mortality from COVID-19 infection vary among populations. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection in a tertiary care hospital in Oman. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using database that included: demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, medications and clinical outcomes of all patients hospitalized in Royal Hospital, Muscat, Oman, between March 12, 2020 and December 1st 2020. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to investigate the relationship between each variable and the risk of death of COVID-19 infected patients. RESULTS: In total,1002 patients with COVID-19 infection with mean age of the cohort was 5416 years (65% (n=650) male) were included, with an overall and intensive care unit (ICU) mortalities of 26% (n=257) and 42% (n=199/473), respectively. The prevalence of ICU admission was 47% (n=473) and the need for mechanical ventilation was 41% (n=413). The overall length of stay in the ICU was 13 (9-21) days. Adjusting for other factors in the model, the multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that in-hospital mortality in admitted COVID-19 patients was associated with old age (p<0.001), heart diseases (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-3.03; p=0.018), liver diseases (aOR, 4.48; 95% CI: 1.04-19.3; p=0.044), those with higher ferritin levels (aOR, 1.00; 95% CI: 1.00-1.00; p=0.006), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (aOR, 3.20; 95% CI: 1.65-6.18; p=0.001), sepsis (aOR, 1.77; 95% CI: 1.12-2.80; p=0.022), and those that had ICU admission (aOR, 2.22; 95% CI: 1.12-4.38; p=0.022).

Unfortunately, it remains poorly implemented in daily practice. Multiple studies have shown that training and support (T&S) programs can increase the use of EIBI. Nonetheless, gains have only been modest and short-term at best. Suggestions have been made to rely more on multicomponent programs that simultaneously address several barriers to the implementation of EIBI. The PINO-project aims to evaluate the added value of such a multicomponent program to improve EIBI delivery in daily practice. METHODS/DESIGN: A quasi-experimental three-arm implementation study in Flanders (Belgium) will assess the effects of tailored T&S to General Practitioners (GPs) with or without community mobilisation on EIBI delivery in general practice. The study lasts 18 months and will take place in three comparable municipalities. In municipality 1 and 2, GPs receive a tailored T&S program. The T&S is theoretically founded and tailored to the GPs views, needs and practice characteristics. Furthermore, community actions will be embedded within municipality 1 providing additional, contextual, support. In municipality 3, GPs are offered a minimal intervention to facilitate data collection. The primary outcome is the proportion of adult patients screened for hazardous and harmful alcohol use at the end of an 18-month implementation period. The secondary outcome is the scaling up activity at municipal level in screening rates, as assessed every 3 months, and the proportion of patients who received an additional brief intervention when necessary. Furthermore, the correlation between the opinions and needs of the GPs, their practice organisation and their EIBI performance will be explored. DISCUSSION: The PINO-project addresses the gap between what is theoretically possible and the current practice. This is an innovative study combining T&S at GP level with community actions. At the same time, it implements and evaluates practice T&S based on the theoretical domains framework.

Effective management requires good adherence. In response to the problem of reduced adherence over time, a pilot study using ventilators equipped with technology to remotely monitor home adherence was undertaken. METHODS From July 2019, children requiring PAP therapy consented for remote monitoring. Data collected included ventilator usage, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and mask leak. Parents were contacted on Days 14, 42, and 90 post-establishment. A proforma was used to assess parental understanding and ways to improve therapy adherence. A parental feedback questionnaire was completed on Day 90 of the study. RESULTS Median nightly PAP usage over 90-day post-establishment was 6.58 h (interquartile range: 2.47-8.62); 60% of patients met criteria for good adherence (>4 h for >70% of nights). There was a decrease in median nightly usage in Week 1 (6.92 h) versus Week 12 (6.15 h), p = 0.04. Mask leak was higher in Week 1 (17.7 L/min) versus Week 12 (14.7 L/min), p = 0.053. There was no significant difference in AHI between Week 1 (2.7/h) versus Week 12 (2.3/h), p = 0.75. 45% of questionnaire respondents felt active remote monitoring positively influenced PAP usage, whilst 84% reported overall satisfaction with PAP therapy.

We investigated whether a recombinant native full-length S-protein trimer (triSpike) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was able to elicit a neutralizing and protective immune response in animals and analyzed the capacity of anti-S antibodies to mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus entry in vitro and enhancement of replication in vivo. SARS-CoV-specific serum and mucosal immunoglobulins were readily detected in immunized animals. Serum IgG blocked binding of the S-protein to the ACE2 receptor and neutralized SARS-CoV infection in vitro. Entry into human B cell lines occurred in a FcRII-dependent and ACE2-independent fashion indicating that ADE of virus entry is a novel cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV. Vaccinated animals showed no signs of enhanced lung pathology or hepatitis and viral load was undetectable or greatly reduced in lungs following challenge with SARS-CoV.

Video visits have been hypothesized to be one way to reduce burnout among clinicians, but there has been minimal research on physician views of virtual care. We sought to measure family physician experience with video visits at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We identified all faculty and resident physicians at a large academic department of family medicine who had conducted a video visit in the prior month and conducted an anonymous online 12-question survey about their experiences, satisfaction, and barriers with care. RESULTS: Most eligible physicians responded (102/109, 94%), of whom half (52%) reported this was their first month trying a video visit. There was very high satisfaction (91% very or somewhat satisfied). The majority of respondents felt that video visits were shorter (54%) or took the same amount of time (38%) as in-person visits. There was concern that many physicians had experienced a visit in which they felt video was not the appropriate platform given patient concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This study is among the first to assess physician experience with video visits. As the visits are perceived as shorter, they may offer a unique opportunity to address clinician burnout.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism and active chemicals in the ethanol extracts of V. patula (VP) and L. chinensis (LC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The inhibitory activities of VP and LC on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production were investigated in RAW264.7 macrophages and BV2 microglia. Downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and upregulation of Nrf2 (NF-E2 p45-related factor 2)-ARE (antioxidant response element) pathway were investigated using RT-Q-PCR and Western blotting. Direct antioxidant capacities were measured using free radical scavenging and Folin-Ciocalteu assays. The flavonoids and triterpenes in VP and LC were identified by HPLC-ESI-MS. RESULTS: VP and LC inhibited NO and IL-6 production and suppressed iNOS, IL-6, IL-1? and CCL2 gene expression. VP and LC were potent direct antioxidants and effective indirect antioxidants assayed by Nrf2 activation and induction of heme oxygenase (HO)-1, glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM) and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). Three flavonoids including apigenin (1), luteolin (2) and chryseriol (3), and one triterpene betulinic acid (4) were found in VP; while compounds 1-4 and oleanolic acid (5) were in LC.

PURPOSE: To assess the incidence, patterns, and severity of injuries in victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, compared with the prior three years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The demographics, clinical presentation, injuries, and radiological findings of patients reporting physical abuse arising from IPV during the statewide COVID-19 pandemic between March 11th and May 3rd, 2020 were compared with the same period over the past three years. Pearsons chi-squared and Fischers exact have been used for analysis. RESULTS: 26 physical IPV victims from 2020 (37+/-13 years, 25 women) were evaluated and compared with 42 physical IPV victims (41+/-15 years, 40 women) from 2017-2019. While the overall number of patients reporting IPV decreased during the pandemic, the incidence of physical IPV was 1.8 times greater (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 3.0, p = 0.01). The total number of deep injuries was 28 during 2020 versus 16 from 2017-2019; the number of deep injuries per victim was 1.1 during 2020 compared with 0.4 from 2017-2019 (p<0.001).

We quantified the impact of different STEMI treatment strategies on patient outcomes and provider risk in context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using a decision-analytic framework, we evaluated the effect of PPCI versus the pharmaco-invasive strategy for managing STEMI on 30-day patient mortality and individual provider infection risk based on presence of cardiogenic shock, suspected coronary territory, and presence of known or presumptive COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: For patients with low suspicion for COVID-19, PPCI had mortality benefit over the pharmaco-invasive strategy, and the risk of cardiac catheterization laboratory provider infection remained very low (<0.25%) across all subgroups. For patients with presumptive COVID-19 with cardiogenic shock, PPCI offered substantial mortality benefit to patients relative to the pharmaco-invasive strategy (7.9% absolute decrease in 30-day mortality), but also greater risk of provider infection (2.3% absolute increase in risk of provider infection). For patients with presumptive COVID-19 with nonanterior STEMI without cardiogenic shock, PPCI offered a 0.4% absolute mortality benefit over the pharmaco-invasive strategy with a 0.2% greater absolute risk of provider infection, and the tradeoff between patient and provider risk with PPCI became more apparent in sensitivity analysis with more severe COVID-19 infections. CONCLUSIONS: Usual care with PPCI remains the appropriate treatment strategy in the majority of cases presenting with STEMI in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, utilization of a pharmaco-invasive strategy in selected patients with STEMI with presumptive COVID-19 and low likelihood of mortality from STEMI and use of preventive strategies such as preprocedural intubation in high risk patients when PPCI is the preferred strategy may be reasonable to reduce provider risk of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Patient and Provider Risk in Managing ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Decision Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although live-attenuated vaccines have been used for some time to control clinical symptoms of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), the molecular bases for the attenuated phenotype remain unclear.

METHODS: A questionnaire was developed in four languages (English, Dutch, Italian, and Spanish). The questionnaire queried whether patients had been infected with COVID-19 and outcome of the infection. Risk factors for COVID-19 infection were collected. RESULTS: A total of 5200 sarcoidosis patients completed the questionnaire with 116 (2.23%) reporting infection and 18 (15.8%) required hospitalization. Increased hazard ratio (HR) for COVID-19 infection were seen for those with a COVID-19 infected roommate (HR=27.44, p<0.0001), health care provider (HR=2.4, p=0.0001), pulmonary sarcoidosis (HR=2.48, p=0.001), neurosarcoidosis (HR=2.02, p<0.01), or rituximab treatment (HR=5.40, p<0.0001). A higher rate of hospitalization was found for those with underlying heart disease (HR=3.19 (1.297-7.855), p<0.02). No other feature including race, other immunosuppressive agent, age, or underlying condition was associated with a significant increased risk for infection or more severe disease. CONCLUSION: The overall rate of COVID-19 was 2.23%, suggesting an increased rate of COVID-19 infection.

There is, however, limited literature from low middle-income countries regarding risk factors for COVID-19 infection in HCWs. We conducted a caseCcontrol study to evaluate the risk factors of COVID-19 infection to HCWs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This caseCcontrol study was conducted in a designated COVID-19 hospital. Eighty-one HCWs involved in direct care of COVID-19 patients, identified as cases, and 266 were recruited as controls. Telephonic interviews with participants were conducted, and information regarding demographic variables, chemoprophylaxis, exposure to infected patients, and adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) measures was collected. RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant difference in the number of times training session for IPC measures attended by HCWs (p = 0.02), performance of aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs) (p <0.001), practices of donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) (p <0.001), hand hygiene (p <0.001), and decontamination of highly touched surfaces (p <0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed if the decontamination of highly touched surfaces is decreased by one unit, the odds of getting COVID-19 infection is multiplied by a factor of 0.41 and AGMPs decrease the risk of being a case by 0.76. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted that inadequate observation of IPC methods increases the risk of COVID-19 infection to frontline HCWs, whereas performance of AGMPs does not enhance the risk. In this study, HCWs undertaking an AGMP, because of concern of acquiring infection, were more diligent during procedures and hence had lesser infection.

Directions by government to maintain social distancing and avoidance of social gatherings resulted in lesser number of voluntary blood donation camps. This resulted in blood scarcity. Aim: To assess the impact on pattern of usage of blood components previously and during COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study, conducted in Department of Immunohematology and Transfusion Medicine (Blood Centre) of a tertiary care hospital. The study was carried out for a period of two years i.e., from April 2019 to March 2021. The study was divided into two phases. Phase I- April 2019 to March 2020, Phase II April 2020 to March 2021. Data was collected retrospectively from the donor registers and camp reports. Blood components utilisation data was collected from issue registers. Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word were used to compile the data. Basic descriptive statistics and graphs were be prepared using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Independent t-test was applied to assess the difference in mean and Standard Deviation (SD) between two phases. The p-value p<0.05 was considered as significant. Results: A total of 6,060 units were collected during the phase I whereas 3,433 units were collected during the phase II. Mean number of units received during phase I were significantly higher (505 +/- 127.2) as compared to phase II (286.1 +/- 73.9) (p<0.05). Overall, utilisation of Packed Red Blood Cell (PRBC), Random Donor Platelet/Single Donor Platelet (RDP/SDP) and Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) was significantly higher in phase I as compared to phase II (p<0.05).

METHODS: Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs (n = 3513) were collected to detect SARS-CoV-2 during the hospitalization. We analysed the recurrent positive rate after consecutive negative results and its relationship to demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Among 599 enrolled individuals with COVID-19, the median time for viral RNA shedding was 24 days (interquartile range 19-33 days).

Older age and being female were risk factors for recurrent positive results.","output":"Prevalence and impact factors of recurrent positive SARS-CoV-2 detection in 599 hospitalized COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols have been associated with improved postoperative outcomes but require further validation in thoracic surgery. This study evaluated outcomes of patients undergoing pulmonary resection before and after implementation of an ERAS protocol. METHODS: Electronic medical records were queried for all patients undergoing pulmonary resection between April 2017 and April 2019. Patients were grouped into pre- and post-ERAS cohorts based on dates of operation. The ERAS protocol prioritized early mobilization, limited invasive monitoring, euvolemia, and non-narcotic analgesia. Primary outcome measures included intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, postoperative pain metrics, and perioperative morbidity. Regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of morbidity. Subgroup analyses were performed by pulmonary risk profile and surgical approach. RESULTS: A total of 64 pre- and 67 post-ERAS patients were included in the study. ERAS implementation was associated with reduced postoperative ICU admission (pre: 65.6% vs. post: 19.4%, p < 0.0001), shorter ICU median length of stay (LOS) (pre: 1 vs. post: 0, p < 0.0001), and decreased opioid usage measured by median morphine milligram equivalents (pre: 40.5 vs. post: 20.0, p < 0.0001). Post-ERAS patients also reported lower visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores on postoperative days (POD) 1 and 2 (pre: 6.3/5.6 vs. post: 5.3/4.2, p = 0.04/0.01) as well as average VAS pain score over POD0-2 (pre: 6.2 vs. post: 5.2, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an ERAS protocol for pulmonary resection, which dictated reduced ICU admissions, did not increase major postoperative morbidity. Additionally, ERAS-enrolled patients reported improved postoperative pain control despite decreased opioid utilization.

Within only half a year, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 19 million reported cases across 188 countries with more than 700,000 deaths worldwide. Unlike any other disease in history, COVID-19 has generated an unprecedented volume of data, well documented, continuously updated, and broadly available to the general public. Yet, the precise role of mathematical modeling in providing quantitative insight into the COVID-19 pandemic remains a topic of ongoing debate. Here we discuss the lessons learned from six month of modeling COVID-19. We highlight the early success of classical models for infectious diseases and show why these models fail to predict the current outbreak dynamics of COVID-19. We illustrate how data-driven modeling can integrate classical epidemiology modeling and machine learning to infer critical disease parametersin real timefrom reported case data to make informed predictions and guide political decision making. We critically discuss questions that these models can and cannot answer and showcase controversial decisions around the early outbreak dynamics, outbreak control, and exit strategies.

It has been suggested that this abrupt lockdown of populations would foster addiction-related habits, such as caloric/salty (C/S) food intake, screen use, and substance use. However, no data has supported this assumption until now. OBJECTIVE: To assess the global changes and factors of increase in addiction-related habits during the early COVID-19 containment phase in France. METHODS: Online survey among 11,391 participants, opened from day-8 to day-13 of the containment (started 03/17/2020). Questions explored sociodemographic features, psychiatric/addiction history, material conditions of lockdown, general stress ([1-10] Visual Analog Scale), Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), and reported changes in several addiction-related behaviors. Global changes were described, and factors of increase were explored using population-weighted and adjusted logistic regression models, providing adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). RESULTS: Overall, increases in addiction-related habits were more frequent than decreases, as they were reported by 28.4% (C/S food), 64.6% (screens), 35.6% (tobacco), 24.8% (alcohol), and 31.2% (cannabis) of the concerned subjects, respectively. Reduced well-being score and increase stress score were general factors of increase in addiction-related habits (p-values<0.001 for all types of habits). The main specific factors of increase in C/S food intake (n=10,771) were female gender (aOR=1.62; 95%CI=1.48-1.77), being aged less than 29 years (p-values<0.001), having a partner (aOR=1.19; 95%CI=1.06-1.35), being locked down in a more confined space (per one m2/person decrease: aOR=1.02; 95%CI=1.01-1.03), being locked down alone (aOR=1.29; 95%CI=1.11-1.49), and reporting a current (aOR=1.94; 95%CI=1.62-2.31) or past (aOR=1.27; 95%CI=1.09-1.47) psychiatric treatment. The main specific factors of increase in screen use (n=11,267) were female gender (aOR=1.31; 95%CI=1.21-1.43), being aged less than 29 years (p<0.001), having no partner (aOR=1.18; 95%CI=1.06-1.32), being professionally active (p-values <0.001), an intermediate/high education level (p-values <0.001), being locked down with no access to an outdoor space (aOR=1.16; 95%CI=1.05-1.29), being locked down alone (aOR=1.15; 95%CI=1.01-1.32), in an urban environment (p-values <0.01), and not working (p-values <0.001). The main specific factors of increase in tobacco use (n=2,787) were female gender (aOR=1.31; 95%CI=1.11-1.55), having no partner (aOR=1.30; 95%CI=1.06-1.59), having and intermediate/low education level (p-values <0.01), and still working at workplace (aOR=1.47; 95%CI=1.17-1.86). The main specific factors of increase in alcohol use (n= 7,108) were being aged 30-49 years (p-values <0.05), a high level of education (p-values <0.001), or a current psychiatric treatment (aOR=1.44; 95%CI=1.10-1.88). The main specific factor of increase in cannabis use (n=620) was an intermediate/low level of education (p-values <0.001).

Women are more adversely affected by RMDs diseases compared to men.

In the past few decades, porcine PL (pPL) is widely used as the enzyme source for screening the PL inhibitors, which generates a wide range of pPL inhibitors. By contrast, the efficacious inhibitors against human PL (hPL) are rarely reported. This study aims to discover the naturally occurring hPL inhibitors from edible herbal medicines (HMs) and to characterize the inhibitory mechanisms of the newly identified hPL inhibitors. Following the screening of the inhibition potentials of more than 100 HMs against hPL, Ampelopsis grossedentata extract (AGE) displayed the most potent hPL inhibition activity. After that, the major constituents in AGE were identified and purified, while their anti-hPL effects were assayed in vitro. The results clearly showed that two abundant constituents in AGE (dihydromyricetin and iso-dihydromyricetin) were moderate hPL inhibitors, while myricetin and quercetin were strong hPL inhibitors [half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values were around 1.5 M]. Inhibition kinetic analyses demonstrated that myricetin and quercetin potently inhibited hPL-catalyzed near-infrared fluorogenic substrate of human pancreatic lipase (DDAO-ol) hydrolysis in a non-competitive inhibition manner, with K(i) values of 2.04 and 2.33 M, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that myricetin and quercetin could stably bind on an allosteric site of hPL. Collectively, this study reveals the key anti-obesity constituents in AGE and elucidates their inhibitory mechanisms against hPL, which offers convincing evidence to support the anti-obesity and lipid-lowering effects of this edible herb.","output":"Discovery and Characterization of the Naturally Occurring Inhibitors Against Human Pancreatic Lipase in Ampelopsis grossedentata"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The NHS is required to collect data from patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) for inguinal hernia surgery. We explored the use of one such measure, the Carolinas Comfort Scale(?) (CCS), to compare long-term outcomes for patients who received two different types of mesh. The CCS questionnaire asks about mesh sensation, pain and movement limitations, and combines the answers into a total score. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 684 patients were treated between January 2007 and August 2008 and were followed up in November 2009. RESULTS Data on 215 patients who met the inclusion criteria were available (96 patients who received Surgipro? mesh and 119 who received Parietene? Progrip? mesh). Recurrence rates were similar in the Surgipro? group (2/96, 2.1%) and Progrip? group (3/118, 2.5%) (Fisher's exact test = 1.0). Chronic pain occurred less frequently in the Surgipro? group (11/95, 11.6%) than in the Progrip? group (22/118, 18.6%) (p<0.157). Overall, 90% of CCS total scores indicated a good outcome (scores of 10 or less out of 115). A principal component analysis of the CCS found that responses clustered into two subscales: 'mesh sensation' and 'pain+movement limitations'. The Progrip? group had a slightly higher mesh sensation score (p<0.051) and similar pain+movement limitations scores (p<0.120). CONCLUSIONS In this study of quality of life outcomes related to different mesh types, the CCS subscales were more sensitive to differences in outcome than the total CCS score for the whole questionnaire.

To improve the performance of the existing gait recognition method based on wearable devices and to reduce the memory size of the model and increase its robustness, a new identification method based on multimodal fusion of gait cycle data is proposed. In addition, to preserve the time-dependence and correlation of the data, we convert the time-series data into two-dimensional images using the Gramian angular field (GAF) algorithm. To address the problem of high model complexity in existing methods, we propose a lightweight double-channel depthwise separable convolutional neural network (DC-DSCNN) model for gait recognition for wearable devices. Specifically, the time series data of gait cycles and GAF images are first transferred to the upper and lower layers of the DC-DSCNN model. The gait features are then extracted with a three-layer depthwise separable convolutional neural network (DSCNN) module. Next, the extracted features are transferred to a softmax classifier to implement gait recognition. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the gait dataset of 24 subjects were collected. Experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the DC-DSCNN algorithm is 99.58%, and the memory usage of the model is only 972 KB, which verifies that the proposed method can enable gait recognition for wearable devices with lower power consumption and higher real-time performance.","output":"A lightweight double-channel depthwise separable convolutional neural network for multimodal fusion gait recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Daily routine ventilator-filter exchange interrupts the integrity of the ventilator circuit. We hypothesized that this might reduce positive airway pressure in mechanically ventilated ICU patients, inducing alveolar collapse and causing impaired oxygenation and compliance of the respiratory system. METHODS We studied 40 consecutive ICU subjects (P(aO2)/F(IO2) ratio  300 mm Hg), mechanically ventilated with pressure-regulated volume control or pressure support and PEEP  5 cm H2O. Before the filter exchange, (baseline) tidal volume, breathing frequency, end-inspiratory plateau pressure, and PEEP were recorded. Compliance of the respiratory system was calculated; F(IO2), blood pressure, and pulse rate were registered; and P(aO2), P(aCO2), pH, and base excess were measured. Measurements were repeated 15 and 60 min after the filter exchange. In addition, a bench test was performed with a precision test lung with similar compliance and resistance as in the clinical study. RESULTS The exchange of the filter took 3.5  1.2 s (mean  SD). There was no significant change in P(aO2) (89  16 mm Hg at baseline vs 86  16 mm Hg at 15 min and 88  18 mm Hg at 60 min, P = .24) or in compliance of the respiratory system (41  11 mL/cm H2O at baseline vs 40  12 mL/cm H2O at 15 min and 40  12 mL/cm H2O at 60 min, P = .32).

CONCLUSIONS This study showed that a short disconnection of the expiratory ventilator circuit from the ventilator during filter exchange was not associated with any significant deterioration in lung function 15 and 60 min later.

Hence a rapid drug repositioning and lead identification strategy are required to mitigate these outbreaks. We report a pharmacophore and molecular dynamics-based approach for drug repositioning and lead identification against dual targets (3CLp and PLp) of SARS-CoV-2. The pharmacophore model of 3CLp inhibitors was apolar with two aromatic and two H-bond acceptors, whereas that of PLp was relatively polar, bearing one aromatic and three H-bond acceptors. Pharmacophore-based virtual screening yielded six existing FDA-approved drugs and twelve natural products with both the pharmacophoric features. Among them are nelfinavir, tipranavir and licochalcone-D, which has shown better binding characteristics with both the proteases compared to lopinavir. The molecular dynamics revealed that the connecting loop (residues 176C199) of 3CLp is highly flexible, and hence, inhibitors should avoid high-affinity interactions with it. Lopinavir, due to its high affinity with the loop region, exhibited unstable binding. Further, the van der Waals size of the 3CLp inhibitors positively correlated with their binding affinity with 3CLp. However, the van der Waals size of a ligand should not cross a threshold of 572?(3), beyond which the ligands are likely to make high-affinity interaction with the loop and suffer unstable binding as observed in the case of lopinavir. Similarly, the total polar surface area of the ligands were found to be negatively correlated with their binding affinity with PLp.","output":"Dual inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 proteases: pharmacophore and molecular dynamics based drug repositioning and phytochemical leads"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in an urgent need to reorganize the work of echocardiography laboratories in order to ensure the safety of patients and the protection of physicians, technicians, and other staff members.

The disease is caused by the corona virus, transmitted from human to human through droplet infection. The virus was first identified in China in December 2019, and spread worldwide. Despite the virus being highly infectious, there is no cure for coronavirus disease COVID-19. The current global approach in the fight against COVID-19 focuses on travel bans including border closures, restrictions on mass gatherings, and mass vaccination of all adults. However, the travel bans and border closures have shown to negatively affect availability, accessibility, and affordability of basic needs such as food, especially for populations in the low- to middle-income countries. This is so since a good percentage of population in low- to middle-income countries live on hand to mouth, and cannot afford adequate food stock to sustain them for a long period of time. In addition, there is a challenge to afford purchasing storage facilities such as refrigerators for storage of fresh foods. Therefore, the purpose of this narrative literature review is to unveil the impact of government policies on individual choices of food and potential impact on outcomes and nutrition in children, elderly and chronically ill individuals in the COVID-19 pandemic era in low- and middle-income countries from 2020 to 2021.","output":"Impact of government policies on individual choices of food and potential impact on outcomes and nutrition among vulnerable population during COVID-19 pandemic in low- to middle-income country: Literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In 2009, the Institute of Medicine published guidelines for implementation of Crisis Standards of Care (CSC) at the state level in the United States (US). Based in part on the then concern for H1N1 pandemic, there was a recognized need for additional planning at the state level to maintain health system preparedness and conventional care standards when available resources become scarce. Despite the availability of this framework, in the years since and despite repeated large-scale domestic events, implementation remains mixed. PROBLEM: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rejuvenates concern for how health systems can maintain quality care when faced with unrelenting burden. This study seeks to outline which states in the US have developed CSC and which areas of care have thus far been addressed. METHODS: An online search was conducted for all 50 states in 2015 and again in 2020. For states without CSC plans online, state officials were contacted by email and phone. Public protocols were reviewed to assess for operational implementation capabilities, specifically highlighting guidance on ventilator use, burn management, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, pediatric standards, and reliance on influenza planning. RESULTS: Thirty-six states in the US were actively developing (17) or had already developed (19) official CSC guidance. Fourteen states had no publicly acknowledged effort. Eleven of the 17 public plans had updated within five years, with a majority addressing ventilator usage (16/17), influenza planning (14/17), and pediatric care (15/17), but substantially fewer addressing care for burn patients (9/17). CONCLUSION: Many states lacked publicly available guidance on maintaining standards of care during disasters, and many states with specific care guidelines had not sufficiently addressed the full spectrum of hazard to which their health care systems remain vulnerable.","output":"Crisis Standards of Care Implementation at the State Level in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To evaluate if COVID-19 apps address risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, race, gender, sexual orientation, language.

However, people with diverse characteristics may, or may not, be able to use telehealth, presenting digital divide in health care and potential health equity-related issues. This study aimed to assess the use of telehealth among middle-aged and older adults during COVID-19, and to explore factors associated with their telehealth utilization. We used publicly available data from the California Health Interview Survey collected during January 2019 and December 2020 (N=15, 279;mean age= 64.2311.59;female: 52.7%). Approximately 11.0% of the sample used telehealth at least once. Bivariate and multivariate logistical regression analyses found that, compared with non-users, telehealth users were more likely to be having higher numbers of chronic conditions, with self-reported mental distress, living in urban areas, born in the US, with higher English proficiency, higher education, and having higher incomes. Age, race/ethnicity, and gender were not significantly correlated with telehealth usage. Logistic regression revealed that having mental distress (OR=1.48, 95% CI=1.29-1.71, p<0.01), more chronic conditions (OR=1.48, 95% CI=1.29-1.71, p<0.001) and living in an urban area (OR=1.93, 95% CI=1.36-2.74, p<0.001) were independently related to telehealth use. These findings suggest that telehealth, while being beneficial during the pandemic, might also introduce new challenges that exacerbate existing health inequity and disparities.

However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that LPS activated the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and inhibited lung fibroblast autophagy by depleting thymocyte differentiation antigen-1 (Thy-1) and upregulating integrin 3 (Itgb3). Challenge of the human lung fibroblast MRC-5 cell line with LPS resulted in significant upregulation of integrin 3, activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and inhibition of autophagy, which could be abolished by integrin 3 silencing by specific shRNA or treatment with the integrin 3 inhibitor cilengitide. Meanwhile, LPS could inhibit Thy-1 expression accompanied with PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway activation and lung fibroblast autophagy inhibition; these effects could be prevented by Thy-1 overexpression. Meanwhile, Thy-1 downregulation with Thy-1 shRNA could mimic the effects of LPS, inducing the activation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and inhibiting lung fibroblast autophagy. Furthermore, protein immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that LPS reduced the binding of Thy-1 to integrin 3. Thy-1 downregulation, integrin 3 upregulation and autophagy inhibition were also detected in a mouse model of LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis, which could be prohibited by intratracheal injection of Thy-1 overexpressing adeno-associated virus (AAV) or intraperitoneal injection of the integrin 3 inhibitor cilengitide. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that Thy-1 depletion and integrin 3 upregulation are involved in LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and may serve as potential therapeutic targets for pulmonary fibrosis.","output":"Thy-1 depletion and integrin 3 upregulation-mediated PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway activation inhibits lung fibroblast autophagy in lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Surgical site infection (SSI) remains one of the most common postoperative surgical complications.

Consideration should be given to the use of dual antibiotic preoperative treatment with cephazolin and metronidazole for all hysterectomies. SUMMARY Despite advancements, SSI in gynecologic surgery remains a major cause of perioperative morbidity and healthcare cost. Modifiable risk factors should be evaluated and patients optimized to the best extent possible prior to surgery. Preoperative risks include obesity, hyperglycemia, smoking, and untreated preexisting infections. Intraoperative risk-reducing strategies include appropriate perioperative antibiotics, correct topical preparation, maintaining normothermia, and minimizing blood loss.

Data collection included history of known comorbidities, medications, vital signs and laboratory values (admission and during the hospitalization). Outcomes include inflammatory burden (composite scores for multiple markers of inflammation), acute kidney injury (AKI), admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Results Of the 300 patients in the study cohort, 80 patients (26.7%) had history of ACEI or ARB use prior to admission, with 61.3% (49/80) of these patients continuing the medications during hospitalization. Multivariable analysis revealed that the history of ACEI or ARB use prior to hospitalization was not associated with worse outcomes. In addition, the continuation of these agents during hospitalization was not associated with an increase in adverse outcomes and predicted fewer ICU admissions (OR=0.25, 0.08-0.81) with a decrease in the severity of inflammatory burden (peak CRP (6.93.1mg/dl, p=0.03) and peak inflammation score (2.31.1unit reduction, p=0.04)).

The variables studied were sex, age, type of IEI, comorbidities (number and type), treatment in use for IEI, clinical manifestations and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: 121 patients were included: 55.4% female, ages from six months to 74 yo (median age = 25.1 yo). Most patients had predominantly antibody deficiency (n = 53). The infection was mostly asymptomatic (n = 21) and mild (n = 66), and one child had multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). We could not observe sex-related susceptibility, and there was a weak correlation between age and severity of infection. The number of comorbidities was higher in severe cases, particularly bronchiectasis and cardiopathy. There were no severe cases in hereditary angioedema patients. Six patients aged 2 to 74 years died, three of them with antibody deficiency. CONCLUSION: The outcome was mild in most patients, but the Case Fatality Ratio was higher than in the general population. However, the type of IEI was not a determining factor for severity, except for complement deficiencies linked to milder COVID-19.

However, due to variations in the inactivation effects across different viruses, quantitative evaluations of the inactivation profile of SARS-CoV-2 by DUV-LED irradiation need to be performed. In the present study, we quantify the irradiation dose of DUV-LED necessary to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we determined the culture media suitable for the irradiation of SARS-CoV-2 and optimized the irradiation apparatus using commercially available DUV-LEDs that operate at a center wavelength of 265, 280, or 300 nm. Under these conditions, we successfully analyzed the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and the irradiation dose of the DUV-LEDs at each wavelength without irrelevant biological effects. In conclusion, total doses of 1.8 mJ/cm2 for 265 nm, 3.0 mJ/cm2 for 280 nm, and 23 mJ/cm2 for 300 nm are required to inactivate 99.9% of SARS-CoV-2.

Although eosinophilic airway inflammation is an important trait in asthma of children, the roles of pulmonary eosinophils in the disease have been inadequately understood. Here, we show that RSV infection in neonatal mice causes eosinophilia after allergen stimulation. We showed that RSV infection in neonatal mice exacerbated allergic asthma to allergen stimulation that was accompanied with increased detection of eosinophils in the lungs. In addition, we also detected accumulation of ILC2, CD4(+) T cells, and macrophages. Importantly, adoptive transfer of eosinophils from asthmatic mice with early-life RSV infection exacerbated pulmonary pathologies associated with allergic respiratory inflammation in naive mice in response to foreign antigen. The induction of asthmatic symptoms including AHR, tracheal wall thickening, and mucus production became more severe after further stimulation in those mice. The expression of antigen presentation-related molecules like CD80, CD86, and especially MHC II was markedly induced in eosinophils from OVA-stimulated asthmatic mice. The accumulation of CD4(+) T cells in the lungs was also significantly increased as a result of adoptive transfer of eosinophils.

While the immune system plays a key role in the survival of patients to viral infections, in COVID-19, there is a hyperinflammatory immune response evoked by all the immune cells, such as neutrophils, monocytes, and includes release of various cytokines, resulting in an exaggerated immune response, named cytokine storm. This severe, dysregulated immune response causes multi-organ damage, which eventually leads to high mortality. One of the most important components of hypersensitivity is immunoglobulin E (IgE), which plays a major role in susceptibility to respiratory infections and can lead to the activation of mast cells. There is also a negative association between IgE and IFN-, which can reduce Toll-like receptor (TLR) nine receptor expression and TLR-7 signaling to disrupt IFN production. Moreover, anti-IgE drugs such as omalizumab reduces the severity and duration of COVID-19. In addition to its anti-IgE effect, omalizumab inhibits inflammatory cells such as neutrophils. Hence, blockade of IgE may have clinical utility as an immunotherapy for COVID-19.","output":"Anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies as potential treatment in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exotic animals, including small herbivores, are increasing in popularity as companion animals.

Therefore, any of these animals presented as an emergency case must be carefully evaluated for chronic underlying illness. Cardiovascular emergency and critical care principles are similar across all mammalian species. However, specialized techniques and adaptations are occasionally required because of the unique physiology and natural behaviors of these animals. It is essential to evaluate and stabilize these patients before attempting definitive diagnostic plans. Emergency cardiovascular presentations, as in other mammals, consist of congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, pericardial effusion, and toxicities that can result in cardiac and pulmonary arrest.

Digital therapeutic care (DTC) programs provide a scalable, universally accessible, and low-cost approach to the multidisciplinary treatment of LBP. Moreover, novel decision support interventions such as personalized feedback messages, push notifications, and data-driven activity recommendations amplify DTC by guiding the user through the program while aiming to increase overall engagement and sustainable behavior change. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to synthesize recent scientific literature on the impact of DTC apps for people with LBP and outline the implementation of add-on decision support interventions, including their effect on user retention and attrition rates. METHODS: We searched bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database, from March 1, 2016, to October 15, 2020, in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and conducted this review based on related previously published systematic reviews. Besides randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we also included study designs with the evidence level of at least a retrospective comparative study. This enables the consideration of real-world user-generated data and provides information regarding the adoption and effectiveness of DTC apps in a real-life setting. For the appraisal of the risk of bias, we used the Risk of Bias 2 Tool and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions Tool for the RCTs and nonrandomized trials, respectively. The included studies were narratively synthesized regarding primary and secondary outcome measures, DTC components, applied decision support interventions, user retention, and attrition rates. RESULTS: We retrieved 1388 citations, of which 12 studies are included in this review. Of the 12 studies, 6 (50%) were RCTs and 6 (50%) were nonrandomized trials. In all included studies, lower pain levels and increased functionality compared with baseline values were observed in the DTC intervention group. A between-group comparison revealed significant improvements in pain and functionality levels in 67% (4/6) of the RCTs. The study population was mostly homogeneous, with predominantly female, young to middle-aged participants of normal to moderate weight. The methodological quality assessment revealed moderate to high risks of biases, especially in the nonrandomized trials. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review demonstrates the benefits of DTC for people with LBP. There is also evidence that decision support interventions benefit overall engagement with the app and increase participants ability to self-manage their recovery process. Finally, including retrospective evaluation studies of real-world user-generated data in future systematic reviews of digital health intervention trials can reveal new insights into the benefits, challenges, and real-life adoption of DTC programs.","output":"Digital Therapeutic Care and Decision Support Interventions for People With Low Back Pain: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After years of using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate scientific applications in fields as varied as tomography, computer vision, climate modeling, digital forensics, geospatial databases, particle physics, radio astronomy, and localization microscopy, we noticed a number of technical, socio-technical, and non-technical challenges that Research Software Engineers (RSEs) may run into.

Infant C(3)H mice, however, developed infection and died from mouse hepatitis virus when minimal infectious doses of virus were given to them. There was a delay in the time of death compared to that of the genetically susceptible strain, and the virus recovered from these mice had increased pathogenicity for C(3)H mice. The ontogeny of resistance to hepatitis in the C(3)H mice thus progresses from delayed susceptibility to complete resistance as the age of the host increases. It is reflected in increased resistance of macrophages derived in vitro from liver cultures of infant mice of different ages. This increase in resistance with age was reduced by maintaining the cultures for a longer period of time before inoculation, or by increasing the number of explants in a given culture. Resistant cells were uniformly furnished by mice age 16 days, or more. It is concluded that a process of maturation of resistance of the cells takes place after the mice are born, but that this does not continue under in vitro conditions, and that it may be modified by the environment of the cells.","output":"ONTOGENY OF MACROPHAGE RESISTANCE TO MOUSE HEPATITIS IN VIVO AND IN VITRO"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduccin: las redes sociales (RS), como plataformas tecnolgicas, les permiten a las personas y a las instituciones interactuar, compartir contenidos y formar comunidades.

METHODS: We extracted publicly available data from official websites, summarized the containment measures implemented in China and India, and assessed their effectiveness. RESULTS: China has responded to the COVID-19 outbreak with strict public health containment measures, including lockdown of Wuhan city, active case tracing, and large-scale testing, ultimately preventing a large increase in daily new cases and maintaining a low mortality rate per million population (as of May 5, 2021, daily new cases were 11 and mortality rate per million population was 3.37). India, although imposing a national lockdown to control the pandemic, has not implemented strict testing, tracking, and quarantine measures due to the overburdened healthcare system. Combined with massive lockdown, it has accelerated human mobility and exacerbated the epidemic, resulting in a rapid increase in daily new cases and a high mortality rate per million population (as of May 5, 2021, daily new cases were 412,431 and mortality rate per million population was 166.79). CONCLUSION: China and India implemented public health containment measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic based on their national situations. Meanwhile, daily new cases and mortality of COVID-19 also were affected by environmental and socioeconomic.

METHODS: Literature related to pathology education, pathology services in low-resource settings, and application of digital tools to pathology education was reviewed for trends and training gaps. Publications covering pathology manpower and cancer incidence worldwide were also included to assess needs. RESULTS: Pandemic-related virtual teaching has produced abundant online training materials. Pathology learning resources in low- to middle-income countries remain considerably constrained and dampen pathology manpower growth to meet current needs. Projected increases in disease burden toward the developing world thus pose a major challenge. Digital pathology resources have expanded and are beginning to appear beyond the developed countries. CONCLUSIONS: This circumstance offers a unique opportunity to leverage digital teaching resources to enhance and equitize training internationally, potentially sufficient to meet the rising wave of noncommunicable diseases. We propose four next steps to take advantage of the current opportunity: curate and organize digital training materials, invest in the digital pathology infrastructure for education and clinical care, expand student exposure to pathology through virtual electives, and develop further competency-based certification pathways.","output":"Flattening the World of Pathology Education and Training and Shortening the Curve of Pathology Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: EUS-guided gallbladder drainage (EUS-GBD) is emerging as a valuable treatment for acute cholecystitis (AC) in patients unfit for surgery. When lumen-apposing metal stents are used, large-caliber access to the gallbladder allows for subsequent direct peroral endoscopic cholecystoscopy (POEC) and eventual cholecystolithotomy (CL), offering a potentially curative solution for frailer patients. The aim of this series was to evaluate the outcome of these procedures in oncologic patients experiencing AC, with a specific focus on chemotherapy continuity. METHODS: A prospective registry of all consecutive therapeutic EUS procedures performed in the San Raffaele Institute between December 2020 and April 2021 was searched for EUS-GBD + POEC-CL performed in chemotherapy candidates. Clinical and technical variables were prospectively registered, as were days of chemotherapy delay and postprocedural outcomes. RESULTS: Three consecutive patients with a diagnosis of a malignancy (2 pancreatic cancers and 1 severe myeloproliferative disease with skeletal lesions) experienced AC and were primarily treated by EUS-GBD. After 4 weeks, they were systematically scheduled for POEC-CL and lumen-apposing metal stent exchange for a double-pigtail plastic stent. All procedures and revisions were successful, with rapid clinical improvement. All gallbladders were cleared of food debris and stones between 3 and 15 mm using grasping forceps, polypectomy snares, Dormia baskets, and mechanical lithotripsy. One mild adverse event without any clinical consequence was registered during POEC-CL. Revisions did not interfere with the chemotherapy schedule. Technical variables (eg, gastric vs duodenal drainage or need for coaxial double-pigtail plastic stent) are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: EUS-GBD and subsequent POEC-CL allows a highly effective and minimally invasive solution for AC. These initial experiences promote further evaluation of this approach for all those individuals in whom surgical interventions are undesirable, such as oncologic patients whose prognosis depends on chemotherapy continuity, although further prospective confirmation in this setting should be pursued.","output":"EUS-guided gallbladder drainage and subsequent peroral endoscopic cholecystolithotomy: A tool to reduce chemotherapy discontinuation in neoplastic patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The essay analyses the effects of COVID-19 in relation to the cohabitation and the rights of visitation of the non-custodial parent of the children Particular attention is then focused on the application problems of the death of the spouse due to coronavirus and the right of the survivor to live in the family home ? 2020 Ibero-American Law Institute All rights reserved","output":"Housing and confinement.

We compare a paralinguistics-based and a spectrograms-based approach for the task at hand. While the former extracts paralinguistic features from filtered versions of the original speech samples, the latter exploits the spectrogram representations of the speech samples containing specific ranges of frequencies. The machine learning techniques investigated for the paralinguistics-based approach include Support Vector Machines (SVM), and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). For the spectrograms-based approach, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our experiments are conducted on the Mask Augsburg Speech Corpus (MASC), released for the Interspeech 2020 Computational Paralinguistics Challenge (COMPARE).

Unfortunately, due to insufficient resources and awareness in underdeveloped countries, proper and timely PD detection is highly challenged. Besides, all PD patients symptoms are neither the same nor they all become pronounced at the same stage of the illness. Therefore, this work aims to combine more than one symptom (rest tremor and voice degradation) by collecting data remotely using smartphones and detect PD with the help of a cloud-based machine learning system for telemonitoring the PD patients in the developing countries. METHOD: This proposed system receives rest tremor and vowel phonation data acquired by smartphones with built-in accelerometer and voice recorder sensors. The data are primarily collected from diagnosed PD patients and healthy people for building and optimizing machine learning models that exhibit higher performance. After that, data from newly suspected PD patients are collected, and the trained algorithms are evaluated to detect PD. Based on the majority-vote from those algorithms, PD-detected patients are connected with a nearby neurologist for consultation. Upon receiving patients feedback after being diagnosed by the neurologist, the system may update the model by retraining using the latest data. Also, the system requests the detected patients periodically to upload new data to track their disease progress. RESULT: The highest accuracy in PD detection using offline data was [Formula: see text] from voice data and [Formula: see text] from tremor data when used separately. In both cases, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) gave the highest accuracy over support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes (NB). The application of maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) feature selection method showed that by selecting different feature sets based on the patients gender, we could improve the detection accuracy. This studys novelty is the application of ensemble averaging on the combined decisions generated from the analysis of voice and tremor data. The average accuracy of PD detection becomes [Formula: see text] when ensemble averaging was performed on majority-vote from kNN, SVM, and NB. CONCLUSION: The proposed system can detect PD using a cloud-based system for computation, data preserving, and regular monitoring of voice and tremor samples captured by smartphones. Thus, this system can be a solution for healthcare authorities to ensure the older populations accessibility to a better medical diagnosis system in the developing countries, especially in the pandemic situation like COVID-19, when in-person monitoring is minimal.","output":"Telemonitoring Parkinsons disease using machine learning by combining tremor and voice analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A leptina, uma citocina produzida pelas clulas adiposas, possui a??o na reprodu??o dos animais promovendo a puberdade, foliculognese e oognese, ciclo estral e auxiliando na fecunda??o.

Recent surveillance studies have implicated bats as potential reservoirs for a number of viral pathogens, including coronaviruses and Ebola viruses. Caliciviridae represent a major viral family contributing to emerging diseases in both human and animal populations and have been recently identified in bats. In this study, we blended metagenomics, phylogenetics, homology modeling, and in vitro assays to characterize two novel bat calicivirus (BtCalV) capsid sequences, corresponding to strain BtCalV/A10/USA/2009, identified in Perimyotis subflavus near Little Orleans, MD, and bat norovirus. We observed that bat norovirus formed virus-like particles and had epitopes and receptor-binding patterns similar to those of human noroviruses. To determine whether these observations stretch across multiple bat caliciviruses, we characterized a novel bat calicivirus, BtCalV/A10/USA/2009.

Impaired binding of factor X may be due to an undiagnosed mutation in affected individuals. Options to test this mechanism experimentally and potential remedial actions to resolve the hazard are described. This mechanism offers a remedial route to address concerns about the safety of these vaccines, which are otherwise well-positioned to deliver global Covid-19 immunity across diverse healthcare economies.","output":"Proposed mechanism for rare thrombotic events after use of some Covid-19 vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Invasive fungal disease (IFD) leads to increased mortality, morbidity, and costs of treatment in patients with immunosuppressive conditions. The definitive diagnosis of IFD relies on the isolation of the causative fungal agents through microscopy, culture, or nucleic acid testing in tissue samples obtained from the sites of the disease. Biopsy is not always feasible or safe to be undertaken in immunocompromised hosts at risk of IFD. Noninvasive diagnostic techniques are, therefore, needed for the diagnosis and treatment response assessment of IFD. The available techniques that identify fungal-specific antigens in biological samples for diagnosing IFD have variable sensitivity and specificity. They also have limited utility in response assessment. Imaging has, therefore, been applied for the noninvasive detection of IFD. Morphologic imaging with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most applied technique. These techniques are neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific for the early diagnosis of IFD. Morphologic changes evaluated by CT and MRI occur later in the disease course and during recovery after successful treatment. These modalities may, therefore, not be ideal for early diagnosis and early response to therapy determination. Radionuclide imaging allows for targeting the host response to pathogenic fungi or specific structures of the pathogen itself. This makes radionuclide imaging techniques suitable for the early diagnosis and treatment response assessment of IFD. In this review, we aimed to discuss the interplay of host immunity, immunosuppression, and the occurrence of IFD. We also discuss the currently available radionuclide probes that have been evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies for their ability to detect IFD.","output":"Radionuclide Imaging of Invasive Fungal Disease in Immunocompromised Hosts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza viruses are a major threat to human health globally. In addition to further improving vaccine prophylaxis, disease management through antiviral therapeutics constitutes an important component of the current intervention strategy to prevent advance to complicated disease and reduce case-fatality rates. Standard-of-care is treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors that prevent viral dissemination. In 2018, the first mechanistically new influenza drug class for the treatment of uncomplicated seasonal influenza in 2 decades was approved for human use. Targeting the PA endonuclease subunit of the viral polymerase complex, this class suppresses viral replication. However, the genetic barrier against viral resistance to both drug classes is low, pre-existing resistance is observed in circulating strains, and resistant viruses are pathogenic and transmit efficiently. Addressing the resistance problem has emerged as an important objective for the development of next-generation influenza virus therapeutics.

The present study aims to investigate the role of lymphocyte non-specific function detection for TB diagnosis in clinical practice. METHODS: A total of 208 participants including 49 ATB patients, 64 LTBI individuals, and 95 healthy controls were recruited at Tongji hospital from January 2019 to October 2020. All subjects were tested with lymphocyte non-specific function detection and T-SPOT assay. RESULTS: Significantly positive correlation existed between lymphocyte non-specific function and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) spot number. CD4(+) T cell non-specific function showed the potential for differentiating patients with negative T-SPOT results from those with positive T-SPOT results with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.732 (95% CI, 0.572-0.893). The non-specific function of CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, and NK cells was found significantly lower in ATB patients than in LTBI individuals. The AUCs presented by CD4(+) T cell non-specific function, CD8(+) T cell non-specific function, and NK cell non-specific function for discriminating ATB patients from LTBI individuals were 0.845 (95% CI, 0.767-0.925), 0.770 (95% CI, 0.683-0.857), and 0.691 (95% CI, 0.593-0.789), respectively. Application of multivariable logistic regression resulted in the combination of CD4(+) T cell non-specific function, NK cell non-specific function, and culture filtrate protein-10 (CFP-10) spot number as the optimally diagnostic model for differentiating ATB from LTBI. The AUC of the model in distinguishing between ATB and LTBI was 0.939 (95% CI, 0.898-0.981). The sensitivity and specificity were 83.67% (95% CI, 70.96%-91.49%) and 90.63% (95% CI, 81.02%-95.63%) with the threshold as 0.57. Our established model showed superior performance to TB-specific antigen (TBAg)/PHA ratio in stratifying TB infection status.

Consequently, the present study was designed to assess the intertwining impact of coadministration of cefepime (CP, a wide spectrum antibiotic) and diclofenac sodium (DF, an NSAID) on rat's liver, kidney, and testes. Rats received saline, CP (180 mg/kg/day, IM), DF (10 mg/kg/day, IM), or a combination of CP and DF. After 14 days, CP or DF induced tissue damage expressed by marked biochemical alterations in hepatic and renal function tests. Besides this, disrupted lipid metabolism and testosterone levels along with significant histological changes in hepatic, renal, and testicular tissues were noticed. A significant increase in malondialdehyde and decreases in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities alongside significant upregulated caspase 3 expression in tissues following CP or DF treatment suggested a bearable influence of oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and cell death. Accordingly, the simultaneous therapy of CP and DF evoked more obvious tissue damage than their individual treatment. Overall, data concluded that concurrent use of CP and DF in medical practice is a worrisome matter, so it should be done cautiously to avoid synergistic deleterious outcomes.","output":"Cefepime and diclofenac sodium combined treatment-potentiated multiple organ injury: Role of oxidative damage and disrupted lipid metabolism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IL-6 is an important interleukin associated with inflammation and several diseases such as cancer.

To examine their usefulness as capture and reporting probes for the IL-6 biosensing, the five peptides and their interaction with IL-6 were studied in saline aqueous solution. Molecular docking, MD, and MM-PBSA were used to investigate the affinity and stability of these complexes. The conformational changes, the distance between the mass centers, the gyration radii, and the numbers of hydrogen bonds were analyzed to select the most suitable candidates. Three peptides, namely CTE17, CAY15 and CSE25, have the highest affinities presenting significant numbers of residues that have contact frequencies greater than 50% of simulation run time and are the most promising candidates.

The index patient was a 50-year old obese,normotensive, diabetic (10 years duration, HbA1c-6.6% on SU, metformin, sitagliptin and dapagliflozin) male. TSH was suppressed (0.02 mIU/L), FT4 (3.06 ng/dl, upper limit of normal-1.48ng/dl) and FT3 (3.9 pg/ml, upper limit of normal-3.71 pg/ml) were elevated. Total T4 and T3 were normal. HS-CRP was markedly elevated. IL-6 and TBG were not estimated. Cervical USG revealed diffuse hypoechogenecity of thyroid gland and thyromegaly. There was reduced uptake in thyroid scan (technetium). The patient became afebrile after 4 days of initiation of 30 mg prednisolone (tapered by 10 mg every 5 days). The initial tachycardia reverted to sinus rhythm with marked reduction of neck tenderness. This case highlights certain considerations for SAT associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Firstly, it can present with PUO (first case report). Secondly, it may be associated with normal total T4 and T3 which can happen due to reduced TBG consequent upon increased IL-6.[4] References: 1.

METHODS Regression models and moving averages were used to predict expected premature mortality per the ICD-10 during 2020 using historical data sets. Predicted values were then compared to recorded premature mortality to identify changes in mortality trends. RESULTS Seasonal increased mortality was found within neurological diseases. Infectious diseases, tumours and cardiac disease mortality rates decreased compared to expected outcome.

Risk factors for dementia such as hypertension and diabetes are more common in Black, Asian, and other ethnic minorities. There are also marked ethnic inequalities in care seeking, likelihood of diagnosis, and uptake of treatments for dementia. Nevertheless, ethnic differences in dementia incidence and prevalence remain under-explored. OBJECTIVE To examine published peer-reviewed observational studies comparing age-specific or age-adjusted incidence or prevalence rates of dementia between at least two ethnic groups. METHODS We searched seven databases on 1 September 2019 using search terms for ethnicity, dementia, and incidence or prevalence. We included population-based studies comparing incidence or prevalence of dementia after accounting for age of at least two ethnic groups in adults aged 18 or more. Meta-analysis was conducted for eligible ethnic comparisons. RESULTS We included 12 cohort studies and seven cross-sectional studies. Thirteen were from the US, and two studies each from the UK, Singapore, and Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China. The pooled risk ratio for dementia incidence obtained from four studies comparing Black and White ethnic groups was 1.33 (95% CI 1.07-1.65; I-squared = 58.0%).

We aimed to determine the relative frequency and predictive value of single symptoms for paediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections from an Ottawa COVID-19 assessment centre from October 2020 through April 2021. Overall, 46.3% (n=10,688) of pediatric encounters were for single symptoms, and 2.7% of these tested positive. The most common presenting single symptoms were rhinorrhea (31.8%), cough (17.4%) and fever (14.0%).

The process of understanding the condition brought to light certain organ involvement like pulmonary or kidney damage or endocrine disbalances, while connection to other types of organ impairment remain unclear. SARS-CoV-2 has previously been incriminated in cardiac involvement, ranging from mild symptoms to more severe occurrences such as myocarditis, arrythmias or heart failure, thus complicating the acute-phase management and worsening patients' prognosis. Despite being reported as an acute manifestation in critical COVID-19, cardiac tamponade seems to also occur as a \\"long- COVID19\\" complication. The latter is a distinct yet unclear entity associated with remanent fatigue or cough, but more severe sequelae like vasculitis or polyneuropathy can occsur. Case report We report the case of a 42-year-old patient admitted in the intensive care unit for severe respiratory and renal dysfunction one month after an initial mild episode of COVID-19. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on admission was negative. Initial imaging through CT and heart ultrasound revealed the presence of pericardial effusion but no signs of tamponade were initially obvious. Twelve hours later, the patient's state deteriorated with cardiocirculatory failure and signs of obstructive shock. Agents responsible for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) such as influenza A and B, adenovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, coxsackie virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae or parainfluenza viruses were ruled out. Surprisingly, RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 came back positive, although the initial test was negative. Repeated imaging confirmed massive circumferential pericardial effusion for which emergency pericardiocentesis was performed. Fluid was an exudate and histopathology reported chronic inflammation. RT-PCR testing for Mycoplasma tuberculosis in the pericardial tissue came back negative. Conclusions The case is to our knowledge among the first to report cardiac tamponade one month after mild COVID-19 infection. The aim of this case report is to raise awareness in the medical community on the possibility of severe complications targeting major organs in the long-COVID-19 phase.","output":"Cardiac tamponade - an unexpected \\"long COVID-19\\" complication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater surveillance is a promising tool for population-level monitoring of the spread of infectious diseases, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Different from clinical specimens, viruses in community-scale wastewater samples need to be concentrated before detection because viral RNA is highly diluted. The present study evaluated eleven different virus concentration methods for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater. First, eight concentration methods of different principles were compared using spiked wastewater at a starting volume of 30 mL. Ultracentrifugation was the most effective method with a viral recovery efficiency of 25  6%. The second-best option, AlCl3 precipitation method, yielded a lower recovery efficiency, only approximately half that of the ultracentrifugation method. Second, the potential of increasing the sensitivity of the method was explored using three concentration methods starting with a larger volume of 1000 mL. Although ultracentrifugation using a large volume outperformed the other two large-volume methods, it only yielded a comparable method sensitivity as the ultracentrifugation using a small volume (30 mL). Thus, ultracentrifugation using less volume of wastewater is more preferable considering the sampling processing throughput. Third, a comparison of two viral RNA extraction methods showed that the lysis-buffer-based extraction method resulted in higher viral recovery efficiencies, with cycle threshold (Ct) values 0.9C4.2 lower than those obtained for the acid-guanidinium-phenol-based method using spiked samples. These results were further confirmed by using positive wastewater samples concentrated by ultracentrifugation and extracted separately by the two viral RNA extraction methods. In summary, concentration using ultracentrifugation followed by the lysis buffer-based extraction method enables sensitive and robust detection of SARS-CoV-2 for wastewater surveillance.","output":"Comparison of virus concentration methods and RNA extraction methods for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This policy brief offers a short discussion on how workplace bullying is a human rights violation when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is considered.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: National Cancer Database. METHODS: Patients receiving primary radiation or surgery for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma were included from 2004 to 2017. The primary outcomes were the diagnosis-to-treatment interval (DTI) and 5-year survival. Variables of prolonged DTI (>30 days) were assessed via logistic regression models. Survival was then assessed through Cox proportional hazards models. Candidate variables for both outcomes included age, sex, race, ethnicity, distance to treatment facility, insurance coverage, treatment facility type, TNM T stage, nodal status, and DTI (in models estimating survival). RESULTS: An overall 136,203 patients with laryngeal cancer were identified, from which 51,747 remained after exclusions were applied: 18,499 received primary surgery and 33,248 received primary radiation. Being a member of a racial or ethnic minority, advanced age, female sex, 30 miles from treatment facility, lack of insurance, treatment at an academic cancer center, and primary radiation were associated with a prolonged DTI. However, in spite of a faster DTI, treatment at a community cancer center was independently associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio, 1.2; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite being associated with prolonged DTI, receiving treatment at a high-volume academic facility was associated with significantly improved survival.

The data contain information on the incidence of the disease for the first 41 days of the outbreak started on March 7, 2020. Log-linear model has been used to estimate the progression of the COVID-19 infection in Tamil Nadu. Separate models were employed to model the growth rate and decay rate of the disease. Spatial Poisson regression was used to identify the high-risk areas in the state. Results : The models estimated the doubling time for the number of cases in growth phase as 3.96 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.70, 9.42) days and halving time in the decay phase as 12.08 (95% CI: 6.79, 54.78) days. The estimated median reproduction numbers were 1.88 (min = 1.09, max = 2.51) and 0.76 (min = 0.56, max = 0.99) in the growth and decay phases, respectively.

Oral care research and knowledge about prerequisites and obstacles is extensive. However, there is a lack of knowledge about how nursing staff in short-term care units describe their satisfaction about provided oral care in order to maintain older people's oral health. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe how nursing staff perceive their satisfaction of oral care provided for older people in short-term care units and to identify oral care improvements. METHODS: This study reports on the results of two open-ended questions that were part of a larger study. Informants (n = 54) were nursing staff working in the involved short-term care units in municipalities from both densely and sparsely populated regions in central and northern Sweden. The answers to the open-ended questions were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: The analysis yielded one main category; Working together to improve satisfaction with older people's oral care and four subcategories: Older people's oral health, Consideration and respect for the older person's autonomy, Having access to adequate products, and Working together in the same direction. CONCLUSION: Identification of older people's oral health problems together with adequate nursing intervention will increase older people's health outcomes and quality of life. However, regardless of work role, the nursing staff might have difficulty changing their behavior or transforming intentions into actions. Oral care is a complicated and proactive practice that requires nursing staff's attention as well as both educational and organizational initiatives.

Assisted dying is the act of deliberately providing medical assistance to another person who wishes to end their own life. Currently, in Ireland, it is illegal to provide such assistance to people with WTD or suicidal ideation. However, a new bill that would legalise assisted dying for those with terminal illnesses, the Dying with Dignity Bill 2020, is due to be considered by lawmakers in Ireland in the coming months. In order to inform discussion around this complex issue, we examine the prevalence and longitudinal course of WTD in a large population-representative sample of older people. Methods To define WTD, participants were asked: In the last month, have you felt that you would rather be dead? Depressive symptoms were measured using the CES-D. Mortality data were compiled by linking administrative death records to individual-level survey data from the study. Results At Wave 1, 3.5% of participants (279/8,174) reported WTD. Both persistent loneliness (OR 5.73 (95% CI 3.41C9.64)) and depressive symptoms (OR 6.12 (95% CI 4.33C8.67)) were independently associated with WTD. Of participants who first reported WTD at Wave 1 or 2, 72% did not report WTD when reassessed after 2 years, and the prevalence of depressive symptoms (?44%) and loneliness (?19%) was more likely to decline in this group at follow-up. Fifteen per cent of participants expressing WTD at Wave 1 died during a 6-year follow-up. Conclusion WTD amongst community-dwelling older people is frequently transient and is strongly linked with the course of depressive symptoms and loneliness. An enhanced focus on improving access to mental health care and addressing social isolation in older people should therefore be a public health priority, particularly in the current context of the Covid-19 pandemic.","output":"The wish to Die amongst Older People in Ireland in the Context of the Dying with Dignity Bill"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Travel restriction measures have been widely implemented to curb the continued spread of COVID-19 during the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations.

The solution algorithm determines the minimum locomotive fleet size based on the optimal train rescheduling results; it then reduces the traction idle time of locomotives. In response to the uncertainty of COVID-19, two tailored approaches were also designed to recover and remove operation lines, which can insert and cut operation lines based on the results of locomotive assignment.

Neurobiological evidence suggests that people affected by BED show difficulties along the spectrum of impulsivity, including inhibitory control impairments and highlights the potential of novel treatment approaches directly targeting inhibitory control, including cognitive training approaches and non-invasive brain stimulation. METHODS: ACCElect is a prospective, randomized controlled pilot trial investigating a novel, food-related inhibitory control training combined with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). 40 patients with BED will be randomly assigned to receive the training either combined with verum or with sham stimulation (control condition). The inhibitory control training is based on principles of the antisaccade paradigm and comprises six training sessions over two weeks. Core aims are the investigation of feasibility and clinically relevant effects of a tDCS-enhanced inhibitory control training in BED patients and the establishment of a data basis for a larger efficacy trial. The primary clinical endpoint is binge-eating (BE) frequency in terms of changes in BE episodes four weeks after treatment termination as compared to baseline. Key secondary outcomes comprise ED pathology and general psychopathology, inhibitory control capacities, quality of life as well as acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention. DISCUSSION: The results of the present trial will contribute to the development of novel neurobiologically informed treatment approaches for patients suffering from BED.

The pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been well described in the literature. Two similar human coronaviruses that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) are known to cause disease in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Emerging evidence suggests COVID-19 has neurologic consequences as well. Observations: This review serves to summarize available information regarding coronaviruses in the nervous system, identify the potential tissue targets and routes of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system, and describe the range of clinical neurological complications that have been reported thus far in COVID-19 and their potential pathogenesis. Viral neuroinvasion may be achieved by several routes, including transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory nerve, infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier. The most common neurologic complaints in COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, and headache, but other diseases, such as stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizure, and encephalopathy, have also been reported. Conclusions and Relevance: Recognition and understanding of the range of neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 may lead to improved clinical outcomes and better treatment algorithms. Further neuropathological studies will be crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease in the central nervous system, and longitudinal neurologic and cognitive assessment of individuals after recovery from COVID-19 will be crucial to understand the natural history of COVID-19 in the central nervous system and monitor for any long-term neurologic sequelae.","output":"Neuropathogenesis and Neurologic Manifestations of the Coronaviruses in the Age of Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the Netherlands, for coastal and inland water applications, wave modelling with SWAN on structured computational grids has become a main ingredient.

Protection of this group from severe COVID-19 is therefore important. However, according to available vaccination guidelines, one should consider to postpone vaccination of patients on or early after chemotherapy, hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HCT) or with graft versus host disease, because of anticipated poor efficacy. Based on previous (non-COVID-19) vaccination studies among hematology patients, we hypothesized that a significant group of patients may acquire sufficient protection following COVID-19 vaccination, despite disease and therapy related immunodeficiencies. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study with 17 cohorts of hematology patients of particular risk for severe COVID-19 who are considered to have no or limited benefit from vaccination. We evaluated humoral immune responses following 2 doses (28 days apart) of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna/Spikevax) in 722 patients, at baseline and 28 days after each vaccination as SARS-COV-2 S1- (spike)-specific serum IgG antibody concentrations by bead-based multiplex immune assay. The threshold for adequate antibody response is set at 300 binding antibody units (BAU)/ml according to the international WHO standard, and is associated with virus plaque reducing neutralization test titers of 40 PRNT 50. This study is registered as EudraCT 2021-001072-41, NL76768.029.21. Results: Patient cohorts and corresponding vaccine responses are depicted in Table 1. Vaccine efficacy, as measured by antibody concentration, 4 weeks after the 2 nd mRNA-1273 vaccination was available for 691 out of 722 participants. The majority of patients (389/691;56%) obtained an S1 antibody titer that is considered adequate (300 BAU/ml). Twenty-nine percent of patients (198/691) did not seroconvert (S1 antibody titer <10 BAU/ml), while the remaining 15% (104/691) did seroconvert but not to sufficient levels (10-300 BAU/ml). Adequate responses were observed in the majority of patients with sickle cell disease using hydroxyurea, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) on or early after high dose chemotherapy, patients with myeloproliferative disorders on ruxolitinib, patients with multiple myeloma (MM), including those on daratumumab and those early after high-dose melphalan and autologous HCT, patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and patients with chronic GvHD. Insufficient or absent antibody responses were observed in the majority of AML patients receiving hypomethylating agents, CLL patients on ibrutinib, patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) during or shortly after rituximab-chemotherapy or following BEAM chemotherapy and autologous HCT, allogeneic HCT recipients <6 months after transplantation, and CAR-T cell therapy recipients. However, even in these low-responder groups considerable numbers of patients did mount sufficient antibody titers. In others, titers increased after each of both vaccinations, suggesting that booster vaccination may enhance antibody titers to sufficient levels (Figure 1). Conclusion: Vaccination with mRNA-1273 had significant efficacy in severely immunocompromised hematology patients. Adequate humoral immune responses after two dose vaccination were reached in the majority of patients receiving therapy for sickle cell disease, MPD, MM, CML and AML, in patients early after HCT and in patients with GvHD. We are currently evaluating clinical and immunologic parameters that correlate with sufficient antibody responses, pseudovirus neutralization and SARS-COV-2-specific B and T cell numbers, phenotype and function. Per study design, all participants with absent or insufficient antibody responses (<300 BAU/ml) will receive a booster vaccination 5 months after initial vaccination, and antibody responses to booster vaccinations will be presented as well. Unlike currently available guidelines, COVID-19 vaccinatio should not be postponed. Moreover, as antibody titers increased after each of both vaccinations, booster vaccination of patients with absent or insufficient antibody responses seems warranted.

Nucleic acid testing of respiratory tract specimens for SARS-CoV-2 is the current gold standard for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the diagnostic accuracy of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid may be lower than optimal. The detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies should be used as a serological non-invasive tool for the diagnosis and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection. AIM: To investigate the diagnostic value of SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG and nucleic acid detection in COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 652 suspected COVID-19 patients, and 206 non-COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Integrated TCM and Western Medicine Hospital. Data on SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests and serum antibody tests were collected to investigate the diagnostic value of nucleic acid RT-PCR test kits and immunoglobulin (Ig)M/IgG antibody test kits. The 2 test was used to compare differences between categorical variables. A 95% confidence interval (CI) was provided by the Wilson score method. All analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States). RESULTS: Of the 652 suspected COVID-19 patients, 237 (36.3%) had positive nucleic acid tests, 311 (47.7%) were positive for IgM, and 592 (90.8%) were positive for IgG. There was a significant difference in the positive detection rate between the IgM and IgG test groups (P < 0.001).

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) models of mice were constructed by anterior cruciate ligament transection. The knee joint of mice was observed by histological staining, and the expression of USP7 was measured by immunohistochemistry staining. After knocking down or inhibiting USP7, chondrocyte proliferation was measured by histological staining and the CCK-8 assay; apoptosis was measured by western blot, flow cytometry, Caspase-3 activity, and TUNEL staining; and inflammatory response was measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA. The 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), siRNA of CHOP (si-CHOP), and QNZ were used to verify the signaling pathways. It was found that USP7 was reduced in the knee joint cartilage of OA mice. The knockdown of USP7 or its inhibitor decreased chondrocyte proliferation and accelerated apoptosis and inflammatory response under inflammation. The USP7 inhibitor exacerbated cartilage destruction in mice with OA. The knockdown of USP7 or its inhibitor activated the BiP-eIF2-ATF4-CHOP signaling of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and NF-B/p65 signaling. 4-PBA, si-CHOP, and QNZ partly reversed chondrocyte proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammatory response caused by USP7 knockdown. In conclusion, through inhibiting the BiP-eIF2-ATF4-CHOP signaling of ERS and NF-B/p65 signaling, USP7 promotes chondrocyte proliferation and suppresses the apoptosis and inflammatory response under TNF--induced inflammation.","output":"USP7 Attenuates Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and NF-B Signaling to Modulate Chondrocyte Proliferation, Apoptosis, and Inflammatory Response under Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT The importance of addressing the social determinants of health (SDOH) in medical education has been ubiquitously recognised. However, current pedagogical approaches are often limited by inadequate or ahistorical exploration of the fundamental causes of health inequity. Community-engaged pedagogy and structural competency frameworks advocate for progressing from passive SDOH education to directly discussing systemic aetiologies of health inequity through reciprocal partnership with marginalised communities. Herein, we describe the development and exploratory evaluation of a community-engaged structural competency curriculum implemented in 2019 at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Our curriculum explored the downstream impacts of sociopolitical structures on local health inequities. We engaged university, health system and community stakeholders throughout curriculum development, implementation and evaluation. Curricular components included didactic lectures, reflective writing assignments and a community-based, stakeholder-led experience in North Omaha. METHODS We used inductive thematic analysis to explore free-text responses to a post-curriculum survey. RESULTS Eighteen community stakeholders, eleven multidisciplinary UNMC facilitators, and all 132 first-year medical students were involved in the curriculum pilot, with 93% and 55.1% of students and faculty/community facilitators, respectively, responding to the post-session evaluation. Analysis revealed themes including widespread desire for community-engaged teaching, appreciation for the hyperlocal focus of curricular content and recognition of the importance of creating space for lived experiences of community members. DISCUSSION Co-created by a university-community coalition, our pilot findings highlight the crucial role of community-engaged pedagogy in promoting critical understanding of historic structural inequities and present-day health disparities.

The susceptibility of Omicron variant by vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are urgently needed for risk assessment. Methods Omicron variant strains HKU691 and HKU344-R346K were isolated from patients using TMPRSS2-overexpressing VeroE6 cells. Whole genome sequence was determined using nanopore sequencing. Neutralization susceptibility of ancestral lineage A virus and the Omicron, Delta and Beta variants to sera from 25 BNT162b2 and 25 Coronavac vaccine recipients was determined using a live virus microneutralization assay. Results The Omicron variant strain HKU344-R346K has an additional spike R346K mutation, which is present in 8.5% of strains in GISAID database. Only 20% and 24% of BNT162b2 recipients had detectable neutralizing antibody against the Omicron variant HKU691 and HKU344-R346K, respectively, while none of the Coronavac recipients had detectable neutralizing antibody titer against either Omicron isolates. For BNT162b2 recipients, the geometric mean neutralization antibody titers(GMT) of the Omicron variant isolates(5.43 and 6.42) were 35.7-39.9-fold lower than that of the ancestral virus(229.4), and the GMT of both omicron isolates were significantly lower than those of the beta and delta variants. There was no significant difference in the GMT between HKU691 and HKU344-R346K. Conclusions Omicron variant escapes neutralizing antibodies elicited by BNT162b2 or CoronaVac. The additional R346K mutation did not affect the neutralization susceptibility.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched databases and extracted comorbidities and symptoms from the included studies. We stratified the similar signs and symptoms in groups and on the basis of severity and compared them with stratified analysis. Individual case reports and case series with < 5 patients were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 163 studies with 43,187 patients were included. Mean age was 54.6 years. There were significantly fewer women in the study (43.9% vs. 56.1%, p < 0.0001). Prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities were hypertension (31.9%), obesity (27.9%), hyperlipidemia (26.4%), smoking (18.9%), diabetes mellitus (17.2%), atherosclerotic disease (9.2%) and arrhythmia (5.0%). The most frequently reported constitutional symptoms of COVID-19 were fever (73.9%), fatigue (33.4%), malaise (29.9%), myalgia and/or arthralgia (19.2%), generalized weakness (19.0%), and chills (11.3%). For the cardiovascular system, chest pain and/or tightness were most often reported (19.6%), followed by palpitations (5.2%). Hypertension and diabetes were common in severe disease. Obesity and congestive heart failure were not observed in any non-severe cases. Severe cases compared to non-severe cases more frequently had fever (87.8% vs. 58.5%, p < 0.001), shortness of breath (47.4% vs. 20.6%, p < 0.001), cough (66.8% vs. 62.9%, p < 0.001), sputum production (35.4% vs. 26.5%, p < 0.001) and rhinorrhea (32.2% vs. 7.3%, p < 0.001).

Systemic and airway inflammation play roles in the pathogenesis of COPD exacerbation. We hypothesized whether increased serum inflammatory biomarkers are associated with the clinical outcomes of COPD exacerbation caused by different infectious pathogens. METHODS COPD patients with exacerbation were recruited from a hospital emergency department during 2014-2015. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. Dyspnea, eosinopenia, consolidation, acidemia, and atrial fibrillation (DECAF) score was calculated for predicting mortality. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was carried out for respiratory viral assay from nasopharyngeal swabs, and sputum bacterial culture was also performed. Hospital mortality, invasive mechanical ventilation requirement, and length of hospital stay (LOS) were evaluated, and their associations with clinical characteristics, DECAF score, and serum biomarkers were examined. RESULTS A total of 62 COPD patients were enrolled. These patients were classified as Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 2, 3, and 4 in 12.9%, 6.4%, and 80.7% of cases, respectively. Isolated bacterial exacerbation was recovered in 30.6% of exacerbation episodes: Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most commonly identified bacteria. Viral pathogens and coinfections were noted in 9.6% and 16.1% of exacerbated patients, respectively. Influenza was the most commonly detected viral pathogen. Serum biomarkers and DECAF score for viruses, bacteria, coinfection, and noninfectious causes of exacerbations were similar. Neither DECAF score nor serum biomarkers were able to differentiate patients with and without mortality or requiring mechanical ventilation. Increased serum PCT was noted in patients with LOS 7 days when compared with those with LOS <7 days (0.38 ng/mL vs 0.1 ng/mL; P=0.035). CONCLUSION Increased serum PCT is associated with longer LOS in COPD exacerbation. However, CRP and DECAF score play limited roles in predicting clinical outcome and lack an association with causes of exacerbation.","output":"Serum inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes of COPD exacerbation caused by different pathogens."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on their phylogenetic position, Nearctic ground squirrels are closest relatives to the long-tailed ground squirrel Urocitellus undulates even though it has Palaearctic distribution.

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have shown its efficacy in the treatment of behaviour disorders. This study aims to evaluate an online mindfulness-based brief intervention skill named 'STOP (Stop, Take a Breath, Observe, Proceed) touching your face' in reducing face-touching behaviour. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be an online-based, randomised, controlled, trial. We will recruit 1000 participants, and will randomise and allocate participants 1:1 to the 'STOP touching your face' (both 750-word text and 5 min audio description by online) intervention group (n=500) and the wait-list control group (n=500). All participants will be asked to monitor and record their face-touching behaviour during a 60 min period before and after the intervention. Primary outcome will be the efficacy of short-term mindfulness-based 'STOP touching your face' intervention for reducing the frequency of face-touching. The secondary outcomes will be percentage of participants touching their faces; the correlation between the psychological traits of mindfulness and face-touching behaviour; and the differences of face-touching behaviour between left-handers and right-handers. Analysis of covariance, regression analysis, &#967;2 test, t-test, Pearson's correlations will be applied in data analysis. We will recruit 1000 participants from April to July 2020 or until the recruitment process is complete. The follow-up will be completed in July 2020.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web-based survey was sent to 468 Brazilian urology residents from postgraduate years (PGY) 3 to 5 to collect data on clinical practice and training after 4 months of COVID-19. We also assessed health-related and behavior changes, rate of infection by SARS-CoV-2, deployment to the front line of COVID-19, residents concerns, and access to personal protective equipment (PPE). RESULTS: Massive reductions in elective and emergency patient consultations, diagnostic procedures and surgeries were reported across the country, affecting PGY 3 to 5 alike. Most in-person educational activities were abolished. The median damage to the urological training expected for 2020 was 6.0 [3.4 C 7.7], on a scale from 0 to 10, with senior residents estimating a greater damage (P< 0.001). Educational interventions developed included online case-based discussions, subspeciality conferences and lectures, and grand rounds. Most senior residents favored extending residency to compensate for training loss and most younger residents favored no additional training (p< 0.001). Modifications in health and lifestyle included weight gain (43.8%), reduced physical activity (68.6%), increased alcoholic intake (44.9%) and cigarette consumption (53.6%), worsening of sexual life (25.2%) and feelings of sadness or depression (48,2%).

METHODS: This retrospective study included all consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who underwent a computed tomography (CT) angiography for PE clinical suspicion. Clinical data and median blood test results distributed into weekly periods from COVID-19 symptoms onset, were compared between PE and non-PE patients. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were included, 29 (32%) had PE. PE patients were younger (63.9 (SD 13.7) vs 69.9 (SD 12.5) years). Clinical symptoms and COVID-19 CT features were similar in both groups. PE was diagnosed after a mean of 20.0 (SD 8.6) days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Corticosteroid boluses were more frequently used in PE patients (62% vs. 43%). No patients met ISTH DIC criteria. Any parameter was statistically significant or clinically relevant except for D-Dimer when comparing both groups. Median values [IQR] of D-dimer in PE vs non-PE patients were: week 2 (2010.7 [770.1-11208.9] vs 626.0 [374.0-2382.2]; p = 0.004); week 3 (3893.1 [1388.2-6694.0] vs 1184.4 [461.8-2447.8]; p = 0.003); and week 4 (2736.3 [1202.1-8514.1] vs 1129.1 [542.5-2834.6]; p = 0.01).

Understanding the patterning of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the population with regards to incidence, risk factors, impacts on dementia care, and economic costs associated with ADRD can provide clues to target risk and protective factors for all populations as well as addressing health disparities. METHODS We discuss information presented at the 2020 National Research Summit on Care, Services, and Supports for Persons with Dementia and Their Caregivers, Theme 1: Impact of Dementia. In this article, we describe select population trends, care interventions, and economic impacts, health disparities and implications for future research from the perspective of our diverse panel comprised of academic stakeholders, and persons living with dementia, and care partners. RESULTS Dementia incidence is decreasing yet the advances in population health are uneven. Studies examining the educational, geographic and race/ethnic distribution of ADRD have identified clear disparities. Disparities in health and healthcare may be amplified by significant gaps in the evidence base for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The economic costs for persons living with dementia and the value of family care partners' time are high, and may persist into future generations. CONCLUSIONS Significant research gaps remain. Ensuring that ADRD healthcare services and long-term care services and supports are accessible, affordable, and effective for all segments of our population is essential for health equity.

The treatment of such patients and complications may represent a new challenge for the fields of cardiology and pharmacology. Thus, understanding the involvement of this viral infection in CVD might help to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 multiorgan potential of aggressiveness. SARS-CoV-2 disturbs the host epigenome and several epigenetic processes involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 that can directly affect the function and structure of the cardiovascular system (CVS). Hence, it would be relevant to identify epigenetic alterations that directly impact CVS physiology after SARS-CoV-2 infection. This could contribute to the view of this virus-induced CVS injury and direct forthcoming tackles for COVID-19 treatment to reduce mortality in patients with CVD. Targeting epigenetic marks could offer strong evidence for the development of novel antiviral therapies, especially in the context of COVID-19-related CVS damage. In this review, we address some of the main signaling pathways which are currently known as being involved in COVID-19 pathophysiology and the importance of this glint on epigenetics and some of its modifiers (epidrugs) to control the unregulated epitope activity in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19, and underlying CVD.","output":"Can epigenetics help solve the puzzle between concomitant cardiovascular injury and severity of COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outcome of a foregone alternative is not always learnt.

The phenotypic features, particularly of the face, are distinct and easily recognizable, and the diagnosis can be confirmed with molecular gene analysis. Fetal ultrasound imaging may provide important diagnostic clues to facilitate the diagnostic process. Informed consent and parental permission were provided by the parents. Case presentation: The infants mother presented for a Maternal Fetal Medicine genetic counseling telehealth appointment (due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions) as a G7P2132, 32-year old female who had insulin-dependent diabetes and thrombocytosis. Her partner was a 24-year old male with a history of hearing loss, a V-shaped palate, and a lower lip cleft. Gestational age was 14 4/7 weeks and the indications were: increased nuchal translucency, paternal complex medical history, maternal G6PD heterozygote, and recurrent pregnancy loss. During the genetic counseling session, the following were addressed: 1) Maternal heterozygote status for G6PD indicated that if the fetus was male, there was a 50% chance he would be affected with G6PD-deficiency;2) Increased nuchal translucency on fetal ultrasound (US) with measurement at 98th percentile is associated with an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities, microdeletion/duplications, and Noonan syndrome. The patient reportedly had low risk cell-free DNA but results were not available to the counselor at the time of consult. The option for additional genetic screening and diagnostic testing was declined;3) Three first trimester pregnancy losses with the father of this baby (FOB) were addressed, and parents deferred chromosome analyses at the time;4) Mother shared FOBs complex history of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, V-shaped cleft palate, lower lip cleft, and micrognathia. However, father was not present during the telehealth encounter. Mother was counseled regarding the possibility of an autosomal dominant condition with the potential risk to the pregnancy of up to 50%. It was recommended that the FOB have a clinical genetics evaluation, which could potentially provide a specific diagnosis and inform recurrence risk and management guidance. Follow-up MFM genetic counseling telephone visit occurred with the mother at 31 6/7 weeks gestation due to multiple congenital anomalies evident on fetal ultrasound. A 25 week fetal ultrasound revealed hypotelorism and a thickened nuchal translucency. A repeat study at 29 weeks revealed a V-shaped palate with a possible cleft, micrognathia, and midline mandibular cleft. FOBs history was revisited. It was determined that he had 3 previous no shows to Genetics clinic appointments and did not pursue evaluation after the last counseling appointment. Again, it was emphasized that in order to best make a diagnosis for the family, an affected person would need to undergo a thorough evaluation, including medical and family history review, physical examination, and any indicated genetic testing. The parents were comfortable with the likelihood that the baby had the same condition as the father, but variable expressivity and broad range pf phenotypic presentation were explained. Recommendations for postnatal evaluation of the infant and pertinent genetic testing were provided. Consultative Genetics evaluation of the infant at 2 days of age revealed a short, broad forehead with supraorbital fullness leading to a horizontal brow indentation;mask-like facial appearance;hypotelorism;very deep set eyes with blepharophimosis;deep, creased nasal bridge;small, upturned nose with hypoplastic alae and narrow nares;microstomia with pursed lips;glossoptosis;micrognathia;2 deep vertical chin creases;short neck with excess nuchal skin;inverted and wide spaced nipples;clenched hands with 5th digits overlying 4th and 2nd overlying 3rd, bilaterally;bilateral vertical talus;2nd toes longer and overlying rd toes;clinodactyly of 4th and 5th toes bilaterally;and deep gluteal crease with no visible sinus. There were no evident contractures. The father has a complex history with no medical assessments prior to age 18. He reported that he did not look like anyone else in his family. He has a diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder, a submucous cleft, vision issues, hearing loss necessitating a hearing aid on the left, and a history of cholesteatomas and of mastoidectomy. On brief examination, he had a mask-like face, blepharophimosis, left microphthalmia, left esotropia, narrowing of his midface, deep vertical crease on the mandibular region, microstomia, broad great toes, single flexor creases on the thumbs, and contracture of right thumb. Maxillofacial CT of the infant revealed hypoplastic mandibular body, ramus, and condyles bilaterally with micrognathia and retrognathia;hypoplastic maxilla bilaterally;and enophthalmos with retracted appearance of globes in the bony orbits bilaterally. Multiple facial bone abnormalities were seen, including microsomia, micrognathia, retrognathia, orbital hypotelorism and enophthalmos Genetic testing was performed via a custom Whole Exome Slice at GeneDx laboratories and included the MYH3 and TNNI2 genes. Results revealed a heterozygous pathogenic change in MYH3 (c.2015 G>A;p. R6724) consistent with the diagnosis of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome. Conclusion: The presentation of midline mandibular cleft on fetal ultrasound was the most specific prenatal finding. This is a very rare fetal finding. Thus, it should prompt further evaluation to assess for true clefting versus ridging or creasing. Additionally, targeted assessment for other findings or clinical clues for Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, such as contractures, windmill vane hand, and mouth size, could aid in the differential diagnosis considerations and the diagnostic process. Admittedly, these are position and quality dependent, and are challenging to assess even in ideal situations. The phenotype of the father was immediately recognizable. However, due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, prior to the infants birth, only telehealth visits were conducted and the fathers participation was by telephone. This limited the ability to narrow the differential diagnosis without visualization of his distinct phenotypic features. Finally, missed opportunities to diagnose the father prior to this pregnancy occurred. Many clinics send no show letters to referring providers and patients, as we do. Emphasizing the importance of diagnosis prior to pregnancy for individuals concerned about having a genetic disorder should be considered as part of the information shared in these letters.","output":"eP455: Fetal ultrasound presentation and neonatal diagnosis of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome in son of previously undiagnosed adult male"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This study aims to determine the effectiveness of using Google Classroom and Edmodo in online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic.

While compartmental models can be structured to separate distinct sectors of a population, they are conceptually distinct from individual-based models in which population structure emerges from micro-scale interactions. While the conceptual distinction is straightforward, a fair comparison of the approaches is difficult to achieve. Here, we carry out such a comparison by building a set of compartmental metapopulation models from an agent-based representation of a real population. By adjusting the compartmental model to approximately match the dynamics of the Agent-based model, we identify two key qualitative properties of the individual-based dynamics which are lost upon aggregation into metapopulations. These are (1) the local depletion of susceptibility to infection, and (2) decoupling of different regional groups due to correlation between commuting behaviors and contact rates. The first of these effects is a general consequence of aggregating small, closely connected groups (i.e., families) into larger homogeneous metapopulations. The second can be interpreted as a consequence of aggregating two distinct types of individuals: school children, who travel short distances but have many potentially infectious contacts, and adults, who travel further but tend to have fewer contacts capable of transmitting infection. Our results could be generalised to other types of correlations between the characteristics of individuals and the behaviors that distinguish them.","output":"The effects of local homogeneity assumptions in metapopulation models of infectious disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As mice age their adaptive immune system changes dramatically, leading to weakened responses to newly encountered antigens and poor efficacy of vaccines.

Vaccine-eligible children with laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infection were identified from jurisdictional notifiable infectious disease databases and individually matched to controls from the national immunisation register, based on date of birth, Aboriginal status and location of residence. Results: 171 cases met the inclusion criteria; most were Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander (80%) and the median age was 19 months.

The role of non-contrast MRI is investigated to move toward a more personalized, less invasive, and highly cost-effective PCa diagnostic workup. OBJECTIVE To perform a non-systematic review of the existing literature to highlight strength and flaws of performing non-contrast MRI, and to provide a critical overview of the international scientific production on the topic. MATERIALS AND METHODS Online databases (Medline, PubMed, and Web of Science) were searched for original articles, systematic review and meta-analysis, and expert opinion papers. RESULTS Several investigations have shown comparable diagnostic accuracy of biparametric (bpMRI) and mpMRI for the detection of PCa. The advantage of abandoning contrast-enhanced sequences improves operational logistics, lowering costs, acquisition time, and side effects. The main limitations of bpMRI are that most studies which compared the non-contrast and contrast MRI come from centers with high expertise that might not be reproducible in the general community setting; besides, reduced protocols might be insufficient for estimation of the intra- and extra-prostatic extension and regional disease. The mentioned observations suggest that low quality mpMRI for the general population, might represent the main shortage to overcome. DISCUSSION Non-contrast MRI future trends are likely represented by PCa screening and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. PCa screening is still a controversial topic and bpMRI, and has become one of the most promising diagnostic applications, as it is a more sensitive test for PCa early detection, compared to serum PSA level test. Also, AI applications and radiomic have been the object of several studies investigating PCa detection using bpMRI, showing encouraging results. CONCLUSION Today, the accessibility to MRI for early detection of PCa is a priority. Results from prospective, multicenter, multireader and paired validation studies are needed to provided evidence supporting its role in the clinical practice. This article is protected by copyright.

This article analyses 3,038,026 English tweets about COVID-19 from March 10 to 23, 2020. It focuses on one relevant aspect of public reaction: gender differences. The results show that females are more likely to tweet about the virus in the context of family, social distancing and healthcare whereas males are more likely to tweet about sports cancellations, the global spread of the virus and political reactions. Thus, women seem to be taking a disproportionate share of the responsibility for directly keeping the population safe.

The sample consists of 3755 participants, of which 67% are men and 33% are women with an average age of 51 years (SD = 13.64). Using mean comparison tests and probit regression models, we show that loneliness is a common occurrence among the Japanese population and that a significant number of people became lonely for the first time during the pandemic. In general, loneliness was greater among younger respondents, but older people became lonelier during the pandemic. Simultaneously, we observed significant differences in loneliness across age and gender subsamples. Although depression and subjective health status contributed to loneliness, we found no single explanation for the loneliness experienced by people during the pandemic; rather, subsample analysis revealed that the causes of loneliness for each group differed. Nevertheless, we discovered that older people are at a higher risk of developing loneliness during the pandemic due to a variety of socioeconomic and behavioral factors. The findings of this study suggest that health authorities should not generalize cases of loneliness, but rather intervene individually in each group to avoid further complications.","output":"Who Became Lonely during the COVID-19 Pandemic?

Lockdowns, though an effective policy for containment, imposes a heavy cost on the economy as it enforces extreme social distancing measures on the whole population. The objective of this note is to study alternatives to Lockdown which are either more targeted or allows partial opening of the economy. Cities are often spatially organized into wards. We introduce Multi-lattice small world (MLSW) network as a model of a city where each ward is represented by a 2D lattice and each vertex in the latex represents an agent endowed with SEIR dynamics. Through simulation studies on MLSW, we examine a variety of candidate suppression policies and find that restricting Lockdowns to infected wards can indeed out-perform global Lockdowns in both reducing the attack rate and also shortening the duration of the epidemic. Even policies such as partial opening of the economy, such as Two-Day Work Week, can be competitive if augmented with extensive Contact Tracing.","output":"Suppress, and Not Just Flatten: Strategies for Rapid Suppression of COVID19 Transmission in Small World Communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 pandemic is a global health problem that affects the whole world and can progress with asymptomatic or viral symptoms of pneumonia or cause severe acute respiratory failure SARS-CoV-2 has spread much more widely and quickly than other viruses and has caused a significant number of life losses globally Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that is frequently performed by ENT and head & neck surgeons with various indications, and its implementation can facilitate weaning patients from mechanical ventilation, thereby potentially increasing the availability of beds in the intensive care unit (ICU) Since tracheostomy causes a large amount of aerosol formation, it is a serious risk process for the spread of covid-19 infection even if personal protective equipment (PPE) is used both during surgery and postoperative care There is not enough experience on how to perform tracheotomy in Covid-19 patients Therefore, the surgical procedure and indications for tracheostomy should be revised during the covid-19 pandemic process We aim to provide authoritative guidance for healthcare providers and healthcare systems by synthesizing our experience with tracheostomy, available evidence, and information in the literature data during the current COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Tracheostomy and tracheostomy care during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemi coronavirus COVID-19 telah memunculkan tantangan baru untuk diatasi oleh negara-bangsa.Secara khusus, yaitu mengenai bagaimana negara merespons dan berupaya mencegah dan menghentikan penyebaranvirus jauh lebih luas.

To enter cells, hantaviruses fuse their envelope membrane with host cell membranes. Previously, we have shown that the Gc envelope glycoprotein is the viral fusion protein sharing characteristics with class II fusion proteins. The ectodomain of class II fusion proteins is composed of three domains connected by a stem region to a transmembrane anchor in the viral envelope. These fusion proteins can be inhibited through exogenous fusion protein fragments spanning domain III (DIII) and the stem region. Such fragments are thought to interact with the core of the fusion protein trimer during the transition from its pre-fusion to its post-fusion conformation. Based on our previous homology model structure for Gc from Andes hantavirus (ANDV), here we predicted and generated recombinant DIII and stem peptides to test whether these fragments inhibit hantavirus membrane fusion and cell entry. Recombinant ANDV DIII was soluble, presented disulfide bridges and beta-sheet secondary structure, supporting the in silico model. Using DIII and the C-terminal part of the stem region, the infection of cells by ANDV was blocked up to 60% when fusion of ANDV occurred within the endosomal route, and up to 95% when fusion occurred with the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the fragments impaired ANDV glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion, and cross-inhibited the fusion mediated by the glycoproteins from Puumala virus (PUUV). The Gc fragments interfered in ANDV cell entry by preventing membrane hemifusion and pore formation, retaining Gc in a non-resistant homotrimer stage, as described for DIII and stem peptide inhibitors of class II fusion proteins. Collectively, our results demonstrate that hantavirus Gc shares not only structural, but also mechanistic similarity with class II viral fusion proteins, and will hopefully help in developing novel therapeutic strategies against hantaviruses.","output":"Inhibition of the Hantavirus Fusion Process by Predicted Domain III and Stem Peptides from Glycoprotein Gc"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Decreased quality of life (QOL) due to fatigue in the setting of anemia is common with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), often leading to dependence on red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in considerably reduced blood supply such that the importance of conserving donor RBCs for patients particularly in need is even more crucial (Shander, Anesth Analg 2020). While some patients with MDS experience improved QOL after transfusions, many do not, even at the same ECOG performance status (PS) and hemoglobin (Hb). In a pilot study, we sought to assess the feasibility of a peri-transfusion QOL assessment (PTQA;QOL assessed before and after transfusion) to determine if it could help inform future transfusion decisions for patients with MDS. METHODS: Starting in 2019, patients with MDS at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Yale School of Medicine, and Wake Forest University were screened for eligibility using clinic schedule reports in Epic;those 18 or older with biopsy-proven MDS presenting to clinic for RBC transfusions with no evidence of known CHF or unstable angina were eligible to participate. A Hb threshold of 7.5 g/dL or greater was required for participation (Tanasijevic, Leuk Lymph 2020). The QUALMS, a validated PRO for patients with MDS (Abel, Haematologica, 2016), was used to assess patients' QOL before and after RBC transfusion. At consent, patients were given a study packet including a copy of the QUALMS and were instructed to fill out the survey the day before their upcoming transfusion. One week after RBC transfusion, the patient completed the QUALMS again. Surveys were scored, compared, and compiled into a report that was sent to patients and providers (Figure). Based on the QUALMS validation study, we considered a change by 5 or more points to be potentially clinically significant. After descriptive statistics, two-sided Fisher's Exact tests assessed for associations between patient characteristics (ECOG PS and Hb) and post-transfusion increase in QOL. RESULTS: As of July 2020, a total of 57 patients had been enrolled. Of these, 28 (49%) have completed PTQA with both a pre-transfusion and post-transfusion QUALMS. Mean age was 72 years (standard deviation (SD)=11.6), 19% were female, and 89% had had one or more RBC transfusions within 8 weeks prior to enrollment. For the 29 patients who did not undergo PTQA, 11 are still awaiting their index transfusion;4 passed away before the index transfusion;4 were transplanted before the index transfusion;2 developed AML;7 later became ineligible or were lost to follow up;and 1 withdrew consent. Of the 28 who underwent PTQA, about half had an ECOG performance status of 1, and median Hb at transfusion was 8.05 g/dL (Table). The mean pre-transfusion QUALMS score was 56.1 (SD=15.3) and post-transfusion score was 59.3 (SD=18.0);overall, 35.7% experienced an increase in QOL. Patients with ECOG PS of 1 or 2 were no more likely to have an increase in QOL after RBC transfusion compared to those with PS of 0 (p=1.00). In contrast, 50% of patients with pre-transfusion Hb < 8.0 g/dL had an increase in QOL compared to 25% of patients with Hb >= 8.0 g/dL, although this difference also did not reach significance (p=0.24). CONCLUSIONS: Although PTQA was feasible for about half of patients enrolled, there were many barriers when working with this high-risk MDS population. Moreover, only about one-third of patients experienced an increase in QOL one week after RBC transfusion, arguing that, for some patients, a more limited transfusion schedule may be possible.

Accurate and efficient segmentation of pneumonia lesions in computed tomography (CT) scans is vital for treatment decision\\\\making. We proposed a novel unsupervised approach using a cycle consistent generative adversarial network (cycle\\\\GAN) which automates and accelerates the process of lesion delineation. METHOD: The workflow includes lung volume segmentation, healthy lung image synthesis, infected and healthy image subtraction, and binary lesion mask generation. The lung volume was first delineated using a pre\\\\trained U\\\\net and worked as the input for the following network. A cycle\\\\GAN was trained to generate synthetic healthy lung CT images from infected lung images. After that, the pneumonia lesions were extracted by subtracting the synthetic healthy lung CT images from the infected lung CT images. A median filter and k\\\\means clustering were then applied to contour the lesions. The auto segmentation approach was validated on three different datasets. RESULTS: The average Dice coefficient reached 0.666  0.178 on the three datasets. Especially, the dice reached 0.748  0.121 and 0.730  0.095, respectively, on two public datasets Coronacases and Radiopedia.

The performance is comparable to existing supervised segmentation networks and outperforms unsupervised ones. CONCLUSION: The proposed label\\\\free segmentation method achieved high accuracy and efficiency in automatic COVID\\\\19 lesion delineation. The segmentation result can serve as a baseline for further manual modification and a quality assurance tool for lesion diagnosis.

Previous efforts to create heterobifunctional protein conjugates suffered from heterogeneity in domain stoichiometry, which in part led to the failure of antibody-enzyme conjugates in clinical trials. We used the megamolecule approach to synthesize anti-HER2 nanobody-cytosine deaminase conjugates with tunable numbers of nanobody and enzyme domains in a single, covalent molecule. Linking two nanobody domains to one enzyme domain improved avidity to a human cancer cell line by 4-fold but did not increase cytotoxicity significantly due to lowered enzyme activity. In contrast, a megamolecule composed of one nanobody and two enzyme domains resulted in an 8-fold improvement in the catalytic efficiency and increased the cytotoxic effect by over 5-fold in spheroid culture, indicating that the multimeric structure allowed for an increase in local drug activation.

METHODS: A total of 1000 informal caregivers, recruited offline, participated in a cross-sectional online survey from April 21 to May 2, 2020. Questionnaires were used to assess COVID-19-specific changes in the care situation, negative feelings in the care situation, problems with implementation of COVID-19 measures, concerns/excessive demands, loss of support, change in informal caregivers' own involvement in care and problems with provision, comprehension & practicability of COVID-19 information, and to relate these issues to five indicators of care involvement (i.e., being the main caregiver, high expenditure of time, high level of care, dementia, no professional help). Binomial and multiple regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: Across indicators of care involvement, 25.5-39.7% reported that the care situation rather or greatly worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for those caring for someone with dementia or those usually relying on professional help. In a multiple regression model, the mean number of involvement indicators met was associated with age (? = .18; CI .10-.25), excessive demands (? = .10, CI .00-.19), problems with implementation of COVID-19 measures (? = .11, CI .04-.19), an increase in caregiving by the informal caregivers themselves (? = .14, CI .03-.24) as well as with no change in the amount of caregiving (? = .18, CI .07-.29) and loss of support (? = -.08, CI -.16-.00). No significant associations with the mean number of involvement indicators met were found for gender, educational level, change in the care situation, negative feelings, and provision, comprehension & practicability of COVID-19 information.

We used 30-day outcome data (death or receipt of respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support) to determine prognostic accuracy for adverse outcome. RESULTS: We analysed data from 20 891 adults, of whom 4611 (22.1%) died or received organ support (primary outcome), with 2058 (9.9%) receiving organ support and 2553 (12.2%) dying without organ support (secondary outcomes). C-statistics for the primary outcome were: CURB-65 0.75; CRB-65 0.70; PMEWS 0.77; NEWS2 (score) 0.77; NEWS2 (rule) 0.69; SFAHP (6-point rule) 0.70; SFAHP (7-point rule) 0.68; WHO algorithm 0.61. All triage tools showed worse prediction for receipt of organ support and better prediction for death without organ support. At the recommended threshold, PMEWS and the WHO criteria showed good sensitivity (0.97 and 0.95, respectively) at the expense of specificity (0.30 and 0.27, respectively). The NEWS2 score showed similar sensitivity (0.96) and specificity (0.28) when a lower threshold than recommended was used. CONCLUSION: CURB-65, PMEWS and the NEWS2 score provide good but not excellent prediction for adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19, and predicted death without organ support better than receipt of organ support. PMEWS, the WHO criteria and NEWS2 (using a lower threshold than usually recommended) provide good sensitivity at the expense of specificity.

Since its initial emergence in 1998 in Malaysia, this virus has become a great threat to domestic animals and humans. Sporadic outbreaks and person-to-person transmission over the past two decades have resulted in hundreds of human fatalities. Epidemiological surveys have shown that NiV is distributed in Asia, Africa, and the South Pacific Ocean, and is transmitted by its natural reservoir, Pteropid bats.

Among the underserved groups disproportionately affected by the digital divide are women who are transitioning from incarceration and seeking to reenter the workforce outside the carceral system (women-in-transition). Women-in-transition rarely have been exposed to sound technology education, as they have generally been isolated from the digital environment while in incarceration. Furthermore, while women have become the fastest-growing segment of the incarcerated population in the United States in recent decades, prison education and reentry programs are still not well adjusted for them. Most programs are mainly designed for the dominant male population. Consequently, women-in-transition face significant post-incarceration challenges in accessing and using relevant digital technologies and thus have added difficulties in entering or reentering the workforce. Against this backdrop, our multi-disciplinary research team has conducted empirical research as part of technology education offered to women-in-transition in the Midwest. In this article, we report results from our interviews with 75 women-in-transition in the Midwest that were conducted to develop a tailored technology education program for the women. More than half of the participants in our study are women of color and face precarious housing and financial situations. Then, we discuss principles that we adopted in developing our education program for the marginalized women and participants' feedback on the program. Our team launched in-person sessions with women-in-reentry at public libraries in February 2020 and had to move the sessions online in March due to COVID-19. Our research-informed educational program is designed primarily to support the women in enhancing their knowledge and comfort with technology and nurturing computational thinking. Our study shows that low self-efficacy and mental health challenges, as well as lack of resources for technology access and use, are some of the major issues that need to be addressed in supporting technology learning among women-in-transition.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the characteristics of COVID-19 disease in pregnant women and non-pregnant women are very similar. However, pregnant women with COVID-19 in the third trimester are more likely than their non-pregnant counterparts to require intensive care, though this may reflect a lower threshold for intervention in pregnant women rather than more serious disease. Compared with pregnant women without COVID-19, pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital have worse maternal outcomes, including death, although the absolute risk remains very low.

However, the stability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A virus (IAV) on different types of papers is currently unknown. Investigation of the survival time of these viruses on different types of papers will provide insights into their risk of long-distance transport by postal items. METHODS: We evaluated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV, mixed with a culture medium, on the surface of postcards with various coatings, including plain paper (PP), inkjet paper (IP), and inkjet photo paper (IPP). The surface structure of each paper was microscopically assessed. RESULTS: The surface structures of PP, IP, and IPP varied greatly depending on the presence or absence, and type, of coat layer, regardless of the base material. IP and IPP surfaces were less conducive to virus survival than PP surfaces, because of the difference in surface shapes. The survival times of SARS-CoV-2 on each paper were approximately 59.8 (PP), 6.5 (IP), and 9.8 h (IPP), and significantly longer than those of IAV (10.3, 1.8, and 3.3 h, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via paper, such as postcards, is significantly higher than that of IAV transmission. While PP, IP, and IPP have the same base material, their surface structures differ, which affects viral stability. The IP and IPP surfaces are less suitable for virus survival.

After a brief introduction on the global epidemiological and economic implication of the pandemic, the problem of the correct characterization of either vaccine or immunization/herd immunity as global public/ common good, according to the necessary characteristics outlined by the pertinent economic theories, is addressed. The conclusion is that the term global public good/global common goods has been extensively used in the last two years by policy makers, political leaders, academics, economists, international organizations, NGOs and others health groups, in a sort of loose way. Substantially, in order to underscore that equitable access to health products, including vaccines, health and biomedical technologies, medical services, medical devises, whose availability, accessibility, acceptability, affordability to the world is fundamental to tackling the pandemic. The current legal proprietary regime applied to vaccines, extensively covered by IPRs, has transformed an intrinsically non-excludable common/public good (the vaccines, due to their nature and characteristics) in something excludable and rival in consumption. Consequently, the article argues that what is needed is a swift in their legal governance. The current legal discipline of vaccines and health technologies must be changed to bring it into line with the non-excludable nature of these goods. The richest countries in the world, in pursuit of their vaccine nationalisms, have already collectively preordered 8.8 billion doses of vaccine, far in excess of need, thus obliging billions of people in the Global South to wait years to be vaccinated. In this respect, the article investigates the EU vaccines strategy and analyzes the Advanced Purchase Agreements signed by the European Commission with the major vaccine producers, enlightening the untenable secrecy and opacity with which the European Unions executive has handled COVID-19 vaccine supply contracts, and how it has simply paid no more than lip-service to the concept of global common/public good by attributing a broad private governance to the pharmaceutical companies.

With widespread displacement of population/ migrants, considerable destruction of property, increase in mortality, morbidity, and poverty, infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics have become global threats requiring a collective response.

Additionally, the general application of project management in international assistance projects is analysed to determine how project management can contribute to keeping the project orientation humane during a crisis. The analysis reveals that applying project management tools and techniques are beneficial to achieve success in humanitarian assistance projects. However, capturing, codifying, and disseminating the knowledge generated in the process and placing the end-users at the centre of the project life cycle is a prerequisite. While the latter can seem obvious, the findings demonstrate that the inadequate inclusion of beneficiaries is one of the main reasons that prevent positive project outcomes leading to unsustainable outcomes.

In this case-control study, we investigated the diurnal free bioavailable salivary cortisol secretion in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive COVID-19 patientsbefore dexamethasone treatment in cases requiredrecruited between April 15 to June 15, 2021, (NCT04988269) at Laikon Athens University-Hospital, and 33 healthy age- and sex-matched controls were included. Diurnal salivary cortisol (8 a.m., 12, 6, and 10 p.m.), plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and aldosterone, and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were assessed. Diurnal salivary dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and IL-6 were also assessed in subgroups of patients. RESULTS: Median CRP and IL-6 measurements were about sixfold higher in patients than controls (both p < 0.001) Morning salivary cortisol levels did not differ between the two groups, but patients exhibited higher median levels of evening and nocturnal salivary cortisol compared to controls [0.391 (0.054, 0663) vs. 0.081 (0.054, 0.243) g/dl, p < 0.001 and 0.183 (0.090, 0.834) vs. 0.054 (0.054, 0.332) g/dl, p < 0.001, respectively], resulting in higher time-integrated area under the curve (AUC) (4.81  2.46 vs. 2.75  0.810, respectively, p < 0.001). Circulating ACTH, DHEA, and aldosterone levels were similar in patients and controls.

In addition, the study aimed to investigate treatment uptake for different diagnostic groupsduring and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Monthly data for number of unique patients and number of contacts were extracted for the three-year period of January 2018 through December 2020. Data from each facility were analyzed separately for women, men and patients with psychotic, affective, anxiety and substance use-related disorders. Interrupted time series were used to demonstrate possible effects of COVID-19. Results: COVID-19 was associated with a marked decrease in treatment contacts, both for women and men, in the general psychiatry emergency unitdriven by a significant decrease in anxiety-related disorders (p < 0.001) and affective disorders (p < 0.01)but not in psychotic or substance use disorders (SUDs). Also, in the addiction psychiatry emergency unit, no significant impact of COVID-19 was seen. Conclusions: COVID-19 may decrease treatment uptake for acute affective and anxiety-related disorders.

Given the rapid increase of COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh, we aimed to translate and validate the FCV-19S in Bangla. The forward-backward translation method was used to translate the English version of the questionnaire into Bangla. The reliability and validity properties of the Bangla FCV-19S were rigorously psychometrically evaluated (utilizing both confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch analysis) in relation to socio-demographic variables, national lockdown variables, and response to the Bangla Health Patient Questionnaire. The sample comprised 8550 Bangladeshi participants. The Cronbach  value for the Bangla FCV-19S was 0.871 indicating very good internal reliability. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the uni-dimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S fitted well with the data. The FCV-19S was significantly correlated with the nine-item Bangla Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-90) (r = 0.406, p < 0.001). FCV-19S scores were significantly associated with higher worries concerning lockdown. Measurement invariance of the FCV-19S showed no differences with respect to age or gender. The Bangla version of FCV-19S is a valid and reliable tool with robust psychometric properties which will be useful for researchers carrying out studies among the Bangla speaking population in assessing the psychological impact of fear from COVID-19 infection during this pandemic.","output":"Psychometric Validation of the Bangla Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Rasch Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Maintaining your research team's productivity during the COVID-19 era can be a challenge.

In addition, retroviruses are widely used as tools to transfer genes of interest to target cells. Understanding the entry mechanism of retroviruses contributes to developments of novel therapeutic approaches against retrovirus-induced diseases and efficient exploitation of retroviral vectors. Entry of enveloped viruses into host cell cytoplasm is achieved by fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes at either the cell surface or intracellular vesicles. Many animal retroviruses enter host cells through endosomes and require endosome acidification. Ecotropic murine leukemia virus entry requires cathepsin proteases activated by the endosome acidification. CD4-dependent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is thought to occur via endosomes, but endosome acidification is not necessary for the entry whereas entry of CD4-independent HIVs, which are thought to be prototypes of CD4-dependent viruses, is low pH dependent. There are several controversial results on the retroviral entry pathways. Because endocytosis and endosome acidification are complicatedly controlled by cellular mechanisms, the retrovirus entry pathways may be different in different cell lines.","output":"Retrovirus Entry by Endocytosis and Cathepsin Proteases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper aims to address the immediate effects of the COVID-19 crisis in the Portuguese tourism and hospitality industry by examining whether some specific characteristics make people more vulnerable or more immune to unemployment. Design/methodology/approach: Using an extensive micro-level data set of personal and job-related attributes containing all unemployed individuals in the Portuguese tourism and hospitality industry, a logit model with 56,142 observations is estimated to assess how each characteristic contributed to the unemployment odds during the COVID-19 crisis (until the end-July 2020), relatively to the pre-COVID period. Findings: The most vulnerable workers to COVID-19 unemployment seem to be older, less educated, less qualified, women and residents in regions with a higher concentration of people and tourism activity. Moreover, the COVID-19 crisis is generating a new type of unemployment by also affecting those who were never unemployed before, with more stable jobs and more motivated at work, while reducing voluntary disruptions. Practical implications: Public effort should be made not only to increase workforce education but especially to reinforce job-specific skills. The COVID-19 crisis has broken traditional protective measures against unemployment and separated workers from their desired occupations, which justifies new and exceptional job preservation measures. Policy recommendations are given aiming at strengthening worker resilience and industry competitiveness in the most affected sub-sectors and regions. Originality/value: This study extends the current understanding of worker vulnerability to economic downturns.

We present our experience with a novel technique to improve continence outcomes in patients who are undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). PATIENTS AND METHODS A consecutive series of 159 patients after initiation of a bladder neck plication stitch was compared with the most recent group before the change. After completion of the vesicourethral anastomosis, a single suture was used to plicate the distal bladder neck. A structured questionnaire was used for follow-up. Continence criteria used were 1 pad per day for social continence and 0 pad per day for total continence. RESULTS A total of 334 patients were included in the study: 159 in the plication stitch group vs 175 in the control group. Average age was 59.1 vs 59.6 years, average body mass index was 27.9 vs 28.3 kg/m(2), and average prostate volume was 58.1 vs 60.9 cc, respectively. The mean time to reach social continence was 3.633.01 vs 5.334.89 weeks (P=0.004), and total continence was 5.103.80 vs 8.496.32 weeks (P=0.002), respectively.

The main goal of this investigation was to show the effect of Se supplementation, at levels slightly higher than the recommended values, combined with natural zeolite clinoptilolite on Se deposition in tissues (muscle and liver) and on the immune and antioxidative status of supplemented growing pigs. The experiment was carried out during a 98 d period on 60 pigs. Pigs were fed a standard feed mixture based on corn and soybean and were divided into four groups, according to the level of dietary selenium supplementation as follows: C-0.3 mg/kg DM organic Se, E1-0.5 mg/kg DM sodium selenite, E2-0.5 mg/kg DM organic selenium; E3-0.5 mg/kg DM organic Se+0.2% zeolite. Higher (P < 0.05) selenium concentrations were determined in the muscle and liver in growing pigs fed with higher organic Se in combination with zeolite compared to the lower organic Se concentration. Addition of organic Se increased (P < 0.05) Se deposition in muscle and liver compared to the equal amount of inorganic Se (E2 vs. E1). Higher organic Se in combination with natural zeolite addition increases (P < 0.05) proportion of pigs' cluster of differentiation (CD)45(+) compared to the same amount of inorganic Se and lower organic Se addition. The proportion of CD45(+) and CD4(+) lymphocytes was higher (P < 0.05) in E3 group compared to the other groups.

Their argument is that short-selling exacerbates downward price movements, thus being responsible for heightened volatility and reduced market confidence. This paper reviews the academic literature on short-selling and short-selling bans, comparing the arguments against banning short-selling with the arguments in favour. We find that the evidence almost unanimously points towards short-selling bans being disruptive for the orderly functioning of markets, as they are found to reduce liquidity, increase price inefficiency and hamper price discovery. In addition, short-selling bans are found to have negative spillover effects on other markets, for example option markets. According to the literature, during periods of price decline and heightened volatility, short-sellers do not behave differently from any other traders, and contribute less to price declines than regular long sellers. As research has shown that short-selling bans are more deleterious to markets characterized by a relatively high amount of small stocks, low levels of fragmentation, and fewer alternatives to short-selling, emerging markets should be particularly wary of bans on short-selling.","output":"What Does Academic Research Say about Short-Selling Bans?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study investigated the features of oncology patients with confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) at the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs-Riyadh during the outbreak of June 2015 to determine the clinical course and outcome of affected patients. METHODS: The patients' demographic information, cancer history, treatment pattern, information about MERS-coronavirus (CoV) infection, history of travel, clinical symptoms, test results, and outcome were collected and analyzed as part of a quality improvement project to improve the care and safety of our patients. Only patients with confirmed infection were included. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were identified, with a median age of 66 years (range, 16-88 years), and 12 patients (63%) were males. The most common underlying disease was hematologic malignancies (47.4%), followed by colorectal cancer (21%) and lung cancer (15.8%). Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbidities (57.9% and 52.6%, respectively). Infection was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal swab in all patients. All patients contracted the infection during their hospitalization for other reasons. Sixteen patients (80%) were admitted to the intensive care unit; 13 patients (81%) had acute respiratory distress syndrome, 11 were intubated (68.75%), 9 had acute renal injury (56.25%), and 3 required dialysis (18.75%). Only 3 patients (15.8%) with early-stage cancers survived. Patients with hematologic malignancies and advanced solid tumors had a 100% case fatality rate.

TRIAL DESIGN: The CARED trial is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, randomized, parallel, two-arm, sequential, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial. It was planned as a pragmatic trial since the inclusion criteria are broad and the study procedures are as simple as possible, in order to be implemented in the routine clinical practice in general wards in the pandemic setting and a middle-income country context. The sequential design involves two stages. The first stage will assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on blood oxygenation (physiological effects). The second stage will assess the effects on clinical outcomes. PARTICIPANTS: Participants of either gender admitted to general adult wards in 21 hospital sites located in four provinces of Argentina are invited to participate in the study if they meet the following inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria: SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection by RT-PCR; Hospital admission at least 24 hours before; Expected hospitalization in the same site 24 hours; Oxygen saturation 90% (measured by pulse oximetry) breathing ambient air;  Hypertension;  Diabetes;  At least moderate COPD or asthma;  Cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting or valve replacement surgery);  Body mass index 30; Willingness to sign informed consent (online supplementary material 1 and 2). Exclusion criteria: Age <18 years; Women in childbearing age; >= 72 hs since current admission; Requirement for a high dose of oxygen (>5 litres/minute) or mechanical ventilation (non-invasive or invasive); History of chronic kidney disease requiring haemodialysis or chronic liver failure; Inability for oral intake.

INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The intervention consists in a single oral dose of 500.000 IU of commercially available cholecalciferol soft gel capsules (5 capsules of 100.000 IU) or matching placebo MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome for the first stage is the change in the respiratory Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFAr) score between pre-treatment value and the worst value recorded during the first 7 seven days of hospitalization, the death or discharge, whichever occurs first. The SOFAr score measured as the ratio between the pulse oximetry saturation (SpO(2)) and FiO(2) (27, 28) is used instead of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)). SOFAr score is a 4-points scale, with higher values indicating deeper respiratory derangement as follows: 1 PaO(2) <400; 2 PaO(2) <300; 3 PaO(2) <200; 4 PaO(2) <100. The primary outcome for the second stage is the combined occurrence of requirement 40% of FiO(2), invasive or non-invasive ventilation, up to 30 days or hospital discharge. RANDOMISATION: A computer-generated random sequence and the treatment assignment is performed through the web-based randomization module available in the electronic data capture system (Castor?). A randomization ratio 1:1, stratified and with permuted blocks was used. Stratification variables were diabetes (yes/no), age (60/>60 years) and the site. BLINDING (MASKING): Double-blind was achieved by using placebo soft gel capsules with the same organoleptic properties as the active medication. Central management of the medication is carried out by a pharmacist in charge of packaging the study drug in unblinded fashion, who have no contact with on-site investigators. Medication is packaged in opaque white bottles, each containing five soft gel capsules of the active drug or matching placebo, corresponding to complete individual treatment. Treatment codes are kept under the pharmacist responsibility, and all researchers are unaware of them.

This article reviews the available evidence regarding the impact and interlink between COVID-19 and &#932;1DM. We also explore the mechanisms behind the viral etiology of &#932;1DM. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can trigger severe diabetic ketoacidosis at presentation in individuals with new-onset diabetes. However, at present, there is no hard evidence that SARS-CoV-2 induces T1DM on it's own accord. Long term follow-up of children and adults presenting with new-onset diabetes during this pandemic is required to fully understand the type of diabetes induced by COVID-19.","output":"New onset diabetes, type 1 diabetes and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With an increase in published reports on respiratory rehabilitation (RR) programs in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there is a need for a meta-analysis and systematic review to measure the effects of RR program in SARS. OBJECTIVE: Objective of the review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RR program in patients recovering from SARS. METHODS: PubMed/ MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and Clinical Trial Registries were systematically searched (between January 1, 2003, to July 31, 2021) to identify all patients who received RR program, at least for six days, following SARS. The primary outcome was exercise capacity [6-meter walking distance (6-MWD)], and secondary outcomes were change in pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters, activities in daily livings (ADLs), and quality of life (QoL). Meta-analysis was performed by using RevMan 5.4. RESULTS: Twenty-one observational studies, including eight comparative studies, were included. Eight comparative studies participated in quantitative meta-analysis. The intervention group, who received RR program, improved significantly in exercise capacity (6-MWD) [mean difference (MD):45.79, (95% CI:31.66-59.92)] and PFT parameters, especially in forced vital capacity (FVC%) [MD:4.38, (95% CI:0.15-8.60)], and diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO%) [MD:11.78, (95% CI:5.10-18.46)]. The intervention group failed to demonstrate significant improvement in ADLs and QoL outcomes. No significant adverse events were reported during the intervention. CONCLUSION: Respiratory rehabilitation can improve exercise capacity and PFT parameters in patients recovering from SARS infection. RR program does not cause serious adverse events. There is a need for clinical trials to measure the long-term efficacy of the RR program.","output":"Respiratory Rehabilitation in Patients Recovering from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genomic data can facilitate personalized treatment decisions by enabling therapeutic hypotheses in individual patients.

Calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D) represents the perpetrator of the several systemic effects of vitamin D, including the anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and anti-atherosclerotic action potentially preventing acute cardiovascular ischemic events. Variability in the transformation of vitamin D into 1,25(OH)2D has been suggested to modulate its cardioprotective benefits, however, the determinants of the levels of calcitriol and their impact on the cardiovascular risk have been seldom addressed and were therefore the aim of the present study. Methods A consecutive cohort of patients undergoing coronary angiography for acute coronary syndrome(ACS) were included. The levels of 25 and 1,25(OH)2 D were assessed at admission by chemiluminescence immunoassay kit LIAISON? Vitamin D assay (Diasorin Inc) and LIAISON? XL. Hypovitaminosis D was defined as 25(OH)D < 10 ng/ml, whereas Calcitriol deficiency as 1,25(OH)2D < 19.9 pg/ml. Results We included in our study 228 patients, divided according to median values of 1,25(OH)2D (<or  41.5pg/ml). Lower calcitriol was associated to age (p=0.005), diabetes (p=0.013), renal failure (p<0.0001), use of diuretics (p=0.007), platelets (p=0.019), WBC (p=0.032), 25(0H)D (p=0,046), higher creatinine (p=0.011), and worse glycaemic and lipid profile. A total of 53 patients (23.2%) had hypovitaminosis D, whereas 19 (9.1%) displayed calcitriol deficiency (15.1% among patients with hypovitaminosis D and 7.1% among patients with normal Vitamin D levels, p=0.09). The independent predictors of 1,25(OH)2D above the median were renal failure (OR[95%CI]=0.242[0.095-0.617], p=0.003) and level of vitamin D (OR[95%CI]=1.057[1.018-1.098], p=0.004). Calcitriol levels, in fact, directly related with the levels of vitamin D (r=0.175, p=0.035), whereas an inverse linear relationship was observed with major inflammatory and metabolic markers of cardiovascular risk (C-reactive protein: r=-0.14, p=0.076; uric acid: r=-0.18, p=0.014; homocysteine: r=-0.19, p=0.007; fibrinogen: r=-0.138, p=0.05) and Lp-PLA2 (r=-0.167, p=0.037), but not for leukocytes. Conclusion The present study shows that among ACS patients, calcitriol deficiency is frequent and can occur even among patients with adequate vitamin D levels. We identified renal failure and vitamin D levels as independent predictors of 1,25(OH)2D deficiency. Furthermore, we found a significant inverse relationship of calcitriol with inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers, suggesting a potential more relevant and accurate role of calcitriol, as compared to cholecalciferol, in the prediction of cardiovascular risk. Future trials should certainly investigate the potential role of calcitriol administration in the setting of acute coronary syndromes as much as in other inflammatory disorders, such as the SARS-CoV2 infection.","output":"Determinants of vitamin D activation in patients with acute coronary syndromes and its correlation with inflammatory markers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Psychological stress may have an adverse impact on the voice. The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between the change in levels of perceived psychological stress and vocal symptoms among Israeli academic college professors required to shift to synchronous online teaching during the global COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online questionnaire was completed by 313 professors (156 men and 157 women) from 14 academic colleges in Israel at the end of the first week of online synchronous teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was assumed to be the most burdened and stressful week of the transition. Participants provided self-reports for the current levels of psychological stress and vocal symptoms during the transition to online synchronous teaching, as well as general psychological stress and general vocal symptoms during previous periods of teaching. RESULTS: The results revealed higher levels of psychological stress but not vocal symptoms during the transition to online synchronous teaching compared with previous periods of teaching. Psychological stress during the transition to online synchronous teaching was positively associated with vocal symptoms during this period but this association was moderated by general stress. Although there was a positive association between psychological stress and vocal symptoms for individuals who reported low levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching, this association was especially strong for individuals who reported high levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to examine vocal symptoms of professors in specific contexts that are potentially stressful. The psychological stress surrounding the transition to online synchronous teaching was associated with elevated levels of vocal symptoms especially for those who reported high levels of psychological stress during previous periods of teaching. These results with professors accord with the notion that psychological stress may have a negative impact on the voice.","output":"Psychological Stress and Vocal Symptoms Among University Professors in Israel: Implications of the Shift to Online Synchronous Teaching During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the trends in foreign trade in agriculture focusing on imports and exports for different sub-sectors and the identity of agricultural trade flows with specific regions and countries Secondly, to understand how agricultural imports and exports improve the living standards of households in South Africa The study uses a quantitative research approach by analysing trade data from the South African Revenue Services (SARS) and household data from the World Bank and OECD The threshold vector autoregressive (TVAR) model is employed to establish a nonlinear causal relationship The Diks-Panchenko nonparametric causality test revealed no causal relationship between the foreign agricultural trade and household consumption and household income in South Africa However, with the increase of exported agricultural goods from South Africa, there are many significant benefits to South African households","output":"Trends in foreign agricultural trade and its impact on households in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because COVID-19 and other emerging infectious diseases are likely to play an increasingly important role in shaping American and global society in years to come, there is a need to prepare young people to make informed decisions in this changing global context.

Obtaining QALY values for COVID-19 presents a challenge owing to the availability of two US EQ-5D-5L value sets and the potentially asymptomatic presentation of the disease. The first value set was completed allowing for the discounting of future health outcomes while the second value set is undiscounted. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the distribution of QALY values using a national survey and the two published value sets; and to estimate the association between COVID-19 outcomes and QALY losses. METHODS: Between 9 and 11 November, 2020, 1153 US adults completed the EQ-5D-5L instrument (five items and a visual analog scale) as well as self-reported their demographics, COVID-19 symptoms, and memberships to populations that are at risk of COVID-19 infection. The two US value sets were applied to the EQ-5D-5L responses to produce QALY values. We estimated the mean QALYs by visual analog scale decile and a generalized linear model of COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: The discounted values are higher than the undiscounted values for each visual analog scale decile owing to methodological differences. Persons at increased risk, with a fever in the past day, and with one or more other symptoms have significantly greater QALY losses (p < 0.01). Overall, non-institutionalized individuals at risk of symptomatic clinical COVID-19 equal 0.68 for the 2016 value set (95% confidence interval 0.49-0.87) and 0.10 for the 2017 value set (95% confidence interval - 0.31 to 0.51) QALYs.

Majority of the respondent strongly agree/agree that covid-19 vaccine is safe for adults and children. Significant variation among all the groups was found regarding acquisition of higher immunity following infection rather by vaccination, effectiveness in infection prevention, safety in children, provision of mandatory vaccination by government, and public health protection following government guidelines.Conclusion: The major barrier to the covid-19 vaccination was found to be safety and awareness. But there is well acceptance to covid-19 vaccine among the community of Odisha, India, and further efforts to create awareness concerning safety and vaccination will be instrumental in the eradication of this infection.","output":"Covid-19 vaccine, acceptance, and concern of safety from public perspective in the state of Odisha, India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a disease with unique characteristics including lung thrombosis1, frequent diarrhoea2, abnormal activation of the inflammatory response3 and rapid deterioration of lung function consistent with alveolar oedema4. The pathological substrate for these findings remains elusive. Here we show that the lungs of patients with COVID-19 contain infected pneumocytes with abnormal morphology and frequent multinucleation. Generation of these syncytia results from activation of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein at the cell plasma membrane level. Based on these observations, we performed two high-content microscopy-based screenings with over 3000 approved drugs to search for inhibitors of Spike-driven syncytia. We converged on the identification of 83 drugs that inhibited Spike-mediated cell fusion, several of which belonged to defined pharmacological classes. We focussed our attention on effective drugs that also protected against virus replication and associated cytopathicity. One of the most effective molecules was Niclosamide, which markedly blunted calcium oscillations and membrane conductances in Spike-expressing cells by suppressing the activity of TMEM16F/Anoctamin6, a calcium-activated ion channel and scramblase responsible for phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for COVID-19 disease pathogenesis and support the repurposing of Niclosamide for therapy.","output":"Drugs that inhibit TMEM16 proteins block SARS-CoV-2 Spike-induced syncytia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: dental procedures produce bio-aerosols that can carry the highly contagious COVID-19 virus. Hence, the entire dental care team has to follow the current COVID-19 related infection control protocols. The study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices associated with infection control methods during dental procedures among dental practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. METHODS: the online questionnaire consisted of four sections namely, demographic details, eight questions on knowledge, four questions on attitude and eight questions on the practice of dentists during COVID-19 pandemic. One point was attributed for a correct response and zero point for an incorrect response. The study used descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression models in Jamovi 1.8.1 to establish relationships between knowledge, attitude, and practices among dental professionals and their demographic characteristics. RESULTS: among 384 dentists, 294 (76.6%) were aware of the hand hygiene methods, 372 dentists (96.9%) were aware of the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), 343 dentists (89.3%) recorded the body temperature of the patients. One hundred and thirty eight (138) dentists (35.9%) did not use rubber dam and 158 dentists (41.1%) were not aware of the four-handed dentistry. Among the study participants, 57.8% displayed adequate knowledge, 63.8% possessed good attitude and 93.5% followed good practices on COVID-19 appropriate infection control measures during dental procedures. The mean knowledge, attitude, and practice scores were found to be 6.61, 2.04, and 3.38 respectively. Based on multivariable binary logistic regression analysis, it is observed that males (aOR: 0.55, 95% CI 0.35-0.87; p=0.011) have a lower likelihood of having a good knowledge when compared with females after adjusting for the other independent variables in the model. Also, individuals with higher qualifications (aOR: 0.57, 95% CI 0.36-0.92; p=0.022) appear to have lower likelihood of having good knowledge on COVID-19 infection control methods during dental procedure.

In the current study, we aimed to investigate how the period of home confinement affected self-reported sleep characteristics in Italians and Belgians, with special regard to sleep timing and subjective quality. Using an online survey we collected data from 2272 participants, 1622 Italians (Mage = 34.1  13.6 years, 1171 F), and 650 Belgian (Mage = 43.0  16.8 years, 509 F). Participants reported their sleep pattern (eg, bedtime, risetime) and perceived sleep quality during and, retrospectively, before the lockdown. During the lockdown, sleep timing was significantly delayed, time spent in bed increased, and sleep quality was markedly impaired in both Italians and Belgians. The most vulnerable individuals appeared to be women, subjects experiencing a more negative mood, and those perceiving the pandemic situation as highly stressful. However, the two samples differed in the subgroups most affected by the changes, possibly because of the different welfare systems of the two countries. In fact, in the Italian sample sleep quality and timing underwent significant modifications especially in unemployed participants, whereas in the Belgian sample this category was the one who suffered less from the restrictions.

NMV/r will be primarily administered outside the hospital setting as a 5-day course oral treatment. The ritonavir component boosts plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir through the potent and rapid inhibition of the key drug metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Thus NMV/r, even given as a short treatment course, has a high potential to cause harm from drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with other drugs metabolized through this pathway. Options for mitigating risk from DDIs with NMV/r are limited due to the clinical illness, the short window for intervention and the related difficulty to implement clinical monitoring or dosage adjustment of the comedication. Pragmatic options are largely confined to pre-emptive or symptom-driven pausing of the comedication or managing any additional risk through counselling. This review summarizes the effects of ritonavir on drug disposition (i.e. metabolizing enzymes and transporters) and discusses factors determining the likelihood of having a clinically significant DDI. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive list of comedications likely to be used in COVID-19 patients which are categorized according to their potential DDI risk with NMV/r.

Here, we examine the relationship between self-reported cognitive biases (CB) and emotion regulation skills (ER), COVID-19 risk perception and affective response, and mental well-being (MWB). Five Hundred and Eleven individuals completed General Health Questionnaire, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Davos Assessment of Cognitive Biases Scale (DACOBS) as well as scales measuring COVID-19 risk perception and affective response during the initial days of the epidemic in Poland. We used path and bootstrapping analyses to examine the hypothesis that CB may shape MWB during COVID-19 pandemic both directly and indirectly by (i) decreasing ER capacity and (ii) by increasing COVID-19 risk perception and affective response. Negative effect of CB and positive effect of ER via cognitive reappraisal on MWB were observed in participants. Furthermore, in line with our hypothesis, we observed indirect effects of CB via increased COVID-19 risk perception and affective response and decreased use of reappraisal strategy, which all, in turn, were related to MWB. Finally, we found an indirect effect of CB on MWB through double mediation of suppression strategies and COVID-19 affective response.

It is activated by long stretches of dsRNA and provides the first line of host defense against pathogens by inhibiting translation initiation in the infected cell. Many cellular and viral transcripts contain nucleoside modifications and/or tertiary structure that could affect PKR activation. We have previously demonstrated that a 5-end triphosphateCa signature of certain viral and bacterial transcriptsCconfers the ability of relatively unstructured model RNA transcripts to activate PKR to inhibit translation, and that this activation is abrogated by certain modifications present in cellular RNAs. In order to understand the biological implications of native RNA tertiary structure and nucleoside modifications on PKR activation, we study here the heavily modified cellular tRNAs and the unmodified or the lightly modified mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNA). We find that both a T7 transcript of yeast tRNA(Phe) and natively extracted total bovine liver mt-tRNA activate PKR in vitro, whereas native E. coli, bovine liver, yeast, and wheat tRNA(Phe) do not, nor do a variety of base- or sugar-modified T7 transcripts. These results are further supported by activation of PKR by a natively folded T7 transcript of tRNA(Phe) in vivo supporting the importance of tRNA modification in suppressing PKR activation in cells. We also examine PKR activation by a T7 transcript of the A14G pathogenic mutant of mt-tRNA(Leu), which is known to dimerize, and find that the misfolded dimeric form activates PKR in vitro while the monomeric form does not. Overall, the in vitro and in vivo findings herein indicate that tRNAs have an intrinsic ability to activate PKR and that nucleoside modifications and native RNA tertiary folding may function, at least in part, to suppress such activation, thus serving to distinguish self and non-self tRNA in innate immunity.","output":"Native Tertiary Structure and Nucleoside Modifications Suppress tRNAs Intrinsic Ability to Activate the Innate Immune Sensor PKR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has highly impacted the communities globally by reprioritizing the means through which various societal sectors operate Among these sectors, healthcare providers and medical workers have been impacted prominently due to the massive increase in demand for medical services under unprecedented circumstances Hence, any tool that can help the compliance with social guidelines for COVID-19 spread prevention will have a positive impact on managing and controlling the virus outbreak and reducing the excessive burden on the healthcare system This perspective article disseminates the perspectives of the authors regarding the use of novel biosensors and intelligent algorithms embodied in wearable IoMT frameworks for tackling this issue We discuss how with the use of smart IoMT wearables certain biomarkers can be tracked for detection of COVID-19 in exposed individuals We enumerate several machine learning algorithms which can be used to process a wide range of collected biomarkers for detecting (a) multiple symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and (b) the dynamical likelihood of contracting the virus through interpersonal interaction Eventually, we enunciate how a systematic use of smart wearable IoMT devices in various social sectors can intelligently help controlling the spread of COVID-19 in communities as they enter the reopening phase We explain how this framework can benefit individuals and their medical correspondents by introducing Systems for Symptom Decoding (SSD), and how the use of this technology can be generalized on a societal level for the control of spread by introducing Systems for Spread Tracing (SST)","output":"Perspective: Wearable Internet of Medical Things for Remote Tracking of Symptoms, Prediction of Health Anomalies, Implementation of Preventative Measures, and Control of Virus Spread During the Era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Few reports have presented an overall view of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across an entire country and throughout the entire gestation period.

Methods: : A nationwide questionnaire-based survey for all 2,185 maternity services in Japan was conducted between July and August 2020. Information regarding maternal characteristics and epidemiological, clinical, treatment, and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 between 16 January and 30 June 2020 were collected. Main outcome measures were incidence of pregnant women with COVID-19 and infant infection, positive rate of the universal screening test for asymptomatic pregnant women, identification of infection route and rates of maternal death, and severe cases. Results: : Responses from 1,418 institutions were assessed (65% of all delivery institutions in Japan). Seventy-two pregnant women were reported to have been diagnosed with COVID-19. The positive rate of the universal screening test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among asymptomatic pregnant women was 0.03% (2/7428). The most common route of infection was familial (57%). Fifty-eight pregnant women with COVID-19 were symptomatic, of whom five (8.6%) had a severe infection and one died (a tourist).

We searched for studies published during COVID-19 pandemic and reporting information about the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included in the review. The percentage of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was not so high (up to 86.1% students or 77.6% general population); for influenza vaccine, the maximum percentage was 69%. Several factors influenced the acceptance or refusal (ethnicity, working status, religiosity, politics, gender, age, education, income, etc.). The most given reasons to refuse vaccine were as follows: being against vaccines in general, concerns about safety/thinking that a vaccine produced in a rush is too dangerous, considering the vaccine useless because of the harmless nature of COVID-19, general lack of trust, doubts about the efficiency of the vaccine, belief to be already immunized, doubt about the provenience of vaccine.

Methods: The Oncomine and TIMER databases were used to examine the expression of PER1 in OV. KaplanCMeier Plotter and PrognoScan were used to evaluate the relationship between PER1 and prognosis. KaplanCMeier Plotter was used to analyze the relationships between PER1 and clinicopathological features of OV patients. The relationship between PER1 expression and immune infiltration in OV was investigated using the TIMER database and CIBERSORT algorithm. The STRING database was used to analyze PER1-related protein functional groups, the GeneMANIA online tool was used to analyze gene groups with similar functions to those of PER1, and Network Analyst was used to identify transcription factors that regulate PER1. The correlation between PER1 and immunoinvasion of OV was analyzed using TIMER. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect PER1 expression. Results: PER1 was differentially expressed in different cancer tissues, and its expression in various OV subtypes was lower than that in normal ovarian tissue. OV patients with low PER1 expression had a reduced overall survival rate. Decreased PER1 expression in stage 1 and stage 1+2 OV patients was related to poor prognosis, while increased PER1 expression in stage 3+4 patients and TP53 mutation were related to poor overall survival and progression-free survival. We identified eight genes whose expression was strongly correlated with that of PER1, as well as four transcription factors that regulate PER1. In OV, PER1 expression levels were positively correlated with infiltration levels of cells including neutrophils, regulatory T cells, and M2 macrophages, and closely related to a variety of immune markers. Reduced expression of PER1 was significantly associated with poor overall survival.

Among 2,506 parents surveyed, 44.3% supported school-based vaccine mandates for students and 69.1% supported mandates for teachers and school staff. Asian parents, male parents, those with higher income, college education, those voting for the 2021 Democratic mayoral candidate and parents from Manhattan were most likely to support vaccine mandates for students. Among all parents, 25.1% said they would not vaccinate their child if required. Our data show only modest support for school-based vaccine mandates for children despite their importance in improving vaccination coverage.","output":"Acceptability of COVID-19 vaccine mandates among New York City parents, November 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and moderate COVID-19 may be the most common COVID-19 cases. This study was designed to develop a diagnostic model for patients with asymptomatic and moderate COVID-19 based on demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables. METHODS: This retrospective study divided the subjects into 2 groups: asymptomatic COVID-19 (without symptoms, n = 15) and moderate COVID-19 (with symptoms, n = 57). Demographic characteristics, clinical data, routine blood tests, other laboratory tests, and inpatient data were collected and analyzed to compare patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 and moderate COVID-19. RESULTS: Comparison of the asymptomatic COVID-19 group with the moderate COVID-19 group yielded the following results: the patients were younger (P = 0.045); the cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ (cytotoxic) T cell level was higher (P = 0.017); the C-reactive protein (CRP) level was lower (P = 0.001); the white blood cell (WBC, P < 0.001), neutrophil (NEU, P = 0.036), lymphocyte (LYM, P = 0.009), and eosinophil (EOS, P = 0.036) counts were higher; and the serum iron level (P = 0.049) was higher in the asymptomatic COVID-19 group. The multivariate analysis showed that the NEU count (odds ratio [OR] = 2.007, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.162 - 3.715, P = 0.014) and LYM count (OR = 9.380, 95% CI: 2.382 - 36.934, P = 0.001) were independent factors for the presence of clinical symptoms after COVID-19 infection. The NEU count and LYM count were diagnostic predictors of asymptomatic COVID-19. This diagnostic prediction model showed high discriminatory power, consistency, and net clinical benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model can distinguish asymptomatic COVID-19 from moderate COVID-19, thereby helping clinicians identify and distinguish patients with potential asymptomatic COVID-19 from those with moderate COVID-19.","output":"Neutrophils and Lymphocytes Can Help Distinguish Asymptomatic COVID-19 From Moderate COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the coronavirus pandemic began, research groups worldwide developed diagnostic tests. One of the promising platforms for testing is an optical and plasmonic biosensor. Localized surface plasmon resonances owing to their highly concentrated field intensity provide highly sensitive devices. A beneficial approach to excite localized surface plasmon modes for field-based applications is using photonic crystal fibers while photonic quasi-crystals demonstrate a higher order of symmetry, the more isotropic Brillouin zone, and the easier achievement of photonic bandgap as compared with conventional photonic crystals. In this work, by exploiting a photonic quasi-crystal fiber, we are designing a surface plasmon resonance biosensor for the on-chip and real-time detection of coronaviruses. In our miniaturized design, a thin gold layer is employed on the outer layer of an air hole of a photonic quasi-crystal fiber with a 12-fold symmetry where the leakage of the fiber core mode can excite the surface plasmon resonance mode on the gold. According to three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations, the proposed biosensor shows the sensitivity of 1172 nm/RIU in the detection of coronaviruses within the saliva. Moreover, the smallest detection limit obtained in the simulation is about 12 nm. These promising results altogether indicate that this reconfigurable and lab-on-a-chip platform can potentially be used in the detection of all kinds of coronaviruses.","output":"Photonic Quasi-Crystal Fiber-Based Plasmonic Biosensor: a Platform for Detection of Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patient: Male, 23-year-old Final Diagnosis: Cytokine release syndrome ? disseminated intravascular coagulation ? multiple organ failure Symptoms: Auditory hallucinations ? fever ? headache ? restlessness ? suicidal thoughts Medication:  Clinical Procedure:  Specialty: Infectious Diseases ? Neurology OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: Cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CLOCC) is a rare clinical and radiological syndrome that has been associated with various infectious etiologies. CLOCC are among the recently described neurological associations with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report a case of CLOCC in a man with SARS-CoV-2 infection who presented with auditory hallucinations and rapidly developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). CASE REPORT: A 23-year-old man with no past medical and psychiatric history presented with auditory hallucinations, restlessness, and suicidal ideations. A nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was positive for SARS-CoV-2. A brain MRI revealed an isolated oval-shaped lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum, with hyperintense signal on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and hypointense on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, suggestive of CLOCC. After a dramatic hospital course associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and severe intra-abdominal and cerebral bleeding, he developed cardiac arrest and died on hospital day 15. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the need for increased vigilance for the atypical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, it suggests that CLOCC can be considered as a differential diagnosis by clinicians in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who present with unexplained neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms, leading to poor outcome.","output":"A 23-Year-Old Man with SARS-CoV-2 Infection Who Presented with Auditory Hallucinations and Imaging Findings of Cytotoxic Lesions of the Corpus Callosum (CLOCC)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We use aggregated data from Facebook to show that COVID-19 was more likely to spread between regions with stronger social network connections.

These relationships hold after controlling for geographic distance to the hotspots as well as for the income and population densities of the regions. As the pandemic progressed in the U.S., a county's social proximity to recent COVID- 19 cases predicts future outbreaks over and above physical proximity.

These differences likely underlie the changes in Omicron biology noted in other studies, including an attenuation in the lung parenchyma, compared to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and other variants, as well as a preference for endosomal entry, in place of the TMPRSS2-mediated membrane fusion pathway. This raises questions on Omicron tropism and infectivity in various target organ systems, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Up to 70% of COVID-19 patients report GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Here, we show that in the context of donor intrinsic genetic heterogeneity, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infects human colonoids similarly, if not less effectively, than the ancestral WT (WA1) strain or the Delta variant. Additionally, we note a higher ratio of viral RNA to infectious virus titer, which may suggest that Omicron is potentially less infectious in the intestine.

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, these resources were no longer available due to health and safety protocols. With the advancement of technology, it was possible to create anatomy walkthrough videos for the students to supplement the traditional methods of teaching anatomy. GOAL To investigate the effectiveness of a video based guide to learning gross anatomy of the boney pelvis and the viscera. METHODS Two videos were created covering the boney pelvis and the viscera for the first and second year medical students. The videos were presented by an anatomy professor and filmed and edited by Medical Students. The video covers the curriculum outline, labels relevant parts of the anatomy, and provides extra information relating to form and function. The videos included a quiz at the end for students to test their knowledge. The videos were made available online on Youtube to an international audience, along with a feedback survey. RESULTS Feedback was collected on the boney pelvis and the viscera videos. The respondents watched the videos for the purpose of preparing for anatomy labs and dissections, preparing for anatomy lectures and preparing for examinations. The majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the videos presented assisted them in fulfilling their indicated purpose (89.1%), that a combination of video and written materials should be used for effective learning of anatomy (95.7%), and that they would like to see videos for other anatomical regions (95.7%). CONCLUSION In summary, digital media in the form of video-based anatomy guides may be useful in instances when in person teaching is not possible and may be a useful tool to be incorporated into the educational curriculum in combination with traditional teaching methods.

The complex interplay of social determinants, service system factors, population demographics, and behavioural dynamics makes it extraordinarily difficult for decision makers to determine the nature and balance of investments required to have the greatest impacts on SB. Real-world experimentation to establish the optimal targeting, timing, scale, frequency, and intensity of investments required across the determinants is unfeasible. Therefore, this study harnesses systems modelling and simulation to guide population-level decision making that represent best strategic allocation of limited resources. METHODS: Using a participatory approach, and informed by a range of national, state, and local datasets, a system dynamics model was developed, tested, and validated for a regional population catchment. The model incorporated defined pathways from social determinants of mental health to psychological distress, mental health care, and SB. Intervention scenarios were investigated to forecast their impact on SB over a 20-year period. RESULTS: A combination of social connectedness programs, technology-enabled coordinated care, post-attempt assertive aftercare, reductions in childhood adversity, and increasing youth employment projected the greatest impacts on SB, particularly in a youth population, reducing self-harm hospitalisations (suicide attempts) by 28.5% (95% interval 26.3C30.8%) and suicide deaths by 29.3% (95% interval 27.1C31.5%). Introducing additional interventions beyond the best performing suite of interventions produced only marginal improvement in population level impacts, highlighting that more is not necessarily better. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that targeted investments in addressing the social determinants and in mental health services provides the best opportunity to reduce SB and suicide. Systems modelling and simulation offers a robust approach to leveraging best available research, data, and expert knowledge in a way that helps decision makers respond to the unique characteristics and drivers of SB in their catchments and more effectively focus limited health resources.

METHODS: Patients operated for lumbar disc herniation or lumbar spinal stenosis between 2007 and 2017, were recruited from the national Swedish spine register. A total of 16,910 procedures were eligible for analysis. The responsiveness of the SF-36 general health assessment items to surgical treatment was evaluated with the standardized response mean (SRM). Improvement in self-rated general health was used to dichotomize SF-36 profiles and EQ VAS distributions. RESULTS: For disc herniation, 5852 (83%) patients reported improvement in general health 1 year after surgery. For spinal stenosis, the corresponding numbers were 6,482 (66%). The additional improvement after year 1 was small. The responsiveness of the SF-36 item 2 (the health transition item) to surgical treatment of disc herniation or spinal stenosis was substantial.

The present study therefore aims to determine the association of vitamin D status with the different domains of intelligence among Saudi Arabian adolescents. This study used relational survey method among 1864 Saudi adolescent, including 549 boys and 1315 girls (mean age 14.7  1.7 years) recruited using a multistage, stratified cluster randomization of 47 public and private schools in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. A general questionnaire was used to collect demographic information. Intelligence was assessed using multiple intelligence inventory. Anthropometrics were measured and fasting blood samples collected for assessment of glucose and lipid profile. Vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <50 nmol/L) was observed in 84.2% of boys and 93.5% of girls. Girls had higher levels of verbal, kinesthetic, musical, naturalist and existential intelligence than boys, while boys have higher logical intelligence than girls (p-values < 0.05). Mixed regression analysis controlled for age, BMI and sex revealed that kinesthetic intelligence was significantly associated with 25(OH)D in boys ( 5.6 (2.8C8.5; p < 0.001)) and inversely associated with musical intelligence ( ?1.2 (?2.3C0.1; p = 0.03)) and positively with naturalist ( 2.3 (0.5C4.2; p = 0.01)) in girls.

This analysis assesses if their completion is associated with mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cohort from the National Diabetes Audit of England and Wales comprising 179 105 people with type 1 and 1 397 790 with type 2 diabetes, aged 17-99 years on 1st January 2009, diagnosed before 1st January 2009 and alive on 1st April 2013 was followed to 31st December 2019. Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for demographic characteristics, smoking, HbA1c , BP, serum cholesterol, BMI, duration of diagnosis, eGFR, prior myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, respiratory disease and cancer, investigated whether care processes recorded 1st January 2009 to 31st March 2010 were associated with subsequent mortality. RESULTS Over a mean follow-up of 7.5 and 7.0 years there were 26 915 and 388 093 deaths in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes respectively. Completion of five or less, compared to eight, care processes (retinal screening not included as data not reliable) had a mortality hazard ratio of 1.37 (95% CI 1.28-1.46) in people with type 1 and 1.32 (95% CI 1.30-1.35) in people with type 2 diabetes. The hazard ratio was higher for respiratory disease deaths and lower in South Asian ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS People with diabetes who have fewer routine care processes have higher mortality.

Given its potential for providing evidence of causality in complex systems, QCA is increasingly used in evaluative research to examine the uptake or impacts of public health interventions. We map this emerging field, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of QCA approaches identified in published studies, and identify implications for future research and reporting. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were systematically searched for peer-reviewed studies published in English up to December 2019 that had used QCA methods to identify the conditions associated with the uptake and/or effectiveness of interventions for public health. Data relating to the interventions studied (settings/level of intervention/populations), methods (type of QCA, case level, source of data, other methods used) and reported strengths and weaknesses of QCA were extracted and synthesised narratively. RESULTS: The search identified 1384 papers, of which 27 (describing 26 studies) met the inclusion criteria. Interventions evaluated ranged across: nutrition/obesity (n = 8); physical activity (n = 4); health inequalities (n = 3); mental health (n = 2); community engagement (n = 3); chronic condition management (n = 3); vaccine adoption or implementation (n = 2); programme implementation (n = 3); breastfeeding (n = 2), and general population health (n = 1). The majority of studies (n = 24) were of interventions solely or predominantly in high income countries. Key strengths reported were that QCA provides a method for addressing causal complexity; and that it provides a systematic approach for understanding the mechanisms at work in implementation across contexts. Weaknesses reported related to data availability limitations, especially on ineffective interventions. The majority of papers demonstrated good knowledge of cases, and justification of case selection, but other criteria of methodological quality were less comprehensively met. CONCLUSION: QCA is a promising approach for addressing the role of context in complex interventions, and for identifying causal configurations of conditions that predict implementation and/or outcomes when there is sufficiently detailed understanding of a series of comparable cases. As the use of QCA in evaluative health research increases, there may be a need to develop advice for public health researchers and journals on minimum criteria for quality and reporting.

These enzymes are also members of the dihydroorotate dehydrogenases (DHODHs) family, which besides membrane bound DHOQOs, class 2, includes soluble enzymes which reduce either NAD+ or fumarate, class 1. As key enzymes in both the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway as well as in the energetic metabolism, inhibitors of DHOQOs have been investigated as leads for therapeutics in cancer, immunological disorders and bacterial/viral infections. This work is a thorough bioinformatic approach on the structural conservation and taxonomic distribution of DHOQOs. We explored previously established structural/functional hallmarks of these enzymes, while searching for uncharacterized common elements. We also discuss the cellular role of DHOQOs and organize the identified protein sequences within six sub-classes 2A to 2F, according to their taxonomic origin and sequence traits. We concluded that DHOQOs are present in Archaea, Eukarya and Bacteria, including the first recognition in Gram-positive organisms. DHOQOs can be the single dihydroorotate dehydrogenase encoded in the genome of a species, or they can coexist with other DHODHs, as the NAD+ or fumarate reducing enzymes.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Summary data on 27 291 employees at a tertiary healthcare system in the Greater Houston metropolitan area between 15 December 2020 and 5 June 2021. The initial 12-week vaccination programme period (15 December 2020 to 6 March 2021) was defined as a rapid roll-out phase. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: At the pandemic onset, HCW testing and surveillance was conducted where SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs were offered STDL. Deidentified summary data of SARS-CoV-2 infections and STDL utilisation among HCWs were analysed. Prevaccination and postvaccination trends in SARS-CoV-2 positivity and STDL utilisation rates were evaluated. RESULTS: Updated for 5 June 2021, 98.2% (n=26 791) of employees received a full or partial dose of one of the approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccination rate during the rapid roll-out phase was approximately 3700 doses/7 days. The overall mean weekly SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates among HCWs were significantly lower following vaccine roll-out (2.4%), compared with prevaccination period (11.8%, p<0.001). An accompanying 69.8% decline in STDL utilisation was also observed (315 to 95 weekly leaves). During the rapid roll-out phase, SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate among Houston Methodist HCWs declined by 84.3% (8.9% to 1.4% positivity rate), compared with a 54.7% (12.8% to 5.8% positivity rate) decline in the Houston metropolitan area. CONCLUSION: Despite limited generalisability of regional hospital-based studieswhere factors such as the emergence of viral variants and population-level vaccine penetrance may differaccounts of robust HCW vaccination programmes provide important guidance for sustaining a critical resource to provide safe and effective care for patients with and without COVID-19 across healthcare systems.","output":"Impact of mRNA vaccines in curtailing SARS-CoV-2 infection and disability leave utilisation among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional analysis from a tertiary healthcare system in the Greater Houston metropolitan area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Semantic segmentation involves extracting meaningful information from images or input from a video or recording frames. It is the way to perform the extraction by checking pixels by pixel using a classification approach. It gives us more accurate and fine details from the data we need for further evaluation.

Together with the vector length, PhA constitutes the bioimpedance vector analysis (BIVA) patterns, and their joint interpretation exceeds the limits of the evaluation of the PhA alone. The present investigation aimed to monitor changes in the BIVA patterns during a training macrocycle in swimmers, trying to ascertain if these parameters are sensitive to training load changes across a 13-week training period. METHODS Twelve national and international level swimmers (four females; eight males; 20.9  1.9 years; with a competitive swimming background of 11.3  1.8 years; undertaking 16-20 h of pool training and 4-5 h of dry-land training per week and 822.0  59.0 International Swimming Federation (FINA) points) were evaluated for resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) using a single frequency phase sensitive bioimpedance device at the beginning of the macrocycle (M1), just before the beginning of the taper period (M2), and just before the main competition of the macrocycle (M3). At the three-time assessment points, swimmers also performed a 50 m all-out first stroke sprint with track start (T50 m) while time was recorded. RESULTS The results of the Hotelling T2 test showed a significant vector displacement due to simultaneous R and Xc changes (p < 0.001), where shifting from top to bottom along the major axis of the R-Xc graph from M1 to M2 was observed. From M2 to M3, a vector displacement up and left along the minor axis of the tolerance ellipses resulted in an increase in PhA (p < 0.01). The results suggest a gain in fluid with a decrease in cellular density from M1 to M2 due to decrements in R and Xc. Nevertheless, the reduced training load characterizing taper seemed to allow for an increase in PhA and, most importantly, an increase of Xc, thus demonstrating improved cellular health and physical condition, which was concomitant with a significant increase in the T50 m performance (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS PhA, obtained by bioelectrical R and Xc, can be useful in monitoring the condition of swimmers preparing for competition.

Though all nations of the world have been affected by this disease, there have been marked cross-national variations in prevalence, severity and mortality rates. Various explanations, based on demographic, social and climatic factors, have been suggested to account for this variability, but these remain unverified to date. Based on recent research findings suggesting that human enterocytes may serve as a point of entry for SARS-CoV-2, leading to intestinal viral replication, this paper puts forward the hypothesis that prior intestinal infection with coronaviruses, either symptomatic or asymptomatic, may moderate this process and minimize the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This hypothesis is supported by evidence on the gastrointestinal manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and related infections, on the geographical patterns observed in the variability of COVID-19 mortality, and on the occurrence and geographical distribution of outbreaks of diarrheal disease, as well as asymptomatic infection, with human coronaviruses as verified by direct or serological testing. Preliminary supporting evidence based on national and international health statistics is presented, along with suggestions on more robust methods by which this hypothesis may be tested.

Case reports suggest that cardiac dysfunction may also occur in patients with transient global amnesia (TGA). Until now, no study has systematically assessed this phenomenon. METHODS We performed a case-control study using data of consecutive patients presenting with TGA from 2010 to 2015. Multiple logistic regression analysis accounting for age, sex and cardiovascular risk factors was performed to compare the likelihood of myocardial injury [defined as elevation of cTn > 99th percentile (14 ng/L); highly sensitive cardiac troponin T assay] in TGA with three reference groups: migraine with aura, vestibular neuritis and transient ischaemic attack (TIA). RESULTS Cardiac troponin elevation occurred in 28 (25%) of 113 patients with TGA. Patients with TGA with cTn elevation were significantly older, more likely to be female and had higher blood pressure on admission compared with those without. The likelihood of myocardial injury following TGA was at least more than twofold higher compared with all three reference groups [adjusted odds ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-26.4, compared with migraine with aura; adjusted odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.4, compared with vestibular neuritis; adjusted odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2, compared with TIA]. CONCLUSIONS One out of four patients with TGA had evidence of myocardial injury as assessed by highly sensitive cTn assays.

In doing so, the regulatory assessment process can be clearly beneficial to integrated pest management (IPM) programs. In general, the regulatory framework for insect-resistant GM crops includes an assessment of the following: effects of the insecticidal trait on non-target organisms, other potential adverse environmental impacts, evolution of resistance to target pests, and environmental and agronomic benefits of the insecticidal trait. Each countrys regulatory system is dependent on the overall environmental risk management goals, relevant and available risk information, scientific capacity, and the available financial resources. A number of regulatory activities can help to ensure that new products such as Bt crops fit well within IPM programs: (1) evaluation of the environmental safety of new products, and their ability to enhance IPM; (2) encouragement of the adoption of new technologies with improved environmental safety profiles; (3) adoption of an expedited regulatory review system; and (4) encouragement and appropriate oversight of sustainable use of such products. Governmental regulation of insect-resistant GM crops can also hinder IPM programs by creating significant barriers to the adoption of such technologies. Such barriers include: (1) absence of functioning regulatory systems in many developing countries; (2) meeting the obligations and understanding the various interpretations of international treaties, e.g., Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety; (3) lack of public sector research to generate data supporting the safety of these crops; and (4) regulatory costs involved in the development and commercialization of novel products for small market sectors. Ways in which regulatory data requirements can be globally harmonized need to be considered to decrease the regulatory barriers for insect-resistant GM crops and comparable technologies.

Design: Retrospective clinical audit and simulation model. Setting: Multiple UK NHS ophthalmology centres. Participants: Data on the reduction in new nAMD referrals was obtained from four NHS Trusts in England comparing April 2020 to April 2019. To estimate the potential impact on one-year visual outcomes, a stratified bootstrap simulation model was developed drawing on an electronic medical records dataset of 20,825 nAMD eyes from 27 NHS Trusts. Main outcome measures: Simulated mean visual acuity and proportions of eyes with vision []6/60, []6/24 and []6/12 at one year under four hypothetical scenarios: no treatment delay, 3, 6 and 9-month treatment delays. Estimated additional number of eyes with vision []6/60 at one year nationally. Results: The number of nAMD referrals at four major eye treatment hospital groups based in England dropped on average by 72% (range 65 to 87%) in April 2020 compared to April 2019. Simulated one-year visual outcomes for 1000 nAMD eyes with a 3-month treatment delay suggested an increase in the proportion of eyes with vision []6/60 from 15.5% (13.2 to 17.9) to 23.3% (20.7 to25.9), and a decrease in the proportion of eyes with vision []6/12 (driving vision) from 35.1% (32.1 to 38.1) to 26.4% (23.8 to29.2). Outcomes worsened incrementally with longer modelled delays.

Conclusions: We report a large decrease in nAMD referrals during the first month of COVID-19 lockdown and provide an important public health message regarding the risk of delayed treatment. As a conservative estimate, a treatment delay of 3 months could lead to a >50% relative increase in the number of eyes with vision []6/60 and 25% relative decrease in the number of eyes with driving vision at one year.","output":"Estimating excess visual loss in people with neovascular age-related macular degeneration during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The advancement of science and technology has led to the recent development of highly sensitive pathogen biosensing techniques.

However, a mounting body of evidence suggests that at physiological doses, bilirubin is a powerful antioxidant and anti-atherosclerotic agent. Recent clinical studies have shown that human beings with genetically-induced hyperbilirubinemia (Gilbert Syndrome) are protected against coronary heart disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether administration of exogenous bilirubin to normal rats would convey similar protective effects in an experimental model of coronary ischemia. We hypothesized that intraperitoneal bilirubin administration 1 h before injury would decrease infarct area and preserve left ventricular (LV) systolic function when compared to non-treated rats. Coronary ischemia was induced by temporary (30 min) ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in control or bilirubin treated rats, followed by a 1-h period of reperfusion. LV function was estimated by measurements of fractional shortening (FS) and fractional area shortening using echocardiography. LV function decreased in both experimental groups after ischemia and reperfusion, although in bilirubin-treated rats FS was less depressed during the period of ischemia (18.8 vs. 25.8%, p = 0.034). Infarct size was significantly reduced in the bilirubin treated group compared to the non-treated group (13.34 vs. 25.5%, p = 0.0067). Based on the results of this study, bilirubin supplementation appears to provide significant decrease in infarct size although protective effects on LV function were noted only during the period of ischemia. This result also suggests that lipid soluble antioxidant bilirubin prevents the oxidation of cardiolipin and decreases the infarct size in the heart during ischemia.","output":"Intraperitoneal bilirubin administration decreases infarct area in a rat coronary ischemia/reperfusion model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has boosted medical students' vulnerability to various problems.

Take home - any 4 h within a 24-h window for end of semester) implemented in a radiologic pathology unit of a Bachelor of Science (Medical Radiation Science) course during the pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective study involving a review and analysis of existing information related to the integrity of the two radiologic pathology assessments. Three integrity evaluation approaches were employed. The first approach was to review all the Turnitin plagiarism detection software reports with use of 'seven-words-in-a-row' criterion to identify any potential collusion. The second approach was to search for highly irrelevant assessment answers during marking for detection of other cheating types. Examples of highly irrelevant answers included those not addressing question requirements and stating patients' clinical information not from given patient histories. The third approach was an assessment score statistical analysis through descriptive and inferential statistics to identify any abnormal patterns that might suggest cheating occurred. An abnormal pattern example was high assessment scores. The descriptive statistics used were minimum, maximum, range, first quartile, median, third quartile, interquartile range, mean, standard deviation, fail and full mark rates. T-test was employed to compare mean scores between the two assessments in this year (2020), between the two assessments in the last year (2019), between the two mid-semester assessments in 2019 and 2020, and between this and last years' end of semester assessments. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: No cheating evidence was found in all Turnitin reports and assessment answers. The mean scores of the end of semester assessments in 2019 (88.2%) and 2020 (90.9%) were similar (p = 0.098). However, the mean score of the online open book mid-semester assessment in 2020 (62.8%) was statistically significantly lower than that of the traditional invigilated mid-semester assessment in 2019 (71.8%) with p < 0.0001. CONCLUSION: This study shows the use of the online open book assessments with tight time restrictions and the take home formats in the radiologic pathology unit did not have any academic integrity issues. Apparently, the strict assessment time limit played an important role in maintaining their integrity.","output":"Evaluation of academic integrity of online open book assessments implemented in an undergraduate medical radiation science course during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background A disease caused by a novel coronavirus virus, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), broke out in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and spread around the word As of March 4, 2020, 93090 confirmed cases and 2984 deaths have been reported in more than 80 countries and territories It has triggered global public health security However, the features and prognosis of COVID-19 are incompletely understood Case Summary We here report that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) increased in a confirmed COVID patient The high level of ESR sustained for a long time even after the patient recovered from COVID-19, while all results related to tumor, tuberculosis, rheumatic diseases, anemia, etc cannot explain the abnormal elevation of ESR presented in this case Conclusion Although the increased ESR cannot be explained by all existing evidence, it possibly links the abnormal pathologic change in some COVID-19 patients and negative prognosis, and provides the clue to dissect the mechanism of illness progressing in COVID-19 and its prognosis","output":"Unexplained Elevation of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate in a Patient Recovering From COVID-19: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thirty years after German reunification - and under distress due to the acute coronavirus crisis - the seventh New Paradigm Workshop of the Forum New Economy took place in Berlin on 28-30 September Renowned German and international experts discussed the \\"Future of the German Economic Model\\" How well is Germany prepared for the coming challenges?

The aim of this study was to review our experience with spinal hemangioblastomas in order to assess potential predictors of neurological outcome after surgery. All cases of spinal hemangioblastomas removed at two Italian academic institutions from 1985 to 2020 were reviewed. Data about clinical presentation and symptom duration, diagnosis of VHL, surgical approach, use of IONM, duration of hospital stay, follow-up, and modified McCormick grade before and after surgery were extracted. Sixty-one patients (31 F, 30 M) underwent 69 surgeries to remove 74 spinal hemangioblastomas (37 cervical, 32 thoracic, 5 lumbar). Improvement was found in 32.3% of cases, neurological condition remained stable in 51.6% of cases, and deteriorated in 16.1% of patients. A worsening trend in VHL patients and an improvement trend in non-VHL patients were detected, despite the lack of statistical significance. Laminotomy and use of IONM were found to be associated with better outcome, although no association was found between surgery without IONM and worse outcome. In most cases, patients affected by spinal hemangioblastomas can expect a good long-term outcome. In our experience, laminotomy seems to be associated with better outcome compared to laminectomy. While its absence is not associated with worse outcome, IONM seems to be associated with a better neurological outcome. Our study suggests that the more impaired the preoperative neurological condition, the worse the outcome.","output":"Spinal hemangioblastomas: analysis of surgical outcome and prognostic factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Standard surgical practice of paediatric soft tissue facial injuries requires general anaesthetic (GA) if treatment with local anaesthetic is not tolerated. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has increased the risk of hospital admission for GA to patients and pre-operative Covid-19 testing can delay surgical treatment. In response, a service was established to facilitate short surgical procedures by the Oral and Maxillofacial surgical (OMFS) team with ketamine sedation (KS) at a tertiary level paediatric emergency department. Evaluation of this service demonstrates that KS is a suitable alternative to GA with reduced waiting times, low complications and equivalent surgical outcomes. METHOD: 20 patients treated under KS from May- September 2020 were identified and compared to a control group of 20 patients treated under GA during the same time period. Data including patient demographics, surgical treatment and the KS/GA procedure was collected from the medical records and was analysed using Microsoft excel. RESULTS: The KS patients had shorter waits for treatment with 85% of patients waiting 1 day or less, compared with 55% for the GA group. Using the local KS protocol 1 or 2 doses of ketamine was sufficient in 79% of cases and adverse effects were minimal with 21% of KS patients suffering mild nausea and vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: KS is an acceptable alternative to GA for the management of paediatric soft tissue injuries. KS reduces inpatient admission for GA which is of increased importance during the Covid-19 pandemic. Other OMFS units would benefit from access to a similar service.","output":"782 Evaluation of Ketamine Sedation as An Alternative to General Anaesthetic for The Management of Paediatric Soft Tissue Facial Injuries During the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY","output":"Recommendations for radiotherapy during the novel coronavirus pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The increasing interest for (the topic of) digital transformation - fueled by the synergies between technological developments (in terms of business-related applications of digital technologies) and businesses' search for (new determinants of digital technology-based) competitive advantage, while accelerated by the covid-19 pandemic - is an undeniable reality of nowadays (which is here to stay).

They were often under immense pressure to care for severely ill patients with a new disease, under strict hygiene conditions and with lockdown measures creating practical barriers to working. This study aims to explore the range of mental health, financial and other practical support measures that 36 countries in Europe and Canada have put in place to support health workers and enable them to do their job. METHODS: We use data extracted from the COVID-19 Health Systems Response Monitor (HSRM). We only consider initiatives implemented outside of clinical settings where COVID-19 patients are treated, and therefore exclude workplace provisions such as availability of personal protective equipment, working time limits or mandatory rest periods. RESULTS: We show that countries have implemented a range of measures, ranging from mental health and well-being support initiatives, to providing bonuses and temporary salary increases. Practical measures such as childcare provision and free transport and accommodation have also been implemented to ensure health workers can get to their workplace and have their children looked after. Other initiatives such as offering continuing professional development credits for knowledge learnt during the crisis were also offered in some countries, albeit less frequently. CONCLUSIONS: While a large number of initiatives have been introduced, often as ad-hoc measures, their effectiveness in helping staff is unknown in most countries. The effectiveness of these initiatives should be evaluated to inform future crisis responses and strategies for health workforce development.","output":"How are countries supporting health workers?

The current review provided the detailed antiviral, immunomodulatory effect, unique pharmacokinetic profile of two antibiotics namely azithromycin (AZ) and doxycycline (DOX). It summarizes current clinical trials and concerns regarding the safety issues of these drugs. Azithromycin (AZ) has amazing lung tissue access, wide range antibacterial efficacy, conceivable antiviral action against COVID-19. It also showed efficacy when combined with other antiviral drugs in limited clinical trials, but many clinicians raise concerns regarding cardiovascular risk in susceptible patients. DOX has a considerable role in the management of pneumonia, it has some advantages including cardiac safety, very good access to lung tissue, potential antiviral, and immunomodulation impact by several mechanisms.

The students evaluated their experience with the PAL\\\\based exam through a questionnaire which consisted of five given statements (answer possibilities: agree, disagree, neutral) and two questions (answer possibilities: better, equal, worse) to rate. RESULTS: In the survey, 77.9% of the students rated PAL as a better learning method and 21% rated it as at least equally effective to the known multiple\\\\choice (MC) test. A total of 74.9% of the students indicated that they learned more content with PAL and 20.2% said they learned the same amount; 83.7% said that their clinical thinking has improved through PAL.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early CP therapy in COVID-19 progression. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study was an open-label, single-center randomized clinical trial performed in an academic medical center in Santiago, Chile, from May 10, 2020, to July 18, 2020, with final follow-up until August 17, 2020. The trial included patients hospitalized within the first 7 days of COVID-19 symptom onset, presenting risk factors for illness progression and not on mechanical ventilation. The intervention consisted of immediate CP (early plasma group) versus no CP unless developing prespecified criteria of deterioration (deferred plasma group). Additional standard treatment was allowed in both arms. The primary outcome was a composite of mechanical ventilation, hospitalization for >14 days, or death. The key secondary outcomes included time to respiratory failure, days of mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, mortality at 30 days, and SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR clearance rate. Of 58 randomized patients (mean age, 65.8 years; 50% male), 57 (98.3%) completed the trial. A total of 13 (43.3%) participants from the deferred group received plasma based on clinical aggravation. We failed to find benefit in the primary outcome (32.1% versus 33.3%, odds ratio [OR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.32C2.84, p > 0.999) in the early versus deferred CP group. The in-hospital mortality rate was 17.9% versus 6.7% (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.54C17.17 p = 0.246), mechanical ventilation 17.9% versus 6.7% (OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.54C17.17, p = 0.246), and prolonged hospitalization 21.4% versus 30.0% (OR 0.64, 95% CI, 0.19C2.10, p = 0.554) in the early versus deferred CP group, respectively. The viral clearance rate on day 3 (26% versus 8%, p = 0.204) and day 7 (38% versus 19%, p = 0.374) did not differ between groups. Two patients experienced serious adverse events within 6 hours after plasma transfusion. The main limitation of this study is the lack of statistical power to detect a smaller but clinically relevant therapeutic effect of CP, as well as not having confirmed neutralizing antibodies in donor before plasma infusion. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we failed to find evidence of benefit in mortality, length of hospitalization, or mechanical ventilation requirement by immediate addition of CP therapy in the early stages of COVID-19 compared to its use only in case of patient deterioration.

We conducted a nationwide, multicentre cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire on a cohort of RT-PCR-confirmed adult COVID-19 patients in Malaysia between 6 June and 30 November 2020. The aim of our study was to investigate their presenting symptoms and assess their chemosensory function using self-ratings of perceived smell, taste, chemesthesis, and nasal blockage. In this cohort of 498 patients, 41.4% reported smell and/or taste loss when diagnosed with COVID-19, which was the commonest symptom. Blocked nose, loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal disturbances were independent predictors of smell and/or taste loss on multivariate analysis. Self-ratings of chemosensory function revealed a reduction in smell, taste, and chemesthesis across the entire cohort of patients that was more profound among those reporting smell and/or taste loss as their presenting symptom. Perceived nasal obstruction accounted for only a small proportion of changes in smell and taste, but not for chemesthesis, supporting viral disruption of sensorineural mechanisms as the dominant aetiology of chemosensory dysfunction. Our study suggests that chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19 is more widespread than previously reported among Asians and may be related to the infectivity of viral strains.

DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical study. SETTING: Inpatients unit of a COVID-19 specialized hospital. POPULATION: Forty-two patients with moderate COVID-19 were randomly allocated at a 2:1 ratio to two groups: the SWD group and the control group. METHODS: Participants of the SWD group received SWD treatment, and participants of the control group received placebo SWD treatment for one session per day, 10 minutes per session, for no more than 14 days. Both groups were given standard care treatment. Primary outcome was the rate of clinical improvement according to a sevencategory ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included the rate of computed tomography (CT) improvement and the rate of potential adverse events. RESULTS: Clinical improvement occurred in 92.6% of patients in the SWD group by day 14 compared with 69.2% of patients in the control group (P = 0.001). The Cox model indicated that the SWD group had a higher clinical improvement probability than the control group (Hazard Ratio, 3.045; 95% CI, 1.391-6.666; P = 0.005). Similarly, CT improvement occurred in 85.2 % of patients in the SWD group and 46.2 % of patients in the control group respectively by day 14 (P = 0.001). The Cox model indicated SWD group had a higher CT improvement probability than control group (Hazard Ratio, 3.720; 95% CI, 1.486-9.311; P = 0.005).

A thorough analysis of time-series forecasting models is therefore required to equip state authorities and health officials with immediate strategies for future times. This aims of the study are three-fold: (a) To model the overall trend of the spread;(b) To generate a short-term forecast of 10 days in countries with the highest incidence of confirmed cases (USA, India and Brazil);(c) To quantitatively determine the algorithm that is best suited for precise modelling of the linear and non-linear features of the time series. The comparison of forecasting models for the total cumulative cases of each country is carried out by comparing the reported data and the predicted value, and then ranking the algorithms (Prophet, Holt-Winters, LSTM, ARIMA, and ARIMA-NARNN) based on their RMSE, MAE and MAPE values. The hybrid combination of ARIMA and NARNN (Nonlinear Auto-Regression Neural Network) gave the best result among the selected models with a reduced RMSE, which proved to be almost 35.3% better than one of the most prevalent method of time-series prediction (ARIMA).

In the case of enveloped viruses, this activity was assigned to the formation of a polyelectrolyte complex between an anionic species, the polyanion, and the spike cationic proteins which are, for polymer chemists, comparable to cationic polyelectrolytes. Unfortunately, in vitro antiviral activity was not confirmed in vivo, possibly because polyanions were captured by cationic blood elements before reaching target cells. Accordingly, virologists abandoned the use of polyanions for antiviral therapy. In the case of coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants the game may not be over because these viruses infect cells of airways and not of blood. This communication proposes strategies to use polysulfates to attack and inhibit viral particles before they reach target cells in the airways. For this, polysulfate solutions may be administered by spray, gargling and nebulization or used to capture virus-containing droplets and aerosols by bubbling when these vectors are in the atmosphere. The technical means exist. However, biocompatibility and biofunctionality tests are necessary in the case of airways. Such tests require manipulation of pathogens, something which is beyond the competences of a biomaterialist. For this, a specialist in virology is necessary. Attempts to find one failed so far despite all-around solicitations over the past ten months and despite the fact that attacking the virus with polysulfates may complement beneficially the defensive strategies based on masks, vaccines and hospitals.","output":"The non-specific antiviral activity of polysulfates to fight SARS-CoV-2, its mutants and viruses with cationic spikes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the most remarkable results in 2019 is the reduced prevalence and death of children from coronavirus infection (COVID\\\\19).

He has no history of previous cardiovascular or respiratory disease, no history of thromboembolism (PTE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). ECG showed atrial fibrillation with HR 120 bpm and incomplete RBBB. Blood pressure was 85/45mmHg with cold periphery. Patient denied any provocable PE risk factors. Bed site POCUS (Point-of-Care Ultrasound) echocardiography was performed immediately in order to evaluate the cause of patient symptoms and hemodynamic instability. Examination showed increased right ventricle (RV) size, reduced RV function (TAPSE 13, TDI S 9), presence of McConnells sign, severe tricuspid regurgitation with dilated v. cava and signs of pulmonary hypertension. Due to hemodynamic instability and indirect signs of the presence pf pulmonary embolism fibrinolysis with alteplase infusion was applied. Patient hemodynamically stabilized after first hour. Nasopharyngeal smear for SARV CoV-2 was taken due to ongoing pandemic and result come out positive for virus RNK (real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction-PCR). CT angiography was performed which showed large intraluminal thrombi in the right pulmonary artery, extending to left pulmonary artery up to subsegmental level. His D-dimer values were 7813 ng/ml, CRP 123 mg/L. Evaluated sPESI score was 2, which indicated elevated 30-day death risk. Patient remained clinically stable. He was transferred to the infectious disease clinic for further treatment. After two weeks was discharged with recommendations for three months anticoagulation treatment with Rivaroxaban. Patient performed control visit at our clinic after four months. He was stable, asymptomatic with normal right ventricular function. Conclusion: This is case of successful treatment of pulmonary embolism complicated with cardiogenic shock as a first manifestation of COVID-19 infection at our clinic since the start of pandemic. POCUS echocardiography is fast noninvasive method that help us urgently assess the cause of patient instability and guide diagnostic approach and patient management.

RECENT FINDINGS: The syndrome consists of five inter-correlated elements: (a) fear of SARSCoV2 infection and fear of coming into contact with objects or surfaces contaminated with the coronavirus; (b) fear of socio-economic impacts of the pandemic; (c) fear of foreigners for fear that they are infected; (d) pandemic-related compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking; and (e) pandemic-related traumatic stress symptoms. A severe form of the syndrome, characterized by clinically significant distress and impairment in functioning, is the COVID Stress Disorder, which is regarded as a pandemic-related adjustment disorder. Several treatment options exist but further research is needed. SUMMARY: Research during the COVID-19 pandemic has identified a pandemic-related adjustment disorder. The diagnosis of COVID Stress Syndrome should be made only after ruling out other disorders that could potentially account for the pattern of symptoms, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Further studies are needed to investigate the long-term course of the syndrome. Similar adjustment disorders may arise in future pandemics.

A total of 17 non-AKI patients with severe and critical COVID-19 treated between February 14 and March 26, 2020 were included and randomly divided into intervention group and control group according to the random number table. Patients in the intervention group immediately received CRRT with oXiris filter plus conventional treatment, while those in the control group only received conventional treatment. Demographic data were collected and collated at admission. During ICU hospitalization, the concentrations of circulating cytokines and inflammatory chemokines, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, and IFN-, were quantitatively measured daily to reflect the degree of CRS induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical data, including the severity of COVID-19 white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil proportion (NEUT%), lymphocyte count (LYMPH), lymphocyte percentage (LYM%), platelet (PLT), C-reaction protein (CRP), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TB), albumin (ALB), serum creatinine (SCr), D-Dimer, fibrinogen (FIB), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, IFN-, number of hospital days and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were obtained and collated from medical records, and then compared between the two groups. Age, and SCr significantly differed between the two groups. Besides the IL-2 concentration that was significantly lower on day 2 than that on day 1 in the intervention group, and the IL-6 concentrations that were significantly higher on day 1, and day 2 in the intervention group compared to the control group, similar to the IL-10 concentration on day 5, there were no significant differences between the two groups. To sum up, CRRT with oXiris filter may not effectively alleviate CRS in non-AKI patients with severe and critical COVID-19. Thus, its application in these patients should be considered with caution to avoid increasing the unnecessary burden on society and individuals and making the already overwhelmed medical system even more strained (IRB number: IRB-AF/SC-04).","output":"Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy With oXiris Filter May Not be an Effective Resolution to Alleviate Cytokine Release Syndrome in Non-AKI Patients With Severe and Critical COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease outbreak in 2019 (COVID-19) has now achieved the level of a global pandemic and affected more than 100 million people on all five continents and caused over 2 million deaths Russia is, needless to say, among the countries affected by SARS-CoV-2, and its health authorities have mobilized significant efforts and resources to fight the disease The paper presents the result of a functional analysis of 155 patients in the Moscow Region who were examined at the Central Clinical Hospital of the Russian Academy of Sciences during the first wave of the pandemic (February-July, 2020) The inclusion criteria were a positive PCR test and typical, computed tomographic findings of viral pneumonia in the form of ground-glass opacities A clinical correlation analysis was performed in four groups of patients: (1) those who were not on mechanical ventilation, (2) those who were on mechanical ventilation, and (3) those who subsequently recovered or (4) died The correlation analysis also considered confounding comorbidities (diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, etc ) The immunological status of the patients was examined (levels of immunoglobulins of the M, A, G classes and their subclasses, as well as the total immunoglobulin level) using an original SARS-CoV-2 antibody ELISA kit The ELISA kit was developed using linear S-protein RBD-SD1 and NTD fragments, as well as the N-protein, as antigens These antigens were produced in the prokaryotic E coli system Recombinant RBD produced in the eukaryotic CHO system (RBD CHO) was used as an antigen representing conformational RBD epitopes The immunoglobulin A level was found to be the earliest serological criterion for the development of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and it yielded the best sensitivity and diagnostic significance of ELISA compared to that of class M immunoglobulin We demonstrated that the seroconversion rate of \\"early\\" N-protein-specific IgM and IgA antibodies is comparable to that of antibodies specific to RBD conformational epitopes At the same time, seroconversion of SARS-CoV-2 N-protein-specific class G immunoglobulins was significantly faster compared to that of other specific antibodies Our findings suggest that the strong immunogenicity of the RBD fragment is for the most part associated with its conformational epitopes, while the linear RBD and NTD epitopes have the least immunogenicity An analysis of the occurrence rate of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins of different classes revealed that RBD- and N-specific antibodies should be evaluated in parallel to improve the sensitivity of ELISA An analysis of the immunoglobulin subclass distribution in sera of seropositive patients revealed uniform induction of N-protein-specific IgG subclasses G1-G4 and IgA subclasses A1-A2 in groups of patients with varying severity of COVID-19 In the case of the S-protein, G1, G3, and A1 were the main subclasses of antibodies involved in the immune response","output":"COVID-19 in Russia: Clinical and Immunological Features of the First-Wave Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the higher mortality rate and widespread phenomenon of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) within the United States (US) population, understanding the mutational pattern of SARS CoV-2 has global implications for detection and therapy to prevent further escalation.

In this population, the highest frequency variants were in known mutations in the 5'UTR, AA193 protein, RdRp and the spike glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the local community was tracked by integrating mutation data with patient postal codes with two predominant community spread clusters being identified. Notably, significant viral genomic diversity was identified. Less than 10 percent of the Los Angeles community samples resembled published mutational profiles of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from China, while >50 percent of the isolates shared closely similarities to those from New York State. Based on these findings we conclude SARS-CoV-2 was likely introduced into the Los Angeles community predominantly from New York State but also via multiple other independent transmission routes including but not limited to Washington State and China.","output":"Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Genomes from Southern California Reveals Community Transmission Pathways in the Early Stage of the US COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pada masa pandemi COVID-19 ini Di Kantor Balai Desa Kubangsari semua staf dapat diandalkan dari tangan ke tangan dalam melaksanakan pelayanan kepada masyarakat dan kebutuhan administrasi.

It is not known whether this vulnerability is specific to anatomically-modern humans or shared with other hominids. The contribution of introgressed Neanderthal DNA to neurodegenerative disorders remains uncertain. It is also unclear how common variants associated with neurodegenerative disease risk are maintained by natural selection in the population despite their deleterious effects. In this study, we aimed to quantify the genome-wide contribution of Neanderthal introgression and positive selection to the heritability of complex neurodegenerative disorders to address these questions. Methods We used stratified-linkage disequilibrium score regression to investigate the relationship between five SNP-based signatures of natural selection, reflecting different timepoints of evolution, and genome-wide associated variants of the three most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Results We found a significant depletion of positively-selected SNPs in the heritability of Parkinsons disease, raising the possibility that these variants may modulate disease risk, in addition to conferring an evolutionary advantage. For Alzheimers disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, common deleterious disease variants are unlikely to be maintained by positive selection. There was no enrichment of Neanderthal introgression in the SNP-heritability of these disorders, suggesting that Neanderthal admixture is unlikely to have contributed to disease risk. Conclusions These findings provide insight into the origins of neurodegenerative disorders within the evolution of Homo sapiens and addresses a long-standing debate, showing that Neanderthal admixture is unlikely to have contributed to common genetic risk of neurodegeneration in anatomically-modern humans.","output":"The contribution of Neanderthal introgression and natural selection to neurodegenerative diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced hospitals to prioritize admissions.

During the placement, NQNs were supposed to be supervised and supported by professional nurses. On the contrary, professional nurses expected NQNs to be hands-on and provide quality care on completion of their training. Expectations of professional nurses created misperceptions regarding the objectives of community service. Therefore, exploring their experience would identify skills gap that is needed to be addressed. OBJECTIVES: This study explored and described the experiences of professional nurses working with NQNs placed for community service in the City of Tshwane. METHOD: A qualitative exploratory design was conducted. Individual interviews were carried out with 22 professional nurses in various public healthcare settings, such as a hospital, a community health centre and a clinic. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants and confidentiality and anonymity were maintained throughout the interviews. Creswells data analysis process was implemented. RESULTS: Two themes emerged from this study, namely, experience of participants with NQNs and professional nurses. Participants experienced NQNs as not being competent to work independently and had to deal with unprofessional behaviour of NQNs. Participants supported NQNs, even though they were not empowered as mentors to NQNs. CONCLUSION: Participants were disappointed that NQNs were not competent and confident to work independently. They expressed their frustrations in behaviours displayed by NQNs.

Here we aimed to examine the associations between IFG and diabetes at admission with risks of complications and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 312 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from 5 hospitals in Wuhan from Jan 1 to Mar 17, 2020. Clinical information, laboratory findings, complications, treatment regimens, and mortality status were collected. The associations between hyperglycemia and diabetes status at admission with primary composite end-point events (including mechanical ventilation, admission to intensive care unit, or death) were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: The median age of the patients was 57 years (interquartile range 38C66), and 172 (55%) were women. At the time of hospital admission, 84 (27%) had diabetes (and 36 were new-diagnosed), 62 (20%) had IFG, and 166 (53%) had normal fasting glucose (NFG) levels. Compared to patients with NFG, patients with IFG and diabetes developed more primary composite end-point events (9 [5%], 11 [18%], 26 [31%]), including receiving mechanical ventilation (5 [3%], 6 [10%], 21 [25%]), and death (4 [2%], 9 [15%], 20 [24%]). Multivariable Cox regression analyses showed diabetes was associated increased risks of primary composite end-point events (hazard ratio 3.53; 95% confidence interval 1.48C8.40) and mortality (6.25; 1.91C20.45), and IFG was associated with an increased risk of mortality (4.11; 1.15C14.74), after adjusting for age, sex, hospitals and comorbidities.

This study investigated the phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the nodule-forming rhizobial bacteria recovered from Pisum sativum subsp., Cicer pinnatifidum, and Lens culinaris subsp. orientalis exhibiting natural distribution in the Gaziantep province of Turkey. PCA analyses of rhizobial isolates, which were tested to be highly resistant to stress conditions, showed that especially pH and salt concentrations had an important effect on these bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA determined that these wild species were nodulated by at least 7 groups including Rhizobium and non-Rhizobium. The largest group comprised of Rhizobium leguminosarum and Rhizobium sp. while R. pusense, which was previously determined as non-symbiotic species, was found to nodulate C. pinnatifidum and L. culinaris subsp. orientalis. In recent studies, Klebsiella sp., which is stated to be able to nodulate different species, strong evidences have been obtained in present study exhibiting that Klebsiella sp. can nodulate C. pinnatifidum and Pseudomonas sp. was able to nodulate C. pinnatifidum and P. sativum subsp. Additionally, L. culinaris subsp. orientalis unlike other plant species, was nodulated by Burkholderia sp. and Serratia sp. associated isolates. Some isolates could not be characterized at the species level since the 16S rRNA sequence similarity rate was low and the fact that they were in a separate group supported with high bootstrap values in the phylogenetic tree may indicate that these isolates could be new species.

The effect of ECMO for patients with severe ARDS in the context of COVID-19 is unclear. This study is to summarize the clinical features, and outcomes of patients with severe ARDS due to COVID-19 treated with ECMO. We analyzed the incidence of morbidity including ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, pump malfunction, oxygenator dysfunction, infection during VV ECMO. We also compared COVID ECMO patients to non COVID-19 ECMO patients. Methods This is a retrospective review of an institutional ECMO database. We included consecutive patients from January 2015 through July 2020. 138 patients (mean age, 47.0  14.4 y) with respiratory failure who underwent VV ECMO implantation were included in this study. Patients were stratified into two cohorts: those with COVID-19 or non COVID-19.

Little is known about laboratory prognostic markers in COVID-19 patients. The aim of our study was to describe the basic clotting parameters in COVID-19 patients and their prognostic role in different clinical forms of the disease. Material and Methods: We enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Emergency Department. A cohort of 67 age-and sex-matched non-COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory illness was used as a control group. For all patients, platelet count (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), C-reactive protein (PCR), fibrinogen, and D-dimer were determined. The COVID-19 population was divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of SARS. The clotting factors values were compared between the groups. Results: At admission, the COVID-19 patients showed statistically significant increased levels of fibrinogen (601.5 (480C747) vs. 455 (352.5C588.5) mg/dL; p = 0.0000064), and a higher percentage of patients had fibrinogen levels &gt;400 mg/dL (86% vs.58%; p = 0.0054) compared to the control group.

Conclusion: Fibrinogen seems to increase early in COVID-19 patients and may be used as a risk stratification marker for the early detection of a subgroup of COVID-19 patient at increased risk to develop SARS, who might benefit from a different and thorough clinical surveillance and treatment.","output":"Clotting factors in COVID-19: Epidemiological association and prognostic values in different clinical presentations in an Italian cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced medical schools to create educational material to palliate the anticipated and observed decrease in clinical experiences during clerkships. An online learning by concordance (LbC) tool was developed to overcome the limitation of students experiences with clinical cases. However, knowledge about the instructional design of an LbC tool is scarce, especially the perspectives of collaborators involved in its design: 1- educators who wrote the vignettes questions and 2- practitioners who constitute the reference panel by answering the LbC questions. The aim of this study was to describe the key elements that supported the pedagogical design of an LbC tool from the perspectives of educators and practitioners. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative research design has been used. Online questionnaires were used, and descriptive analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Six educators and 19 practitioners participated in the study. Important to the educators in designing the LbC tool were prevalent or high-stake situations, theoretical knowledge, professional situations experienced and perceived difficulties among students, and that the previous workshop promoted peer discussion and helped solidify the writing process. Important for practitioners was standards of practice and consensus among experts. However, they were uncertain of the educational value of their feedback, considering the ambiguity of the situations included in the LbC tool.

Our test was compared with three commercial methods, and was used to determine COVID-19 seroprevalence among healthcare workers and outpatients in Minnesota. Methods Seventy-nine plasma and serum samples from 50 patients 4 - 69 days after symptom onset who tested positive by a SARS-CoV-2 PCR method using a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab were used to evaluate our tests clinical performance. Seropositive samples were analyzed for IgG titers in a follow-up assay. Thirty plasma and serum from 12 patients who tested negative by a SARS-CoV-2 PCR method using a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and 210 negative pre-pandemic serum samples were also analyzed. Among samples from patients >14 days after symptom onset, the assay had 100% clinical sensitivity and 100% clinical specificity, 100% positive predictive value and 100% negative predictive value. Analytical specificity was 99.8%, indicating minimal cross-reactivity. A screening study was conducted to ascertain COVID-19 seroprevalence among healthcare workers and outpatients in Minnesota. Results Analysis of serum collected between April 13 and May 21, 2020 indicated a COVID-19 seroprevalence of 2.96% among 1,282 healthcare workers and 4.46% among 2,379 outpatients.

We have designed an experimental treatment called IDEA based on four affordable drugs already available on the market in Argentina, based on the following rationale: -Ivermectin solution at a relatively high dose to lower the viral load in all stages of COVID 19 -Dexamethasone 4-mg injection, as anti-inflammatory drug to treat hyperinflammatory reaction to COVID-infection -Enoxaparin injection as anticoagulant to treat hypercoagulation in severe cases. -Aspirin 250-mg tablets to prevent hypercoagulation in mild and moderate cases Except for Ivermection oral solution, which was used in a higher dose than approved for parasitosis, all other drugs were used in the already approved dose and indication. Regarding Ivermectin safety, several oral studies have shown it to be safe even when used at daily doses much higher than those approved already. A clinical study has been conducted on COVID-19 patients at Eurnekian Hospital in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The study protocol and its final outcomes are described in this article. Results were compared with published data and data from patients admitted to the hospital receiving other treatments. None of the patient presenting mild symptoms needed to be hospitalized.

METHODS: With the help of this Web GIS, data on this issue were collected voluntarily from the Cologne area. Using house perimeters as a data basis, it was possible to check, in conjunction with the Official Topographic Cartographic Information System object type catalog, whether buildings with certain functions, for example residential building with trade and services, have been visited more frequently by infected persons than other types of buildings. In this context, data protection and ethical and legal issues were considered.

With the great reduction in human mobility and daily activities, considerable impacts have been imposed on the global air transportation industry. This study applies a hybrid SARIMA-based intervention model to measure the differences in the impacts of different control measures implemented in China, the U.S. and Singapore on air passenger and air freight traffic. To explore the effect of time span for the measures to be in force, two scenarios are invented, namely a long-term intervention and a short-term intervention, and predictions are made till the end of 2020 for all three countries under both scenarios. As a result, predictive patterns of the selected metrics for the three countries are rather different. China is predicted to have the mildest economic impact on the air transportation industry in this year in terms of air passenger revenue and air cargo traffic, provided that the control measures were prompt and effective. The U.S. would suffer from a far-reaching impact on the industry if the same control measures are maintained. More uncertainties are found for Singapore, as it is strongly associated with international travel demands. Suggestions are made for the three countries and the rest of the world on how to seek a balance between the strictness of control measures and the potential long-term industrial losses.","output":"Impact of different control policies for COVID-19 outbreak on the air transportation industry: A comparison between China, the U.S. and Singapore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Paediatric palliative care makes frequent use of orodispersible and transmucosal drug delivery routes. The limited published experience of this practice suggests that it enables the delivery of needle-free symptom relief, with the potential to train family carers to administer anticipatory medications without reliance on trained health professionals. AIMS: To identify orodispersible and potential transmucosal alternatives that may be used in adults in the event of a patient having no oral or intravenous route and no access to subcutaneous injections. METHODS: The author panel identified medications through review of multiple drug formularies, review of the published evidence and their experience. Where possible, licensed alternatives were identified and any 'off label' or unlicensed medications clearly highlighted. RESULTS: A list of 27 medications is provided, which could be used either via the orodispersible or transmucosal alternative route for healthcare professionals delivering end of life care to consider when the licensed alternative routes are unavailable. All users of this guide are encouraged to use their professional judgement whenever selecting a medication for a patient, recognising that this review is neither a guideline nor a systematic review, and taking account of licensing considerations, adverse effects, potential unpredictability of time to effect and contraindications. CONCLUSION: Should it be necessary to use these orodispersible or transmucosal alternatives then any experience gained should be reported in the literature. Combined with further research, this experience offers the possibility of reducing injection frequency and inherent delays in medication administration, particularly in the community setting during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Orodispersible and transmucosal alternative medications for symptom control in adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection was a leading cause of death in 2020 worldwide.

Several potential pathogens such as astroviruses, caliciviruses, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus delphini have been studied, but the etiology of the syndrome seems complex. In pooled samples from 38 diarrheic and 42 non-diarrheic litters, each comprising of intestinal contents from 2C3 mink kits from the same litter, the bacterial populations were studied using Illumina Next Generation Sequencing technology and targeted 16S amplicon sequencing. In addition, we used deep sequencing to determine and compare the viral intestinal content in 31 healthy non-diarrheic and 30 diarrheic pooled samples (2C3 mink kits from the same litter per pool). The results showed high variations in composition of the bacterial species between the pools. Enterococci, staphylococci and streptococci dominated in both diarrheic and non-diarrheic pools. However, enterococci accounted for 70% of the reads in the diarrheic group compared to 50% in the non-diarrheic group and this increase was at the expense of staphylococci and streptococci which together accounted for 45% and 17% of the reads in the non-diarrheic and diarrheic group, respectively. Moreover, in the diarrheic pools there were more reads assigned to Clostridia, Escherichia-Shigella and Enterobacter compared to the non-diarrheic pools. The taxonomically categorized sequences from the virome showed that the most prevalent viruses in all pools were caliciviruses and mamastroviruses (almost exclusively type 10). However, the numbers of reads assigned to caliciviruses were almost 3 times higher in the diarrheic pools compared the non-diarrheic pools and Sapporo-like caliciviruses were more abundant than the Norwalk-like caliciviruses.

The aim of our study was to investigate the vancomycin removal during hemoperfusion (HP) using HA380 cartridge. METHODS This is an experimental study, in which 500 mL of solution was circulated in a closed-circuit (blood flow of 250 mL/min) simulating HP ran using HA380. Vancomycin was added to reach a through concentration or a very high concentration to evaluate the removal ratio (RR) during 120 min of HP. Comparison between blood-crystalloid solution and balanced solution was performed by using Kruskal-Wallis test. The kinetics of vancomycin removal and the adsorption isotherm were evaluated. RESULTS We found a complete removal of vancomycin at baseline through concentration of 23.0  7.4 mg/L. Using extremely high concentration (baseline 777.0  62.2 mg/L), RR was 90.1  0.6% at 5 min and 99.2  0.6% at 120 min. No difference in terms of RR was found between blood-crystalloid mixture and balanced solution. The kinetics of the vancomycin reduction followed an exponential decay. Repeated boluses (total amount of 2,000 mg) resulted in cumulative adsorption of 1,919.4 mg with RR of 96.6  1.4%, regardless of the amount injected (100 vs. 500 mg).

The aim of this study was to describe the demographics of vaccinated COVID-19 cases and compare the mortality rates of COVID-19 cases who were infected post-vaccination in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. We retrieved data for COVID-19 cases who were infected pre- or post-vaccination and had received at least one injection of the OxfordCAstraZeneca or PfizerCBioNTech vaccine from 4 December 2020 to 15 October 2021. Results: The number of patients who were infected and had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine was 281,744. Approximately 45% of subjects were infected post-vaccination, and 75% of subjects had received the PfizerCBioNTech vaccine. Only 0.342% of the patients who were infected post-vaccination died, and 447 patients were admitted to ICUs. Most of the patients who were infected with COVID-19 post-vaccination and were admitted to ICUs (69.84%) had received only one dose of the vaccine (p < 0.0001). The mean time to infection for patients who had received one and two doses of the OxfordCAstraZeneca vaccine were 27 and 8 days longer than their counterparts who had received one and two doses of PfizerCBioNTech vaccine, respectively. No difference in the odds of mortality between the PfizerCBioNTech and OxfordCAstraZeneca vaccines was found (OR = 1.121, 95% CI = [0.907C1.386], p-value = 0.291). Patients who had received two doses of the vaccine had significantly lower odds of mortality compared to those who had received one dose (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Vaccines are vital in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study show no difference between the PfizerCBioNTech and OxfordCAstraZeneca vaccines in the rate of mortality. However, the number of vaccine doses was significantly associated with a lower risk of mortality.

Observations Follicular conjunctivitis has been reported as an early sign of infection or during hospitalization for severe COVID-19 disease. It has been confirmed that COVID-19 is transmitted through both respiratory droplets and direct contact. Another possible route of viral transmission is entry through aerosolized droplets into the tears, which then pass through the nasolacrimal ducts and into the respiratory tract. For nonemergent care, eye care providers should use telehealth. Eye care providers should prioritize patient care in order of absolute necessity, such as sudden vision loss, sudden onset flashes and floaters, and eye trauma. In those cases, exposure should be minimized. The close proximity between eye care providers and their patients during slit-lamp examination may require further precautions, such as shields, barriers, and mask use to lower the risk of transmission via droplets or through hand to eye contact. Conclusions All nonemergent eye care appointments should be delayed or conducted remotely. For emergent in-person appointments, careful and appropriate adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations may minimize exposure for both the health care provider and patient.","output":"Urgent and Emergent Eye Care Strategies to Protect Against COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Patients with rheumatologic diseases might be more susceptible to COVID-19 and carry a poorer prognosis. The aim of this study is to examine the incidence and outcomes of all COVID-19 patients with rheumatologic conditions in Hong Kong. METHODS: This is a population-based retrospective study. All patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR with a previous diagnosis of rheumatologic diseases were reviewed. The incidence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatologic conditions was calculated and compared to the general population in Hong Kong. Descriptive data of those rheumatologic patients with COVID-19 and the clinical course of the index infection were presented. RESULTS: Up till 27 May 2020, there were 1067 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Hong Kong which had a population of 7.5 million. Out of the 39,835 patients with underlying rheumatologic diseases, we identified 5 PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases. The estimated incidence of COVID-19 was 0.0126% patients with rheumatologic diseases, compared to 0.0142% in the general population. All 5 patients had inflammatory arthropathies. One patient was on hydroxychloroquine and sulphasalazine, and one was on methotrexate. None of the 3534 patients on b/tsDMARDs was infected. Four patients had leucopenia/lymphopenia and stool viral PCR was positive in 3 patients. All patients made uneventful recovery without complications or flare of underlying diseases. CONCLUSIONS: We found no alarming signals of increased frequency or severity of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatologic diseases, although extrapolation of the results to other populations with different infection control strategies should be made with caution.","output":"Incidence and clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatologic diseases: A population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is an important cause of hair loss in adult women and has a major impact on patient's quality of life. It evolves from the progressive miniaturization of follicles that leads to a subsequent decrease of hair density, leading to non-scarring diffuse alopecia, with characteristic clinical, dermoscopic, and histological patterns. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed in follicular keratinocytes and dermal papilla cells and is shown to have important role in hair growth and regulation of hair cycle. VDR polymorphism was not extensively investigated in hair disorders including FPHL. Aim To investigate the association between VDR gene polymorphism (Cdx-1 and Taq-1) and FPHL to explore if these polymorphisms affect the disease occurrence or influence its clinical presentation. Methods A case-control study was conducted on 30 female patients with FPHL and 30 age-matched female healthy subjects, as a control group. Degree of hair loss was assessed by Ludwig grading. VDR gene polymorphisms, Taq-1 and Cdx-1 were investigated by real time polymerase chain reaction. Results CC genotype, TC genotype, and T allele of Taq-1 were more prevalent in FPHL patients than in control group. They increased disease risk by 12.6, 2.1, and 2.9 folds, respectively. AA genotype, GA genotype, and G allele of Cdx-1 were significantly more prevalent among FPHL patients than in control group. They increased disease risk by 7.5, 5.2, and 5.5 folds, respectively. Conclusion Taq-1 and Cdx-1 can be considered as risk factors for FPHL. They may play role in disease persistence rather than disease initiation. This association may be explained by failure of new anagen growth and decreased proliferation of hair follicle stem cells.

We aimed to describe outcomes with highflow oxygen delivered through nasal cannula (HFNC) and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in COVID-19 AHRF and identify individual factors associated with non-invasive respiratory support failure. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 within a large academic health system in New York City early in the pandemic to describe outcomes with HFNC and NIPPV. Patients were categorized into the HFNC cohort if they received HFNC but not NIPPV, whereas the NIPPV cohort included patients who received NIPPV with or without HFNC. We described rates of HFNC and NIPPV success, defined as live discharge without endotracheal intubation (ETI). Further, using Fine-Gray sub-distribution hazard models, we identified demographic and patient characteristics associated with HFNC and NIPPV failure, defined as the need for ETI and/or in-hospital mortality. RESULTS Of the 331 patients in the HFNC cohort, 154 (46.5%) patients were successfully discharged without requiring ETI. Of the 177 (53.5%) who experienced HFNC failure, 100 (56.5%) required ETI and 135 (76.3%) patients ultimately died. Among the 747 patients in the NIPPV cohort, 167 (22.4%) patients were successfully discharged without requiring ETI, and 8 (1.1%) were censored. Of the 572 (76.6%) patients who failed NIPPV, 338 (59.1%) required ETI and 497 (86.9%) ultimately died. In adjusted models, significantly increased risk of HFNC and NIPPV failure was observed among patients with co-morbid cardiovascular disease (sub-distribution hazard ratio (sHR) 1.82;95% confidence interval (CI), 1.17-2.83 and sHR 1.40;95% CI 1.06-1.84, respectively). Conversely, a higher oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (SpO2/FiO2) at HFNC and NIPPV initiation was associated with reduced risk of failure (sHR, 0.32;95% CI 0.19-0.54, and sHR 0.34;95% CI 0.21-0.55, respectively). CONCLUSIONS A subset of patients with COVID-19 AHRF was effectively managed with non-invasive respiratory modalities and achieved successful hospital discharge without requiring ETI. Notably, patients with co-morbid cardiovascular disease and more severe hypoxemia experienced lower success rates with both HFNC and NIPPV. Identification of specific patient factors may help inform more selective use of non-invasive respiratory strategies, and allow for a more personalized approach to the management of COVID-19 AHRF in pandemic settings.","output":"Cardiovascular disease and severe hypoxemia are associated with higher rates of non-invasive respiratory support failure in COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preparing adolescents for transitioning from school to work has become a priority across all developed countries due to the increasingly difficult labour market conditions and changes related to technological advances Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has created additional uncertainties in the world of work This article reviews the concept of career-related teacher support (CRTS) and illustrates the different roles that school teachers can have in influencing students' career planning and decision making The information should be beneficial to teachers, counsellors, researchers and policy-makers seeking to optimise school-based career guidance and counselling practices Brief suggestions are also provided for future research and practice (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Career-related teacher support: A review of roles that teachers play in supporting students' career planning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, exploring complex dynamic of epidemic models becomes a focal point for research after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic which has no vaccine or fully approved drug treatment up till now.

Moreover, certain ethnic groups have shown a higher predilection to contract COVID-19, with heightened mortality. We sought to review the available literature with regards to impact of COVID-19 and comorbidities on the health and economics, especially in context to the developing countries including India. METHODS: A Boolean search was carried out in PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar databases up till August 23, 2020 using the specific keywords, to find the prevalence of comorbidities and its outcome in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: All available evidence consistently suggests that presence of comorbidities is associated with a poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. Diabetes prevalence is highest in Indian COVID-19 patients, compared to other countries. Majority of the patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic ranging from 26 to 76%.

Advance care plans are intended to protect autonomy by helping patients receive goal-consistent healthcare. Accordingly, there is a need to better understand factors associated with hospital doctors application of advance care plans to treatment decisions of this patient cohort. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explain the recommendations of multidisciplinary hospital-based clinicians about the benefits of advance care plans for people diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders, and the elements that influence how doctors apply such plans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a constructivist grounded theory informed thematic analysis, semi-structured interviews were conducted with purposively and theoretical sampled hospital-based clinicians: 16 doctors, six registered nurses and 10 allied health clinicians who self-reported having experience delivering healthcare to people with neurodegenerative disorders and an advance care plan. Allied health and nurse data helped to inform questions posed to doctors. Data were inductively analysed using open and focused coding. RESULTS: Analysis revealed two main themes: recommending agency through advance care plans; and limiting agency through advance care plans. These themes formed the basis of the core category: patient agency. All clinicians held positive attitudes towards advance care plans as a means to preserve patient voices and alleviate family of responsibility. However, the extent to which doctors shared decisions with family revealed a tension between individualistic agency associated with advance care plans and relational autonomy perceived by doctors as appropriate. CONCLUSION: Although doctors expressed positive attitudes towards advance care plans, they typically practiced relational autonomy wherein they partner with family in contemporaneous healthcare decision on patients behalf.

However, their contributions to acute infection in the aged and their developmental pathways are unclear. We find that the response against influenza A virus infection in aged mice is dominated by a Fas+GL7- effector B cell population we call infection-induced-ABC (iABC). Most iABC express IgM and include antibody-secreting cells in the spleen, lung and bone marrow. We find that in response to influenza, IgD+CD21-CD23-ABC are the precursors of iABC. These IgD+ABC develop in germ free mice, so are independent of foreign antigen recognition, suggesting they arise from an intrinsic age-associated developmental program. The response of ABC to influenza infection, resulting in iABC, is T cell independent and requires both extrinsic TLR7 and TLR9 signals. In response to influenza infection, IgD+ABC can induce a faster recovery of weight and higher total anti-influenza IgG and IgM titers that can neutralize virus. Immunization with whole inactivated virus also generates iABC in aged mice. Thus, in unimmunized aged mice, whose other B and T cell responses have waned, IgD+ABC are likely the na?ve B cells with the potential to become Ab-secreting cells and to provide protection from infection in the aged.","output":"IgD+ Age-Associated B cells are the progenitors of the main T-independent B cell response to infection that generates protective Ab and can be induced by an inactivated vaccine in the aged"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent novel coronavirus, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has developed into an international pandemic affecting millions of individuals with hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide.

The pathophysiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-) leading to systemic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, acutely affecting the cardiovascular system. Hypertension (56.6%) and diabetes (33.8%) are the most prevalent comorbidities among individuals with COVID-19, who require hospitalization. Furthermore, cardiac injury, defined as elevated us-troponin I, significantly relates to inflammation biomarkers (IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), hyperferritinemia, and leukocytosis), portraying an important correlation between myocardial injury and inflammatory hyperactivity triggered by viral infection. Increased risk for myocardial infarction, fulminant myocarditis rapidly evolving with depressed systolic left ventricle function, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, and cardiomyopathies mimicking STEMI presentations are the most prevalent cardiovascular complications described in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 tropism and interaction with the RAAS system, through ACE2 receptor, possibly enhances inflammation response and cardiac aggression, leading to imperative concerns about the use of ACEi and ARBs in infected patients.

Whether these patterns were present in public hospitals is unknown. The aim of this brief study was to investigate COVID-19 hospitalizations and outcomes in the public health system during the initial pandemic response. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on COVID-19 admissions in New York City public hospitals during the exponential phase of the pandemic. All data were collected from an integrated electronic medical records system (Epic Health Systems, Verona, WI). Overall, 5,422 patients with at least one admission each for COVID-19 were reviewed, with a study of demographic characteristics (including age, gender, race, BMI), pregnancy status, comorbidities, facility activity, and outcomes. Data related to hospitalization and mortality trends were also collected from City of New York website. These data often involved more than one facility and/or service line resulting in more location or treatment facility counts than patients due to utilization of services at more than one location and transfers between locations and facilities. Results: Higher mortality was associated with increasing age with the highest death rate (51.9%) noted in the age group >75 years (OR 7.88, 95%CI 6.32C10.08). Comorbidities with higher mortality included diabetes (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.33C1.70), hypertension (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.44C1.83), cardiovascular conditions (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.47C1.87), COPD (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.39C2.50). It was deduced that 20% of all New York City COVID-19 positive admissions were in public health system during this timeframe. A high proportion of admissions (21.26%) and deaths (19.93%) were at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens. Bellevue and Metropolitan Hospitals had the lowest number of deaths, both in borough of Manhattan. Mortality in public hospitals in Brooklyn was 29.9%, Queens 28.1%, Manhattan 20.4%. Conclusion: Significant variations existed in COVID-19 hospitalizations and outcomes in the public health system in New York City during the initial pandemic. Although outcomes are worse with older age and those with comorbidities, variations in hospitals and boroughs outside of Manhattan are targets to investigate and strategize efforts.","output":"Outcomes of COVID-19 Admissions in the New York City Public Health System and Variations by Hospitals and Boroughs During the Initial Pandemic Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What are the latent questions on some textual data?

This is only attainable if countries with substantial wind energy potential use it in significant proportion to satisfy their energy needs. One promising sector where wind energy can be employed to actualize this potential is the electricity sector. However, the current reality is that fossil fuels still dominate the energy profiles of most economies of the world, including the advanced economies, with wind renewable energy source accounting for a very small proportion of the energy mix. Germany is one of the few countries that offers promising opportunities in deploying wind energy to its full potentials. This study therefore explores the feasibility of substituting wind energy for nuclear energy and other fossil fuels using Germany as a country of focus. We use the ridge regression procedure to analyse yearly time series data for the German power sector that spans the period 1986 to 2018. With respect to output elasticities of the energy inputs, the results reveal that wind and natural gas have positive output elasticity estimates while the estimates for nuclear and coal are negative. We also found that all the inputs pairs have positive substitution elasticity estimates between them. With respect to wind energy, the highest substitutability estimate occurred with nuclear power which is followed by natural gas and then coal. The study recommended that policies such as granting of tax credit for wind energy technology, reduction in property taxes for wind power facilities, and allocation of fund for research and development (R&D) in wind energy technology are recommended to promote the use of wind energy in the economy.","output":"Wind energy and sustainable electricity generation: evidence from Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: As of 13 December 2020, Afghanistan reported around 48,952 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1960 deaths Lack of knowledge and perceptions among healthcare workers (HCWs) can pose challenges to disease control Therefore, targeted, timely assessment of knowledge and perceptions are needed to address practices that might hinder efforts to stop the spreading of COVID-19 in Afghanistan This study aimed to assess COVID-19-related knowledge, perceptions, and risk prevention practices (KPP) among frontline HCWs in Afghanistan;(2) Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with the support of field teams who were deployed in Afghanistan, surveyed from 14 to 22 April 2020 in eight provinces in Afghanistan with varying cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases A 28-item KPP survey instrument was adapted from other internationally validated questionnaires related to COVID-19 (3) Results: The survey was conducted among 213 frontline HCWs engaged in screening and treating COVID-19 patients Survey results indicated that basic awareness of COVID-19 was 100% across all the participants Knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 transmission, symptoms, incubation period and complications associated with COVID-19 are comprehensive and high (&gt;90%), except available treatment for COVID-19 (84%) HCWs&rsquo;perceptions towards the prevention and control of COVID-19 were positive However, only 63% believed that the use of N-95 face masks and disposable and fluid-resistant gowns (76%) could prevent COVID-19 transmission This survey showed high knowledge and positive perception (72%), and only 48% of frontline HCWs had shown risk prevention practices Addressing their perceptions and placing additional focus on practices across all health facilities is recommended as a preparedness measure","output":"Frontline Healthcare Workers Knowledge, Perception and Risk Prevention Practices Regarding COVID-19 in Afghanistan: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, pushed by COVID-19 pandemic, the need of respecting social distancing has motivated several researchers to define novel technological solutions to monitor and track user movements.

Real-world estimates of vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant are still limited. An outbreak in Ruili city of Chinaprovided an opportunity to evaluate VE against the Delta variant of two types of COVID-19 vaccines in use in China and globally - inactivated (CoronaVac and BBIBP-CorV) and adenovirus type 5 vectored (Convidecia) vaccines. METHODS: We estimated VE using a retrospective cohort study two months after the Ruili vaccination campaign (median: 63 days). Close contacts of infected people (Chinese nationality, 18 years and above) were included to assess VE against symptomatic Covid-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, and severe COVID-19. We calculated the relative risks (RR) of the outcomes for unvaccinated compared with fully vaccinated individuals. We used logistic regression analyses to estimate adjusted VEs, controlling for gender and age group (18-59 years and 60 years and over).We compared unvaccinated and fully vaccinated individuals on duration of RT-PCR positivity and Ct value. FINDINGS: There were 686 close contacts eligible for VE estimates. Adjusted VE ofad5-vectored vaccine was 61.5% (95% CI, 9.5-83.6) against symptomatic COVID-19, 67.9% (95%CI: 1.7-89.9) against pneumonia, and 100% (95%CI: 36.6-100) against severe/critical illness. For the two inactivated vaccines, combined VE was 74.6% (95% CI, 36.0-90.0) against symptomatic COVID-19, 76.7% (95% CI: 19.3-93.3) against pneumonia, and 100% (95% CI: 47.6-100) against severe/critical COVID-19. There were no statistically significant differences in VE between twoinactivated vaccines for symptomatic COVID-19 and for pneumonia, nor were there statistically significant differences between inactivated and ad5-vectored VE in any of the three outcomes. The median durations of RT-PCR positivity were 17 days for fifteen people vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine, 18 days for forty-four people vaccinated with the Ad5 vectored vaccine, and 26 days for eleven unvaccinated individuals. INTERPRETATION: These results provide reassuring evidence that the three vaccines are effective at preventing Delta-variant COVID-19 in short term following vaccination campaign, and are most effective at preventing more serious illness. The findings of reduced duration of RT-PCR positivity and length of hospital stay associated with full vaccination suggests potential saving of health-care system resources.","output":"Effectiveness of adenovirus type 5 vectored and inactivated COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, and severe COVID-19 caused by the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant: evidence from an outbreak in Yunnan, China, 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to find a way for modern tourists to enjoy increased well-being while being provided with high-quality information about cultural assets. In order for tourists to enjoy well-being, cultural tourism guides must provide quality services while using various storytelling techniques. As the number of tourists who are interested in cultural assets and use their leisure time for this purpose increases, quality cultural tourism commentary can be directly connected to the well-being of tourists. Modern tourists can experience richness of life and emotional stability while being provided with cultural tourism commentary services through various storytelling techniques rather than professional knowledge. In order for tourists to effectively experience well-being through cultural tourism commentary, cultural tourism guides need to implement the following effective commentary. First, culture tourism guides should try to have sense of unity with visitors. Second, they should encourage humanistic imagination through related information. Third, they should provide customized explanations for tourists understanding because tourists consist of various classes and ages. Cultural tourism guides who attract tourists interest, have appropriate wit, skillful responses to cope with unexpected situations, cheerful laughter, and a loud voice gained satisfaction from many tourists. In modern society, cultural tourism commentators are not limited to simply explaining tourist destinations, but play an important role in satisfying the well-being of modern tourists who seek leisure and emotional stability. The external environment that refers to outdoor atmospherics is also crucial as it influences visitor experiences. In museums, external physical environment factors such as architectural style, positioning of entrances, and exterior dcor and signage can be a crucial facet of external ambiance affecting visitor experiences. The external environment (e.g., spacious design, pretty landscape design, outdoor natural surroundings) is a constituent of the tangibility aspect of museum performances. These external environment factors and internal factors together create perceived physical environments that visitors and staff cognitively/emotionally/physiologically respond to.

Rehabilitation services were highly disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic. Aim: To understand rehabilitation provision in palliative care services during the Covid-19 pandemic, identifying and reflecting on adaptative and innovative practice to inform ongoing provision. Design: Cross-sectional national online survey. Setting/participants: Rehabilitation leads for specialist palliative care services across hospice, hospital, or community settings, conducted from 30/07/20 to 21/09/2020. Findings: 61 completed responses (England, n=55; Scotland, n=4; Wales, n=1; and Northern Ireland, n=1) most frequently from services based in hospices (56/61, 92%) providing adult rehabilitation. Most services (55/61, 90%) reported rehabilitation provision becoming remote during Covid-19 and half reported reduced caseloads. Rehabilitation teams frequently had staff members on sick-leave with suspected/confirmed Covid-19 (27/61, 44%), redeployed to other services/organisations (25/61, 41%) or furloughed (15/61, 26%).

In late 2020, the Infectious Diseases Research Department (IDRD) at King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC) initiated a surveillance program focused on monitoring the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 variants by sequencing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of 20 to 32% of all community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 positive cases identified from November 2020 to February 2021 at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) in Riyadh. Sequence analysis detected among sequenced isolates a SARS-CoV-2 variant harboring an N501T substitution in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). COVID-19 cases linked to this new variant under investigation, first detected in isolates from November, grew exponentially in 2021 to account alone for more than 62 % (142/228) of all SARS-CoV-2 positive cases studied in February, thus suggesting that this variant might have increased transmissibility. Genome sequencing showed that this variant has evolved from the pangolin lineage B.1.1 and diverged from the original strain of Wuhan in China by ten amino acid changes located in ORF1a (P3359L and Q3729K), ORF1b (P314L), spike (S) protein (F157S, N501T, D614G), ORF6 (F2S) and nucleocapsid (N) protein (I84V, R203K and G204R). Isolates belonging to the new variant were further split into two sub-groups based on additional changes in the spike. Of these, one sub-group carried the Y144*, G257S, T859N and A899S variations combined, while one carried the H49Y variation alone. Patients infected with this new variant did not show any increase in the severity of infections. The rapid rise of the new variant among community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 cases suggests a national spread, although this needs to be further assessed carefully.","output":"Emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variant under investigation in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergence and re-emergence of several pathogens have been witnessed by this century in the form of outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. In India, the influencing factor that promotes dissemination of emerging and re-emerging viral infections is the biogeographical zones: a megadiverse country, characterized by varied geographical, climatic conditions and ever-changing socio-economical and geopolitical issues. These influence the movement of humans and animals and add layers of complexity for the identification and timely management of infectious diseases.

KFD virus was initially identified in 1957 and was known to be endemic in Karnataka State while CCHF virus was first identified during 2010 in Gujarat State, India. These viruses have managed to emerge in new areas within the last decade. With changing epidemiology of these arboviruses, there is a probability of the emergence of these viruses from new areas in future.

Modelling results obtained from analytical tool development are essential to understand the ongoing pandemic dynamics with a view to helping the public and policy makers. The pandemic has generated data on a huge number of interesting statistics such as the number of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths in many spatio-temporal resolutions for the analysts to investigate. The multivariate nature of these data sets, along with the inherent spatio-temporal dependencies, poses new challenges for modellers. This article proposes a two-stage hierarchical Bayesian model as a joint bivariate model for the number of cases and deaths observed weekly for the different local authority administrative regions in England. An adaptive model is proposed for the weekly Covid-19 death rates as part of the joint bivariate model. The adaptive model is able to detect possible step changes in death rates in neighbouring areas. The joint model is also used to evaluate the effects of several socio-economic and environmental covariates on the rates of cases and deaths. Inclusion of these covariates points to the presence of a north-south divide in both the case and death rates. Nitrogen dioxide, the only air pollution measure used in the model, is seen to be significantly positively associated with the number cases, even in the presence of the spatio-temporal random effects taking care of spatio-temporal dependencies present in the data. The proposed models provide excellent fits to the observed data and are seen to perform well for predicting the location specific number of deaths a week in advance. The structure of the models is very general and the same framework can be used for modelling other areally aggregated temporal statistics of the pandemics, e.g. the rate of hospitalisation.","output":"Bayesian spatio-temporal joint disease mapping of Covid-19 cases and deaths in local authorities of England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To investigate differences in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality between patients with rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) and the general population in Italy. METHODS We analysed the data from the national surveillance study promoted by the Italian Society for Rheumatology (CONTROL-19 database) including patients with RMD and COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 29 November 2020, compared with official data from the Italian population (within the same period) adjusted for age, sex and geographic location. The main outcome of the analyses was mortality. The relationship between RMD and mortality was analysed using adjusted logistic models and sensitivity analyses were conducted to support the robustness of our results. RESULTS We included 668 RMD patients (62.7% with inflammatory arthritis, 28.6% with systemic autoimmune diseases), who had a mean age of 58.4 years and of which 66% were female. Compared to the general population, the RMD population showed an increased risk of death (OR 3.10 (95% CI 2.29-4.12)), independently from the differences in age and sex distribution. Even after considering the potential influence of surveillance bias, the OR was 2.08 (95% CI: 1.55-2.73). Such excess of risk was more evident in the subgroup of younger patients, and more consistent in women. Subjects with systemic autoimmune diseases showed a higher risk of death than patients with any other RMDs.

Focusing on the spatial heterogeneity, epidemic spread on the framework of modeling that incorporates population movement within and across the boundaries is studied. The entire population of interest in a region is divided into small distinct geographical sub regions, which interact using migration networks across boundaries. Utilizing the time delay differential equations based model estimations, we analyzed the spread dynamics of disease in India. The numerical outcomes from the model are validated using real time available data for COVID-19 cases. Based on the developed model in the framework of the recent data, we verified total infection cases in India considering the effect of nationwide lockdown at the onset of the pandemic and its unlocking by what seemed to be the end of the first wave. We have forecasted the total number of infection cases in two extreme situations of nationwide no lockdown and strict lockdown scenario. We expect that in future for any change in the key parameters, due to the regional differences, predictions will lie within the bounds of the above mentioned extreme plots. We computed the approximate peak infection in forwarding time and relative timespan when disease outspread halts. The most crucial parameter, the time-dependent generalization of the basic reproduction number, has been estimated. The impact of the social distancing and restricted movement measures that are crucial to contain the pandemic spread has been extensively studied by considering no lockdown scenario.

The exact images at end-inspiratory or end-expiratory phases can be chosen accurately. PURPOSE: To investigate the correlation of the projected lung area (PLA) by dynamic chest X-ray with pulmonary functions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-two healthy volunteers who received medical check-ups for health screening were included in this study. All subjects underwent DXR in both posteroanterior (PA) and lateral views and pulmonary function tests on the same day. All the volunteers took several tidal breaths before one forced breath as instructed. The outlines of lungs were contoured manually on the workstation with reference to the motion of diaphragm and the graph of pixel values. The PLAs were calculated automatically, and correlations with pulmonary functions and demographic data were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The PLAs have correlation with physical characteristics, including height, weight and BMI, and pulmonary functions such as vital capacity (VC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)). VC and FEV(1) revealed moderate correlation with the PLAs of PA view in forced inspiratory phase (VC: right, r = 0.65; left, r = 0.69. FEV1: right, r = 0.54; left, r = 0.59).

Effective infection prevention and control (IPC) in HHC is essential to keeping both healthcare workers and patients safe, especially in the event of an emerging infectious disease outbreak. Prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, we explored successes and challenges with IPC from the perspectives of HHC staff. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: From May to November 2018, we conducted in-depth telephone interviews with 41 staff from 13 agencies across the nation. METHODS: Transcripts were coded by a multidisciplinary coding team, and several primary and subcategories were identified using directed content analysis. RESULTS: Four primary categories were generated including (1) uniqueness of HHC; (2) IPC as a priority; (3) importance of education; and (4) keys to success and innovation. Participants perceived that IPC plays a big part in patient safety and reducing rehospitalizations, and protection of patients and staff was a major motivator for compliance with IPC. The identified challenges included the unpredictability of the home environment, patient/family dynamics, the intermittent nature of HHC, and staffing issues. Education was seen as a tool to improve staff, patient, caregiver and families' compliance with IPC. Keys to success and innovation included a leadership focus on quality, using agency infection data to improve quality, and a coordinated approach to patient care. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This qualitative work identified barriers to effective IPC in HHC, as well as important facilitators that HHC agencies can use to implement policies and procedures to improve patient care and keep staff safe. Leadership prioritization of IPC is key to implementing appropriate IPC policies and may be especially important in midst of a crisis such as coronavirus disease 2019.","output":"Home Health Staff Perspectives on Infection Prevention and Control: Implications for Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has triggered a global pandemic Healthcare workers are placed at an elevated risk of nosocomial cross-infection from clinical exposure One diagnostic criterion for COVID-19 is a positive result from a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay of pharyngeal swab specimens, which has been a routine procedure for healthcare workers during the outbreak In the context of a global shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), we aimed to lower the probability of clinical cross-infection without impacting the results of pharynx sampling through an optimized pharyngeal swab assisted device (OPAD) Methods: To evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of an OPAD for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, 22 confirmed COVID-19 cases were enrolled in our self-controlled study The results of two pharyngeal sampling qRT-PCR tests using the OPAD or the traditional method were recorded each Clinical data including baseline characteristics, laboratory tests, and computed tomography (CT) results were also collected The procedure duration and levels of pharynx exposure with the OPAD, and the diagnostic consistency between the OPAD and the traditional method for pharyngeal sampling qRT-PCR, were evaluated individually Additionally, a questionnaire was designed for healthcare workers who had performed the pharyngeal swab to deepen our understanding of their attitude during their service on the frontline Results: In all 44 samplings (22 samples with each method), the qRT-PCR results of 18 pairs (81 82%) were consistent, while 3 (13 64%) were single positive with the OPAD The positive rate was slightly higher with the OPAD (54 55%, 12/22) than with the traditional method (45 45%, 10/22) Using the OPAD, the average procedure duration of sampling was 30 s (30+/-13 s) Pharynx exposure was excellent in 21 subjects (95 45%, 21/22), which meant that the operator could acquire the swabs without difficulty Conclusions: As the COVID-19 pandemic escalates, our OPAD has identical efficacy compared to the traditional method for pharyngeal swabs, and it can also contribute to protecting the safety of healthcare workers","output":"Application of an optimized pharyngeal swab-assisted device in pharyngeal sampling for COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The positive-strand RNA virus Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) encodes an ovarian tumor (OTU)-like protease/deubiquitinase (PRO/DUB) protein domain involved both in proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein through its PRO activity, and in removal of ubiquitin chains from ubiquitylated substrates through its DUB activity. Here, the crystal structures of TYMV PRO/DUB mutants and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that an idiosyncratic mobile loop participates in reversibly constricting its unusual catalytic site by adopting \\"open\\", \\"intermediate\\" or \\"closed\\" conformations. The two cis-prolines of the loop form a rigid flap that in the most closed conformation zips up against the other side of the catalytic cleft. The intermediate and closed conformations also correlate with a reordering of the TYMV PRO/DUB catalytic dyad, that then assumes a classical, yet still unusually mobile, OTU DUB alignment. Further structure-based mutants designed to interfere with the loop's mobility were assessed for enzymatic activity in vitro and in vivo, and were shown to display reduced DUB activity while retaining PRO activity. This indicates that control of the switching between the dual PRO/DUB activities resides prominently within this loop next to the active site. Introduction of mutations into the viral genome revealed that the DUB activity contributes to the extent of viral RNA accumulation both in single cells and in whole plants.

First, the in vivo replication interference of avian influenza virus (AIV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was evaluated using qRT-PCR to detect accurately either AIV or IBV genomes or viral copy numbers during dual infections. Second, we have determined the amount of specific antibodies in sera of chicks infected with AIV alone, IBV alone, mixed AIV + IBV, IBV then AIV or AIV IBV 3 days later using an ELISA test. Finally, histopathological analyses of internal organs from inoculated chicks were realized. Quantitative results of AIV and IBV co-infection showed that interferences between the two viruses yielded decreased viral growth.

The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of HD TIV vs aTIV in the England and Wales 65+ population. METHODS A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a decision tree with two influenza related outcomes: Laboratory confirmed cases that could result in GP consultation, and hospitalisations that may result in premature mortality. Due to a lack of comparative evidence, the effectiveness of HD TIV vs. aTIV was calculated indirectly, based on relative effectiveness estimates for each vaccine vs. a common comparator, standard dose (SD) TIV. The primary analysis included hospitalisations explicitly due to influenza/pneumonia. Cost-effectiveness was established for three scenarios applying differing relative effectiveness estimates for aTIV vs. SD TIV. Uncertainty was analysed in one-way deterministic sensitivity analyses. A secondary analysis included hospitalisations due to any respiratory illness. RESULTS The minimum population impact of vaccination with HD TIV rather than aTIV was 13,092 fewer influenza cases, 1,109 fewer influenza related deaths, 4,673 fewer hospitalisations and 3,245 fewer GP appointments. HD TIV was cost-effective vs. aTIV for all three effectiveness scenarios with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) equal to 1,932, 4,181, and 8,767 per quality adjusted life year.

Nucleic acid pathogen detection methods, typically PCR, have numerous limitations, such as highly sophisticated equipment requirements, reagents, and trained personnel relying on well-established laboratories, besides being time-consuming. Thus, there is a crucial need to develop novel nucleic acid detection tools that are rapid, specific, sensitive, and cost-effective, particularly ones that can be used for versatile point-of-care diagnostic applications.

The resulting disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can cause multi-organ system dysfunction in patients requiring hospitalisation and intensive care treatment. Serious infections like COVID-19 often negatively affect nutritional status, and the resulting nutritional deficiencies may increase disease severity and impair recovery.

VA may play a similar role in COVID-19. First, VA is important in maintaining innate and adaptive immunity to promote clearance of a primary infection as well as minimise risks from secondary infections. Second, VA plays a unique role in the respiratory tract, minimising damaging inflammation, supporting repair of respiratory epithelium and preventing fibrosis. Third, VA deficiency may develop during COVID-19 due to specific effects on lung and liver stores caused by inflammation and impaired kidney function, suggesting that supplements may be needed to restore adequate status.

These findings reinforce the importance of optimising dietary behaviours for healthy ageing. INTRODUCTION: Research investigating the roles of individual nutrients in muscle health fails to account for the synergistic relationships between foods and nutrients. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of diet quality and dietary patterns for muscle mass and function in men over a 15-year period. METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted in 522 men from the Geelong Osteoporosis Study with complete dietary and muscle mass or muscle function data at both baseline and 15-year follow-up assessments. Dietary exposures were extracted from food frequency questionnaires and included the Australian Recommended Food Score, the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII?), and three a posteriori dietary patterns: Plant-focused, Western, and Traditional (Anglo-Australian). Outcome variables included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometryCderived skeletal muscle index (SMI) and muscle function measured with the timed up-and-go (TUG) test. RESULTS: An anti-inflammatory diet and higher scores on a Traditional dietary pattern both predicted greater SMI ((B: ?0.04 (95%CI ?0.08, ?0.00) kg/m(2)) and (B: 0.12 (95%CI 0.04, 0.20) kg/m(2)), respectively), while a pro-inflammatory diet predicted slower TUG (B: 0.11 (95%CI 0.001, 0.21) sec) over the 15-year follow-up period.

Although continuous human-to-human transmission has not been reported, the occurrence of various H7N9-associated epidemics and the lack of production of strong antibodies against H7N9 in humans warn of the potential for H7N9 to become a new pandemic. Therefore, the need for effective vaccination against H7N9 as a life-threatening viral pathogen has become a major concern. The current study reports the design of a multi-epitope vaccine against Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) proteins of H7N9 Influenza A virus by prediction of Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), Helper T lymphocyte (HTL), IFN- and B-cell epitopes. Human -defensin-3 (HD-3) and pan HLA DR-binding epitope (PADRE) sequence were considered as adjuvant. EAAAK, AAY, GPGPG, HEYGAEALERAG, KK and RVRR linkers were used as a connector for epitopes. The final construct contained 777 amino acids that are expected to be a recombinant protein of about ~ 86.38 kDa with antigenic and non-allergenic properties after expression. Modeled protein analysis based on the tertiary structure validation, docking studies, and molecular dynamics simulations results like Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), Gyration, Root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) and Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) showed that this protein has a stable construct and capable of being in interaction with Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), TLR8 and m826 antibody. Analysis of the obtained data the demonstrates that suggested vaccine has the potential to induce the immune response by stimulating T and Bcells, and may be utilizable for prevention purposes against Avian Influenza A (H7N9).","output":"Designing a multi-epitope vaccine to provoke the robust immune response against influenza A H7N9"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the amount of vaccine hesitancy and its determinants in relation to various demographic, social, and personal characteristics among the Saudi population. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: we utilized a structured questionnaire on a five point-Likert scale that included immunization process awareness, perception towards immunization and factors leading to vaccine refusal. RESULTS: The study included 5965 participants characterized according to various demographical factors. The participant's knowledge, perception, and the factors affecting the decision of taking the vaccine were calculated. About 40.7% had enough information about COVID-19 vaccines and were willing to take it. The participant's perception towards COVID-19 vaccines is proportional to their knowledge and varied with the personal characteristics. Factors influencing vaccine use varied also with personal characteristics. Intent to be vaccinated was higher among older age groups, advanced education, retirees, and higher income persons (P < 0.001). Moreover, the influence of heterogeneity in personal perception towards COVID-19 vaccines has been discussed. Vaccine barriers scores were significantly higher among lower educational and income levels (P = 0.004). The leader's influence on vaccine decision was high (p < 0.001). The side effects of COVID-19 vaccine is the most important barrier to vaccine acceptance. Knowledge and perception score were consistently and significantly higher among the group who received their information from official websites, followed by those who had used both websites and social media (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Additional approaches will be needed to effectively meet the needs of the hesitant population, particularly the safety and efficacy concerns, the speed of vaccine development, and the distrust in government and health organizations.","output":"Factors related to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a public health threat worldwide. The World Health Organization aims to eliminate HCV. However, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a severe compromise in health services, and this has halted efforts to eliminate HCV. Herein, we report our experience with the initiative of HCV elimination in Duhok city, Kurdistan Region of Iraq, with a focus on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the HCV elimination plan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anti-HCV antibody test was used to screen subjects. All positive results were then confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. All patients with current HCV infection were treated with direct-acting antiviral regimens. RESULTS: During the study period, 459,015 subjects were tested for anti-HCV antibody positivity, with a monthly average of 9,562 tests for HCV. This number dropped to zero during the lockdown period between 1March and 31May 2020. Among the tested samples, 0.29% (1350/459015) tested positive for anti-HCV antibodies. RT-PCR testing of all positive samples revealed that 0.020% (93/459015) were positive. Of the 93 recruited subjects, 3 patients did not complete the treatment course due to the lockdown. All patients who finished the treatment course were cured as determined by sustained virologic response 12 (SVR12) weeks after finishing the treatment course. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, reductions in health facility utilisation led to a significant decrease in services offered for HCV screening and treatment. Such a decrease in services has had a negative impact on HCV elimination. An urgent plan is needed to resume the services, and strict follow-up is needed for patients whose treatment was interrupted.","output":"Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the elimination of hepatitis C virus in Duhok, Kurdistan, Iraq: A retrospective cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Older adultsclassified as a high\\\\risk groupare highly likely to experience increased loneliness due to the implementation of various policies designed to prevent the spread of COVID\\\\19.

In the psychiatric clinic of the University Medical Center G?ttingen, students' ratings concerning the learning effect and their substantive assessment for both forms of teaching were comparatively evaluated to determine the quality of this process. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Overall, 350 students who had visited classroom teaching (winter semester, WS18/19 to WS19/20) vs. digital teaching (SS20) assessed their form of teaching post hoc, within a standardized survey. They rated the individual learning effect in seven psychiatric subjects and did a substantive assessment on eight dimensions. In addition, they rated their expenditure of time. RESULTS: For digital teaching, the individual learning effect was rated as either being equivalent or superior (subjects: psychotherapy, schizophrenia). Despite a significantly heightened expenditure of time, digital teaching was substantively assessed as being equivalent to classroom teaching or superior (dimensions: independent processing of learning goals, overall format of lecture). Concerning their anticipated preparation for the professional practice, students rated digital teaching as being inferior to classroom teaching. CONCLUSION: A pandemic-driven conversion from classroom to digital teaching did not result in a loss of quality on the dimensions measured in this comparative evaluation. With a view to professional practice, digital teaching should complement classroom teaching and be part of future curricula.","output":"[Implementation of digital teaching in psychiatry as consequence of COVID-19: a comparative evaluation with classroom teaching]./ Einfhrung digitaler Lehre im Fach Psychiatrie als Reaktion auf COVID-19: eine vergleichende Evaluation zur Pr?senzlehre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The first cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Brazil were diagnosed in February 2020. Our Emergency Department (ED) was designated as a COVID-19 exclusive service. We report our first 500 confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients. METHODS: From 14 March to 16 May 2020, we enrolled all patients admitted to our ED that had a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Infection was confirmed via nasopharyngeal swabs or tracheal aspirate PCR. The outcomes included hospital discharge, invasive mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital death, among others. RESULTS: From 2219 patients received in the ED, we included 506 with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. We found that 333 patients were discharged home (65.9%), 153 died (30.2%), and 20 (3.9%) remained in the hospital. A total of 300 patients (59.3%) required ICU admission, and 227 (44.9%) needed invasive ventilation. The multivariate analysis found age, number of comorbidities, extension of ground glass opacities on chest CT and troponin with a direct relationship with all-cause mortality, whereas dysgeusia, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-ii receptor blocker and number of lymphocytes with an inverse relationship with all-cause mortality CONCLUSIONS: This was a sample of severe patients with COVID-19, with 59.2% admitted to the ICU and 41.5% requiring mechanical ventilator support.

As a result, it has been difficult to treat cancer patients on time, which adversely affects their prognosis. To address this problem, cancer centers must develop a strategic plan to manage both inpatients and outpatients during the pandemic, provide them with the necessary treatment, and at the same time prevent the spread of the virus among patients, visitors and medical staff. METHODS: Based upon the epidemic situation in Zhejiang Province, China, the number of running non-emergency medical wards in the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital was gradually increased in a controlled manner. All staff of the hospital received COVID-19 preventive training and was provided with three different levels of protection according to the risks of their services. Only patients without a known history of SARS-CoV-2 contact were eligible to schedule an appointment. Body temperature was measured on all patients upon their arrival at the hospital. Chest CT image, blood cell counting and travel/contact history were investigated in patients with fever. Respiratory tract samples, such as sputum and throat swabs, from all patients, including those clinically suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, were collected for nucleic acid detection of SARS-CoV-2 before treatment. RESULTS: A total of 3697 inpatients and 416 outpatients seeking cancer treatment were enrolled from February 1 to April 3, 2020, in compliance with the hospitals infection-control interventions. The clinicopathological parameters of the patients were summarized herein. 4237 samples from 4101 patients produced negative RNA testing results. Four clinically suspected patients all presented negative RNA test results and were excluded from the SARS-CoV-2 infection through follow-up retesting and monitoring. Seven patients with only N-gene positive results were retested, followed by CT scan and SARS-CoV-2 contact history investigation. All of them were finally diagnosed as non-infected patients. There was one outpatient who was confirmed positive by virus RNA test and then followed up. She might be an asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed case. During the study period, there was no SARS-CoV-2 infection among staff, patients and escorts of patients in the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital. CONCLUSION: This study suggested our infection-control interventions, including viral nucleic acid test, could be used as a reliable method to screen cancer patients in the area with moderate COVID-19 prevalence.

Rural settings have been reported to be more vulnerable in some parts of the world. In Uganda, local council (LC) leaders in rural districts are among the immediate personnel mandated to support compliance with preventive guidelines, and to identify and report/deliver COVID-19 cases to health units. We examined the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission, knowledge levels, perceptions & opinions of LC leaders in selected districts in Eastern Uganda, to support the design of risk-based COVID-19 control measures in rural settings, to protect lives better. Methods: : A convenience sample was taken from village council leaders in the selected districts. Pretested questionnaires and in-depth interviews were used to assess the knowledge levels, perceptions, and opinions of respondents about COVID-19. An observational survey was also conducted to examine the barriers that might deter effective control of COVID-19, with reference to health guidelines set by the Ugandan government and the World Health Organization. Data was analyzed using HyperRESEARCH 2.8 software, and STATA version-15.0. Results: and discussion: Eighty percent of local council leaders reported that they were formally engaged in the fight against COVID-19 in their communities, and the common means of engagement were;dissemination of COVID-19 information by word of mouth, regulation of public events, and monitoring of visitors that come from distant places. All clients reported having received some information about this pandemic, but there was generally low knowledge on some vital aspects: 70% of the respondents did not know the meaning of COVID-19;100% were uninformed on these common symptoms;headache, sore throat, nausea, and loss of taste & smell;10% did not know if willingness to conform to health guidelines may affect COVID-19 prevention, and they believed that domestic animals are viable vectors. Radio was the commonest source of COVID-19 information, but it was confounded by poor quality of radio-signals. Most respondents were of the view that in the communities they lead;inaccessibility to authentic health information, financial constraints, and belief that COVID-19 is a fallacy, were some of the leading obstacles to the fight against the pandemic. Low awareness and misconceptions on COVID-19 could be explained by;technological challenges, low literacy levels, and dissemination of wrong information about this pandemic. From the observational survey, the major factors which might intensify the risk of COVID-19 spread were: scarcity of requirements for hand hygiene, face protection, violation of health guidelines & directives, porous borders, terrain, and use of potentially polluted open water sources. Conclusion: and recommendations: Rural communities in Eastern Uganda are vulnerable to the drastic spread of COVID-19, due to challenges related to: low awareness of COVID-19, reluctance in complying with preventive guidelines, finance, technology, terrain, porous borders, illiteracy and scarcity of protective wear and hygiene resources.

This pathway is down-regulated by virus- and host-encoded enzymes that degrade 2-5A. Phosphodiesterase 12 (PDE12) was the first cellular 2-5A- degrading enzyme to be purified and described at a molecular level. Inhibition of PDE12 may up-regulate the OAS/RNase-L pathway in response to viral infection resulting in increased resistance to a variety of viral pathogens. We generated a PDE12-null cell line, HeLaPDE12, using transcription activator-like effector nuclease-mediated gene inactivation. This cell line has increased 2-5A levels in response to IFN and poly(I-C), a double-stranded RNA mimic compared with the parental cell line. Moreover, HeLaPDE12 cells were resistant to viral pathogens, including encephalomyocarditis virus, human rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Based on these results, we used DNA-encoded chemical library screening to identify starting points for inhibitor lead optimization.

It is notable that in countries where latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is common and participating in the national Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination program, the case-fatality rates are relatively low throughout the world. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effects of the BCG vaccine and LTBI status on the course of the disease in patients diagnosed with coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) infection and to compare the LTBI rate with people with and without COVID-19 infection. The patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection who were hospitalized during a period of seven months between May 1st to December 1st, 2020 were investigated by the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) test in the blood samples for the presence of LTBI. For the comparison of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and people without COVID-19 infections in terms of LTBI rate retrospectively; all consecutive patients who were sent blood samples to the mycobacteriology laboratory for the QFT-Plus test between January 2016 and December 2019 were included in the study.

RESULTS In total, 270 patients after LSH with a follow-up of up to 14.5 years were enrolled and divided into groups according to their last follow-up length:  1 year 242,  3 years 112,  5 years 76,  7 years 45 and  10 years 18 women. Increase of minimal follow-up was associated with gradual decrease in surgical success. Rates of stress urinary incontinence were unchanged by the surgery, while anal incontinence and constipation rates decreased significantly; 14.5% of women were operated on for SUI in the follow-up. The PFDI-20, PFIQ-7 and VAS bother scores decreased significantly regardless of minimal follow-up length. CONCLUSIONS LSH with anterior and posterior mesh extension is a safe, effective and durable surgery with a positive long-term effect on quality of life. Although the surgical success gradually decreases, LSH remains a surgical success in most women.","output":"Long-term development of surgical outcome of laparoscopic sacrohysteropexy with anterior and posterior mesh extension."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and its subsequent spread outside of Wuhan, China, led to the human society experiencing a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While the development of vaccines and pharmaceutical treatments are ongoing, government authorities in China have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions as primary barriers to curb the spread of the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although the decline of COVID-19 cases coincided with the implementation of such interventions, we searched for evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of these interventions, since artifactual factors, such as the environment, the pathogen itself, and the phases of epidemic, may also alter the patterns of case development. METHODS: We surveyed common viral respiratory infections that have a similar pattern of transmission, tropism, and clinical manifestation, as COVID-19 under a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the current pandemic season. We then compared this data with historical data from previous seasons without such interventions. RESULTS: Our survey showed that the rates of common respiratory infections, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infections, decreased dramatically from 13.7% (95% CI, 10.82-16.58) and 4.64% (95% CI, 2.88-7.64) in previous years to 0.73% (95% CI, 0.02-1.44) and 0.0%, respectively, in the current season.

However, the field needs to better understand if a change in care delivery from in-person to telehealth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic will yield durable patient engagement and health outcomes for patients with obesity. The objective of this study was to examine the association of mode of healthcare utilization (telehealth versus in-person) and sociodemographic factors among patients with obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective medical chart review identified patients with obesity from a university outpatient obesity medicine clinic and a community bariatric surgery practice. Patients completed an online survey (1 June 2020-24 September 2020) to assess changes in healthcare utilization modality during subsequent changes in infection rates in the geographic area. Logistic regression analysis examined the association of mode of healthcare utilization and key sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 583 patients (87% female, mean age 51.2 years (standard deviation 13.0), mean body mass index 40.2 (standard deviation 6.7), 49.2% non-Hispanic white, 28.7% non-Hispanic black, 16.4% Hispanic, 7% other ethnicity, 33.1% completed bariatric surgery) were included. Adjusted logistic regression models showed older age was inversely associated with telehealth use (adjusted odds ratio = 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.98) and non-Hispanic black were more likely to use telehealth compared to non-Hispanic white (adjusted odds ratio = 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.05-2.81).

Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and clinicaltrials.gov was conducted for relevant articles until January 2022. Eligibility criteria were randomized controlled and non-randomized trials. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 28 days or 30 days. The quality of studies was assessed using the MINORS tool. Paired meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled risk ratios along with their 95% Confidence Interval. Results: In total, 33 studies were included. Twenty-one studies with a total population of 7900 individuals provided data on mortality. Patients who received vasopressors were statistically significantly more likely to die compared to those who did not receive vasopressor therapy [RR (95%CI): 4.26 (3.15, 5.76); p<0.001]. This result remained statistically significant regardless of the in-hospital setting. In-hospital and 30-day mortality were statistically significantly higher in patients who received vasopressors [RR (95%CI): 4.60 (2.47, 8.55); p<0.001 and RR (95%CI): 2.97 (1.72, 5.14); p<0.001, respectively].

METHODS: A search using keywords \\"COVID-19\\" and \\"Diabetes\\" was performed using different sources, including PubMed and World Health Organization. RESULTS: COVID-19 may enhance complications in individuals with diabetes through an imbalance in angiotension-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activation pathways leading to an inflammatory response. ACE2 imbalance in the pancreas causes acute ?-cell dysfunction and a resultant hyperglycemic state. These individuals may be prone to worsened COVID-19 complications including vasculopathy, coagulopathy as well as psychological stress. Apart from general preventive measures, remaining hydrated, monitoring blood glucose regularly and monitoring ketone bodies in urine if on insulin is essential. All this while concurrently maintaining physical activity and a healthy diet. Different supporting entities are being set up to help this population. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is a top priority.

METHODS: As part of the recognition of COVID-19 as an occupational disease in 152 HCWs with the mean age of 43.2 years, personal, anthropometric and anamnestic data related to the disease as well as anti-spike immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were obtained. Through descriptive statistics, correlation and regression analyses, relationships of all variables and Ig levels, especially seropositivity of IgG, were investigated. RESULTS: The mean interval between the symptom onset and the determination of antibodies was 58 days. IgG seropositivity and IgM seropositivity were noted in 82 % and 49 % of HCWs, respectively. Symptom duration was the only statistically significant predictor of IgG seropositivity. With each day of symptom duration, the probability of IgG seropositivity increased from 1.078 to 1.092 times (p < 0.05). If symptoms lasted longer than 17 days, a majority (almost 80 %) of the subjects demonstrated seropositivity in the following months.

Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and P.3, contain mutations in spike that has been suggested to associate with an increased recognition of mouse ACE2, raising the postulation that these SARS-CoV-2 variants may have evolved to expand species tropism to wildtype mouse and potentially other murines. Our study evaluated this possibility with substantial public health importance. METHODS: We investigated the capacity of wildtype (WT) SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 variants in infecting mice (Mus musculus) and rats (Rattus norvegicus) under in vitro and in vivo settings. Susceptibility to infection was evaluated with RT-qPCR, plaque assays, immunohistological stainings, and neutralization assays. FINDINGS: Our results reveal that B.1.1.7 and other N501Y-carrying variants but not WT SARS-CoV-2 can infect wildtype mice. High viral genome copies and high infectious virus particle titres are recovered from the nasal turbinate and lung of B.1.1.7-inocluated mice for 4-to-7 days post infection. In agreement with these observations, robust expression of viral nucleocapsid protein and histopathological changes are detected from the nasal turbinate and lung of B.1.1.7-inocluated mice but not that of the WT SARS-CoV-2-inoculated mice. Similarly, B.1.1.7 readily infects wildtype rats with production of infectious virus particles. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides direct evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.1.7, as well as other N501Y-carrying variants including B.1.351 and P.3, has gained the capability to expand species tropism to murines and public health measures including stringent murine control should be implemented to facilitate the control of the ongoing pandemic.

His fundamental contribution has become thoroughly embedded in subsequent econometric research, yet it could not fully answer all the deep issues that the author raised. Notably, Haavelmo struggled to formalize the implications for decision making of the fact that models can at most approximate actuality. In the same period, Wald initiated his own seminal development of statistical decision theory. Haavelmo favorably cited Wald, but econometrics subsequently did not embrace statistical decision theory. Instead, it focused on study of identification, estimation, and statistical inference. This paper proposes statistical decision theory as a framework for evaluation of the performance of models in decision making. I particularly consider the common practice of as-if optimization: specification of a model, point estimation of its parameters, and use of the point estimate to make a decision that would be optimal if the estimate were accurate. A central theme is that one should evaluate as-if optimization or any other model-based decision rule by its performance across the state space, not the model space. I use prediction and treatment choice to illustrate. Statistical decision theory is conceptually simple, but application is often challenging.

Young people are more vulnerable to substance use than older people. Substance use has varying impacts on the health and socio-economics of countries, and is a major public health concern globally. Currently, substance use is a common public health concern among the youth of Ethiopia, mainly in Jimma town. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the substance use and risk factors among the youth of Jimma town in 2019. METHODS: The study was conducted in Jimma town among youth who were engaged in substance use, from March to April 2019. A descriptive qualitative study design was employed and the study participants were acquired using purposive/judgmental sampling techniques. In total, 20 interviews were conducted with young people using in-depth and key informant interview methods. The data were analyzed by using ATLAS.ti version 7. Thematic analyses were performed in order to extract the main themes and categories. Direct quotations were presented with a thick description of the findings. RESULTS: The findings of this study were discussed under six themes and 12 categories, which emerged from thematic analysis of the data: substance use setting, time and means of distribution, substance-related factors, social and economic factors, individual factors, psychological factors, and legal and policy factors. CONCLUSION: The study indicated that khat, alcohol, cigarettes and shisha or water pipes were the most commonly used substances. Different factors that drive the youth to engage in substance use were identified; individual factors, social and economic factors, substance-related factors, and legal and policy factors were most common. Generally, to overcome this problem, the community, lawyers, and policemen should participate in the implementation and enforcement of rules and regulations on substance use.

During the most recent couple of decades, numerous examinations have been performed on the early discovery of malignant growth utilizing noninvasive or light intrusive methods in lieu of conventional excisional biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The change of the optical properties of ex-vivo breast tissues provides different responses to light transmission, absorption, and particularly the reflection over the spectrum range. We offer the use of Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) with advanced image processing and pattern recognition in order to analyze HSI data for breast cancer detection. The spectral signatures were mined and evaluated in both malignant and normal tissue. K-mean clustering was designed for classifying hyperspectral data in order to evaluate and detection of cancer tissue. This method was used to detect ex-vivo breast cancer. Spatial spectral images were created to high spot the differences in the reflectance properties of malignant versus normal tissue. RESULTS: Trials showed that the superficial spectral reflection images within 500 nm wavelength showed high variance (214.65) between cancerous and normal breast tissues. On the other hand, image within 620 nm wavelength showed low variance (0.0020).However, the superimposed of spectral region 420-620 nm was proposed as the optimum bandwidth. Finally, the proposed HS imaging system was capable to discriminate the tumor region from normal tissue of the ex-vivo breast sample with sensitivity and a specificity of 95 % and 96 %.

RVNA titers were determined by the RABV micro-neutralization test on 383 bat samples representing 21 species, comprising 30.9% of local bat diversity, from 31 locations across the island over 5 years. RVNA was positively detected in 33 samples (8.6%) representing 6 bat species (mainly frugivorous) with titers ranging from 0.1 to 19 IU/mL (mean 1.66 IU/mL). The analyses based on a multivariable binomial generalised linear mixed-effects model showed that bat age and year of capture were significant predictors of seropositivity. Thus, juvenile bats were more likely to be seropositive when compared to adults (estimate 1.13; p = 0.04) which may suggest early exposure to the RABV with possible implications for viral amplification in this population. Temporal variation in rabies seropositivity, 2012C2014 versus 2015C2017 (estimate 1.07; p = 0.03) may have been related to the prevailing rabies epizootic situation. Regarding other factors investigated, RVNA was found in bats from both rural and non-rural areas, as well as in both hematophagous and non-hematophagous bat species. The most common seropositive species, Artibeus jamaicensis planirostris is ubiquitous throughout the island which may potentially facilitate human exposure. The findings of this study should be factored into public health assessments on the potential for rabies transmission by non-hematophagous bats in Trinidad.","output":"The Serological Prevalence of Rabies Virus-Neutralizing Antibodies in the Bat Population on the Caribbean Island of Trinidad"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The results confirm the role of digital technology in selecting tourist destinations that do no harm to the environment and in minimizing the environmental impact through non-invasive tourism activities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Type Specific Primer based one step RT-PCR (TSP-PCR) test to distinguish the L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for viral genome sequencing, was developed. The study also analyzed 18,221 whole genome sequences (WGS) available up to April 2020 to know the prevalence of L and S type of strains. Phylogenetic and recombination analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome with nearest animal and human coronaviruses were analyzed using MEGA X and SimPlot version 3.5.1 software respectively. RESULTS: The rapid TSP-PCR distinguished the L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2 by amplifying a specific 326 bp and 256 bp fragment of the L and S type strain respectively. The test was used to analyzed 120 random SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from Assam, India among which 118 were found to be of L-type strains only. On analysis of 18,221 WGS, it was found that L type was the predominant strain with an overall prevalence a??90%. However, pockets of high prevalence of S-type strains (>35%) were still in circulation in Washington region in April 2020.

Although asymptomatic cases are not unique to COVID-19, the high asymptomatic case rate raised many problems for developing effective public health interventions. The current modeling effort explored how asymptomatic transmission might impact pandemic responses in four key areas: isolation procedures, changes in reproduction rate, the potential for reduced transmission from asymptomatic cases, and social adherence to public health measures. A high rate of asymptomatic cases effectively requires large-scale public health suppression and mitigation procedures given that quarantine procedures alone could not prevent an outbreak for a virus such as SARS-CoV-2. This problem only becomes worse without lowering the effective reproduction rate, and even assuming the potential for reduced transmission, any virus with a high degree of asymptomatic transmission will likely produce a pandemic. Finally, there is a concern that asymptomatic individuals will also refuse to adhere to public health guidance. Analyses indicate that, given certain assumptions, even half of the population adhering to public health guidance could reduce the peak and flatten the curve by over 90%.

METHODS: From Danish biobanks, we obtained plasma samples from 323 subjects aged 30-70 years with known SARS-CoV-2 infection. The PFAS concentrations measured at the background exposures included five PFASs known to be immunotoxic. Register data was obtained to classify disease status, other health information, and demographic variables. We used ordered logistic regression analyses to determine associations between PFAS concentrations and disease outcome. RESULTS: Plasma-PFAS concentrations were higher in males, in subjects with Western European background, and tended to increase with age, but were not associated with the presence of chronic disease. Of the study population, 108 (33%) had not been hospitalized, and of those hospitalized, 53 (16%) had been in intensive care or were deceased.

Oxidative stress and inflammation are closely related to ALI. Innate immune cells are the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Macrophages play an extremely important role in ALI through the activation of inflammation and oxidative stress. Itaconate, a metabolite of tricarboxylic acid, has been reported to have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the role of itaconate in ALI is unclear. Herein, we use 4-octyl itaconate (OI), the cellular permeable derivate of itaconate, to study the effects of itaconate in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: We used OI to pretreat C57BL/6 mice and LPS-induced ALI models to illustrate the role of itaconate in acute lung injury. The mice were randomly divided into four groups: control group, OI (100 mg/kg) group, ALI Group, ALI + OI (50 mg/kg) group, and ALI + OI (100 mg/kg) group. RAW264.7 cells were used to further prove the role and mechanism of itaconate in vitro. RESULTS: According to the H&E staining of the lung, OI was observed to significantly reduce lung inflammation. The active oxygen content of tissues was also significantly reduced (P<0.05). OI reduced the accumulation of neutrophils and secretion of inflammatory factors in LPS-induced ALI (P<0.05). At the cellular level, OI also reduced oxidative stress and inflammation. Intervention with OI was also observed to upregulate the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) and Nrf-2 target genes in the lung tissue and RAW264.7 cells. CONCLUSION: OI alleviates LPS-induced ALI. Moreover, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of OI might depend on the activation of Nrf-2.

However, the long-term consequences of the 2020 crisis for the development of the innovative potential of Chinese Internet corporations, primarily the largest platforms such as Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, and JD.com as integrators of the Chinese Internet economy, are still unclear. This article provides a general overview of changes in the consumption of services of large platforms, including moderate growth in demand, strengthening of the segment of high-tech services (cloud solutions for business, digital healthcare, etc.), digitalization of small and medium enterprises, and expansion of the user audience. The innovative and technological initiatives of the platforms are analyzed. Within the framework of the announced state plans, large platforms, in partnership with regional authorities, business, and universities, intend to develop an advanced digital infrastructure (5G, data centers, etc.) and innovation infrastructure (digital clusters, technology parks, and research centers). Despite the lack of new breakthrough initiatives, the innovation capacity of the platforms is expected to strengthen in the long term. Presumably, the key role will be played by qualitative changes in the markets owing to the diffusion of digital technologies and competences, which will lead to an increase in demand for Internet innovations. The mechanisms of transforming market changes into a resource for innovative development of the platforms are associated with the expansion of market data, the emergence of a complex system of services, and unique innovative ecosystems of the platforms, making it possible to organize and coordinate the innovative activities of various entities, as well as to coopt promising start-ups able to create breakthrough innovations during the crisis.","output":"The Impact of the COVID Crisis on the Innovative Potential of Chinas Internet Platforms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The therapeutic drug-loaded nanoparticles (NPs, 20C100 nm) have been widely used to treat brain disorders. To improve systemic brain delivery efficacy of these NPs, it is necessary to quantify their transport parameters across the bloodCbrain barrier (BBB) and understand the underlying transport mechanism. METHODS: Permeability of an in vitro BBB, bEnd3 (mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells) monolayer, to three neutral NPs with the representative diameters was measured using an automated fluorometer system. To elucidate the transport mechanism of the neutral NPs across the in vitro BBB, and that of positively charged NPs whose BBB permeability was measured in a previous study, we developed a novel transcellular model, which incorporates the charge of the in vitro BBB, the mechanical property of the cell membrane, the ion concentrations of the surrounding salt solution and the size and charge of the NPs. RESULTS: Our model indicates that the negative charge of the surface glycocalyx and basement membrane of the BBB plays a pivotal role in the transcelluar transport of NPs with diameter 20-100 nm across the BBB. The electrostatic force between the negative charge at the in vitro BBB and the positive charge at NPs greatly enhances NP permeability. The predictions from our transcellular model fit very well with the measured BBB permeability for both neutral and charged NPs. CONCLUSION: Our model can be used to predict the optimal size and charge of the NPs and the optimal charge of the BBB for an optimal systemic drug delivery strategy to the brain.","output":"Transcellular Model for Neutral and Charged Nanoparticles Across an In Vitro BloodCBrain Barrier"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The gripping coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has imposed dramatic changes to many areas of daily living in all sectors of society across the world.

Limited data exists regarding the use of ASCS for hand burns. We hypothesized that using ASCS in hand burns shortens healing time with no difference in complications and less donor site morbidity. Methods This was a retrospective chart review of second- and third-degree hand burns treated at a level 1 Trauma and Burn Center from 2017 to 2019. Study groups included patients with hand burns treated with ASCS in combination with STSG and those treated with STSG alone. Outcomes included time to re-epithelialization, return to work, length of hospital stay, and complications including reoperation, graft failure, and infection. Results Fifty-nine patients aged 14 to 85 years (mean age 39  15 years) met inclusion criteria. The ASCS treatment group comprised 37 patients; STSG comprised 22 patients. Mean follow-up time was 14  7 months. The ASCS treatment group had a larger mean percent total body surface area (TBSA) (22%  14% vs 6%  8%; P < .05). There was no difference in time to wound re-epithelialization between both groups (ASCS, 11  4 days vs STSG, 11  5 days). Mean length-of-stay was 23  13 days compared to 10  13 days (P < .05) between the ASCS and STSG groups, respectively. No patients in the ASCS group required reoperation, whereas 2 patients in the STSG group required such for an infection-related graft loss and a web space contracture release. On multivariable analysis adjusting for TBSA, ASCS was associated with an earlier return to work (P < .05). Conclusions ASCS is safe and effective in treating hand burns.

One expressive mode, subtle and often unnoticed except by the parents, is infant gaze avoidance. It often elicits parental feelings of rejection, shame and despair, and may be a reason for seeking parent-infant psychotherapy. In therapy, the symptom often discloses a disturbance in the dyad's emotional interaction. Therapy can bring about relief in the symptom and the relational disorder. Sometimes, the therapist discovers that the infant is avoiding the therapist's, rather than the parents', eyes. This challenges the therapist's expertise in establishing contact with the baby and in perceiving and processing emotional reactions to what may be experienced as the baby's dismissal. Gaze avoidance elicits theoretical questions approached in a previous publication: what does the child seem to avoid in the adult's eyes, and how can we conceptualize the psychodynamics behind the symptom? It also evokes technical questions: how can the therapist make contact with an infant who avoids the mother's or the therapist's eyes?

In this study, we conceptualize social comparison as a multi-dimensional construct based on different comparing targets and processes, and explore how individual (i.e., cognitive reappraisal) and contextual (i.e., quarantine status) factors may influence the relationships among passive social media use, social comparison and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on a survey with 1131 Wuhan residents in China, we found that passive social media use was positively related to both upward contrast and downward identification, which in turn predicted a higher level of stress. Cognitive reappraisal was negatively associated with unhealthy social comparison (i.e., upward contrast and downward identification) but was positively related to healthy social comparison such as upward identification. Quarantined people tended to report more upward contrast, especially when they engaged in more frequent social media browsing.

How sequence variations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome affect pathogenicity is poorly understood. Starting in October 2020, using the methodology of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we looked at the association between whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of the virus and COVID-19 mortality as a potential method of early identification of highly pathogenic strains to target for containment. Although continuously updating our analysis, in December 2020, we analyzed 7548 single-stranded SARS-CoV-2 genomes of COVID-19 patients in the GISAID database and associated variants with mortality using a logistic regression. In total, evaluating 29,891 sequenced loci of the viral genome for association with patient/host mortality, two loci, at 12,053 and 25,088 bp, achieved genome-wide significance (p values of 4.09e-09 and 4.41e-23, respectively), though only 25,088 bp remained significant in follow-up analyses. Our association findings were exclusively driven by the samples that were submitted from Brazil (p value of 4.90e-13 for 25,088 bp). The mutation frequency of 25,088 bp in the Brazilian samples on GISAID has rapidly increased from about 0.4 in October/December 2020 to 0.77 in March 2021. Although GWAS methodology is suitable for samples in which mutation frequencies varies between geographical regions, it cannot account for mutation frequencies that change rapidly overtime, rendering a GWAS follow-up analysis of the GISAID samples that have been submitted after December 2020 as invalid. The locus at 25,088 bp is located in the P.1 strain, which later (April 2021) became one of the distinguishing loci (precisely, substitution V1176F) of the Brazilian strain as defined by the Centers for Disease Control. Specifically, the mutations at 25,088 bp occur in the S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which plays a key role in viral entry of target host cells. Since the mutations alter amino acid coding sequences, they potentially imposing structural changes that could enhance viral infectivity and symptom severity. Our analysis suggests that GWAS methodology can provide suitable analysis tools for the real-time detection of new more transmissible and pathogenic viral strains in databases such as GISAID, though new approaches are needed to accommodate rapidly changing mutation frequencies over time, in the presence of simultaneously changing case/control ratios. Improvements of the associated metadata/patient information in terms of quality and availability will also be important to fully utilize the potential of GWAS methodology in this field.","output":"Genome-wide association analysis of COVID-19 mortality risk in SARS-CoV-2 genomes identifies mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that colocalizes with P.1 of the Brazilian strain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the current evidence that correlates impaired male fertility with the risk of developing male-related malignancies.

INTERVENTION(S) Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Pooled risk ratio (RR) differences among male factor infertility subjects compared with a fertile control population, and meta-regression analysis according to age at baseline, mean follow-up, range of study time, and year of publication. RESULT(S) Six studies met the inclusion criteria and were critically examined. Four studies examined male infertility and TCa (n = 161,634; 174 TCa cases), and four examined infertility in relation to PCa (n = 183,950 men; 377 PCa cases) from 1963 to 2014.

The following study was designed to determine whether immunization with an inactivated CCV vaccine would protect dogs from clinical disease induced using this model. Dogs (n = 13) were vaccinated with an inactivated CCV vaccine. Vaccinates and controls (n = 5) were orally inoculated with virulent CCV virus and treated with dexamethasone on days 0, 2, 4, and 6 after virus challenge. Control dogs developed clinical signs including diarrhea, dehydration, anorexia, depression, and nasal and ocular discharge. Diarrhea was noted in 80% of the controls and 60% progressed to a severe watery or bloody diarrhea that persisted for multiple days. Conversely, only 2/13 (15%) vaccinates developed mild diarrhea and none developed bloody diarrhea. The control dogs averaged 10.8 days of diarrhea compared to 1.4 days for vaccinates over the 21 day observation period. In addition to reduced clinical signs, the number of days of virus shedding and the level of CCV in feces was different for controls (100% shed virus) and vaccinates (38% shed virus). This study demonstrates that vaccination with an inactivated CCV vaccine can significantly reduce not only viral replication, but the occurrence of clinical disease following a virulent CCV infection.","output":"Efficacy of an inactivated vaccine against clinical disease caused by canine coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) infection has recently become a worldwide challenge with dramatic global economic and health consequences. As the pandemic is still spreading, new data concerning Covid-19 complications and related mechanisms become increasingly available. Accumulating data suggest that the incidence of cardiac arrest and its outcome are adversely affected during the Covid-19 period. This may be further exacerbated by drug-related cardiac toxicity of Covid-19 treatment regimens. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms that lead to Covid-19 associated cardiac arrest is imperative, not only in order to improve its effective management but also to maximize preventive measures. Herein we discuss available epidemiological data on cardiac arrest during the Covid-19 pandemic as well as possible associated causes and pathophysiological mechanisms and highlight gaps in evidence warranting further investigation. The risk of transmission during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is also discussed in this review. Finally, we summarize currently recommended guidelines on CPR for Covid-19 patients including CPR in patients with cardiac arrest due to suspected drug-related cardiac toxicity in an effort to underscore the most important common points and discuss discrepancies proposed by established international societies.","output":"Cardiac arrest and drug-related cardiac toxicity in the Covid-19 era.

The present trends indicate that the pandemic will have an enormous clinical and economic impact on population health. Infections are initiated by the transmembrane spike (S) glycoproteins of human coronavirus (hCoV) binding to host receptors. Ongoing research and therapeutic product development are of vital importance for the successful treatment of CoViD-19. To contribute somewhat to the overall effort, herein, single point mutations (SPMs) of the binding site residues in hCoV-OC43 S that recognizes cellular surface components containing 9-O-acetylated sialic acid (9-O-Ac-Sia) are explored using an in silico protein engineering approach, while their effects on the binding of 9-O-Ac-Sia and Hidroxychloroquine (Hcq) are evaluated using molecular docking simulations. Thr31Met and Val84Arg are predicted to be the critical - most likely SPMs in hCoV-OC43 S for the binding of 9-O-Ac-Sia and Hcq, respectively, even though Thr31Met is a very likely SPM in the case of Hcq too. The corresponding modes of interaction indicate a comparable strength of the Thr31Met/9-O-Ac-Sia and Val84Arg/Hcq (or Thr31Met/Hcq) complexes. Given that the binding site is conserved in all CoV S glycoproteins that associate with 9-O-acetyl-sialoglycans, the high hydrophobic affinity of Hcq to hCoV-OC43 S speaks in favor of its ability to competitively inhibit rapid S-mediated virion attachment in high-density receptor environments, but its considerably low specificity to hCoV-OC43 S may be one of the key obstacles in considering the potential of Hcq to become a drug candidate.","output":"Prediction of Single Point Mutations in Human Coronavirus and Their Effects on Binding to 9-O-Acetylated Sialic Acid and Hidroxychloroquine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the increasing attention among scholars on entrepreneurship education, there is a lack of empirical evidence on how to prepare for entrepreneurial education at an early age.

In the early 1990s, researchers reported that TFM induced vitellogenin in fish and that TFM was an agonist for the rainbow trout estrogen receptor. To support continued registration of TFM for sea lamprey control, regulatory agencies required further testing to evaluate potential endocrine disruption effects. Fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) were exposed to TFM at measured concentrations of 0.0659, 0.181, 0.594, 1.79, and 5.11 mg active ingredient (a.i.)/L for 21 days. No-observable- and lowest-observable-effect concentrations (NOEC and LOEC, respectively) were determined to be 1.79 mg/L or greater for each endpoint. Male survival in the highest treatment group was reduced relative to the controls. Percent egg fertility was reduced in the highest treatment group, resulting in an estimated NOEC of 1.79 mg/L. While no effect on gonadal-somatic index (GSI) was observed for males, female GSI was increased in the 5.11 mg/L treatment. Vitellogenin production was not altered relative to the controls for all TFM treatment groups. However, female testosterone was elevated in the 5.11 mg/L treatment. The results suggest that prolonged exposure to TFM at concentrations exceeding 1.79 mg/L has the potential to disrupt endocrine function. Biologically relevant effects in this study were found at the highest exposure concentration following a 21-day exposure.

Linear associations were determined between neuroimaging markers (white matter hyperintensity [WMH] volume and diffusion imaging indices) and mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure (PP), both unadjusted and adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, antihypertensive medication, BP source, and assessment center. In 37 041 participants aged 45 to 82 years (53% female), univariable analyses demonstrated that increases in both BP components were associated with greater WMH volume and white matter injury on diffusion indices, with a larger effect for PP (standardized effect size for WMH: mean arterial BP: 0.182 [95% CIs, 0.170C0.193]; PP: 0.285 [95% CIs, 0.274C0.296]).

Minimizing the boundary region is one of the pivotal and substantial themes for studying the rough sets which consequently aims to maximize the accuracy measure.

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy (PRG) and to investigate whether PRG can be applied for patients with advanced esophageal cancer. METHODS In this study, 89 patients (74 men and 15 women) with advanced esophageal cancer underwent PRG using computed tomography and fluoroscopic guidance. These patients were unsuitable candidates for endoscopic intervention because of esophageal stricture. Primary placement of a mushroom-retained gastrostomy catheter was intended. The end points were technical success and complications after PRG as well as clinical outcomes and survival of the patients. These end points also were compared between the pre-chemoradiotherapy (pre-CRT) and post-CRT groups using the Chi square test, Fisher's exact test, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS All the patients had a successful PRG. The mushroom-tip gastrostomy catheter was primarily inserted in 77 patients (86.5 %) and finally achieved for all the patients. Complications occurred for 14 patients (15.7 %) including Dindo-Clavien classification grade 3 (1 catheter dislodgement), grade 2 (2 gastric hemorrhages), and grade 1 (7 skin infections and 4 oozing hemorrhages) complications.

The induction of a coordinated immune response is crucial to the elimination of any pathogenic infection. However, SARS-CoV-2 can modulate the host immune system to favor viral adaptation and persistence within the host. The virus can counteract type I interferon (IFN-I) production, attenuating IFN-I signaling pathway activation and disrupting antigen presentation. Simultaneously, SARS-CoV-2 infection can enhance apoptosis and the production of inflammatory mediators, which ultimately results in increased disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 produces an array of effector molecules, including nonstructural proteins (NSPs) and open-reading frames (ORFs) accessory proteins. We describe the complex molecular interplay of SARS-CoV-2 NSPs and accessory proteins with the host's signaling mediating immune evasion in the current review. In addition, the crucial role played by immunomodulation therapy to address immune evasion is discussed.

RESULTS Post-2016 anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric negatively affected mental health, physical health, and health care-seeking behaviors among immigrant patients. Although most clinicians reported rarely witnessing immigration enforcement activities, nearly half reported persistent fear among their immigrant patients. A higher percentage of clinicians in U.S. border states reported increased fears associated with adverse physical and mental health effects among immigrant patients than those in non-border states.

Given that chronic hypoxia promotes cytokines production in the absence of disease, the inflammatory response against SARS-CoV-2 may also be different in these populations. The aim of this study was to compare pro-inflammatory cytokine levels among healthy and COVID-19 patients living at different altitudes above sea level. Methods & Materials A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in two Peruvian cities at different altitudes for comparison: Lima (sea level) and Huaraz (3052 meters above sea level). Patients with COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were compared to healthy subjects, according to their residing location. Five important proinflammatory cytokines were measured including: IL-6, IL-2, IL-10, IFN- and TNF- using ELISA-based assays. Cytokines levels were calculated and their mean, maximum and minimum levels were reported according to each study group. The difference between means was compared using the ANOVA and post-hoc Turkey Test, a signifiant value of p<0.05 was considered significant. Results A total of 35 COVID-19 patients and 10 healthy subjects were recruited from each study site. The mean levels of IL-6 (p<0.03) and TNF- (p<0.01) were significantly different among the study groups. In the case of IL-6, patients from Lima had a mean level of 16.2 pg/ml (healthy) and 48.3 pg/ml (COVID-19), meanwhile, patients from Huaraz had levels of 67.3 pg/ml (healthy) and 97.9 pg/ml (COVID-19). Regarding TNF-, patients from Lima had a mean level of 25.9 pg/ml (healthy) and 61.6 pg/ml (COVID-19), meanwhile, patients from Huaraz had levels of 89.0 pg/ml (healthy) and 120.6 pg/ml (COVID-19). The levels of IL-2, IL-10 and IFN- were not significantly different in the study groups. Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 residing in high-altitude tend to have higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 and TNF-. Altogether, this findings demonstrates the need to perform more studies in populations residing at high altitude, given that inflammatory response may be significantly different in these populations.","output":"Comparison of Cytokines Levels Among Covid-19 Patients Living at Sea Level and High Altitude"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intensive care units (ICU) around the world are overburdened with COVID-19 patients with ventilator-dependent chronic respiratory failure (VDRF).

A secondary aim was to compare the prevalence of smoking and snuff use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study population includes 1644 participants aged 23C26 years from the Swedish population-based birth cohort BAMSE. From August to November 2020, the participants answered a web questionnaire on COVID-19 symptoms, lifestyle and health. Information on tobacco use was compared against the previous study follow-up in 2016C2019. RESULTS: The prevalence of suspected COVID-19 symptoms was 45.3% (n=742), and 80 of these (10.8%) reported long-term symptoms (?4 weeks). There was no significant difference in sociodemographic or lifestyle factors in relation to the duration of suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Rhinitis, migraine and lower self-rated health before the pandemic was more common among participants with long-term symptoms. In addition, there was a tendency for higher prevalences of asthma, chronic bronchitis and depression in this group. The prevalence of smoking decreased from 18.9% before the pandemic to 14.7% during the pandemic, while snuff use increased from 12.7% to 22.4% (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of Swedish young adults have had symptoms of suspected COVID-19 from February up to August 2020. Among these, one out of 10 have had long-term symptoms for at least 4 weeks. Long-term symptoms of suspected COVID-19 were associated with several common chronic conditions.

While the impact of lifestyle medicine is strong across many psychiatric illnesses, our understanding of the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in treating obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) is minimal. We aimed to conduct a systematic review examining the effect of lifestyle interventions (targeting diet, exercise, sleep, stress management, and tobacco/alcohol use) on OCRDs symptoms. METHODS We systematically searched four electronic databases for published randomized controlled trials reporting on lifestyle interventions for OCRDs. We qualitatively synthesized results of eligible studies and calculated mean changes in symptom severity from baseline to end-point and standardized between-groups effect-sizes. RESULTS We identified 33 eligible studies. Poor efficacy was noted across a number of rigorous dietary supplement interventions with some promising data in four (of six) studies regarding n-acetylcysteine for trichotillomania, skin picking and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Stress management interventions, generally characterized by high risk of bias, reported mild effectiveness with greater effects noted for mind-body exercises (yoga) for OCD. Greater improvements may be achieved when lifestyle intervention is adjunct to first-line treatments and delivered by facilitators. CONCLUSIONS Diet (particularly N-acetylcysteine) and stress management interventions appear promising avenues for OCRDs treatment. We present an action plan to move the lifestyle interventions for OCRDs field forward. Further high quality lifestyle interventions are required to improve the certainty of findings and to inform clinical treatment guidelines.Review registration numberCRD42020151407.","output":"Lifestyle interventions in the treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In February 2020, the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan city posed a huge economic burden to local medical systems. Consequently, Wuhan established Fangcang Shelter hospitals as a One Health approach for responding to and containing the COVID-19 outbreak by isolating and caring for mild-to-moderate cases. However, it is unclear to what degree the hospitals contained COVID-19. This study performed an interrupted time series analysis to compare the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 before and after the operation of Fangcang Shelter hospitals. The initial number of confirmed cases in Wuhan increased significantly by 68.54 cases per day prior to February 4, 2020. Compared with the number of cases noted 20 days before the use of Fangcang Shelter hospitals, a sustained reduction in the number of confirmed cases (trend change, ?125.57; P < 0.0001) was noted 41 days after the use of the hospitals. Immediate-level changes were observed for confirmed cases (level change, 725.97; P = 0.025). These changes led to an estimated 5148 fewer confirmed cases (P < 0.0001). According to the mean confirmed cases of 395.71 per day before the intervention, we estimated that Wuhan had advanced the terminal phase of COVID-19 by 13 days. Furthermore, immediately after introduction of Fangcang Shelter Hospitals on February 5, the reproduction number dropped rapidly, from a pre-introduction rate of 4.0 to 2.0.

A total of 35 responses were received including data from regionally organised breast screening in several countries. 27 respondents, covering 21 countries, reported the existence of a policy towards IFD and stated that they communicated to women about the benefit and risks. Few countries had attempted to measure the proportion of women making an informed choice. A cluster analysis of the survey responses allowed to identify three categories: countries in a confirmation phase who have adopted a policy specific to mammography screening; countries in an implementation phase with generic polices and limited administrative support dedicated yet to IFD; and countries in a decision phase who are deliberating how to address IFD. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the key policy and organisational characteristics of approaches taken to facilitate IFD in Europe.

Results: Compared to the last three years (2017-2019), the number of suicide deaths was lower during the initial phase of the pandemic but subsequently exceeded the past trend. By August 2020, the total number of suicides was 5.69% higher than the average number of suicides in the same month of the previous three years. The largest increase was found in suicides by young women (less than 40 years of age), with a 40% increase in August 2020 compared to the same month in the past three years. The number of suicides among students and housekeepers in summer months was notably larger in 2020. The survey data indicated that the status of mental health among young women was worse than that of women in other age groups.

DESCRIPTION: To remedy this, we generated 3,178,297 paired fosmid-end Sanger sequence reads from seven cats, and combined these data with the publicly available 2X cat whole genome sequence. All sequence reads were assembled together to form a 3X whole genome assembly allowing the discovery of over three million SNPs. To reduce potential false positive SNPs due to the low coverage assembly, a low upper-limit was placed on sequence coverage and a high lower-limit on the quality of the discrepant bases at a potential variant site. In all domestic cats of different breeds: female Abyssinian, female American shorthair, male Cornish Rex, female European Burmese, female Persian, female Siamese, a male Ragdoll and a female African wildcat were sequenced lightly. We report a total of 964 k common SNPs suitable for a domestic cat SNP genotyping array and an additional 900 k SNPs detected between African wildcat and domestic cats breeds.

We imaged films with up to four water layers that grow anisotropically over a single face. Growth usually begins from the near edges of a face where defects preferentially capture water vapor. Thicker films produced by condensation cooling completely engulf nanoparticles and form thicker menisci over defects. The high surface tension of water smooths film surfaces and produces films of inhomogeneous thickness.

The article provides an overview of the most important publications, presents the current results of the German Registry for PIMS and expert recommendations for treatment. SUMMARY: MIS-C PIMS is a new syndrome that is associated with a variety of virus infections, and also with SARS-CoV-2. The main characteristics are fever, multiple organ dysfunction due to a hyper-inflammatory state. In particular, cardiac dysfunction and severe shock. A high proportion of patients require intensive medical care, but the absolute number of children with SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C is low. Medical therapy is based on pathophysiologic considerations and is not evidence-based. Immunoglobulins, steroids and biologics are used and lead to effective treatment. Therefore, the mortality rate is very low.

IL-33 is a cytokine expressed by epithelial cells that exerts pleiotropic functions in the lung. The present study investigated whether immunoglobulin superantigens protein A and protein L and IL-33 caused the release of inflammatory (histamine), angiogenic (VEGF-A) and lymphangiogenic (VEGF-C) factors from HLMCs. The results show that protein A and protein L induced the rapid (30 min) release of preformed histamine from HLMCs. By contrast, IL-33 did not induce the release of histamine from lung mast cells. Prolonged incubation (12 h) of HLMCs with superantigens and IL-33 induced the release of VEGF-A and VEGF-C. Preincubation with IL-33 potentiated the superantigenic release of histamine, angiogenic and lymphangiogenic factors from HLMCs.

Guidelines were retrieved openly from internet search and some were requested from mental health practitioners in various SSA countries. The authors designed a semi structured questionnaire, as a self-interview guide to gain insight on the experience of COVID-19 from experts in the mental health sector in the various countries. While we used a document analysis approach to analyze the data, we made use of the Mental Health Preparedness and Action Framework to discuss our findings. We received health or mental health guidelines from 10 SSA countries. Cameroon, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda all had mental health guidelines or mental health component in their health guidelines. Our experts highlight that the mental health needs of the people are of concern during this pandemic but have not been given priority. They go further to suggest that the mental health needs are slightly different during this time and requiring a different approach especially considering the measures taken to curb the spread of disease. We conclude that despite the provision of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support guidelines, gaps still exist making them inadequate to meet the mental health needs of their communities.","output":"Mental Health and Psychosocial Support During COVID-19: A Review of Health Guidelines in Sub-Saharan Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Medical care workers experienced unprecedented levels of workload and pressure since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Little is known about its exact impact on medical care workers and related factors in China. This study aims to identify the psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical care workers in China. METHODS: From February 23 to March 5, 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 863 medical care workers from seven provinces in China using standard questionnaires measuring adverse psychological outcomes including Impact of Event Scale-6 (IES-6), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale(DASS)and related psychosocial factors like perceived threat, social support and coping strategies. Exploratory Factor analysis was performed to identify the dimensions of perceived threat by study participants. Multivariate regression was used to examine the determinants of adverse psychological outcomes. RESULTS: Posttraumatic stress (PTS) were prevalent in this sample of health care professionals, and 40.2% indicated positive screens for significant posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. The proportion of having mild to extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were 13.6, 13.9 and 8.6%, respectively. Perceived threat and passive coping strategies were positively correlated to PTS and DASS scores, while perceived social support and active coping strategies were negatively correlated to DASS scores. Nurses were more likely to be anxious than others among medical care workers during the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse psychological symptoms were prevalent among medical care workers in China during the COVID-19 epidemic. Screening for adverse psychological outcomes and developing corresponding preventive measures would be beneficial in decreasing negative psychological outcomes.","output":"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical care workers in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Self-measured blood pressure monitoring (SMBP) helps diagnose and manage hypertension from outside the clinic, which has implications for patient empowerment and outcomes, continuity of care, and resilience in care communities catering to vulnerable populations. METHODS: We instituted a protocol for SMBP among hypertensive patients at 9 community health centers in 3 states and administered questionnaires to patients before and after the protocol was instituted to assess knowledge and engagement with disease management, beliefs and attitudes towards, and experience doing SMBP. Questionnaires included 16 items designed to evaluate patient perceptions and beliefs about SMBP. These included a series of questions using a 5-point Likert scale, binary questions related to their perceived ability to comply with specific SMBP guidelines and open-ended questions to obtain descriptions of experiences with SMBP. RESULTS: The pre-questionnaire was completed by 478 patients and the post-questionnaire was completed by 372. Seventy-seven percent of respondents knew their ideal blood pressure and their engagement with blood pressure management increased significantly (p=0.0024) after completing the protocol. Additionally, 85% of respondents said that they had a positive experience doing SMBP. Open-ended responses revealed insight regarding why patients chose to do SMBP and factors patients appreciated about SMBP. DISCUSSION: When trained properly and supported, community health center patients are capable of and motivated to perform accurate SMBP. Our study provides evidence that health center patients can follow detailed SMBP protocols and monitor their own blood pressure from the safety of their homes, which is critical to their care continuum, particularly in days of a pandemic.","output":"Are Community Health Center Patients Interested in Self-Measured Blood Pressure Monitoring (SMBP) C And Can They Do It?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 outbreak has spread worldwide and has resulted in hospital restrictions The perceived impact of these practices on patients undergoing essential surgeries is less understood Methods Adult (18 years) patients who underwent medically-necessary surgical procedures spanning multiple surgical specialties from March 23, 2020 to April 24, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic were identified as eligible for a phone survey Survey responses were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach involving descriptive statistics and thematic analysis of coded and annotated survey results Results Of the 212 patients who underwent medically-necessary surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of these patients were male (61 3%), White (83 5%), married or with a domestic partner (68 9%), and underwent oncologic procedures (69 3%) Of the 46 (21 7%) patients who completed the survey, the majority of these patients indicated that COVID-19 pandemic restrictions had no impact on their inpatient hospital stay and were satisfied with their decision to proceed with surgery Severity of patient condition (44 4%), the risk/benefit discussion with the surgeon (24 4%), and COVID-19 education and testing (19 5%) were the most important factors in proceeding with surgery during the pandemic;34 4% of patients felt their inpatient postoperative course was negatively impacted by the lack of visitors Conclusion Medically-necessary, time-sensitive surgical procedures, as determined by the surgeon, can be performed during a pandemic with good patient satisfaction provided there is an appropriate discussion between the surgeon and patient about the risks and benefits","output":"What is the Patient Experience of Surgical Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic?

Thus, it is assumed that, like SARS, it may have adverse effects on other vital organs, which have dominant expression of ACE2. In testis, SARS affected patients displayed peritubular fibrosis, extensive germ cell disruption, damage of blood-testis barrier integrity and more frequent occurrence of apoptosis.

Although ITDSs are fairly accurate in detecting fever in adults, there is little information about their utility in children. METHODS In a pediatric emergency department, we compared temperatures of children (<18 years old) measured using 3 ITDSs (OptoTherm Thermoscreen, FLIR ThermoVision 360, and Thermofocus 0800H3) to standard, age-appropriate temperature measurements (confirmed fever defined as 38.0C [oral or rectal], 37.0C [axillary]). Measured temperatures were compared with parental reports of fever using descriptive, multivariate, and receiver operating characteristic analyses. RESULTS Of 855 patients, 400 (46.8%) had parent-reported fever, and 306 (35.8%) had confirmed fever. At optimal fever thresholds, OptoTherm and FLIR had sensitivity (83.0% and 83.7%, respectively) approximately equal to parental report (83.9%) and greater than Thermofocus (76.8%), and specificity (86.3% and 85.7%) greater than parental report (70.8%) and Thermofocus (79.4%). Correlation coefficients between traditional thermometry and ITDSs were 0.78 (OptoTherm), 0.75 (FLIR), and 0.66 (Thermofocus). CONCLUSIONS Compared with traditional thermometry, FLIR and OptoTherm were reasonably accurate in detecting fever in children and better predictors of fever than parental report. These findings suggest that ITDSs could be a useful noninvasive screening tool for fever in the pediatric age group.","output":"Mass screening for fever in children: a comparison of 3 infrared thermal detection systems."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using standard systems biology methodologies a 14-compartment dynamic model was developed for the Corona virus epidemic.

Beyond the modeling of the overall COVID-19 outbreak, the pandemic has also motivated research assessing various policy decisions and event outcomes. One such area of study, addressed here, relates to the formulation of methods which measure the impact that large events or gatherings of people had in the local areas where the events were held.

Apart from barrier dysfunction, ARDS is characterized by hyper-inflammation and impaired alveolar fluid clearance (AFC), which foster the development of pulmonary permeability edema and hamper gas exchange. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is an evolutionarily conserved pleiotropic cytokine, involved in host immune defense against pathogens and cancer. TNF exists in both membrane-bound and soluble form and its mainly -but not exclusively- pro-inflammatory and cytolytic actions are mediated by partially overlapping TNFR1 and TNFR2 binding sites situated at the interface between neighboring subunits in the homo-trimer. Whereas TNFR1 signaling can mediate hyper-inflammation and impaired barrier function and AFC in the lungs, ligand stimulation of TNFR2 can protect from ventilation-induced lung injury. Spatially distinct from the TNFR binding sites, TNF harbors within its structure a lectin-like domain that rather protects lung function in ARDS. The lectin-like domain of TNF -mimicked by the 17 residue TIP peptide- represents a physiological mediator of alveolar-capillary barrier protection. and increases AFC in both hydrostatic and permeability pulmonary edema animal models. The TIP peptide directly activates the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) -a key mediator of fluid and blood pressure control- upon binding to its  subunit, which is also a part of the non-selective cation channel (NSC). Activity of the lectin-like domain of TNF is preserved in complexes between TNF and its soluble TNFRs and can be physiologically relevant in pneumonia. Antibody- and soluble TNFR-based therapeutic strategies show considerable success in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, but their chronic use can increase susceptibility to infection. Since the lectin-like domain of TNF does not interfere with TNFs anti-bacterial actions, while exerting protective actions in the alveolar-capillary compartments, it is currently evaluated in clinical trials in ARDS and COVID-19. A more comprehensive knowledge of the precise role of the TNFR binding sites versus the lectin-like domain of TNF in lung injury, tissue hypoxia, repair and remodeling may foster the development of novel therapeutics for ARDS.","output":"Dichotomous Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor in Pulmonary Barrier Function and Alveolar Fluid Clearance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a major complication in patients with cancers due to therapy-induced neutropenia and underlying conditions, which increases hospitalization time and mortality rate.

Recent data suggest a prominent B cell germinal-center (GC) response elicited by mRNA vaccines in draining lymph nodes. Thus, in this study we aimed to explore the correlation between VAHL and humoral immunity as reflected by post-vaccination serologic testing and by comparing the incidence of VAHL between lymphoma patients treated recently with B cell depleting therapy and those that were not. METHODS: A total of 137 patients with hematologic malignancy that had post-vaccination [18F]FDG PET-CT were included (All-PET group), 86 received both vaccine doses before imaging (PET-2 group). Their VAHL status and grade on imaging were recorded. Among 102 lymphoma patients, 34 (33.3%) were treated during the year prior vaccination with anti-CD20 antibody containing therapy. A subgroup of 54 patients also underwent serologic testing 2-3 weeks after the booster dose, and their anti-spike titers were recorded and graded as well. RESULTS: The overall incidence of VAHL in patients with hematologic malignancy was 31.4%. The 34 lymphoma patients treated during the year prior vaccination with anti-CD20 antibody containing therapy had significantly lower rates of VAHL comparted with all other lymphoma patients (8.8 versus 41.2% in all-PET patients, Pv < 0.01). VAHL rates were 10% in patients with negative serology, 31.3% in patients with low anti-spike titers, and 72.2% in patients with high anti-spike titers. The positive predictive values of VAHL were 90 and 93.3% in all-PET and PET-2 patients, respectively. A positive statistically significant correlation was found between VAHL and serology ranks in All-PET patients (rs = 0.530, Pv < 0.001), and stronger correlation was found in PET-2 patients (rs = 0.642, Pv < 0.001).

Methods: We performed a post-hoc analysis of a prospective, blinded, observational single-center biomarker study that enrolled consecutive patients with spontaneous SAH between July 2018 and September 2020. Serum samples obtained on admission and on hospital day 4 were analyzed for concentrations of MPO-DNA complexes. The primary outcome was the occurrence of DCI defined as new infarction on brain CT-scan. The secondary outcome was clinical vasospasm, a composite of clinical and transcranial doppler parameters. We used Wilcoxon's signed-rank-test to assess for differences between paired measures. Results: Among 100 patients with spontaneous SAH, mean age 59 (SD+13) years, 55% women, 78 patients had an aneurysmal SAH and complete DCI information. Among these, 29 (37%) developed DCI. MPO-DNA complexes were detected in all serum samples. The median MPO-DNA level was 33 ng/ml (IQR, 18-43 ng/ml) on admission, and 22 ng/ml (IQR, 11-31 ng/ml) on day 4 (Mann-Whitney test: p=0.015). In the primary outcome analysis, we found a significant reduction in MPO-DNA levels from admission to day 4 in patients with DCI (paired test, p=0.036) but not in those without DCI (p=0.171). The secondary analysis showed a similar reduction in MPO-DNA levels between admission and day 4 in patients with (p=0.006), but not in those without clinical vasospasm (p=0.473). Conclusions: MPO-DNA-complexes are detectable in peripheral serum samples of patients with aSAH. A pronounced reduction in MPO-DNA levels over the first days after aSAH might herald DCI. The potential of MPO-DNA serum levels to serve as a biomarker of DCI requires further exploration.","output":"Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Biomarker Titers and Delayed Cerebral Ischemia in Patients With Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic that began in the last quarter of 2019 seriously impacted the transportation industry.

In this study, based on the facility density (FD), which has often been used in traditional research, a novel micro-scale COVID-19 risk predictor, facility attractiveness (FA, which has a better ability to reflect contact frequency), was proposed for improving the gravity model in combination with the differences in regional population density and mobility levels of an age-hierarchical population. An empirical analysis based on spatiotemporal modeling was carried out using geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) in the Qingdao metropolitan area during the first wave of the pandemic. The spatiotemporally nonstationary relationships between facility density (attractiveness) and micro-risk of COVID-19 were revealed in the modeling results. The new predictors showed that residential areas and health-care facilities had more reasonable impacts than traditional densities. Compared with the model constructed using FDs (0.5159), the global prediction ability (adjusted R(2)) of the FA model (0.5694) was increased by 10.4%. The improvement in the local-scale prediction ability was more significant, especially in high-risk areas (rate: 107.2%) and densely populated areas (rate in Shinan District: 64.4%; rate in Shibei District: 57.8%) during the outset period. It was proven that the optimized predictors were more suitable for use in spatiotemporal infection risk modeling in the initial stage of regional epidemics than traditional predictors. These findings can provide methodological references and model-optimized ideas for future micro-scale spatiotemporal infection modeling.","output":"A Novel Predictor for Micro-Scale COVID-19 Risk Modeling: An Empirical Study from a Spatiotemporal Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of alcohol is a serious public health concern all over the world, especially among young people, including students. Medical students are often exposed to higher levels of distress, which may lead to a higher prevalence of psychoactive substance use and psychiatric co-morbidities. Alcohol abuse can be one of the detrimental methods of coping with distress. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of alcohol use among medical students in Poland. METHODS: We analyzed data from the POLLEK cohort study on alcohol consumption and possible influencing factors. RESULTS: Among the 540 students included, 167 (30.9%) were hazardous drinkers (HAZ) according to the AUDIT test. The main identified risk factors of hazardous/harmful drinking were male gender and smoking cigarettes.

In case of hospital admission, continuation of therapy in patients undergoing chronic NIV is necessary and several protective circuit configurations have been recommended to reduce the risk of aerosol dissemination. However, all these configurations increase instrumental dead space. We therefore designed this study to evaluate their effects on the tidal volume (VTE) required to preserve stable end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (PETCO2) with constant respiratory rate. METHODS: A bench consisting of a test lung connected to an adult-sized mannequin head was set up. The model was ventilated through usual domiciliary configuration (single limb circuit with facial vented mask) which was used as reference. Then, five different circuit configurations including non-vented facial mask with viral/bacterial filter, modification of leak position, and change from single to double-limb circuit were evaluated. For each configuration, pressure support (PS) was gradually increased to reach reference PETCO2. Resulting VTE was recorded as primary outcome. RESULTS: Reference PETCO2 was 38(0)mmHg, with a PS set at 10cmH2O, resulting in a VTE of 432(2)mL. Compared to reference, all the configurations evaluated required substantial increase in VTE to preserve alveolar ventilation, ranging from +79(2) to +216(1)mL. CONCLUSIONS: Modifications of NIV configurations in the context of COVID-19 pandemic result in substantial increase of instrumental dead space. Re-evaluation of treatment efficiency and settings is crucial whenever protective measures influencing NIV equipment are considered.","output":"Protective Recommendations for Non-invasive Ventilation During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Bench Evaluation of the Effects of Instrumental Dead Space on Alveolar Ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Studies investigating clinical and imaging findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and predictors for lung injury mostly focus on adults. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of laboratory findings in predicting lung involvement in children with COVID-19. METHODS: Children with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction or COVID-19 IgM and who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed retrospectively. Admission absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), ANC/ALC ratio, platelet count, D-dimer, fibrinogen, ferritin, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate dehydrogenase levels were compared in patients with normal and abnormal CT scans. RESULTS: A total of 101 children were included. Among the patients, 68 (67.3%) had normal CT scans, and 33 (32.7%) had pulmonary involvement. The median CRP, ferritin, and fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in children with abnormal CT findings. The model of binary logistic regression based on the presence of cough, shortness of breath, fibrinogen, ferritin, and CRP levels showed that the possibility of having abnormal CT was 1.021 times more likely for every one unit increase in fibrinogen levels. CONCLUSION: Fibrinogen might be useful to predict pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 in children.

Unadjusted and adjusted associations between racial/ethnic identity and past-week depression and/or anxiety symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2 score  3 or Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 score  3), trouble sleeping, physical reactions when thinking about COVID-19, and self-rated worsened mental health due to the pandemic were estimated in separate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Over 30% of respondents reported depression and/or anxiety symptoms, 21% reported physical reactions, 25% had trouble sleeping, and 33% worsened mental health since the pandemic began. Adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related characteristics and pandemic-related stressors, odds of anxiety symptoms (odds ratio (OR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30C0.95) and worsened mental health (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36C0.94) were lower among non-Hispanic Black vs. non-Hispanic white respondents.

METHODS: Caregivers were educated with our educational program using a telelecture system and supported telerehabilitation following instructions from rehabilitation specialists in our university using the telemedicine system every two to four weeks for three months. Caregivers were assessed with our original questionnaire before and after the telelecture. Participants were assessed by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up & Go test (TUG test), Hand-held dynamometer (HHD) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) before and after telerehabilitation. Wilcoxon's signed-rank test was used for the statistical analyses. A value of P<.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Nine elderly people were enrolled. The mean age was 84.7 (78C90) years old and the sex ratio was 1:8 (males:females). The average number of telerehabilitation sessions was 4.7. The average score of nineteen caregivers before the lecture was 15.3, while that after the lecture was 18.3. Caregivers understanding was significantly increased after the telelecture (P<.001).

The objective of the present study was to explore whether parents perceived increases in and overall levels of parenting stress during the pandemic were associated with feeding practices and perceptions of child eating behaviors. METHODS: Parents (n = 284) of children 4C6 years completed a cross-sectional online survey between March and April 2020. Perceived changes in parenting stress during the onset of the pandemic, levels of parenting stress during the pandemic, child feeding practices, and children's eating behaviors were assessed. We used ordinal linear regression to examine whether changes in and levels of parenting stress predicted use of controlling or responsive feeding practices and perceptions of child eating behaviors. RESULTS: The majority (63.7%, n = 181) of parents indicated their family was moderately or extremely emotionally affected by the pandemic and 56.7% (n = 161) indicated pandemic-related precautions had been moderately or extremely challenging. Perceived increases in parenting stress during the onset of the pandemic were associated with more frequent use of food as a reward (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.04C1.26) and for emotional regulation (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.04C1.23), as well as greater child food responsiveness (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.84C0.99) and slow eating (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.84C1.00). Higher overall levels of parenting stress were associated with more frequent use of food as a reward (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02C1.08) and for emotional regulation (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.03C1.08) but also with use of pressuring feeding practices (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01C1.06) and encouraging a balanced diet (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01C1.06). Higher overall levels of parenting stress were associated with greater child food fussiness (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02C1.08), enjoyment of food (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02C1.07), and satiety responsiveness (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.93C0.98).

The diameter (0.3-10a?m) and quantity of aerosols generated during 45-s intervals of no-flow and chest compression before and after defibrillation were analyzed by a particle analyzer. Aerosols generated from the coughs of 4 healthy human subjects were also compared to aerosols generated by swine. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the total aerosols generated during chest compression before defibrillation compared to no-flow.

Here we provide a first assessment of the potential impacts of monitoring and maintenance breakdown in a suite of coral restoration projects (based on floating rope nurseries) in Colombia, Seychelles, and Maldives.

The maxillectomies were performed on patients who suffered a superinfection of mucormycosis after COVID-19 contraction and uncontrolled blood sugar levels. Case 1 elaborates a technique to overcome the complications like lack of supporting structures and microstomia by fabrication of sectional and hollow obturator prostheses using sectional impression technique and lost salt technique. Case 2 explains the management of an extensive defect with a mobile soft tissue flap and lone standing tooth by using a functional impression technique to gain retention and support from the remaining soft and hard tissues. Both the techniques overcome the clinical complications and give predictable outcomes. Prosthetic rehabilitation of such challenging cases needs modifications depending upon the clinical challenges encountered.","output":"Prosthetic Rehabilitation of Rhino Orbital Mucormycosis Associated with COVID-19: A Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: When used effectively, the Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) system can bring into reality a revolutionary victory in the fight against maternal and perinatal mortality from avoidable causes. This study aimed at determining the status of implementation of the system among health facilities in the Morogoro Region. METHOD: This study was conducted among 38 health facilities from three districts of the Morogoro region, Tanzania, from April 27, 2020, to May 29, 2020. Quantitative data were collected through document review for MPDSR implementation status. The outcome was determined by using a unique scoring sheet with a total of 30 points. Facilities that scored less than 11 points were considered to be in the pre-implementation phase, those scored 11 to 17 were considered in the implementation phase, and those scored 18 to 30 were considered to be in the institutionalization phase. RESULTS: The majority 20(53 %) of health facilities were in the pre-implementation phase, only 15(40 %) of assessed health facilities were in the implementation phase, and few 3(8 %) of health facilities were in institutionalization phase. There was a strong evidence that MPDSR implementation was more advanced in urban compared to rural health facilities (Fishers test = 6.158, p = 0.049), hospitals compared to health centers (Fishers test =14.609, p <0.001) and private and faith-based organization than public facilities (Fishers test, 15.897 = p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that health facilities in Morogoro Region have not adequately implemented the MPDSR system. The majority of health facilities in rural settings and owned by the government showed poor MPDSR implementation and hence called for immediate action to rectify the situation. Strengthen MPDSR implementation, health facilities should be encouraged to adhere to the available MPDSR guidelines in the process of death reviews. Transparent systems should also be established to ensure thorough tracking and follow-up of recommendations evolving from MPDSR reviews. Health facilities should also consider integrating MPDSR to other quality improvement teams to maximize its efficiency.","output":"Implementation of maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response system among health facilities in Morogoro Region: a descriptive cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Every anatomical lung resection requires the airtight closure of at least one bronchus. In current clinical practice, these bronchi are sealed with sutures or staplers. This study investigated in an ex vivo pig model whether a new bipolar sealing device MARSEAL (KLS Martin, Tuttlingen, Germany) could be an alternative for this purpose. Methods Complete bronchial trees were prepared free from pig heart-lung blocks that were removed at a slaughterhouse. These preparations were taken to the laboratory, and main, lobar, and segmental bronchi were closed using sutures, staples, or bipolar sealing. Each trachea was then intubated and connected to a ventilating device. The initial airtight closure of the bronchus was first tested with lung-protective ventilation. After 15 minutes of ventilation, the inspiratory ventilation pressure was slowly increased and the burst pressure (in mbar) was recorded. Each group included 12 bronchus closures. Group mean burst pressures were compared using a nonparametric test (Mann-Whitney U test). The significance level was p < 0.05. Results The main bronchi closed both stapler magazines or sutures were all initially airtight during ventilation. The mean burst pressure was 60  0 mbar for staplers and 57.92  5.8 mbar for sutures. In contrast, 50% of main bronchi sealed with MARSEAL devices (5 or 10 mm) leaked air from the beginning. This was also noted in all lobar bronchi sealed with the MARSEAL 5-mm device and 80% of those sealed with the MARSEAL 10-mm device. The mean burst pressure of initially airtight lobar bronchi was 12.7  7.25 mbar. In contrast, all segmental bronchi (mean width: 1.6 cm) were airtight when ventilated. Mean burst pressure was 14.64  9.1 mbar with the MARSEAL 5-mm device and 29.64  21.3 mbar with the MARSEAL 10-mm device. Histological investigation of the preparations (with hematoxylin and eosin staining) showed intact cartilaginous structures that were largely unaffected by bipolar coagulation. The airtight sealing of the segmental bronchi resulted from fusion of the peribronchial tissue and not the cartilage.

Following confirmation of the first few cases, the government enacted preventive measures to curb community transmission. However, daunting challenges deter these precautionary measures. Just after two years the country took its independence from Sudan, civil conflicts sparked and continue to overburden and undermine the fragile healthcare system. The conflicts have caused disruption of health services, destruction of health facilities, death and migration of health workers, displacements of a huge number of people. This scenario continues while the country is grappling with the pandemic. Other concerning issues include: insufficient COVID-19 testing capacity, limited medical and personal protective equipment and an inadequate number of health workers which leave the country ill-equipped in the battle against the pandemic. Non-compliance of COVID-19 prevention protocols by the general public due to high rate of poverty and social stigma contribute to the spread of the virus. The current situation in South Sudan make evident that there is a need for an immediate ceasefire by the warring sides so the available health services including COVID-19 efforts, are not disrupted to ensure the safety of all.

Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in MIS-C patients and severe hyperinflammatory response ensues with potential for cardiac complications. The cause of MIS-C has not previously been identified. METHODS: Here, we analyzed biospecimens from 100 children: 19 children with MIS-C, 26 with acute COVID-19, and 55 controls. Stool was assessed for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and plasma was assessed for markers of breakdown of mucosal barrier integrity, including zonulin. Ultrasensitive antigen detection was used to probe for SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia in plasma, and immune responses were characterized. As proof of concept, we treated a MIS-C patient with larazotide, a zonulin antagonist, and monitored impact on antigenemia and clinical response. RESULTS: We showed that in MIS-C, prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the GI tract leads to release of zonulin, a biomarker of intestinal permeability, with subsequent trafficking of SARS-CoV-2 antigens into the bloodstream, leading to hyperinflammation. The MIS-C patient treated with larazotide displayed a coinciding decrease in plasma SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen levels, inflammatory markers, and a resultant clinical improvement above that achieved with currently available treatments. CONCLUSION: These mechanistic data of MIS-C pathogenesis provide insight into targets for diagnosing, treating, and preventing MIS-C, which are urgently needed for this increasingly common severe COVID-19-related disease in children.","output":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is driven by zonulin-dependent loss of gut mucosal barrier"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The move from home into residential care is one of the most stressful life experiences for older adults. Relocation stress is a significant risk factor for anxiety and/or depression in aged care residents. Whether long-term or recently diagnosed, these mood disorders are associated with a decline in overall well-being, daily functioning and independence. The mental health needs of older adults are often poorly recognised and supported, including during the transition into residential care. Despite growing interest in how to facilitate this major life transition, few studies have taken the perspective of multiple stakeholders. The aim of this study was to explore resident, relative and staff experiences of the transition into residential aged care, and to identify strategies to support the mental health of older adults at this time. The role of pastoral care practitioners to facilitate transitions and support residents mental health was also examined. METHODS: This phenomenological study involved individual interviews with 35 aged care residents, relatives and staff, between January and April 2021. Participants were selected using purposive sampling. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and supported by field notes. Data analysis followed Giorgis steps for qualitative data analysis. RESULTS: Results were distilled into three main categories related to the overall transition experience, recognising and responding to residents mental health needs, and tailoring support to individual needs. A novel contribution of this study relates to the need to address a broad misunderstanding of the role of pastoral care and subsequent under-utilisation of a potentially valuable resource. CONCLUSIONS: By describing transition experiences and the resources to support residents mental health, findings of this study provide practical, real world suggestions for reducing relocation stress. New resources developed from the findings include guides, checklists and short question-and-answer films, in which current residents and staff describe strategies to support mental health and overall quality of life. Similar resources could be used to support transitions in other care settings.","output":"Strategies to support older adults mental health during the transition into residential aged care: a qualitative study of multiple stakeholder perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: A recent survey has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic has culminated in dramatical and critical treatment particularly in acute infected patients. In fact, this systematic review-meta-analysis was directly pertained to estimation at the efficient value of some clinical managements to confront the COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and Scholar databases were searched from inception to July 1, 2020, to identify studies reporting the current treatment process and medications (e.g. hydroxychloroquine, antiviral therapy, convalescent plasma, and immunomodulatory agents) for COVID-19. A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed to calculate the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The outcomes of this study were the frequency of negative conversion cases, clinical improvements, mechanical ventilation demand, intensive care unit (ICU) entry, and mortality. The standard treatment refers to the published guidelines and specialist experience which varies in different articles, and the proposed treatment refers to the kind of interest suggested in the included studies. RESULTS: A number of 45 articles met the eligibility criteria (out of 6793 articles). Among them, 26 articles involving 3263 patients were included in quantitative analysis. Anti-COVID-19 interventions could significantly increase clinical improvement (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.08-1.27; I2 = 49.8%) and reduce the mortality rate (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35-0.95; I2 = 74.8%). Although in terms of negative conversion, ICU entry, and mechanical ventilation demand, clinical intervention had no beneficial effect. The clinical effect of immunomodulatory agents (especially tocilizumab and anakinra) was noticeable compared to other medications with RR of 0.22 (95% CI 0.09-0.53; I2 = 40.9%) for mortality and 1.25 (95% CI 1.07-1.46; I2 = 45.4%) for clinical improvement. Moreover, Antivirals (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.26; I2 = 47.0%) and convalescent plasma therapy (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01-1.98; I2 = 66.6%) had significant beneficial effects on clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, all the included interventions significantly declined the mortality and enhanced clinical improvements with no effect on negative conversion and mechanical ventilation demand. Especially, immunomodulators and plasma therapy showed favorable outcomes.

The response by the Alberta Precision Laboratories, Public Health Laboratory (ProvLab), AB, Canada, included the development and implementation of nucleic acid detection-based assays and dynamic changes in testing protocols for the identification of cases as the epidemic curve increased exponentially. This rapid response was essential to slow down and contain transmission and provide valuable time to the local health authorities to prepare appropriate response strategies. As of May 24, 2020, 236,077 specimens were tested, with 6,475 (2.74%) positives detected in the province of Alberta, Canada. Several commercial assays are now available; however, the response from commercial vendors to develop and market validated tests is a time-consuming process. In addition, the massive global demand made it difficult to secure a reliable commercial supply of testing kits and reagents. A public health laboratory serves a unique and important role in the delivery of health care. One of its functions is to anticipate and prepare for novel emerging pathogens with a plan for pandemic preparedness. Here, we outline the response that involved the development and deployment of testing methodologies that evolved as SARS-CoV-2 spread worldwide, the challenges encountered, and mitigation strategies.

Vaccine-induced immune responses are often attenuated in frail and older populations such as Long-Term Care Facility (LTCF) residents but published data are scarce. Methods VIVALDI is a prospective cohort study in England which links serial blood sampling in LTCF staff and residents to routine healthcare records. We measured quantitative titres of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibodies in residents and staff following second vaccination dose with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech). We investigated differences in peak antibody levels and rates of decline using linear mixed effects models. Results We report on 1317 samples from 402 residents (median age 86 years, IQR 78-91) and 632 staff (50 years, 37-58), []280 days from second vaccination dose. Peak antibody titres were 7.9-fold higher after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine compared to Oxford-AstraZeneca (95%CI 3.6-17.0; P<0.01) but rate of decline was increased, and titres were similar at 6 months. Prior infection was associated with higher peak antibody levels in both Pfizer-BioNTech (2.8-fold, 1.9-4.1; P<0.01) and Oxford-AstraZeneca (4.8-fold, 3.2-7.1; P<0.01) recipients and slower rates of antibody decline. Increasing age was associated with a modest reduction in peak antibody levels for Oxford-AstraZeneca recipients. Conclusions Double-dose vaccination elicits robust and stable antibody responses in older LTCF residents, suggesting comparable levels of vaccine-induced immunity to that in the general population. Antibody levels are higher after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination but fall more rapidly compared to Oxford-AstraZeneca recipients and are enhanced by prior infection in both groups.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike antibody levels following second dose of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 or BNT162b2 in residents of long-term care facilities in England (VIVALDI)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Stroke at a young age is a societal challenge with a rising incidence.

METHODS: We retrospectively recruited 411 consecutive patients with first-ever ischemic stroke who were 18 to 50 years of age (mean age, 38.2  8.1 years, women 31.4%), admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2007 to 2018. Sex differences in demographics, risk factors, etiology, and diagnostic testing were analyzed. RESULTS: Females were significantly younger than males (36.9 versus 38.7 years, P<0.05). Hypertension (43.0%), smoking (41.1%), hyperlipidemia (37.2%), and hyperhomocysteinemia (27.9%) were common risk factors, statistically higher among males than females (P<0.05). Stroke etiology showed a significant sex difference that large-artery atherosclerosis and small-vessel diseases were more common among males than females (48.6% versus 19.4%, P<0.001; 9.9% versus 3.1%, P<0.05, respectively).

Although these studies provide very important information about the causes of CO2 emissions and environmental degradation, some deficiencies remain in the related literature. The agricultural sector activities, which are an important sector at a global level and have significant potential impacts on CO2 emissions, have not been adequately studied. In order to fill this gap, the effects of agriculture and renewable energy on CO2 emissions were examined for lucky-seven countries during the period 1995-2014. The results of panel cointegration reveal the presence of long-run nexus among the variables. While the findings indicate that agriculture increases CO2 emissions, renewable energy is a very important catalyst in reducing CO2 emissions in lucky-seven countries. We also found that economic growth and energy consumption enhance CO2 emissions and trade openness decreases.

Results The results highlighted three themes, Competence and the transition to registration, Support mechanisms and Communication. Both academics and PEs described how they observed the new registrants gaining confidence and competence during their time on the temporary register and suggested that professional bodies could consider curriculum changes to encompass a final transitional placement similar to their experience. They suggested that having robust support mechanisms and communication in place are essential for the success of this initiative. Conclusion The results provide insight into how PEs and academics supported new registrants to meet the necessary requirements of the HCPC register whilst working during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The major studies evaluating carotid revascularization excluded patients with carotid near-occlusion. Given the paucity of data in the literature, we attempted to evaluate the safety of carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting in carotid near-occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective data base review was performed from January 2010 to December 2018 to identify patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting for symptomatic ICA near-occlusion and had 1-month clinical and imaging follow-up with carotid sonography. The medical records and imaging studies of patients with ICA near-occlusion were selected for analysis. RESULTS Forty-five patients met the criteria for ICA near-occlusion, of whom 39 were included in the study, given insufficient 1-month follow-up on 6 patients. Of the 39 patients, 25 underwent carotid endarterectomy and 14 underwent carotid artery stenting. All patients had technically successful immediate revascularization of the ICA. Most (33 of 39) had 1-year follow-up postoperatively. Patients with carotid artery stenting had 20% restenosis and 79% vessel maturation rates, while patients with carotid endarterectomy had 17.4% restenosis and 84% vessel maturation. There was no significant difference in periprocedural complication rates between the 2 procedures. CONCLUSIONS Carotid artery stenting shows similar outcomes in restenosis and vessel maturation rates compared with carotid endarterectomy for ICA near-occlusion. There were no major differences between the 2 treatments in clinical outcomes or periprocedural complications. Carotid artery stenting is a revascularization option for carotid near-occlusion if the patient is considered at high risk for carotid endarterectomy.","output":"Comparison of Carotid Endarterectomy and Stenting for Symptomatic Internal Carotid Artery Near-Occlusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The questionnaire addresses the perspective of these teachers in relation to a series of questions that seek to corroborate the existence of a multidimensional gap (methodology, socio-economic and technological) in addition to verifying the effectiveness of educational management.

RECENT FINDINGS Over the past year, researchers have described several polymorphisms in Henoch-Schonlein purpura and Kawasaki Disease as well as the association between various vasculitides and infections. International and multidisciplinary efforts in Kawasaki Disease have resulted in recommendations for its diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management to improve patient care and further increase global collaboration. Researchers are investigating the role of inflammation and its role in endothelial health and atherosclerosis. Treatment regimens continue to improve, with the use of different immunosuppressive medications; however, we continue to have incomplete treatment successes. SUMMARY Vasculitides are rare conditions with significant morbidity and mortality whose prognosis has improved with newer diagnostic modalities and treatments; however, we continue to have insufficient knowledge of vasculitides and lack unambiguous diagnostic criteria. As technology continues to progress it is clear that a single cause of these diseases may be an oversimplification: the genetic makeup of individuals, as well as various environmental exposures, are of vital importance in the pathophysiology and evolution of disease processes, as well as response to therapy. Efforts should continue to improve international multicenter collaboration and interdisciplinary efforts to help solve this ever-growing puzzle.","output":"Update on pediatric vasculitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considerable clinical evidence supports that increased bloodCbrain barrier (BBB) permeability is linked to immune extravasation of CNS parenchyma during neuroinflammation. Although BBB permeability and immune extravasation are known to be provoked by vascular endothelial growth factor-A (i.e., VEGF-A) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), respectively, the mechanisms that link both processes are still elusive. The interleukin-20 (i.e., IL-20) cytokine signaling pathway was previously implicated in VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and is known to induce cellular response by way of signaling through IL-20 receptor subunit  (i.e., IL-20RB). Dysregulated IL-20 signaling is implicated in many inflammatory pathologies, but its contribution to neuroinflammation has yet to be reported. We hypothesize that the IL-20 cytokine, and the IL cytokine subfamily more broadly, play a key role in CNS neuroinflammation by signaling through IL-20RB, induce VEGF activity, and enhance both BBB-permeability and CXCL12-mediated immune extravasation. To address this hypothesis, we actively immunized IL-20RB(C/C) mice and wild-type mice to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and found that IL-20RB(C/C) mice showed amelioration of disease progression compared to wild-type mice. Similarly, we passively immunized IL-20RB(C/C) mice and wild-type mice with myelin-reactive Th1 cells from either IL-20RB(C/C) and wild-type genotype. Host IL-20RB(C/C) mice showed lesser disease progression than wild-type mice, regardless of the myelin-reactive Th1 cells genotype. Using multianalyte bead-based immunoassay and ELISA, we found distinctive changes in levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines between IL-20RB(C/C) mice and wild-type mice at peak of EAE. We also found detectable levels of all cytokines of the IL-20 subfamily within CNS tissues and specific alteration to IL-20 subfamily cytokines IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24, expression levels. Immunolabeling of CNS region-specific microvessels confirmed IL-20RB protein at the spinal cord microvasculature and upregulation during EAE. Microvessels isolated from macaques CNS tissues also expressed IL-20RB. Moreover, we identified the expression of all IL-20 receptor subunits: IL-22 receptor subunit -1 (IL-22RA1), IL-20RB, and IL-20 receptor subunit  (IL-20RA) in human CNS microvessels. Notably, human cerebral microvasculature endothelial cells (HCMEC/D3) treated with IL-1 showed augmented expression of the IL-20 receptor. Lastly, IL-20-treated HCMEC/D3 showed alterations on CXCL12 apicobasal polarity consistent with a neuroinflammatory status. This evidence suggests that IL-20 subfamily cytokines may signal at the BBB via IL-20RB, triggering neuroinflammation.","output":"Expression of IL-20 Receptor Subunit  Is Linked to EAE Neuropathology and CNS Neuroinflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza viruses cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Long-term or frequent use of approved anti-influenza agents has resulted in drug-resistant strains, thereby necessitating the discovery of new drugs. In this study, we found aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor, as an anti-influenza candidate through screening of compound libraries. Aprotinin has been previously reported to show inhibitory effects on a few influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes (e.g., seasonal H1N1 and H3N2). However, because there were no reports of its inhibitory effects on the other types of influenza viruses, we investigated the inhibitory effects of aprotinin in vitro on a wide range of influenza viruses, including avian and oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus strains. Our cell-based assay showed that aprotinin had inhibitory effects on seasonal human IAVs (H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes), avian IAVs (H5N2, H6N5, and H9N2 subtypes), an oseltamivir-resistant IAV, and a currently circulating influenza B virus. We have also confirmed its activity in mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza virus, showing a significant increase in survival rate.

This study selected and performed the following services: filming a community documentary, administering community health dance classes, and archiving community cultural artifacts in databases. Interviews were also administered to facilitate implementation of the actual services. Community health services commonly seen in Taiwan and abroad were compiled, and the resources required for each service were examined. Subsequently, factor analysis was performed to explore the characteristic of these services in order to recommend feasible services for university students to undertake. The results indicated that the eight resources required for the 59 common community health services were (1) a designated space or venue, (2) materials, (3) monetary resources, (4) human resources, (5) expertise, (6) professional equipment, (7) patience, and (8) empathy.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic tests are expensive, reliant on centralized labs, can take days to deliver results, and are prone to backlogs and supply shortages. Antigen tests that bind and detect the surface proteins of a virus are rapid and scalable but suffer from high false negative rates. To address this problem, an inexpensive, simple, and robust 60-minute do-it-yourself (DIY) workflow to detect viral RNA from nasal swabs or saliva with high sensitivity (0.1 to 2 viral particles/L) and specificity (>97% true negative rate) utilizing reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was developed. ALERT (Accessible LAMP-Enabled Rapid Test) incorporates the following features: (1) increased shelf-life and ambient temperature storage, compared to liquid reaction mixes, by using wax layers to isolate enzymes from other reagents; (2) improved specificity compared to other LAMP end-point reporting methods, by using sequence-specific QUASR (quenching of unincorporated amplification signal reporters); (3) increased sensitivity, compared to methods without purification through use of a magnetic wand to enable pipette-free concentration of sample RNA and cell debris removal; (4) quality control with a nasopharyngeal-specific mRNA target; and (5) co-detection of other respiratory viruses, such as influenza B, by multiplexing QUASR-modified RT-LAMP primer sets. The flexible nature of the ALERT workflow allows easy, at-home and point-of-care testing for individuals and higher-throughput processing for labs and hospitals.

From each district, a minimum of 400 individuals aged >=6 years from general population and 100 HCWs from the district public health facilities were included. The serum samples were tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against S1-RBD and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 using chemiluminescence immunoassay. We estimated the weighted and test adjusted seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against S1-RBD and/or nucleocapsid protein along with 95% CI. Findings: Of the 28,975 sera tested, the weighted and test adjusted prevalence of IgG antibodies against S1-RBD and/or nucleocapsid protein among the general population aged >=6 years was 67.6% (95% CI: 66.4 C 68.7).

Cell-cell fusion is an energy-dependent process and so-called fusogens are a crucial type of membrane-bound proteins, which are mandatory for overcoming plasma membrane hybridization with associated energetic barriers. Viruses and fusogens of human endogenous retroviral elements are a natural reservoir of fusogenic particles and proteins that could cause bi- and multinucleation of cancer cells. Likewise, multinucleated giant cancer cells have been found in several cancers caused by oncogenic viruses suggesting a possible correlation between viruses and fusogens of human endogenous retroviral origin in cancer cell fusion. ABSTRACT: Cell fusion is a well-known, but still scarcely understood biological phenomenon, which might play a role in cancer initiation, progression and formation of metastases. Although the merging of two (cancer) cells appears simple, the entire process is highly complex, energy-dependent and tightly regulated. Among cell fusion-inducing and -regulating factors, so-called fusogens have been identified as a specific type of proteins that are indispensable for overcoming fusion-associated energetic barriers and final merging of plasma membranes. About 8% of the human genome is of retroviral origin and some well-known fusogens, such as syncytin-1, are expressed by human (cancer) cells. Likewise, enveloped viruses can enable and facilitate cell fusion due to evolutionarily optimized fusogens, and are also capable to induce bi- and multinucleation underlining their fusion capacity. Moreover, multinucleated giant cancer cells have been found in tumors derived from oncogenic viruses. Accordingly, a potential correlation between viruses and fusogens of human endogenous retroviral origin in cancer cell fusion will be summarized in this review.","output":"Cell-Cell Fusion Mediated by Viruses and HERV-Derived Fusogens in Cancer Initiation and Progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prevention and control of COVID-19 in megacities is under large pressure because of tens of millions and high-density populations The majority of epidemic prevention and control policies implemented focused on travel restrictions, which severely affected urban mobility during the epidemic Considering the impacts of epidemic and associated control policies, this study analyzes the relationship between COVID-19, travel of residents, Point of Interest (POI), and social activities from the perspective of taxi travel First, changes in the characteristics of taxi trips at different periods were analyzed Next, the relationship between POIs and taxi travels was established by the Geographic Information System (GIS) method, and the spatial lag model (SLM) was introduced to explore the changes in taxi travel driving force Then, a social activities recovery level evaluation model was proposed based on the taxi travel datasets to evaluate the recovery of social activities The results demonstrated that the number of taxi trips dropped sharply, and the travel speed, travel time, and spatial distribution of taxi trips had been significantly influenced during the epidemic period The spatial correlation between taxi trips was gradually weakened after the outbreak of the epidemic, and the consumption travel demand of people significantly decreased while the travel demand for community life increased dramatically The evaluation score of social activity is increased from 8 12 to 74 43 during the post-epidemic period, which may take 3-6 months to be fully recovered as a normal period Results and models proposed in this study may provide references for the optimization of epidemic control policies and recovery of public transport in megacities during the post-epidemic period","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on urban mobility during post-epidemic period in megacities: from the perspectives of taxi travel and social vitality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To investigate dental students' perceptions and concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, their coping strategies and support resources, and their perceived stress levels.

We and others have shown that OSA was associated with diabetes-related microvascular complications in patients with T2D in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies and that compliance with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduced the progression of microvascular complications. Hence, we hypothesised that adequate CPAP reduces the development of microvascular complication in patients with T2D. METHODS: SLEEP T2D is a cohort study with embedded feasibility, open-label, parallel-arm, randomised control trial (RCT) over 2 years. The primary aim is the feasibility of conducting a definitive RCT assessing the impact of CPAP on chronic kidney disease and other microvascular complications in patients with T2D. The main parameters are to assess willingness of participants to be randomised, follow-up rates, CPAP adherence/compliance, to optimise the choice of outcome measures for a substantive trial, and to identify the parameters for sample size calculations. The secondary aims of the study are related to the impact of CPAP, sleep-related disorders, and sleep chronotype on a variety of diabetes-related end points. The study participants were recruited from the T2D services in multiple NHS trusts across England. The main exclusion criteria for the cohort study are as follows: T1D, eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m(2), known OSA, active malignancy or chronic kidney disease from reasons other than diabetes, pregnancy, professional drivers, and a history of falling asleep whilst driving within last 2 years. The main exclusion criteria from the RCT were as follows: Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index < 10 and Epworth Sleepiness Score  11. Study participants were extensively phenotyped clinically and biochemically. The OSA diagnosis was based on multichannel portable device (ApneaLink Air(TM), Resmed). DISCUSSION: The feasibility RCT will help us design the future RCT to assess the impact of CPAP on diabetes-related microvascular complications. The cohort study will generate preliminary data regarding the impact of sleep quality, duration, and chronotype on diabetes-related outcomes which could lead to further mechanistic and interventional studies.

Many have since resumed services with an emphasis on catch-up vaccinations to reach children with missed vaccinations. This paper evaluated immunization disruptions during Indias March-May 2020 lockdown and the extent to which subsequent catch-up efforts reversed them in Rajasthan, India. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, we conducted phone surveys to collect immunization details for 2,144 children that turned one year old between January and October 2020. We used logistic regressions to compare differences in immunization timeliness and completed first-year immunization status among children that were due immunizations just before (unexposed), during (heavily exposed), and after (post-exposure) the lockdown. Results: Relative to unexposed children, heavily exposed children were significantly less likely to be immunized at or before 9 months (OR 0.550; 95%CI 0.367-0.824; p=0.004), but more likely to be immunized at 10-12 months (OR 1.761; 95%CI 1.196-2.591; p=0.004). They were also less likely to have completed their key first-year immunizations (OR 0.624; 95%CI 0.478-0.816; p=0.001) by the time of survey. In contrast, post-exposure children showed no difference in timeliness or completed first-year immunizations relative to unexposed children, and their immunization coverage was 6.9pp above heavily exposed children despite their younger age. Declines in immunization coverage were larger among children in households that were poorer, less educated, lower caste, and residing in COVID red zones, although subgroup comparisons were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Disruptions to immunization services resulted in children missing immunization during the lockdown, but catch-up efforts after it was eased ensured many children were reached at later ages. Nevertheless, catch-up was incomplete and children due their immunizations during the lockdown remained less likely to be fully immunized 4-5 months after it lifted, even as younger cohorts due immunizations in June or later returned to pre-lockdown schedules.","output":"COVID-19 RELATED IMMUNIZATION DISRUPTIONS IN RAJASTHAN, INDIA: A RETROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, one of the main causes of non-communicable disease as a cause of death every year is stroke.

Participants will be randomly allocated into one of four treatment arms: (1) aerobic exercise and health behaviour support, (2) aerobic exercise and no health behaviour support, (3) stretching-toning and health behaviour support, and (4) stretching-toning and no health behaviour support. The aerobic exercise intervention will consist of three supervised walking/jogging sessions per week for 6 months, whereas the stretching-toning control intervention will consist of three supervised stretching-toning sessions per week also for 6 months. Following the exercise interventions, participants will receive either 1 year of ongoing telephone behavioural support or no telephone support. The primary aim is to determine the independent effect of aerobic exercise on a cognitive composite score in participants allocated to this intervention compared to participants allocated to the stretching-toning group. The secondary aims are to examine the effects of aerobic exercise on a number of secondary outcomes and determine whether aerobic exercise-related changes persist after a 1-year behavioural support programme (at 18 months). DISCUSSION: This study will address knowledge gaps regarding the underlying mechanisms of the pro-cognitive effects of exercise by examining the potential mediating factors, including cerebrovascular/physiological, neuroimaging, sleep, and genetic factors that will provide novel biologic evidence on how aerobic exercise can prevent declines in cognition with ageing.

We evaluated 63 patients who achieved VBAC between January 2014 and August 2020. In addition, an online survey with 41 open and closed questions assessed the participants' opinion regarding VBAC in Romania. The results are summarized and discussed. The results revealed that VBAC rates were under 1%. The main observed complications that followed VBAC were postpartum hemorrhage (15.8%), and uterine atony (7.93%), while the most frequent types of lesions encountered after VBAC were cervical tear (12.6%), followed by labial fissure (9.5%) and vaginal tear (7.9%). The patient's confidence in the health care system is low, and many women decide to try TOLAC at home.

Farm management measures and sustainable use of anthelmintics can, in principle, effectively control trematode infection in livestock and reduce the rate of developing anthelmintic resistance. Previously, we designed an environmental DNA (eDNA) assay to identify a common trematode intermediate host, the freshwater snail Galba truncatula, in water sources to measure specific trematode infection risk areas on pasture-land. To improve this procedure, we now report a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to identify G. truncatula eDNA. METHODS: A LAMP assay was designed and optimised (e.g. temperature, time duration and primer concentration) to identify G. truncatula DNA. The ability of the LAMP assay to target G. truncatula DNA was identified, and LAMP assay limit of detection was investigated in comparison to conventional PCR. In the field, 48 water samples were collected from stream, ditch and water pool habitats in four locations at two Aberystwyth University farms over a seven week period to investigate the applicability of the LAMP assay for use on eDNA samples, in comparison to conventional PCR. RESULTS: The LAMP assay delivered detectable results in 30 min at 63 C. The assay discriminated between G. truncatula DNA and non-target DNA, presenting a level of DNA detection comparable to conventional PCR. No significant difference was found between the ability of the LAMP and PCR assay to identify G. truncatula eDNA in water samples. Kappa coefficient analysis revealed a moderate level of agreement between LAMP and PCR assays. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the LAMP assay can detect G. truncatula eDNA in a simple and rapid manner. The LAMP assay may become a valuable tool to determine optimum pasture management for trematode parasite control.

However, if Long COVID pertains to children as well is not yet clear. Methods An anonymous, online survey was developed by an organization of parents of children suffering from persisting symptoms since initial infection. Parents were asked to report signs and symptoms, physical activity and mental health issues. Only children with symptoms persisting for more than four weeks were included. Results 510 children were included (56.3% females) infected between January 2020 and January 2021. At their initial COVID-19 infection, 22 (4.3%) children were hospitalized. Overall, children had persisting COVID-19 for a mean of 8.2 months (SD 3.9). Most frequent symptoms were: Tiredness and weakness (444 patients, 87.1% of sample), Fatigue (410, 80.4%), Headache (401, 78.6%), Abdominal pain (387, 75.9%), Muscle and joint pain (309, 60.6%), Post-exertional malaise (274, 53.7%), rash (267, 52.4%). 484 (94.9%) children had had at least four symptoms. 129 (25.3%) children have suffered constant COVID-19 infection symptoms, 252 (49.4%) have had periods of apparent recovery and then symptoms returning, and 97 (19.0%) had a prolonged period of wellness followed by symptoms. Only 51 (10.0%) children have returned to previous levels of physical activity. Parents reported a significant prevalence of Neuropsychiatric symptoms. Conclusions Our study provides further evidence on Long COVID in children. Symptoms like fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain, rashes and heart palpitations, and mental health issues like lack of concentration and short memory problems, were particularly frequent and confirm previous observations, suggesting that they may characterize this condition.

Their realisation would contribute towards minimising over-reliance on fossil fuels, improving air quality, reducing carbon footprints and enhancing overall energy security. Alkane gases (propane, butane and isobutane) are efficient and clean-burning fuels. They are established globally within the transportation industry and are used for domestic heating and cooking, non-greenhouse gas refrigerants and as aerosol propellants. As no natural biosynthetic routes to short chain alkanes have been discovered, de novo pathways have been engineered. These pathways incorporate one of two enzymes, either aldehyde deformylating oxygenase or fatty acid photodecarboxylase, to catalyse the final step that leads to gas formation. These new pathways are derived from established routes of fatty acid biosynthesis, reverse -oxidation for butanol production, valine biosynthesis and amino acid degradation. Single-step production of alkane gases in vivo is also possible, where one recombinant biocatalyst can catalyse gas formation from exogenously supplied short-chain fatty acid precursors. This review explores current progress in bio-alkane gas production, and highlights the potential for implementation of scalable and sustainable commercial bioproduction hubs.","output":"Engineering nature for gaseous hydrocarbon production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has been recommended for the treatment of nonminor ischemic stroke by national and international guidelines, but cost-effectiveness evidence has been generated for only a few countries using heterogeneous evaluation methods. We estimate the cost-effectiveness of MT across 32 European countries. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of MT compared with standard care over a 5-year time horizon. Patients with ischemic stroke eligible for MT were identified from 2017 country-specific incidence data. A societal perspective was adopted, including health, social, and informal care costs, and productivity losses. Model outcomes were expressed as quality-adjusted life years. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of findings. RESULTS: We identified 267 514 ischemic stroke cases that were eligible for MT treatment across 32 European countries. MT was found to be more effective and cheaper than standard care in two-thirds of the countries (21/32) and cost-effective in all but one country (Bulgaria). Across Europe, the intervention was estimated to produce over 101 327 additional quality-adjusted life years (95% uncertainty interval, 65 180C149 085) and cost savings of $981 million (868 million, 95% uncertainty interval, ?1544 to 2564) and of $1.7 billion (1.5 billion, 95% uncertainty interval, ?1.2 to 3.6) in health and social care and societal costs, respectively.

In Rwanda, national regulations to reduce COVID-19 altered population mobility and resource allocations. This study evaluated epidemiological trends and care among injured patients preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali (CHUK) in Kigali, Rwanda. METHODS: This prospective interrupted cross-sectional study enrolled injured adult patients (15 years) presenting to the CHUK emergency department (ED) from January 27th-March 21st (pre-COVID-19 period) and June 1st-28th (intra-COVID-19 period). Trained study personnel continuously collected standardized data on enrolled participants through the first six-hours of ED care. The Kampala Trauma Score (KTS) was calculated as a metric of injury severity. Case characteristics prior to and during the pandemic were compared, statistical differences were assessed using (2) or Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Data were collected from 409 pre-COVID-19 and 194 intra-COVID-19 cases. Median age was 32, with a male predominance (74.3%). Road traffic injuries (RTI) were the most common injury mechanism pre-COVID-19 (47.8%) and intra-COVID-19 (53.6%) (p = 0.27). There was a significant increase in the number of transfer cases during the intra-COVID-19 period (52.1%) versus pre-COVID-19 (41.3%) (p = 0.01). KTS was significantly lower among intra-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.04), indicating higher severity of presentation. In the intra-COVID-19 period, there was a significant increase in the number of surgery consultations (40.7%) versus pre-COVID-19 (26.7%) (p < 0.001). The number of hospital admissions increased from 35.5% pre-COVID-19 to 46.4% intra-COVID-19 (p = 0.01). There was no significant mortality difference pre-COVID-19 as compared to the intra-COVID-19 period among injured patients (p = 0.76). CONCLUSION: Emergency injury care showed increased injury burden, inpatient admission and resource requirements during the pandemic period. This suggests the spectrum of disease may be more severe and that greater resources for injury management may continue to be needed during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Rwanda and other similar settings.","output":"Injury burdens and care delivery in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kigali, Rwanda: A prospective interrupted cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, the recently discovered SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virus has afflicted >6.9 million people worldwide and disrupted the global economy.

However, genetic alterations occur every now and then during the course of genome duplication. In order to repair these genetic defects and lesions, nature has devised several repair pathways which function promptly to prevent the cell from accumulating permanent mutations. These repair mechanisms seem to be significantly impacted by posttranslational modifications of proteins like phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Protein ubiquitination is emerging as a critical regulatory mechanism of DNA damage response. Non-proteolytic, proteasome-independent functions of ubiquitin involving monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination of DNA repair proteins contribute significantly to the signaling of DNA repair pathways. In this paper, we will particularly highlight the work on ubiquitin-mediated signaling in the repair processes involving the Fanconi anemia pathway, translesional synthesis, nucleotide excision repair, and repair of double-strand breaks. We will also discuss the role of ubiquitin ligases in regulating checkpoint mechanisms, the role of deubiquitinating enzymes, and the growing possibilities of therapeutic intervention in this ubiquitin-conjugation system.","output":"Central Role of Ubiquitination in Genome Maintenance: DNA Replication and Damage Repair"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The higher education (HE) sector has undergone drastic changes due to the preventive measures needed to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic since March 2020. As a result, most traditional classroom teaching had to move to synchronous or asynchronous online instruction. In the post-Covid-19 era, institutions will, at least partially, go back to teaching in person, and blended teaching (BT) practices will conceivably become the true norm. Although BT practices have been employed and researched extensively over the past two decades, a deeper or more extensive blending of courses will still be a major switch for many teachers and students. More than ever, it is vital for instructors not just to understand how to blend but also to understand the evolution of BT practices and the choices made to arrive at sustainable practices that positively impact the learning experience. In this article, the authors aim to elaborate on the contexts which stimulate or provide a catalyst for the use and subsequent growth of sustainable BT practices in HE. A mixed approach of inductive and deductive thematic analysis is used to analyze 26 interviews of instructors, considered either as pioneers or experienced BT adopters in six HE institutions across Europe (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, UK). This preliminary analysis revealed that the identified over-arching themes, the drivers and enablers that promote BT, are dynamic in nature and vary in diverse contexts.

METHODS: In the present study, we developed new standalone software to easily handle a pipeline for accurate calculation of the CL scale for the five currently available amyloid PET tracers-11 C-PiB, 18 F-florbetapir, 18 F-flutemetamol, 18 F-florbetaben, and 18 F-NAV4694. This pipeline requires reorientation and coregistration of PET and MRI, anatomic standardization of coregistered PET to a standardized space using a warping parameter for coregistered MRI, application of standard volumes of interest (VOIs) to the warped PET, calculation of the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) for the target VOIs, and finally conversion of the SUVR to the CL scale. The PET data for these tracers were collected from the publicly available Global Alzheimer's Association Interactive Network (GAAIN) repository. We also developed software to map Z-scores for the statistical comparison of a patient's PET data with a negative control database obtained from young healthy controls in the GAAIN repository. RESULTS: When whole cerebellum or whole cerebellum plus brainstem was chosen as the reference area, an excellent correlation was found between the CL scale calculated by this software and the CL scale published by GAAIN. There were no significant differences in the detection performance of significant amyloid accumulation using Z-score mapping between each 18 F-labeled tracer and 11 C-PiB. The cutoff CL values providing the most accurate detection of regional amyloid positivity in Z-score mapping were 11.8, 14.4, 14.7, 15.6, and 17.7 in the posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus, frontal cortex, temporal cortex, parietal cortex, and striatum, respectively.

We evaluated the effect of sex hormone on prevalence and clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Retrospective cohort study was performed using the nationwide claims data of 5061 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in South Korea, from January 20 to April 8, 2020. COVID-19 was most prevalent in women of the 20-39 age group (1250 [44.14%]). Men were more likely to receive oxygen therapy (144 [6.46%] vs 131 [4.63%], P=0.004), be admitted to the intensive care unit (60 [2.69%] vs 53 [1.87%], P=0.049), and stay longer after admission to the intensive care unit (19.7011.80 vs 14.759.23, P=0.016). However, there was no significant difference in mortality rates between men and women. In multivariable Cox analysis, independent risk factors for mortality were older age and underlying co-morbidities, rather than sex. To evaluate the effect of HRT among women, subgroup analysis was implemented using age-matched case-control data with a 1:3 ratio of females receiving HRT to those who did not. HRT did not have statistically significant association with clinical outcomes.

RESULTS The NBS programme screened 252 081 newborn infants from 1st August 2018 to 31st January 2021. Using an NBS pilot test protocol, 21 infants were diagnostically confirmed with SMA. The NBS pilot test protocol had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity greater than 99.9%, false-positive rate less than 0.001%, a false-negative rate of 0%, and positive predictive value of 95.5%. A severe phenotype was predicted on the basis of two copies of SMN2 in 57.2% of newborn infants screening positive for SMA. Clinical signs consistent with SMA were evident in 6 out of 21 screen-positive newborn infants within the first 4 weeks of life. A multidisciplinary team establishing strong partnerships across clinical and laboratory staff was key to implementation.

One year ago, a general guideline on the clinical evaluation of antimicrobial agents to treat respiratory infections was drafted in Japanese, leaving scope for critical discussion, and this has been translated into English, as there were no major changes. In this report, respiratory infections have been discussed under the headings acute respiratory tract infection and pneumonia and acute exacerbation of chronic pulmonary diseases. Standardized criteria were set for the assessment of severity of infection and effectiveness of the antimicrobial agent in question. Severity was evaluated on the basis of a combined assessment of the severity of infection and severity of the clinical condition of the patients. Clinical effectiveness of the antimicrobial agent used was evaluated on the basis of clinical outcome as well as microbiological outcome of the trial. Body temperature, local pain, cough, change in sputum quality, peripheral white blood cell count, C-reactive protein level, and chest radiograph were used as the parameters for the evaluation. To maintain the quality of specimens to be examined, Geckler's classification of specimens was used. This report was constructed based on the analysis of large amounts of material collected over the years, incorporating internal and external factors concerning the present evaluation methods. The newly suggested standardized criteria for clinical evaluation of the new antimicrobial drugs are expected to be practiced properly hereupon and subjected to further improvement if necessary.","output":"Clinical evaluation methods for new antimicrobial agents to treat respiratory infections: Report of the Committee for the Respiratory System, Japan Society of Chemotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent global pandemic due to COVID-19 is caused by a type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2). Despite rigorous efforts worldwide to control the spread and human to human transmission of this virus, incidence and death due to COVID-19 continue to rise. Several drugs have been tested for treatment of COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine. While a number of studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine can prolong QT interval, potentially increasing risk of ventricular arrhythmias and Torsade de Pointes, its effects on immune cell function have not been extensively examined. In the current review, an overview of coronaviruses, viral entry and pathogenicity, immunity upon coronavirus infection, and current therapy options for COVID-19 are briefly discussed. Further based on preclinical studies, we provide evidences that i) hydroxychloroquine impairs autophagy, which leads to accumulation of damaged/oxidized cytoplasmic constituents and interferes with cellular homeostasis, ii) this impaired autophagy in part reduces antigen processing and presentation to immune cells and iii) inhibition of endosome-lysosome system acidification by hydroxychloroquine not only impairs the phagocytosis process, but also potentially alters pulmonary surfactant in the lungs. Therefore, it is likely that hydroxychloroquine treatment may in fact impair host immunity in response to SARS-CoV-2, especially in elderly patients or those with co-morbidities. Further, this review provides a rationale for developing and selecting antiviral drugs and includes a brief review of traditional strategies combined with new drugs to combat COVID-19.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine can potentially interfere with immune function in COVID-19 patients: Mechanisms and insights"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics and viral shedding kinetics of asymptomatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To conduct this study, all studies related to the topic under discussion during 2020-2021 were reviewed by systematic search in internationally available databases including Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Finally, 42 completely related studies were selected to extract the results. RESULTS: The prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) varies in different parts of the world and has reached almost 70%. The results showed that, in general, a high percentage of COVID-19 patients had symptoms of renal dysfunction at the time of hospitalization, and the most important of these symptoms were proteinuria, hematuria, and increased serum creatinine. Based on the results, it can be said that AKI most likely occurs early in the disease and in parallel with lung damage. So far, various drugs have been used to control or treat COVID-19 and reduce inflammation in patients. Regardless of their usefulness, some of these drugs may adversely affect kidney function and damage the kidneys. The study results show that chronic kidney disease (CKD) in COVID-19 patients plays a minor role in renal replacement therapy (RRT), and the highest impact on the need for RRT is COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that one of the major negative effects of COVID-19 on the human body is kidney damage, among which acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most important one. In addition, the prevalence of AKI due to COVID-19 varies widely around the world.

PLpro acts as a protease and processes the large coronavirus polyprotein for virus replication. PLpro also functions as both a deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating (deISG) enzyme and removes ubiquitin (Ub) and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from cellular proteins. Both DUB and deISG activities are implicated in suppressing innate immune responses; however, the precise role of each activity in this process is still unclear due in part to the difficulties in separating each activity. In this study, we determine the first structure of MERS PLpro in complex with the full-length human ISG15 to a resolution of 2.3 ?. This structure and available structures of MERS PLpro-Ub complexes were used as molecular guides to design PLpro mutants that lack either or both DUB/deISG activities. We tested 13 different PLpro mutants for protease, DUB, and deISG activitites using fluorescence-based assays. Results show that we can selectively modulate DUB activity at amino acid positions 1649 and 1653 while mutation of Val1691 or His1652 of PLpro to a positive charged residue completely impairs both DUB/deISG activities. These mutant enzymes will provide new functional tools for delineating the importance of DUB versus deISG activity in virus-infected cells and may serve as potential candidates for attenuating the MERS virus in vivo for modified vaccine design efforts.","output":"Decoupling deISGylating and deubiquitinating activities of the MERS virus papain-like protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AIMS: The current gold standard for stem cell product potency assessment, the colony-forming unit (CFU) assay, delivers results that are difficult to standardize and requires a substantial amount of time (up to 14 days) for cellular growth. Recently, the authors developed a rapid (<24 h) flow cytometry assay based on the measurement of intracellular phosphorylated STAT5 (pSTAT5) in CD34+ cord blood stem and progenitor cells in response to IL-3 stimulation. The present work presents a novel adaptation of the protocol for use with autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) and a performance comparison with the CFU assay. METHODS: The flow cytometry intracellular staining assay was optimized for PBSCs, and patient samples were analyzed using the PBSC-IL-3-pSTAT5 and CFU assays. Warming events were also simulated to emulate impaired potency products. RESULTS: Optimization led to minor protocol adjustments, such as removal of the red blood cell lysis step, the addition of a formaldehyde fixation step and an increase in anticoagulant concentration. The PBSC-IL-3-pSTAT5 assay discriminated between normal and impaired samples and identified 100% (18 of 18) of the impaired samples, thus showing better specificity than the CFU assay. CONCLUSIONS: The updated IL-3-pSTAT5 potency assay has several important advantages, such as accelerating the release of autologous stem cell products and enabling the detection of potentially impaired products. The assay could also be used to rapidly assess the potency of any cryopreserved allogeneic stem cell product, such as those processed during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","output":"Rapid potency assessment of autologous peripheral blood stem cells by intracellular flow cytometry: the PBSC-IL-3-pSTAT5 assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global smartphone brands were progressing aggressively over time.

Individuals from countries with socioeconomic inequalities may be at increased risk for mental health disorders. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of depression, anxiety, and their comorbidity among essential workers in Brazil and Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web survey was conducted between April and May 2020 in both countries. The main outcome was a positive screening for depression only, anxiety only, or both. Lifestyle was measured using a lifestyle multidimensional scale adapted for the COVID-19 pandemic (Short Multidimensional Inventory Lifestyle EvaluationCConfinement). A multinomial logistic regression model was performed to evaluate the factors associated with depression, anxiety, and the presence of both conditions. RESULTS: From the 22,786 individuals included in the web survey, 3745 self-reported to be essential workers. Overall, 8.3% (n=311), 11.6% (n=434), and 27.4% (n=1027) presented positive screenings for depression, anxiety, and both, respectively. After adjusting for confounding factors, the multinomial model showed that an unhealthy lifestyle increased the likelihood of depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.00, 95% CI 2.72-5.87), anxiety (AOR 2.39, 95% CI 1.80-3.20), and both anxiety and depression (AOR 8.30, 95% CI 5.90-11.7). Living in Brazil was associated with increased odds of depression (AOR 2.89, 95% CI 2.07-4.06), anxiety (AOR 2.81, 95%CI 2.11-3.74), and both conditions (AOR 5.99, 95% CI 4.53-7.91). CONCLUSIONS: Interventions addressing lifestyle may be useful in dealing with symptoms of common mental disorders during the strain imposed among essential workers by the COVID-19 pandemic. Essential workers who live in middle-income countries with higher rates of inequality may face additional challenges. Ensuring equitable treatment and support may be an important challenge ahead, considering the possible syndemic effect of the social determinants of health.","output":"Depression, Anxiety, and Lifestyle Among Essential Workers: A Web Survey From Brazil and Spain During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Influenza vaccination prevents people from influenza-related diseases and thereby mitigates the burden on national health systems when COVID-19 circulates and public health measures controlling respiratory viral infections are relaxed However, it is challenging to maintain influenza vaccine services as the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to disrupt vaccination programmes in many countries during the 2020/21 winter We summarise available recommendations and strategies on influenza vaccination, specifically the changes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic Methods We searched websites and databases of national and international public health agencies (focusing on Europe, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa) We also contacted key influenza immunization focal points and experts in respective countries and organizations including WHO and ECDC Results Available global and regional guidance emphasises the control of COVID-19 infection in immunisation settings by implementing multiple measures, such as physical distancing, hand hygiene practice, appropriate use of personal protective equipment by health care workers and establishing separate vaccination sessions for medically vulnerable people The guidance also emphasises using alternative models or settings (eg, outdoor areas and pharmacies) for vaccine delivery, communication strategies and developing registry and catch-up programmes to achieve high coverage Several novel national strategies have been adopted, such as combining influenza vaccination with other medical visits and setting up outdoor and drive through vaccination clinics Several Southern Hemisphere countries have increased influenza vaccine coverage substantially for the 2020 influenza season Most of the countries included in our review have planned a universal or near universal influenza vaccination for health care workers, or have made influenza vaccination for health care workers mandatory Australia has requested that all workers and visitors in long term care facilities receive influenza vaccine The UK has planned to expand the influenza programme to provide free influenza vaccine for the first time to all adults 50-64 years of age, people on the shielded patient list and their household members and children in the first year of secondary school South Africa has additionally prioritised people with hypertension for influenza vaccination Conclusions This review of influenza vaccination guidance and strategies should support strategy development on influenza vaccination in the context of COVID-19","output":"Influenza vaccination strategies for 2020-21 in the context of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amid efforts to care for the large number of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), there has been considerable speculation about whether the lung injury seen in these patients is different than acute respiratory distress syndrome from other causes One idea that has garnered considerable attention, particularly on social media and in free open-access medicine, is the notion that lung injury due to COVID-19 is more similar to high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) Drawing on this concept, it has also been proposed that treatments typically employed in the management of HAPE and other forms of acute altitude illness - pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide - should be considered for COVID-19 Despite some similarities in clinical features between the two entities, such as hypoxemia, radiographic opacities, and altered lung compliance, the pathophysiological mechanisms of HAPE and lung injury due to COVID-19 are fundamentally different, and the entities cannot be viewed as equivalent Although of high utility in the management of HAPE and acute mountain sickness, systemically delivered pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19, as they carry the risk of multiple adverse consequences, including worsened ventilation-perfusion matching, impaired carbon dioxide transport, systemic hypotension, and increased work of breathing","output":"COVID-19 lung injury and high-altitude pulmonary edema.

To describe excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Guatemala during 2020 by week, age, sex, and place of death. Methods. We used mortality data from 2015 to 2020, gathered through the vital registration system of Guatemala. We calculated weekly mortality rates, overall and stratified by age, sex, and place of death. We fitted a generalized additive model to calculate excess deaths, adjusting for seasonality and secular trends and compared excess deaths to the official COVID-19 mortality count. Results. We found an initial decline of 26% in mortality rates during the first weeks of the pandemic in 2020, compared with 2015 to 2019. These declines were sustained through October 2020 for the population younger than 20 years and for deaths in public spaces and returned to normal from July onward in the population aged 20 to 39 years. We found a peak of 73% excess mortality in mid-July, especially in the population aged 40 years or older.

We present a rapid meta-analysis of ongoing, completed, or discontinued RCTs on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment for any COVID-19 patients (protocol: https://osf.io/QESV4/ ). We systematically identified unpublished RCTs (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Cochrane COVID-registry up to June 11, 2020), and published RCTs (PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv up to October 16, 2020). All-cause mortality has been extracted (publications/preprints) or requested from investigators and combined in random-effects meta-analyses, calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), separately for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. Prespecified subgroup analyses include patient setting, diagnostic confirmation, control type, and publication status. Sixty-three trials were potentially eligible. We included 14 unpublished trials (1308 patients) and 14 publications/preprints (9011 patients). Results for hydroxychloroquine are dominated by RECOVERY and WHO SOLIDARITY, two highly pragmatic trials, which employed relatively high doses and included 4716 and 1853 patients, respectively (67% of the total sample size). The combined OR on all-cause mortality for hydroxychloroquine is 1.11 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.20; I2 = 0%; 26 trials; 10,012 patients) and for chloroquine 1.77 (95%CI: 0.15, 21.13, I2 = 0%; 4 trials; 307 patients).

We determined whether COVID-19 has resulted in delays in stroke presentation and affected the delivery of acute stroke services in a comprehensive stroke center in Hong Kong. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with transient ischemic attack and stroke admitted via the acute stroke pathway of Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, during the first 60 days since the first diagnosed COVID-19 case in Hong Kong (COVID-19: January 23, 2020CMarch 24, 2020). We compared the stroke onset to hospital arrival (onset-to-door) time and timings of inpatient stroke pathways with patients admitted during the same period in 2019 (preCCOVID-19: January 23, 2019CMarch 24, 2019). RESULTS: Seventy-three patients in COVID-19 were compared with 89 patients in preCCOVID-19. There were no significant differences in age, sex, vascular risk factors, nor stroke severity between the 2 groups (P>0.05). The median stroke onset-to-door time was 1-hour longer in COVID-19 compared with preCCOVID-19 (154 versus 95 minutes, P=0.12), and the proportion of individuals with onset-to-door time within 4.5 hours was significantly lower (55% versus 72%, P=0.024). Significantly fewer cases of transient ischemic attack presented to the hospital during COVID-19 (4% versus 16%, P=0.016), despite no increase in referrals to the transient ischemic attack clinic. Inpatient stroke pathways and treatment time metrics nevertheless did not differ between the 2 groups (P>0.05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: During the early containment phase of COVID-19, we noted a prolongation in stroke onset to hospital arrival time and a significant reduction in individuals arriving at the hospital within 4.5 hours and presenting with transient ischemic attack.

We demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in human iPSC-derived neurons and that infection shows limited antiviral and inflammatory responses but increased activation of EIF2 signaling following infection as determined by RNA sequencing. Intranasal infection of K18 human ACE2 transgenic mice (K18-hACE2) with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in lung pathology associated with viral replication and immune cell infiltration. In addition, similar to 50% of infected mice exhibited CNS infection characterized by wide-spread viral replication in neurons accompanied by increased expression of chemokine (Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Ccl2, Ccl5 and Ccl19) and cytokine (Ifn-lambda and Tnf-alpha) transcripts associated with microgliosis and a neuroinflammatory response consisting primarily of monocytes/macrophages. Micro-glia depletion via administration of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor, PLX5622, in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice did not affect survival or viral replication but did result in dampened expression of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine transcripts and a reduction in monocyte/macrophage infiltration. These results argue that microglia are dispensable in terms of controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication in in the K18-hACE2 model but do contribute to an inflammatory response through expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Collectively, these findings contribute to previous work dem-onstrating the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect neurons as well as emphasizing the potential use of the K18-hACE2 model to study immunological and neuropathological aspects related to SARS-CoV-2-induced neurologic disease. IMPORTANCE Understanding the immunological mechanisms contributing to both host defense and disease following viral infection of the CNS is of critical importance given the increasing number of viruses that are capable of infecting and replicating within the nervous system. With this in mind, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of microglia in aiding in host defense following experimental infection of the central nervous system (CNS) of K18-hACE2 with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Neurologic symptoms that range in severity are common in COVID-19 patients and understanding immune responses that contribute to restricting neurologic disease can provide important insight into better understanding consequences associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection of the CNS.","output":"Microglia Do Not Restrict SARS-CoV-2 Replication following Infection of the Central Nervous System of K18-Human ACE2 Transgenic Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to investigate students views of model evaluation through the lens of personal epistemology. We developed an integrated analytical framework by combining a developmental framework, including absolutist, multiplist, and evaluatist, with a multi-dimensional framework, including limits of knowing, certainty of knowing, and criteria of knowing. Furthermore, we examined the potential influence of the question contexts and the students grade levels. A total of 188 secondary school students were surveyed. Students answered two sets of model evaluation questions based on two scientific contexts. After reading the information about the two models, the students had to choose from three epistemic assumptions and then provide written justifications explaining their choice of assumptions. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted for the multiple-choice questions and the written responses. In both contexts there were higher percentages of 11th-grade students choosing the evaluatist assumptions than the eighth-grade students. For students choosing multiplist and evaluatist assumptions, the 11th-grade students were more likely than the eighth-grade students to think in terms of pragmatic and evidential criteria as the criteria of knowing. Different contexts of the questions evoked different views of model evaluation particularly regarding the limits of knowing. Four additional categories of epistemic levels also emerged from the data.

In chickens, a single Mx protein variant, S631N, has been suggested to possess antiviral activity. However, the impact of this variant on chicken Mx (chMx) protein structure and conformation has not been investigated. Hence, in this study, we applied computational methods such as molecular modeling, molecular dynamic simulation, inter domain motion and residue networks to examine the structure and dynamic behavior of wild-type and mutant chMx. At first, we built 3-dimensional structural models for both wild-type and mutant chMx proteins, which revealed that the structural organization of chMx was similar to that of human Mx proteins. Subsequently, molecular dynamics simulations revealed that angle variation around the hinge1 region led to the different stalk domain conformations between the wild-type and mutant chMx proteins. Domain motion analysis further suggested that the conformational differences in the loop region surrounded by the mutant residue may lead to an inclined stalk domain conformation in the mutant compared to the wild-type protein. In addition, we performed betweenness centrality analysis from residue interaction networks, to identify the crucial residues for intramolecular signal flow in chMx. The results of this study provided information on the differences in structure and dynamics between wild-type and mutant chMx, which may aid in understanding the structural features of the S631N mutant, that may be associated with chMx protein antiviral activity.

We identified dental-related ER visits using the diagnosis codes for non-traumatic dental-related conditions and summarized the frequency, rates, and cumulative total charges of the ER visits. The results show that approximately 30 thousand ER visits between 2016 and 2020 had a dental-related diagnosis. Sixty-seven percent of them had it as a principal diagnosis, amounting to USD 38.7 million total charges over the five years.

Under nonstress conditions, Sis1 is concentrated in the nucleoplasm, where it promotes Hsp70 binding to the transcription factor Hsf1, repressing the HSR. Upon heat shock, Sis1 forms an interconnected network with other proteostasis factors that spans the nucleolus and the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. We propose that localization of Sis1 to this network directs Hsp70 activity away from Hsf1 in the nucleoplasm, leaving Hsf1 free to induce the HSR.

In our study, we present a prospective evaluation of patients affected by solid and liquid tumors who were affected by COVID19 from the same geographical area and time period. Survival outcomes, prognostic risk factors, and effects of oncological treatments received were analyzed. Methods WAll consecutive oncological patients with age > 18 years old affected by COVID19 (confirmed by pharyngeal PCR test) who were hospitalized in 5 tertiary oncological referral centers in the Catalonia region were included in the study. The recruitment period started from 13/03/2020 to 24/04/2020. Two-hundred thirty-one patients were recruited. Thirty-three percent had hematological malignancies and 67% had solid tumors. The median age was 65 years (range 58-75 years). Female patients were 41%. Twenty-six percent of patients were not considered candidates to intensive care treatments (tracheal intubation) due to their advanced oncological status. Of the hematological cohort, lymphoid malignancies represented 36% of the population, multiple myeloma 20%; acute leukemias 15%; chronic lymphoproliferative diseases 12% and other malignancies 17%. At the time of infection, 11% of patients were receiving steroids (more than 0.5mg/kg/24 hours >15 days), 4% were on active immunosuppressive therapy (calcineurin inhibitors, sirolimus or mycophenolate mofetil) and 5% had grade >3 neutropenia. Most importantly, 61% were on active oncological treatment, 18% were on follow-up, 10% had been diagnosed without having received any treatment. Results At COVID19 diagnosis, 75% of patients had a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) < 24% and 63% had fever. Only 16% had cough,16 % had mucous secretion and 12% had dyspnea. All the other symptoms (myalgia, diarrhea, anosmia, ageusia, fatigue, headache) had an incidence < 10%. Chest X-ray was abnormal in 60% of cases.

WThe overall mortality rate was 26% with a non-significant difference between hematological (32%) and oncological (23%) patients (p-value = 0.23, figure 1). A significant difference was observed between patients who were candidates to intensive care treatments (21.5%) and not candidates (42.6%)(p-value = 0.0038, figure 1). The following risk factors were associated with decreased survival on multivariate analysis: having the oncological disease in progression (HR 3.33, 95%Confidence Interval (CI)= 1.73-6-41, p<0.001); use of steroids (>0.5mg/kg/24 hours) in the last 15 days (HR 3.76; 95%CI=1.69-8.40, p<0.001); age (continuous variable, HR 1.05, 95%CI= 1.01-1-08, p=0.005); grade 4 neutropenia. When considering COVID19 in-hospital treatments, only steroids were associated with a protective effect on survival (HR 0.51, 95%CI=0.27-0.94, p=0.032) while hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab had no significant effect. Severe respiratory insufficiency (defined as use of >50% FiO2 as oxygen support) was present or developed in 46% of patients. On multivariate analysis, the following factors were associated with a higher risk of developing severe respiratory insufficiency: use of steroids (>0.5mg/kg/24 hours) in the last 15 days (HR 2.36; 95%CI=1.12-4.97, p=0.023); age (HR 1.05, 95%CI= 1.01-1-08, p=0.009) and dyspnea at diagnosis (HR 3.95; 95%CI=1.77-8.78, p=0.001). Conclusion WCOVID19 is associated to increased mortality in patients affected by solid and liquid tumors. Being a candidate for intensive care treatments could improve survival while having progressive disease, older age and grade >3 neutropenia were considered negative factors. Interestingly, the use of steroids was associated to reduced survival if received within 15 days before COVID19 diagnosis, while it has protective effect when used as part of COVID19 therapy.

Published results obtained recently at this laboratory show that D. radiodurans submitted to ionizing radiation results in its DNA being shattered into small fragments which, when exposed to a \\"static electric field' (SEF), greatly decreases cell viability. These findings motivated the performing of D. radiodurans exposed to gamma radiation, yet exposed to a different exogenous physical agent, \\"static magnetic fields\\" (SMF). Cells of D. radiodurans [strain D.r. GY 9613 (R1)] in the exponential phase were submitted to 60Co gamma radiation from a gamma cell. Samples were exposed to doses in the interval 0.5-12.5 kGy, while the control samples were kept next to the irradiation setup. Exposures to SMF were carried out with intensities of 0.08 T and 0.8 T delivered by two settings: (a) a device built up at this laboratory with niobium magnets, delivering 0.08 T, and (b) an electromagnet (Walker Scientific) generating static magnetic fields with intensities from 0.1 to 0.8 T. All samples were placed in a bacteriological incubator at 30 C for 48 h, and after incubation, a counting of colony forming units was performed. Two sets of cell surviving data were measured, each in triplicate, obtained in independent experiments. A remarkable similarity between the two data sets is revealed, underscoring reproducibility within the 5% range. Appraisal of raw data shows that exposure of irradiated cells to SMF substantially increases their viability. Data interpretation strongly suggests that the increase of D. radiodurans cell viability is a sole magnetic physical effect, driven by a stochastic process, improving the efficiency of the rejoining of DNA fragments, thus increasing cell viability. A type of cut-off dose is identified at 10 kGy, above which the irradiated cellular system loses recovery and the cell survival mechanism collapses.","output":"Exposure of Deinococcus radiodurans to both static magnetic fields and gamma radiation: observation of cell recuperation effects."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and study aims Gastrointestinal endoscopy, being an aerosol-generating procedure, has the potential to transmit Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the current pandemic. Adequate knowledge is the key to prevention. A survey, perhaps the first, was conducted among Indian endoscopists to assess the impact of Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19 on gastroinestinal endoscopy practice in the country. Methods From April 24 to 28, 2020, an electronic survey (using Google Form) was conducted with 23 questions (single or multiple answers) on: (1) endoscopy practice before the pandemic; (2) knowledge about COVID-19; and (3) its impact on endoscopy practice. Results Responses were received from 375 of 1205 (31.1 %) endoscopists. Most (35.7 %) were young (31C40 years), practicing in corporate multi-speciality hospitals (44.6 %) or independent practice set-up (17.7 %) in metropolitan cities (55.6 %) and urban areas (42.3 %). In most units (75.4 %), fewer than 10 % of procedures performed are endoscopies, as compared to before the pandemic. A reduction in volume of endoscopy related to restriction of the routine procedures by the latest guideline was reported by 86.9 % of respondents. Most are using N95 masks (74.7 %) and/or complete personal protective equipment (PPE, 49.2 %) during endoscopic procedures .

METHODS Sixty patients who underwent MICS were randomized to use either a DLT (Group D, n = 30) or a BB (Group B, n = 29; one failed was omitted). The following data were collected: time of intubation and tube localization; incidence of tube displacement; postoperative sore throat and hoarseness; time of cardiopulmonary bypass; maintenance time for SpO2 < 90% (PaCO2 < 60 mmHg); mean arterial pressure and heart rate; SpO2, PaO2, PaCO2, EtCO2, mean airway pressure, and airway peak pressure; surgeons' satisfaction with anesthesia; and short-term complications. RESULTS The times of intubation and tube localization were significantly longer in Group B than in Group D (P < 0.05). Patients in Group B exhibited significantly lower incidence of tube displacement, postoperative sore throat, and hoarseness when compared with patients in Group D (P < 0.05). Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were significantly lower in Group B than in Group D after tracheal intubation (P < 0.05). The mean airway pressure and airway peak pressure were significantly lower in Group B than in Group D after one-lung ventilation (P < 0.05). SpO2 and PaO2 in Group B were significantly higher than in group D after cardiopulmonary bypass (P < 0.05). No short-term postoperative complications were observed in patients of Groups B and D during 3 month follow-up.

Objective: To determine whether a therapy that increases peripheral blood leukocyte and lymphocyte cell counts leads to clinical improvement in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting and Participants: Between February 18 and April 10, 2020, we conducted an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial at 3 participating centers in China. The main eligibility criteria were pneumonia, a blood lymphocyte cell count of 800 per L (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 0.001) or lower, and no comorbidities. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was confirmed with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. Exposures: Usual care alone, or usual care plus 3 doses of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF, 5 g/kg, subcutaneously at days 0-2). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was the time from randomization to improvement of at least 1 point on a 7-category disease severity score. Results: Of 200 participants, 112 (56%) were men and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 45 (40-55) years. There was random assignment of 100 patients (50%) to the rhG-CSF group and 100 (50%) to the usual care group. Time to clinical improvement was similar between groups (rhG-CSF group median of 12 days (IQR, 10-16 days) vs usual care group median of 13 days (IQR, 11-17 days); hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.95-1.71; P = .06). For secondary end points, the proportion of patients progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, or septic shock was lower in the rhG-CSF group (rhG-CSF group, 2% vs usual care group, 15%; difference, -13%; 95%CI, -21.4% to -5.4%). At 21 days, 2 patients (2%) had died in the rhG-CSF group compared with 10 patients (10%) in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 0.19; 95%CI, 0.04-0.88). At day 5, the lymphocyte cell count was higher in the rhG-CSF group (rhG-CSF group median of 1050/L vs usual care group median of 620/L; Hodges-Lehmann estimate of the difference in medians, 440; 95% CI, 380-490). Serious adverse events, such as sepsis or septic shock, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, occurred in 29 patients (14.5%) in the rhG-CSF group and 42 patients (21%) in the usual care group. Conclusion and Relevance: In preliminary findings from a randomized clinical trial, rhG-CSF treatment for patients with COVID-19 with lymphopenia but no comorbidities did not accelerate clinical improvement, but the number of patients developing critical illness or dying may have been reduced.

This article describes the implementation of centralized nationwide mailed HIV/STI home testing (CareKit). METHODS: The Emory Center for AIDS Research developed CareKit for research study participants to request HIV self-test kits, STI specimen collection kits, and condom/lubricant packs to be shipped to any mailing address in the United States. Sexually transmitted infection kits were customized according to study needs and could include materials to collect whole blood, dried blood spots, urine sample, and rectal and pharyngeal swab samples for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia testing. Specimens were mailed back to a central Clinical Laboratory Improvement AmendmentsCapproved laboratory for testing, and results were returned to participants. RESULTS: CareKit was used by 12 MSM studies and mailed 1132 STI kits to 775 participants between January 2018 and March 2020. Participants returned 507 (45%) STI kits, which included 1594 individual specimens. Eighty-one kits (16%) had at least one positive STI test result: pharyngeal chlamydia (n = 7), pharyngeal gonorrhea (n = 11), rectal chlamydia (n = 15), rectal gonorrhea (n = 12), genital chlamydia (n = 6), genital gonorrhea (n = 1), and syphilis (n = 54).

Before surgery, patients receive local anesthetic, consisting of lidocaine with epinephrine, and remain awake for the entire procedure. The purpose of this review was to investigate the advantages, diverse application, outcomes, cost benefits, use in challenging environments, patient considerations, and contraindications associated with WALANT. METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature on the WALANT technique was conducted. Search terms included: WALANT, wide-awake surgery, no tourniquet, local anesthesia, hand, wrist, cost, and safety. RESULTS: The WALANT technique has proven to be successful for common procedures such as flexor tendon repair, tendon transfer, trigger finger releases, Depuytren disease, and simple bony procedures. Recently, the use of WALANT has expanded to more extensive soft-tissue repair, fracture management, and bony manipulation. Advantages include negating preoperative evaluation and testing for anesthesia clearance, eliminating risk of monitored anesthesia care, removal of anesthesia providers and ancillary staff, significant cost savings, and less waste produced. Intraoperative evaluations can be performed through active patient participation, and postoperative recovery and monitoring time are reduced. WALANT is associated with high patient satisfaction rates and low infection rates.

The enlargement of the transcranial window was performed gradually using the ultrasound directly on the skin of the animal, then against the skull, then through a delimited craniotomy and finally through a complete craniotomy. RESULTS: Our results showed that ultrasound allowed the identification of cerebral ventricles and subarachnoid cisterns, as well as the analysis of real-time monitoring of cerebral blood flow in the main brain arteries of the rat. Comparison with existing methods: Ultrasound is a tool with the potential to identify brain structures and blood vessels. In contrast to MRI, transcranial ultrasound is a fast, non-invasive, well tolerated and low-cost method and can be done at the bedside.

METHODS: Eligible women (N = 39,444) were aged 18 years and received a screening mammogram, diagnostic mammogram, or breast biopsy between January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020, at 7 academic and community breast imaging facilities in North Carolina. Changes in the number of mammography or breast biopsy examinations after March 3, 2020 (the first COVID\\\\19 diagnosis in North Carolina) were evaluated and compared with the expected numbers based on trends between January 1, 2019 and March 2, 2020. Changes in the predicted mean monthly number of examinations were estimated using interrupted time series models. Differences in patient characteristics were tested using least squares means regression. RESULTS: Fewer examinations than expected were received after the pandemic's onset. Maximum reductions occurred in March 2020 for screening mammography (?85.1%; 95% CI, ?100.0%, ?70.0%) and diagnostic mammography (?48.9%; 95% CI, ?71.7%, ?26.2%) and in May 2020 for biopsies (?40.9%; 95% CI, ?57.6%, ?24.3%). The deficit decreased gradually, with no significant difference between observed and expected numbers by July 2020 (diagnostic mammography) and August 2020 (screening mammography and biopsy).

In many cases of complete resection, pneumonectomy is performed. We herein report two techniques in which complete resection with negative margins at the intrapericardial pulmonary vein and left atrium was achieved without pneumonectomy. In the first technique, the groove of the pericardium between the right and left atrium was dissected and an atrial cuff was made in a manner that elongated the intrapericardial pulmonary vein. In the second technique, traction was applied to the atrial cuff, and only the middle lobe vein of the elongated pulmonary vein was resected, to perform atrial cuff plasty. The upper lobe vein and inferior pulmonary vein could be preserved. These techniques of PV elongation and atrial cuff plasty are suitable for both achieving complete resection and lung preservation for lung cancer patients with invasion of the left atrium.","output":"The surgical technique for complete resection of lung cancer invading the intrapericardial pulmonary vein and left atrium."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Preferences of members of the public are recognized as important inputs into health care priority-setting, though knowledge of such preferences is scant. We sought to generate evidence of public preferences related to healthcare resource allocation among adults and children. METHODS: We conducted an experimental stated preference survey in a national sample of Canadian adults. Preferences were elicited across a range of scenarios and scored on a visual analogue scale. Intervention group participants were randomized to a moral reasoning exercise prior to each choice task. The main outcomes were the differences in mean preference scores by group, scenario, and demographics. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate a consistent preference by participants to allocate scarce health system resources to children. Exposure to the moral reasoning exercise weakened but did not eliminate this preference. Younger respondent age and parenthood were associated with greater preference for children. The top principles guiding participants allocative decisions were treat equally, relieve suffering, and rescue those at risk of dying. CONCLUSIONS: Our study affirms the relevance of age in public preferences for the allocation of scarce health care resources, demonstrating a significant preference by participants to allocate healthcare resources to children. However, this preference diminishes when challenged by exposure to a range of moral principles, revealing a strong public endorsement of equality of access. Definitions of value in healthcare based on clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness may exclude moral considerations that the public values, such as equality and humanitarianism, highlighting opportunities to enrich healthcare priority-setting through public engagement.","output":"Does moral reasoning influence public values for health care priority setting?: A population-based randomized stated preference survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We exploit the exogenous variation that comes from the COVID\\\\19 and the subsequent lockdown in Ecuador.

RESULTS: Patient-related factors (habits, trust, and knowledge), physician-related factors (conservative preference, risk avoidance), and system-related factors (accessibility, operability) affected patients' diagnose-seeking behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-related, physician-related, and system-related factors affecting patients' diagnose-seeking behaviors in tertiary hospitals should be addressed by investing more health resources in lower-level hospitals, enhancing dissemination of health-related and policy-related knowledge, refining the classification of diseases, incentivizing physicians, and developing appropriate follow-up measures.

The airborne carrier for the COVID-19 can be tiny droplets and particulates from infected person, fine suspended mists (humidity) in air, or ambient aerosols in air. To-date, unfortunately there are no test standards for nano-aerosols (100 nm). A goal in our study is to develop air filters (e.g. respirator, facemask, ventilator, medical breathing filter/system) with 90% capture on 100-nm airborne COVID-19 with pressure drop of less than 30 Pa (3.1 mm water). There are two challenges. First, this airborne bio-nanoaerosol (combined virus and carrier) is amorphous unlike cubic NaCl crystals. Second, unlike standard laboratory tests on NaCl and test oil (DOP) droplets, these polydispersed aerosols all challenge the filter simultaneously and they are of different sizes and can interact among themselves complicating the filtration process. For the first time, we have studied these two effects using ambient aerosols (simulating the bio-nanoaerosols of coronavirus plus carrier of different shapes and sizes) to challenge electrostatically charged multilayer/multimodule nanofiber filters. This problem is fundamentally complicated due to mechanical and electrostatic interactions among aerosols of different sizes with induced charges of different magnitudes. The test filters were arranged in 2, 4, and 6 multiple-modules stack-up with each module having 0.765 g/m2 of charged PVDF nanofibers (mean diameter 525  191 nm). This configuration minimized electrical interference among neighboring charged nanofibers and reduced flow resistance in the filter. For ambient aerosol size>80 nm (applicable to the smallest COVID-19), the electrostatic effect contributes 100C180% more efficiency to the existing mechanical efficiency (due to diffusion and interception) depending on the number of modules in the filter. By stacking-up modules to increase fiber basis weight in the filter, a 6-layer charged nanofiber filter achieved 88%, 88% and 96% filtration efficiency for, respectively, 55-nm, 100-nm and 300-nm ambient aerosol. This is very close to attaining our set goal of 90%-efficiency on the 100-nm ambient aerosol. The pressure drop for the 6-layer nanofiber filter was only 26 Pa (2.65 mm water column) which was below our limit of 30 Pa (3.1 mm water). For the test multi-module filters, a high quality factor (efficiency-to-pressure-drop ratio) of about 0.1 to 0.13 Pa?1 can be consistently maintained, which was far better than conventional filters. Using the same PVDF 6-layer charged nanofiber filter, laboratory tests results using monodispersed NaCl aerosols of 50, 100, and 300 nm yielded filtration efficiency, respectively, 92%, 94% and 98% (qualified for 'N98 standard') with same pressure drop of 26 Pa. The 2C6% discrepancy in efficiency for the NaCl aerosols was primarily attributed to the absence of interaction among aerosols of different sizes using monodispersed NaCl aerosols in the laboratory. This discrepancy can be further reduced with increasing number of modules in the filter and for larger 300-nm aerosol. The 6-layer charged nanofiber filter was qualified as a 'N98 respirator' (98% capture efficiency for 300-nm NaCl aerosols) but with pressure drop of only 2.65-mm water which was 1/10 below conventional N95 with 25-mm (exhaling) to 35-mm (inhaling) water column! The 6-layer charged PVDF nanofiber filter provides good personal protection against airborne COVID-19 virus and nano-aerosols from pollution based on the N98 standard, yet it is at least 10X more breathable than a conventional N95 respirator.","output":"Charged PVDF multilayer nanofiber filter in filtering simulated airborne novel coronavirus (COVID-19) using ambient nano-aerosols"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID 19) which is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019.

However, we know from extensive studies of social networks that there is significant variation in the number of connections and thus social contacts each individual has. Individuals with more social contacts are more likely to attract and spread infection. These individuals are likely the drivers of the epidemic, so-called superspreaders. When many superspreaders are immune, it becomes more difficult for the disease to spread, as the connectedness of the social network dramatically decreases. If one assumes all individuals being equally connected and thus as likely to spread disease as in a SIR model, this is not true. Methods To account for the impact of social network structure on epidemic development, we model the dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 on a dynamic preferential attachment graph which changes appearance proportional to observed mobility changes. We sample a serial interval distribution that determines the probability of dispersion for all infected nodes each day. We model the dispersion in different age groups using age-specific infection fatality rates. We vary the infection probabilities in different age groups and analyse the outcome. Results The impact of movement on network dynamics plays a crucial role in the spread of infections. We find that higher movement results in higher spread due to an increased probability of new connections being made within a social network. We show that saturation in the dispersion can be reached much earlier on a preferential attachment graph compared to spread on a random graph, which is more similar to estimations using R0. Conclusions We provide a novel method for modelling epidemics by using a dynamic network structure related to observed mobility changes. The social network structure plays a crucial role in epidemic development, something that is often overlooked.","output":"Modelling the dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 on a dynamic network graph"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Financial incentive programmes promote smoking cessation. However, the incentive amount which should be provided - and how this may interact with other programme characteristics - is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of the design of incentive programmes for smoking cessation on current smokers' perceptions of programmes and willingness to enrol. METHOD: An online discrete choice experiment was conducted amongst adult current smokers residing in the United Kingdom (N = 430). Hypothetical incentive programmes were described using five attributes (incentive amount, incentive type, frequency of sessions, reward schedule, programme location). Participants responded to a series of choice sets comprised of two hypothetical programmes. For each set, participants selected their preferred programme. They then specified whether they would enrol in their preferred programme if it were available. Analyses also considered the effect of participant income on preferences. RESULTS: Overall, participants preferred higher amounts over lower amounts, cash over vouchers, healthcare settings over workplaces, and consistent amounts over an escalating schedule. One session per week was the most preferred session frequency. Willingness to enrol increased quadratically with the incentive amount, although this increase slowed for higher amounts. Although middle- and high-income smokers preferred slightly higher amounts (cf. low-income participants), enrolment choices did not differ by income. CONCLUSION: The characteristics of incentive programmes influence smokers' perceptions of programmes and willingness to enrol. Higher amounts may encourage greater enrolment rates, but there will likely be a ceiling point beyond which increasing the incentive amount does not meaningfully increase enrolments.","output":"Design of financial incentive programmes for smoking cessation: A discrete choice experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-COV-2, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS) viruses are from the coronaviridae family; the former became a global pandemic (with low mortality rate) while the latter were confined to a limited region (with high mortality rates).

Seven attribute weighting (feature selection) models were employed to find the key differences in their genome's nucleotide sequence. Most attribute weighting models selected the final nucleotide sequences (from 29,000th nucleotide positions to the end of the genome) as significantly different among the three virus classes.

While the UK, USA, Brazil and parts of Asia are bracing themselves for the second waveor the extension of the first waveit is imperative to identify the primary social, economic, environmental, demographic, ethnic, cultural and health factors contributing towards COVID-19 infection and mortality numbers to facilitate mitigation and control measures. METHODS: We process several open-access datasets on US states to create an integrated dataset of potential factors leading to the pandemic spread. We then apply several supervised machine learning approaches to reach a consensus as well as rank the key factors. We carry out regression analysis to pinpoint the key pre-lockdown factors that affect post-lockdown infection and mortality, informing future lockdown-related policy making. FINDINGS: Population density, testing numbers and airport traffic emerge as the most discriminatory factors, followed by higher age groups (above 40 and specifically 60+). Post-lockdown infected and death rates are highly influenced by their pre-lockdown counterparts, followed by population density and airport traffic. While healthcare index seems uncorrelated with mortality rate, principal component analysis on the key features show two groups: states (1) forming early epicenters and (2) experiencing strong second wave or peaking late in rate of infection and death. Finally, a small case study on New York City shows that days-to-peak for infection of neighboring boroughs correlate better with inter-zone mobility than the inter-zone distance. INTERPRETATION: States forming the early hotspots are regions with high airport or road traffic resulting in human interaction. US states with high population density and testing tend to exhibit consistently high infected and death numbers. Mortality rate seems to be driven by individual physiology, preexisting condition, age etc., rather than gender, healthcare facility or ethnic predisposition. Finally, policymaking on the timing of lockdowns should primarily consider the pre-lockdown infected numbers along with population density and airport traffic.","output":"Factors affecting COVID-19 infected and death rates inform lockdown-related policymaking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of radiographs inconsistent with bronchiolitis in children with typical presentation of bronchiolitis and to compare rates of intended antibiotic therapy before radiography versus those given antibiotics after radiography.

Replication of coronaviruses involves novel mechanisms such as ribosomal frameshifting and the synthesis of both genomic and sub-genomic RNAs. We summarised the key components in coronavirus molecular biology and molecular determinants of pathogenesis. Focusing largely on SARS-CoV-2 due to its current importance, this review explores the virology of recently emerged coronaviruses to gain an in-depth understanding of these infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The presented information provides fundamental bottlenecks to devise future disease control and management strategies to curtail the impact of coronaviruses in human populations.","output":"The Molecular Virology of Coronaviruses with Special Reference to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare workers (HCWs), as frontliners, are assumed to be among the highest risk groups for COVID-19 infection, especially HCWs directly involved in patient care.

The data included the COVID-19 High Frequency Phone Survey of Households in Ethiopia that were collected in 2021. This paper relied on the 10th round of the survey, which was comprised of 2178 households. The Instrumental Variable Probit regression model was used to analyze the data. The results showed that majority of the respondents (92.33%) would receiveCOVID-19 vaccines, while 6.61% and 1.06% were, respectively, unwilling and unsure. Across the regions of Ethiopia, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region (SNNPR) (99.30%), Oromia (97.54%), Tigray (97.04%) and Gambela (95.42%) had the highest proportions of respondents willing to have the vaccine. Vaccine safety concern was the topmost reason for those unwilling to receive the vaccine. The results of the Instrumental Variable Probit regression showed that currently working, age, engagement with non-farm businesses and region of residence significantly influenced the populations willingness to take the vaccine (p < 0.05). It was concluded that although the willingness be vaccinated was impressive, without everyone being receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, infection risk can still be high; this is due to the persistent mutation of the viral strains. Thus, there is a need to intensify efforts toward addressing the safety issues of COVID-19 vaccines, while efforts to enhance acceptability should focus on the youth population and those who are unemployed.","output":"Willingness to Take COVID-19 Vaccines in Ethiopia: An Instrumental Variable Probit Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a case report of a 55-year-old male patient, medically free presented to the emergency department at our hospital, King Fahd Armed Forces Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Pregnant women are currently experiencing elevated anxiety and depression symptoms, which may increase risk of substance use, and potentially result in poor perinatal and neurodevelopmental outcomes for children. METHODS: Survey results were analyzed from an ongoing study of 7470 pregnant individuals in Canada: Pregnancy during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Participants were asked about current use of alcohol and substances, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and COVID-19 concerns: how much they worry about COVID-19 threatening their baby's life, threatening their own life, care for themselves or the baby, feelings of social isolation, and financial difficulties. RESULTS: The percentage of participants who reported use during pregnancy was 6.7 % for alcohol, 4.3 % for cannabis, 4.9 % for tobacco, and 0.3 % for illicit drugs; 2.6 % were using multiple substances. Higher depression symptoms and financial difficulties were associated with more cannabis and/or tobacco use as well as the co-use of substances. There were no associations between alcohol use and mental health or COVID-19 concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported rates of use and co-use were lower or comparable to previous research, perhaps reflecting pandemic-related circumstances or the demographics of this sample. Depression symptoms and pandemic-related financial difficulties were associated with more tobacco use, cannabis use, and substance co-use. It remains important to maintain access to perinatal, mental health, and financial supports during the pandemic to mitigate prenatal alcohol and substance use and prevent poor perinatal and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes for children.","output":"Alcohol and substance use in pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We1 and others2 have previously shown that ICU admitted patients with COVID-19 developed high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, but also autoantibodies, some of which are pathogenic.

We did not know whether these autoantibodies still exist, are associated with COVID-19 or with ARDS as described after septic shock4. Objectives: To investigate the presence and titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and autoantibodies in patients survived after COVID-19 ICU stay, in the ICU and 6 months later. Methods: Case series to evaluate titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, specificities of autoantibodies as well as clinical features in ICU admitted COVID-19 patients, initially and 6 months after their discharge. Evaluation of current clinical status included evaluation of lung, heart, kidney, central and peripheral nervous system and mental status using standardized methods. Methods for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and autoantibodies were described in our previous report1. Results: We had initially evaluated1 29 ICU admitted COVID-19 patients' files and sera, of which 4 had been already died during serum evaluation. Six more patients died thereafter. Out of 19 having been discharged, 8 were willing to be re-evaluated. On second evaluation 6 months later, serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were highly positive, although at lower titers compared to the titers at disease onset (median [range]) 8.705 (range: 7.95-9.56) vs 6.640 (range: 6.29-6.76), p=0.0002, Mann-Whitney test. Initially 3 out of 8 patients expressed antinuclear antibodies (ANA) at titers 1/160, 1/320 and 1/320 with a fine speckled pattern with the second patient also expressing at a titer of 1/160, antimitochondrial (AMA) antibodies. Six months later the same patients and not anyone else expressed ANA of the same pattern at titers 1/640, 1/160 and 1/160 respectively. Two patients with 1/20 p-ANCA and 1/640 c-ANCA initially, lost their respective autoantibodies after 6 months. One patient initially negative for IgM anti-2GPI became positive at low titer and an initially positive became negative. One patient initially positive for anti-Ro60 antibody continued to be positive 6 months later. One patient initially negative developed anti-Tg antibodies and 3 patients initially positive for anti-TPO antibodies remained positive 6 months later.

TonB-dependent receptors (TBDRs) are ubiquitous outer membrane -barrel proteins; they play an important role in the recognition of siderophores during iron uptake. Here, in the APEC strain DE205B, we investigated the role of four putative TBDRsireA, 0007, 0008, and 2235in iron uptake. Glutathione-S-transferase pulldown assays indicated that the proteins encoded by these genes directly interact with TonB. Moreover, the expression levels of all four genes were significantly upregulated under iron-depleted conditions compared with iron-rich conditions. The expression levels of several iron uptake-related genes were significantly increased in the ireA, 0007, 0008, and 2235 deletion strains, with the upregulation being the most prominent in the ireA deletion mutant. Furthermore, iron uptake by the ireA deletion strain was significantly increased compared to that by the wild-type strain. Moreover, a tonB mutant strain was constructed to study the effect of tonB deletion on the TBDRs. We found that regardless of the presence of tonB, the expression levels of the genes encoding the four TBDRs were regulated by fur. In conclusion, our findings indicated that ireA, 0007, 0008, and 2235 indeed encode TBDRs, with ireA having the most important role in iron uptake.

India has high patient to rheumatologist ratio, and patients have limited concepts about telemedicine. Thus, we attempted to find the feasibility and acceptance of patients in switching to teleconsultation. The CARE rheumatology clinic at Kerala, India, caters to average 170 (range: 140-240) patients per day. Patients with prefixed appointments had two-level screening for eligibility for teleconsultation. Those eligible were given the option for teleconsultation on the widely available WhatsApp app. Of those who completed teleconsultations, 100 were chosen at random to provide feedback. In the first 7 days, out of 1469 appointments, 975 were found eligible for teleconsultation. Of these, 723 (74%) opted for it. The average footfall in the clinic was reduced to 67 (range 29-117). The proportion of patients accepting teleconsultations increased with time. Amongst the 100 respondents, median satisfaction was 9 (IQR 8-10) and recommendation for continuing was 9.5 (IQR 8-10) on a 0-10 scale. Multivariate analysis showed the recommendation score was dependent on beliefs about social distancing, perceptions about clinical examination, and the satisfaction score of the first teleconsultation. Age, sex, availability of personal video conferencing app or of vehicles did not independently influence this score. Without teleconsultation facilities, three-fourths of the respondents would have stopped drugs or self-medicated. The switch was feasible and accepted by patients. It enabled quick reduction in the number of persons travelling to the centre. Not making the switch could have deprived approximately three-quarters of these patients of proper medical care. Key Points a? Patient to rheumatologist ratios in India is heavily skewed and awareness about telemedicine is limited. a? Switch to telemedicine was feasible and allowed a decrease in the number of people attending the clinic. a?

The primary endpoint was complete wound closure at 12 weeks. RESULTS Twenty-one US sites enrolled and randomised 226 patients with hard-to-heal DFUs. The study was terminated early due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population of 207 patients, with 103 in the FBADM group and 104 in the SOC group. Of these participants, 161 completed the study per protocol (mPP population), with 79 receiving FBADM, and 82 without. At the first analysis point, patients treated with FBADM were found to be significantly more likely to achieve complete wound closure compared with SOC alone (mITT: 45.6% versus 27.9% p=0.008; mPP: 59.5% versus 35.6% p=0.002). The difference in outcome yielded an odds ratio of 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2, 3.9; p=0.008). Median time to closure within 12 weeks was 43 days for the FBADM group compared to 57 days for the SOC group (p=0.36). The median number of applications of FBADM to achieve closure was one. Adverse events were similar between groups and no product-related serious adverse events occurred.

To investigate whether the proposed risk factors increase viral infection by modulation of the VE genes, we examined gene expression profiles of 796 nasal and 1,673 bronchial samples across four lung cancer screening cohorts containing individuals without COVID-19. Smoking was the only clinical factor reproducibly associated with the expression of any VE gene across cohorts. ACE2 expression was significantly up-regulated with smoking in the bronchus but significantly down-regulated with smoking in the nose. Furthermore, expression of individual VE genes were not correlated between paired nasal and bronchial samples from the same patients. Single-cell RNA-seq of nasal brushings revealed that an ACE2 gene module was detected in a variety of nasal secretory cells with the highest expression in the C15orf48+ secretory cells, while a TMPRSS2 gene module was most highly expressed in nasal keratinizing epithelial cells.

METHODS: A multilevel robust computational analysis was undertaken for viral genetic sequence alignment, phylogram construction, genome-wide transcriptome data interpretation of virus-infected lung tissues, miRNA mapping, and functional biology networking. RESULTS: Our findings show both genetic similarities as well as notable differences in the S protein length among SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS viruses.

The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) was used to investigate attitudes, moods and behavior during lockdown in England. ALSPAC participants were invited to complete online questionnaires in May 2020, including a set of questions about frequency of gambling and gambling activities which had been asked three years previously. Mental health and wellbeing data and alcohol use were also collected as part of lockdown questionnaires. Gambling questions were completed by 2632 young adults, 71% female, with a mean age of 27.8 years. Overall, gambling frequency reduced during lockdown for both males and females, but more males engaged in regular (weekly) gambling. Gambling activities became more restricted compared to previous reports, but online gambling (e.g. online poker, bingo, casino games) was more frequent. Previous gambling behaviour predicted gambling frequency during lockdown. No associations were apparent between gambling frequency and measures of mental health and well-being. Heavy alcohol use was strongly linked with regular gambling during lockdown. Gamblers were more than twice as likely as non-gamblers to have experienced financial difficulties pre-COVID, but gambling frequency was not related to employment status during lockdown. Online gambling increased during lockdown, whilst offline gambling activities decreased in frequency. A small minority of regular weekly gamblers, who tended to be male and heavy users of alcohol, participated in a wide range of online and offline gambling activities.","output":"Gambling by Young Adults in the UK During COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) can manifest as fever, cough, and shortness of breath and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Occasionally, these patients may present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) Patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension, as well as older age groups, are known to have a more severe disease progression and poor prognosis In this review article, we attempt to better understand the disease process in diabetics and also discuss potential mechanisms by which diabetes may play a role in disease severity This includes the effect of diabetes on the immune response and immune dysregulation The role of diabetes mellitus in molecular processes including augmenting Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE 2) levels is also discussed as potential mechanisms to explain the grave prognosis seen in these patients [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of International Journal of Endocrinology is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Heightened ACE Activity and Unfavorable Consequences in COVID-19 Diabetic Subjects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutations in hallmark genes are believed to be the main drivers of cancer progression.

Guidelines have established clinical targets but there may be variation in clinical outcomes including HbA1c, based on location and practice size. Investigating this variation may help identify factors amenable to systemic improvement interventions. The aims of this study were to identify centre-specific and patient-specific factors associated with variation in HbA1c levels and to determine how these associations contribute to variation in performance across diabetes centres. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analysed data for 5,872 people with type 1 (n = 1,729) or type 2 (n = 4,143) diabetes mellitus collected through the Australian National Diabetes Audit (ANDA). A linear mixed-effects model examined centre-level and patient-level factors associated with variation in HbA1c levels. RESULTS: Mean age was: 4317 years (type 1), 6413 (type 2); median disease duration: 18 years (10,29) (type 1), 12 years (6,20) (type 2); female: 52% (type 1), 45% (type 2). For people with type 1 diabetes, volume of patients was associated with increases in HbA1c (p = 0.019). For people with type 2 diabetes, type of centre was associated with reduction in HbA1c (p <0.001), but location and patient volume were not. Associated patient-level factors associated with increases in HbA1c included past hyperglycaemic emergencies (type 1 and type 2, p<0.001) and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status (type 2, p<0.001). Being a non-smoker was associated with reductions in HbA1c (type 1 and type 2, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Centre-level and patient-level factors were associated with variation in HbA1c, but patient-level factors had greater impact. Interventions targeting patient-level factors conducted at a centre level including sick-day management, smoking cessation programs and culturally appropriate diabetes education for and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples may be more important for improving glycaemic control than targeting factors related to the Centre itself.","output":"Exploring HbA1c variation between Australian diabetes centres: The impact of centre-level and patient-level factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to their essential role as places for socialization,\\"third places\\"- social places where people casually visit and communicate with friends and neighbors - have been studied by a wide range of fields including network science, sociology, geography, urban planning, and regional studies.

Here, we investigated the importance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in modulating the progression of residual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after heat treatment. METHODS Heat-exposed residual HCC cells were cultured in different ECM gels. We used basement membrane gel (Matrigel) to simulate the normal microenvironment and collagen I to model the pathological stromal ECM. The alterations of morphology and parameters of proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness were analyzed in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS Increased collagen I deposition was observed at the periablational zone after incomplete RFA of HCC in a xenograft model. The markers of cell proliferation, EMT, motility and progenitor-like traits of heat-exposed residual HCC cells were significantly induced by collagen I as compared to Matrigel (p values all < 0.05). Importantly, collagen I induced the activation of ERK phosphorylation in heat-exposed residual HCC cells. ERK1/2 inhibitor reversed the collagen I-promoted ERK phosphorylation, cell proliferative, protrusive and spindle-like appearance of heat-treated residual HCC cells in vitro. Moreover, collagen I promoted the in vivo tumor progression of heat-exposed residual HCC cells, and sorafenib markedly reversed the collagen I-mediated protumor effects. CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate that collagen I could enhance the aggressive progression of residual HCC cells after suboptimal heat treatment and sorafenib may be a treatment approach to thwart this process.","output":"Extracellular matrix collagen I promotes the tumor progression of residual hepatocellular carcinoma after heat treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a Curry-style semantics of programs in which a nominal labelled transition system of types, characterizing observable behaviour, is overlaid on a nominal LTS of untyped computation.

DTI provides qualitative and quantitative information about the microstructure of the brain, and a near-infrared spectroscopy index can assess cerebrovascular autoregulation. We hypothesized that lower ADC values would correlate with worse autoregulatory function. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-one neonates with hypoxic-ischemic injury were enrolled. ADC scalars were measured in 27 neonates (age range, 4-15 days) in the anterior and posterior centrum semiovale, basal ganglia, thalamus, posterior limb of the internal capsule, pons, and middle cerebellar peduncle on MRI obtained after completion of therapeutic hypothermia. The blood pressure range of each neonate with the most robust autoregulation was identified by using a near-infrared spectroscopy index. Autoregulatory function was measured by blood pressure deviation below the range with optimal autoregulation. RESULTS In neonates who had MRI on day of life 10, lower ADC scalars in the posterior centrum semiovale (r = -0.87, P = .003, n = 9) and the posterior limb of the internal capsule (r = -0.68, P = .04, n = 9) correlated with blood pressure deviation below the range with optimal autoregulation during hypothermia. Lower ADC scalars in the basal ganglia correlated with worse autoregulation during rewarming (r = -0.71, P = .05, n = 8). CONCLUSIONS Blood pressure deviation from the optimal autoregulatory range may be an early biomarker of injury in the posterior centrum semiovale, posterior limb of the internal capsule, and basal ganglia.

However, the regulatory mechanisms behind this remain completely unexplored. In this study we performed comparative transcriptomics on the methanogen Methanosarcina barkeri, which was incubated at 30?C and 0?C with 10-20 mM calcium-, magnesium-, or sodium perchlorate. Consistent with prior studies, we observed decreased CH4 production and apparent perchlorate reduction, with the latter process proceeding by heretofore essentially unknown mechanisms. Transcriptomic responses of M. barkeri to perchlorates include up-regulation of osmoprotectant transporters and selection against redox-sensitive amino acids. Increased expression of methylamine methanogenesis genes suggest competition for H2 with perchlorate reduction, which we propose is catalyzed by up-regulated molybdenum-containing enzymes and maintained by siphoning diffused H2 from energy-conserving hydrogenases. Methanogenesis regulatory patterns suggest Mars' freezing temperatures alone pose greater constraints to CH4 production than perchlorates.

Main outcomes and measures: Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, physical examination and diagnostic tests as a blood test, nasopharyngeal swab results for RT-PCR (Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) and chest X-ray results. RESULTS: The overall SARS-CoV-2 pneumonias collected were 172 (female 87 [50.6%], mean age 60.5 years standard deviation [SD] 17.0). Comorbidities were body mass index  25 kg/m(2) (90 [52.3%]), hypertension (83 [48.3%]), dyslipidaemia (68 [39.5%]) and diabetes (33 [19.2%]). The sample was stratified by age groups (< 50 years, 50C75 years and  75 years). Clinical manifestations at onset were fever (144 [83.7%]), cough (140 [81.4%]), dyspnoea (103 [59.9%]) and gastrointestinal disturbances (72 [41.9%]). Day 7.8 (SD:4.1) from clinical onset was the mean day of pneumonia diagnosis. Bilateral pneumonia was more prevalent than unilateral (126 [73.3%] and 46 [26.7%]). Patients with unilateral pneumonia were prone to higher pulse oximetry (96% vs 94%, p < 0.001). We found differences between unilateral and bilateral cases in C-reactive protein (29.6 vs 81.5 mg/L, p < 0.001), and lymphocytes (1400.0 vs 1000.0E3/ml, p < 0.001). Complications were registered: 42 (100%) of patients  75 years were admitted into hospital; pulmonary embolism was only present at bilateral pneumonia (7 patients [5.6%]) and death occurred in 1 patient with unilateral pneumonia (2.2%) vs 10 patients (7.9%) with bilateral pneumonia ( p 0.170). CONCLUSION: Clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were fever, cough and dyspnoea; this was especially clear in the elderly. We described different characteristics between unilateral and bilateral pneumonia.

Home schooling, the lack of social contacts with peers and the care of the children at home posed an enormous challenge for many families. METHODS: The present study investigated the leisure behavior of 285 one- to 10-year-old German children at two time points (t1 and t2) during the Covid-19-related lockdown in spring 2020. In the subsample of primary school children (n = 102), we also explored children's attitudes towards schoolwork at home. Analyses focused on the change of behavior from t1 to t2, on differences in these changes depending on socio-economic status (SES), and on associations of behavior with SES, the number of children at home, and the frequency of receiving learning materials from school. RESULTS: While the frequency of playing outside increased significantly from t1 to t2, the frequency of handicrafts, playing board games, indoor sports, and motivation to do schoolwork decreased. The observed changes between t1 and t2 did not differ depending on SES. However, a lower SES was associated with higher media use, less outdoor activity, and (though only marginally significant) a reduced time doing schoolwork and a reduced ability to concentrate on schoolwork at t1. In households with more children, children played outside more often, but were read to less frequently and (though only marginally significant) watched movies and series less frequently. Children receiving learning materials from school on a regular basis spent significantly more time doing schoolwork at home than children receiving materials only irregularly. CONCLUSIONS: A continuing loss of childcare in day-care facilities and schools entails the danger of declining education in the form of (inter)active indoor activities and schoolwork.","output":"Loss of childcare and classroom teaching during the Covid-19-related lockdown in spring 2020: A longitudinal study on consequences on leisure behavior and schoolwork at home"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The latest COVID-19 pandemic outbreak posed a significant risk to millions of people worldwide who are safe and well-being.

These are performed in two phases: Stage A (written examination) and Stage B (the final Board oral examination). The COVID-19 pandemic started in Israel a few weeks before the scheduled spring 2020 Stage B exams and had a major impact, not only on the health and economic systems in Israel, but also on the residency exams. AIMS To describe the efforts of the Israeli Scientific Council to execute the spring 2020 Stage B exams during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to the worldwide data, and to deduce the appropriate management during potential future crises. METHODS We present a description of the activity of the Israeli Scientific Council since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic according to documents and other sources, An internet search was conducted on the destiny of residency examinations throughout the world, and a comparison between them. RESULTS Due to rapid worsening in the restrictions enforced in Israel, the spring 2020 oral board exams were cancelled. However, a decision was made to execute them in the summer. This new schedule dictated a delay in the schedule of other residency examinations and forced condensation of 5 periods into 10 months instead of 14. The examination team prepared the new summer exams period under the assumption that heavy restrictions will still be implemented. Indeed, COVID-19 was still around and the restrictions were still enforced. Despite that, all oral Board examinations were perfectly executed. This contrasts with the rest of the world, in which most residency exams were cancelled, even without a solution or an alternative date. CONCLUSIONS Recruitment of all involved and preparation for the worst-case scenario enabled the perfect execution of the previously cancelled exams, and will enable the execution of future residency exams under conditions of potential health or war crises. DISCUSSION To the best of our knowledge, the Israeli Scientific Council is the only communal body in the world which organized an alternative period for the cancelled oral exams, only 4 months after the cancelled dates. Due to an enormous effort and rigorous preparations, Israel is also the only place in which oral exams were successfully executed, physically, under an active disease and very heavy restrictions.","output":"[RESIDENCY EXAMINATIONS IN THE COURSE OF THE COVID-19 CRISIS: THE EFFORTS OF THE ISRAELI SCIENTIFIC COUNCIL TO EXECUTE THE FINAL BOARD ORAL EXAMINATIONS DURING A LOCAL AND A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to highlight the COVID-19 response by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Government of Malaysia in order to share Malaysias lessons and to improve future pandemic preparedness.

Human coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major cause of respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections with associated morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to characterize the epidemiology of CoVs in our tertiary care centre, and identify clinical correlates of disease severity. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed of 226 patients admitted with confirmed CoV respiratory tract infection between 2010 and 2016. Variables consistent with a severe disease burden were evaluated including symptoms, length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. RESULTS: CoVs represented 11.3% of all positive respiratory virus samples and OC43 was the most commonly identified CoV. The majority of infections were community-associated while 21.6% were considered nosocomial. The average length of stay was 11.8 days with 17.3% of patients requiring ICU admission and an all-cause mortality of 7%. In a multivariate model, female gender and smoking were associated with increased likelihood of admission to ICU or death.

We identified prospective and retrospective studies, including observational, cohort, single-blinded and multicenter studies, comparing VCE and DBE for the diagnosis of OGIB, and data of all the vascular sources of bleeding were collected. All patients were subjected to the same gold standard method. Relevant data were then extracted from each included study using a standardized extraction form. We calculated study variables (sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy) and performed a meta-analysis using Meta-Disc software. RESULTS In the per-patient analysis, 17 studies (1477 lesions) were included. We identified 3150 exams (1722 VCE and 1428 DBE) in 2043 patients and identified 2248 sources of bleeding, 1467 of which were from vascular lesions. Of these lesions, 864 (58.5%) were diagnosed by VCE, and 613 (41.5%) were diagnosed by DBE. The pretest probability for bleeding of vascular origin was 54.34%. The sensitivity of DBE was 84% (95%CI: 0.82-0.86; heterogeneity: 78.00%), and the specificity was 92% (95%CI: 0.89-0.94; heterogeneity: 92.0%).

METHOD In this study, we included the patients who applied to our smoking cessation clinic between January 1 and June 30, 2020. We conducted telephonic and face-to-face interviews with the patients during the outbreak, and inquired about the changes in their smoking habits. RESULTS In total, 114 volunteers (mean age: 41.2 years [min-max: 18-82 years], M/F: 70/44 [61.4/38.6%]) who registered in the smoking cessation clinic of Chest Diseases Clinic were included in the study. The number of people with and without coronaphobia was 64 (56.1%) and 50 (43.9%), respectively. The analyses of the changes in smoking behaviors because of coronaphobia demonstrated that people with coronaphobia exhibited a significantly higher decrease or cessation of smoking as compared to no change in smoking behavior or increase in the number of cigarettes (p: .006). CONCLUSIONS Success in smoking cessation can be increased with the accurate analyses of the anxiety effects caused by coronaphobia after COVID-19 outbreak on the desire of smoking cessation.

Since modern ICU ventilators are powerful devices that can deliver very high gas flow rates and pressures, multiple physicians have attempted to ventilate more than one patient on a single ventilator -- so-called 'vent splitting'. Early applications of this approach have utilized simple concatenations of ventilator tubing and T-pieces, to provide flow to more than one patient. Additional approaches using custom flow splitters -- sometimes made using 3D printing technologies -- have also advanced into the clinic with FDA approval. However, heretofore there has been less progress made on controlling individual ventilatory pressures for patients with severe lung disease. Given the inherent variability and instability of lung compliance amongst patients with COVID-19, there remains an important need to provide a means of extending ventilator usefulness to more than one patient, but in a way that provides more tailored pressures that can be titrated over time. In this descriptive report, we provide the basis for a ventilator circuit that can support two patients with individualized peak inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures. The circuit is comprised of exclusively 'off the shelf' materials and is inexpensive to produce. The circuit can be used with typical ICU ventilators, and with anesthesia ventilators used in operating rooms. Inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures for each patient can be titrated over time, without changes for one patient affecting the ventilation parameters of the other patient. Using in-line spirometry, individual tidal volumes can be measured for each patient. This Pressure-Regulated Ventilator Splitting (PReVentS) Yale University protocol operates under a pressure-control ventilatory mode, and may function optimally when patients are not triggering breaths from the ventilator. This method has been tested thus far only in the laboratory with mock lungs, and has not yet been deployed in animals or in patients. However, given the novelty and potential utility of this approach, we deemed it appropriate to provide this information to the broader critical care community at the present time.

Donor Shield is automatically provided to donors who participate in kidney paired donation through the NKR or who donate at a Donor Shield Direct center, without any income restrictions. METHODS The support donors across the US received from the Donor Shield program between January 2019 and February 2020 was studied. RESULTS During the study period, 326 (25.9%) of the 1,260 donors covered by Donor Shield, from 46 programs received reimbursements amounting to a total of $647,384.45, with $472,389.97 (73.0%) covering lost wages. Median reimbursement per donor was $1,813.80 (range: $44.0 - $ 7,165.63). 81% of 108 reimbursed donors who were surveyed reported that the lack of these reimbursements would have posed a financial hardship, and 4% said they would have been unable to donate without this support.

Vaccination induced robust neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers that were maintained at high levels for at least one year after two doses (Pseudovirus nAb GMT: 2207, Live-virus nAb GMT: 1964) against the ancestral strain, but not against Omicron. However, a booster dose at 6-12 months with RBD-Wu or RBD- (RBD from the Beta variant) displayed on I53-50 elicited equivalent and remarkably high neutralizing titers against the ancestral as well as the Omicron variant.

This article discusses tobacco control policies and highlights major achievements and open challenges to reduce smoking prevalence and attributable morbidity and mortality in the 21st century. The introduction of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2005 has been a key achievement in the field and has already facilitated a drop in both smoking prevalence and exposure to secondhand smoke. Indicatively, the size of the worldwide population benefiting from at least one cost\\\\effective tobacco control policy has quadrupled since 2007. In addition, plain cigarette packaging has been successfully introduced as a tobacco control policy, surmounting efforts of the tobacco industry to challenge this based on trade and investment law. Nevertheless, tobacco control still faces major challenges. Smoking prevalence needs to be further reduced in a rather expedited manner. Smoke\\\\free environments should be extended, and the use of plain tobacco packaging with large pictorial health warnings for all tobacco products should be further promoted in some parts of the world. Some of these measures will require prompt determination and diligence. For example, bold political decisions are needed to significantly increase real prices of tobacco products through excise taxes, ban added ingredients that are currently used to increase the attractiveness of tobacco products and ban the tobacco industry's corporate social responsibility initiatives.

To study the pattern of CSRE in various domains mentioned in the CSR index, the study is conducted over four points of time. Three alternative years since the commencement of the Companies Act 2013 i.e. 2014-2015, 2016-2017 and 2018-2019 have been taken up. Additionally, the financial year 2019-2020 is included as it marks the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings The findings show that the CSRE made by companies is increasing every year over all points of time taken in the study. In addition to this, Indian companies have voluntarily contributed a substantial amount towards COVID-19 relief over and above the required mandatory limits. Practical implications The gradual increase in CSR contributions even above the mandated amount and voluntary contribution towards COVID-19 relief by Indian companies implies that the nature of CSR in India is still philanthropic.

Observational data on fractures registered in a sustainable way may provide invaluable tools for quality improvements in health care and research. DESCRIPTION Ten years after its implementation, the Swedish Fracture Register has 100% coverage among orthopaedic and trauma departments in Sweden. The completeness of registrations reached in 2020 69-96% for hip fractures at the different departments, with the majority reporting a completeness above 85%. The Swedish Fracture Register is a fully web-based national quality register created and run by orthopaedic professionals, with financial support from public healthcare providers and the government. All users have full access to both the registration platform and all aggregated statistics in real time. The web-based platform was created for use in health quality registers and it has easily gained acceptance among users. The register has gradually developed by the addition of more fracture types and skeletal parts. Research activity is high and 31 scientific publications have been published since 2016. The strategy from the start was to publish validation data and basic epidemiological data. However, over the past few years, publications on outcomes, such as re-operations and mortality, have been published and four register-based, randomised, controlled trials are ongoing. CONCLUSION It is possible to create a fracture register, to gain professional acceptance and to collect fracture data in a sustainable way on a national level if the platform is easy to use.

Our objective was to quantify the presence and magnitude of antibody response in vaccinated, older adult residents at assisted living, personal care, and independent living communities. DESIGN: A cross-sectional quality improvement study was conducted March 15 C April 1, 2021 in the greater Pittsburgh region. SETTING: and Population: Participants were older adult residents at assisted living, personal care, and independent living communities, who received mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. Conditions that impair immune responses were exclusionary criteria. METHODS: Sera were collected to measure IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody level with reflex to total anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin levels, and blinded evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization titers. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients, and multiple linear regression analysis evaluated relationships between factors potentially associated with antibody levels. Spearman correlations were calculated between antibody levels and neutralization titers. RESULTS: All participants (N = 70) had received two rounds of vaccination and were found to have antibodies with wide variation in relative levels. Antibody levels trended lower in males, advanced age, current use of steroids, and longer length of time from vaccination. Pseudovirus neutralization titer levels were strongly correlated (P < .001) with Beckman Coulter antibody levels (D614 G NT50, r(s) = 0.91; B.1.1.7 [UK] NT50, r(s) = 0.91). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Higher functioning, healthier, residential older adults mounted detectable antibody responses when vaccinated with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Data suggests some degree of immunity is present during the immediate period following vaccination. However, protective effects remain to be determined in larger studies as clinical protection is afforded by ongoing adaptive immunity, which is known to be decreased in older adults. This study provides important preliminary results on level of population risk in older adult residents at assisted living, personal care, and independent living communities to inform reopening strategies, but are not likely to be translatable for residents in nursing homes.","output":"Antibody Responses After mRNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccination in Residential Older Adults: Implications for Reopening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10 1371/journal pone 0243889 ]","output":"Correction: Estimation of the incubation period of COVID-19 in Vietnam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are ubiquitous and versatile inorganic cofactors that are crucial for many fundamental bioprocesses in nearly all organisms. How cells maintain Fe-S cluster homeostasis is not well understood in Gram-positive bacteria. Genomic analysis showed that the Suf system, which is encoded by the sufRBDCSU operon, is the sole Fe-S cluster assembly system in the genus Streptomyces Streptomyces avermitilis is the industrial producer of avermectins, which are widely used as agricultural pesticides and antiparasitic agents. sufR (SAV6324) encodes a putative ArsR-family transcriptional regulator, which was characterized as a repressor of the sufRBDCSU operon in this investigation. Spectroscopy and mass spectrometry demonstrated that anaerobically isolated SufR contained an oxidation-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster and existed as a homodimer. EMSAs and DNase I footprinting analyses revealed that [4Fe-4S]-SufR bound specifically and tightly to a 14-bp palindromic sequence (CAAC-N6-GTTG) in the promoter region of the sufR operon, repressing expression of the sufRBDCSU operon. The presence of the [4Fe-4S] cluster is critical for the DNA binding activity of SufR. Cys182, Cys195, and Cys223 in the C-terminal region of SufR are essential for [4Fe-4S] cluster coordination, but Cys178 is not. The fourth non-Cys ligand in coordination of the [4Fe-4S] cluster for SufR remains to be identified. The findings clarify the transcriptional control of the suf operon by [4Fe-4S] SufR to satisfy the varying Fe-S cluster demands. SufR senses the intracellular Fe-S cluster status and modulates the expression of the sole Fe-S cluster assembly system via its Fe-S cluster occupancy.Importance Fe-S clusters function as cofactors of proteins controlling diverse biological processes such as respiration, photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, DNA replication and gene regulation. The mechanism of how Actinobacteria regulate the expression of the sole Fe-S cluster assembly system in response to the varying Fe-S cluster demands remains to be elucidated. In this study, we showed that SufR functions as a transcriptional repressor of the sole Fe-S cluster assembly system in the avermectin-producer S. avermitilis [4Fe-4S]-SufR binds to the promoter region of the suf operon and represses its expression. When Fe-S cluster is insufficient, SufR loses its [4Fe-4S] cluster and DNA binding activity. Apo-SufR dissociates from the promoter region of suf operon, and the expression of the suf system is strongly increased by de-repression to promote the synthesis of Fe-S clusters. The study clarifies how Streptomyces maintains its Fe-S cluster homeostasis through the activity of SufR to modulate the varying Fe-S cluster demands.","output":"SufR, a [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing transcription factor, represses the sufRBDCSU operon in the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in Streptomyces avermitilis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: HIV/AIDS remains one of the major global human health challenges, especially in resource-limited environments. By 2017, over 77.3 million people were infected with the disease, and approximately 35.4 million individuals had already died from AIDS-related illnesses. Approximately 21.7 million people were accessing ART with significant clinical outcomes. However, numerous challenges are experienced in the delivery and accurate interpretation of data on patients with HIV data by various health care providers at different care levels. Mobile health (mHealth) technology is progressively making inroads into the health sector as well as medical research. Different mobile devices have become common in health care settings, leading to rapid growth in the development of downloadable software specifically designed to fulfill particular health-related purposes. OBJECTIVE: We developed a mobile-based app called ARVPredictor and demonstrated that it can accurately define HIV-1 drug-resistance mutations in the HIV pol gene for use at the point of care. METHODS: ARVPredictor was designed using Android Studio with Java as the programming language and is compatible with both Android and iOS. The app system is hosted on Nginx Server, and network calls are built on PHPs Laravel framework handled by the Retrofit Library. The DigitalOcean offers a high-performance and stable cloud computing platform for ARVPredictor. This mobile app is enlisted in the Google Play Store as an ARVPredictor and the source code is available under MIT permissive license at a GitHub repository. To test for agreement between the ARVPredictor and Stanford HIV Database in detecting HIV subtype and NNRT and NRTI mutations, a total of 100 known HIV sequences were evaluated. RESULTS: The mobile-based app (ARVPredictor) takes in a set of sequences or known mutations (protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase). It then returns inferred levels of resistance to selected nucleoside, nonnucleoside protease, and integrase inhibitors for accurate HIV/AIDS management at the point of care. The ARVPredictor identified similar HIV subtypes in 98/100 sequences compared with the Stanford HIV Database (=0.98, indicating near perfect agreement). There were 89/100 major NNRTI and NRTI mutations identified by ARVPredictor, similar to the Stanford HIV Database (=0.89, indicating near perfect agreement). Eight mutations classified as major by the Stanford HIV Database were classified as others by ARVPredictor.

CTTN participates in multiple cellular functions that require cytoskeletal rearrangement, including lamellipodia formation, cell migration, invasion, and various other processes dependent upon the cell type involved. The role of CTTN in vascular endothelial cells is particularly important for promoting barrier integrity and inhibiting vascular permeability and tissue edema. To mediate its functional effects, CTTN undergoes multiple post-translational modifications and interacts with numerous other proteins to alter cytoskeletal structures and signaling mechanisms. In the present review, we briefly describe CTTN structure, post-translational modifications, and protein binding partners and then focus on its role in regulating cellular processes and well-established functional mechanisms, primarily in vascular endothelial cells and disease models.

Hence, monitoring plasma ceramide concentration, can be a valuable tool for measuring effects of therapies on COVID-19 respiratory distress patients.","output":"Inferring a causal relationship between ceramide levels and COVID-19 respiratory distress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: After initial studies suggested that pregnant women were not at a higher risk of complications due to COVID\\\\19 infection. Recent investigations from Sweden and the US have indicated that pregnant and postpartum women are at increased risk of severe complications associated with COVID\\\\19. This study aims to find out the prevalence of maternal mortality and the clinical course of maternal mortality cases due to COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 1st, 2020, to April 30th, 2021, at Postgraduate Institute and YCM Hospital Pimpri Pune (Maharashtra), a dedicated COVID hospital during COVID pandemic. During study period, all pregnant women who were diagnosed to have COVID-19 infection by RT PCR/Rapid Antigen Test were admitted and were enrolled for the study. AIM: To audit the maternal mortality due to COVID-19 infection. PRIMARY: To estimate the prevalence of maternal mortality due to COVID-19 infection in obstetric patients. SECONDARY: To systematically study and analyze the clinical course of infection in mothers who had mortality due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Data collected in standard format regarding Demography, clinical presentation, need for ICU/HDU, CXR findings, laboratory parameters and cases with maternal mortality were studied in detail to fulfill the study objectives. RESULTS: Among 871 COVID-19 cases diagnosed during pregnancy, nine patients had maternal mortality due to covid pneumonia. There was no obvious obstetric cause for mortality in these cases. The prevalence of maternal mortality was 0.01 (1.03%). Cases with maternal mortality were mostly in 3rd Trimester (5 of 9 cases) and presented with moderate to severe illness with breathlessness and myalgia in all 9 cases, cough and fever in 7 out of 9 cases, Tachypneoa was noted in all patients. Saturation below 90 in 6 cases and below 94 in 3 cases. Chest X-ray showed bilateral lung affection in all 9 cases. Leukocytosis with raised N:L ratio was predominantly seen, thrombocytopenia noted in 5 cases and elevated levels of acute phase reactants and inflammatory markers such as CRP, S. ferritin, ESR, LDH, D-dimer and S. fibrinogen was observed. None of the study participants received vaccine for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pneumonia is an additional toll for maternal mortality. Obstetric patients in 2nd and 3rd trimester having COVID-19 infection with late presentation to hospital, moderate to severe disease (RR > 30 min), with raised inflammatory markers (N:L ratio, CRP, Ferritin, d-Dimer, etc.) at presentation, having bilateral lung affection are at risk of poor maternal outcome.","output":"Prevalence of Maternal Mortality and Clinical Course of Maternal Deaths in COVID-19 Pneumonia-A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outcomes and costs of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) contact tracing are limited. During MarchCMay 2020, we constructed transmission chains from 184 index cases and 1,499 contacts in Salt Lake County, Utah, USA, to assess outcomes and estimate staff time and salaries. We estimated 1,102 staff hours and $29,234 spent investigating index cases and contacts.

To date, only a handful of studies have explored the emotional impact of the pandemic surrounding pregnancy and none have investigated the consequence of pandemic-related social restrictions on the postpartum mood of those living among different socioeconomic status (SES). All postpartum patients appearing to the Mount Sinai Health System for their postpartum appointment between January 2, 2020 and June 30, 2020, corresponding to before and during pandemic imposed social restrictions, were screened for mood symptomatology using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Each patient's socioeconomic status (high/low) was determined by their location of clinical service. A total of 516 postpartum patients were screened. While no differences in EPDS scores were observed by SES prior to social restrictions (U = 7956.0, z = - 1.05, p = .293), a significant change in mood symptomatology was observed following COVID-19 restrictions (U = 4895.0, z = - 3.48, p < .001), with patients living in lower SES reporting significantly less depression symptomatology (U = 9209.0, z = - 4.56, p < .001). There was no change in symptomatology among patients of higher SES (U = 4045.5, z = - 1.06, p = .288). Postpartum depression, the most common complication of childbearing, is a prevalent, cross-cultural disorder with significant morbidity. The observed differences in postpartum mood between patients of different SES in the context of temporarily imposed COVID-19-related social restrictions present a unique opportunity to better understand the specific health and social support needs of postpartum patients living in urban economic poverty. Given that maternal mental illness has negative long-term developmental implications for the offspring and that poor mental health reinforces the poverty cycle, future health policy specifically directed towards supporting postpartum women living in low SES by ameliorating some of the early maternal burdens associated with balancing employment-family-childcare demands may assist in interrupting this cycle while simultaneously improving the long-term outcomes of their offspring.","output":"Postpartum mood among universally screened high and low socioeconomic status patients during COVID-19 social restrictions in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the birth of Christ, in these 2019 years, the man on earth has never experienced a survival challenge from any acellular protist compared to SARS-CoV-2 No specific drugs yet been approved The host immunity is the only alternative to prevent and or reduce the infection and mortality rate as well Here, a novel mechanism of melanin mediated host immunity is proposed having potent biotechnological prospects in health care management of COVID-19 Vitamin D is known to enhance the rate of melanin synthesis;and this may concurrently regulate the expression of furin expression In silico analyses have revealed that the intermediates of melanin are capable of binding strongly with the active site of furin protease On the other hand, furin expression is negatively regulated via 1--hydroxylase (CYP27B1), that belongs to vitamin-D pathway and controls cellular calcium levels Here, we have envisaged the availability of biological melanin and elucidated the bio-medical potential Thus, we propose a possible synergistic application of melanin and the enzyme CYP27B1 (regulates vitamin D biosynthesis) as a novel strategy to prevent viral entry through the inactivation of furin protease and aid in boosting our immunity at the cellular and humoral levels","output":"Synergy of melanin and vitamin-D may play a fundamental role in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections and halt COVID-19 by inactivating furin protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)), a highly toxic mycotoxin, always contaminated in a variety of agricultural products.

In this study, to avoid the dependence on the large animals, the camelized, murine antibody (cVHs) against AFB(1) was prepared in vitro based on the identities between murine VH and camelid VHH and then to develop an immunoassay for AFB(1). A murine anti-AFB(1) VH fragment (VH-2E6) was selected for camelization through replacement of conserved hydrophobic residues in framework region 2 (FR2) (cVH-FR2), point mutation at position 103 in the FR4 region (cVH-103), and CDR3-grafted with a high AFB(1)-affinity VHH (cVH-Nb26).

These studies identified atovaquone as a promising candidate for inhibiting viral replication. METHODS: Enrolled patients were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to atovaquone 1500 mg twice daily versus matched placebo. Patients received standard of care treatment including remdesivir, dexamethasone, or convalescent plasma as deemed necessary by the treating team. Patients agreed to allow collection of saliva at baseline and twice a day while hospitalized or up to 10 days. Saliva was collected and RNA extracted for viral load (VL) measurement by Real-time PCR. Our primary outcome was to examine the between group differences in log transformed VL(copies/mL) using generalized linear mixed-effect models of repeated measures from all samples. Additional analysis of Atovquone plasma concentrations were examined and correlated with viral load and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Of the 61 patients enrolled; 41 were received atovaquone and 19 placebo. Overall the population was predominately male Hispanic with a mean age of 51 years. The two groups were balanced (Table 1) with regard to age, gender, race, co-morbidities, days from onset of symptoms, baseline oxygen requirements, and receipt of COVID-19 specific standard of care treatment. A higher proportion with diabetes was noted in the Atovaquone arm. The log(10) VL was 5.25 copies/mL vs. 4.79 copies/mL at baseline in the atovaquone vs. placebo group. Although there was a decrease in VL over time, there was no differences between the atovaquone plus standard of care arm versus the standard of care arm (Figure 1). Additional analysis of atovaquone plasma concentration demonstrated a wide variation in atovaquone levels, inverse association between atovaquone levels and BMI (rho -0.44, p=0.03), and Day 5 concentrations and VL (rho -0.54, p=0.005).

COVID-19 has a negative impact on all elements of health: social, physical and mental. Pharmacotherapy, as well as protective measures (isolation, wearing masks and maintaining physical distance) did not give the expected results. Vaccination has not yet led to herd immunity, so it is still jeopardizing every aspect of human health (1, 2). Non-pharmacological methods, such as stress and sleep control, physical activity and contact with nature are of great importance since they can significantly contribute to staying healthy during a pandemic. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of non-pharmacological measures such as stress and sleep control (with different measures against the negative effects of anxiety and depression on mental state) and the possible positive impact of forest bathing on improving the immune response to the virus and its consequences. METHODS: Available evidence-based studies on ways to com- bat stress and the effect of the proposed measures on human mental health and the im- mune system were analyzed. From the mentioned studies, recommended measures have been registered, which refer to stress and sleep control, diet and eating habits, contact with nature (forest bathing, gardening), virtual communication and meditation (mindfulness practice). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The combined results of these studies indicate that COVID-19 has a chronic course and complications that significantly affect the physical, mental and emotional state of the patient. Proven positive effects of non-pharmacological measures can be applied in the daily practice of primary health care in the comprehensive fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Non-pharmacological measures such as stress and sleep control, spending time in nature, healthy diet, and physical activity may improve the immune response to COVID-19. These measures, with their positive effects on all aspects of health, can make a major contribution to controlling and improving the quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Non-Pharmacological Measures in the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To report our experience with single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for cholecystectomy and to perform a retrospective comparison with conventional 4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

This included patient demographic data and intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. INTERVENTIONS Four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy and SILS for cholecystectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Operative time, conversion to open operation, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS Operative time was longer with SILS for cholecystectomy compared with conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (P < .001). A correlation was seen between reducing SILS operative time and increasing experience (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, -0.29). Three patients in the SILS for cholecystectomy group required the addition of extra laparoscopic ports. No patients in the SILS for cholecystectomy group required conversion to open surgery compared with 4 patients in the standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. Patients stayed an average of 0.76 days following SILS for cholecystectomy and 1.53 days following conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Under current clinical paradigms, both human and animal health professionals routinely diagnose and treat zoonotic infectious diseases in their patients, but tend to work in parallel with little cross-professional communication or coordination of care. For this to evolve toward a One Health model, both types of clinicians need to see how individual cases can be sentinel events indicating environmental risk for disease emergence, and develop mechanisms of rapid communication about these risks. Human and animal clinicians also need to take a more proactive and preventive approach to zoonotic diseases that includes the occupational health of animal workers in farms, laboratories, veterinary clinics, and other settings, as well as the recognition of increased risk among immunocompromised individuals in contact with animals. This requires training in One Health clinical competencies including the ability to diagnose and treat zoonotic diseases, implement preventive care interventions for individual patients, provide occupational health services for animal workers, recognize sentinel cases, report cases to public heath and clinical colleagues, and assess and help to intervene with environmental factors driving infectious disease risk in humans and animals.

METHODS: 92 women from Canada and the United States (ages 20C45 years) whose fertility treatments had been cancelled were recruited via social media. Participants completed a battery of questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms, perceived mental health impact, and change in quality of life related to treatment suspensions. Potential predictors of psychological outcomes were also examined, including several personality traits, aspects of social support, illness cognitions, and coping strategies. RESULTS: 52% of respondents endorsed clinical levels of depressive symptoms. On a 7-point scale, participants endorsed a significant decline in overall quality of life (M(SD) = -1.3(1.3), p < .0001) as well as a significant decline in mental health related to treatment suspensions on a scale from -5 to +5 (M(SD) = -2.1(2.1), p < .001).

A serum amylase concentration of 130 units/l or more on postoperative day (POD) 0 has been shown to be an objective surrogate of pancreatic texture, a determinant of PSCs. This study evaluated serial measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP) to refine PSC risk stratification. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing PD between 2008 and 2014, with vascular resection if required and without preoperative chemoradiotherapy, had serum investigations from the day before operation until discharge. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to identify a threshold value of serum CRP with clinically relevant PSCs for up to 30 days after discharge as outcome measure. RESULTS Of 230 patients, 95 (413 per cent) experienced a clinically relevant PSC. A serum CRP level of 180 mg/l or higher on POD 2 was associated with PSCs, prolonged critical care stay and relaparotomy (all P < 0050). Patients with a serum amylase concentration of 130 units/l or more on POD 0 who developed a serum CRP level of at least 180 mg/l on POD 2 had a higher incidence of morbidity. Patients were stratified into high-, intermediate- and low-risk groups using these markers. The low-risk category was associated with a negative predictive value of 865 per cent for development of clinically relevant PSCs. There were no deaths among 52 patients in the low-risk group, but seven deaths among 79 (9 per cent) in the high-risk group. CONCLUSION A serum amylase level below 130 units/l on POD 0 combined with a serum CRP level under 180 mg/l on POD 2 constitutes a low-risk profile following PD, and may help identify patients suitable for early discharge.","output":"Serum amylase and C-reactive protein in risk stratification of pancreas-specific complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Increasing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment uptake is key to eliminating HCV infection as a public health threat in Canada. People living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection face barriers to HCV treatment initiation. We sought to identify interventions that could support HCV treatment initiation based on patient and HCV care provider perspectives. METHODS: Eleven people living with HIV with a history of HCV infection and 12 HCV care providers were recruited for this qualitative descriptive study. Participants created ranked-ordered lists of potential interventions during nominal groups (n = 4) and individual interviews (n = 6). Following the nominal group technique, transcripts and intervention lists underwent thematic analysis and ranking scores were merged to create consolidated and prioritized lists from patient and provider perspectives. RESULTS: Patient participants identified a total of eight interventions. The highest-ranked interventions were multidisciplinary clinics, HCV awareness campaigns and patient education, nurse-or pharmacist-led care, peer involvement, and more and better-prepared health professionals. Provider participants identified 11 interventions. The highest-ranked were mobile outreach, DAA initiation at pharmacies, a simplified process of DAA prescription, integration of primary and specialist care, and patient-centred approaches. CONCLUSION: Participants proposed alternatives to hospital-based specialist HCV care, which require increasing capacity for nurses, pharmacists, primary care providers, and peers to have more direct roles in HCV treatment provision. They also identified the need for structural changes and educational initiatives. In addition to optimizing HCV care, these interventions might result in broader benefits for the health of HIVCHCV co-infected people.","output":"Potential interventions to support HCV treatment uptake among HIV co-infected people in Canada: Perceptions of patients and health care providers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research Objective Central the COVID-19 pandemic response are registered nurses (nurses), making life and death decisions amidst personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages and scarcity in other resources (e.g., ventilators, medications, staff). Emerging international evidence suggests nurses are at higher risk for detrimental psychosocial outcomes related to the pandemic, such as anxiety, depression, and sleep problems, compared to other clinician groups. The objective of this research is to describe the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses currently practicing in the U.S. Study Design We conducted a concurrent mixed methods study from May-August 2020. Participants were recruited through email listservs from regional professional nursing organizations, NIOSH-funded Education and Research Centers nationwide, and through social media. Through REDCap, participants completed researcher-developed sociodemographic and work characteristic questions (e.g., unit type, staffing levels, availability of PPE), and several validated instruments to measure depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire;PHQ-9), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder;GAD-7), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index;ISI), and resilience (Connor Davidson Resilience Scale;CD-RISC-10). A subset of participants was purposefully selected for semi-structured individual phone interviews to achieve maximum variation. Following data collection, we randomly drew 10 participants to receive a $50 Amazon giftcard. Population Studied We recruited a sample of nurses from 36 states and the District of Columbia. The analytic sample included N=629 for the survey and N=34 for the interviews. We report only survey findings herein. Principal Findings Participants were on average 43?years old (SD 13), 92% female, and 80% White;92% were non-Hispanic. Three-quarters (76%) worked in inpatient hospital settings;20% worked in intensive care or step-down units. Approximately 70% of the sample worked day shifts and 59% worked 12-hour shifts. Out of a list of 13 common PPE items, 91% of the sample reported at least one PPE shortage since the pandemic began, and 24% reported bringing or making their own PPE for use at work. Over one in four (28%) nurses reported being unsure or planned to leave their employer in the next year. About 18% of the sample scored ?15 on the ISI, suggesting insomnia symptoms significant enough to warrant evaluation and treatment. A third of participants (34%) had scores reflecting mild anxiety, a quarter (24%) had scores reflecting moderate anxiety, and 9% scored in the range reflecting severe anxiety on the GAD-7. Reports on the PHQ-9 showed 9% of the sample with scores consistent with major depressive disorder while another 7% scored in the range consistent with other depressive disorder. Finally, the average CD-RISC score was 29, with lower scores indicating lower resilience (range 0-40). Conclusions As with other countries, U.S. nurses are facing highly stressful working conditions, with warning signals indicated in the psychosocial domains of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Overall, resilience levels are worse than pre-pandemic levels from previously published literature.

However, cellular features of recovered patients and long-term health consequences remain largely unexplored. In this study, we collected peripheral blood samples from recovered COVID-19 patients (average age of 35.7 years old) from Hubei province, China, 3 months after discharge; and carried out RNA-seq and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to identify hallmarks of recovered COVID-19 patients. Our analyses showed significant changes both in expression and DNA methylation of genes and transposable elements (TEs) in recovered COVID-19 patients. We identified 639 misregulated genes and 18516 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in total. Genes with aberrant expression and DMRs were found to be associated with immune responses and other related biological processes, implicating prolonged overreaction of the immune system in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, a significant amount of TEs were aberrantly activated and TE activation was positively correlated with COVID-19 severity. Moreover, differentially methylated TEs may regulate adjacent gene expression as regulatory elements. Those identified transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures define and drive the features of recovered COVID-19 patients, helping determine the risks of long COVID-19, and providing guidance for clinical intervention.","output":"Transcriptome and DNA methylome analysis of peripheral blood samples reveals incomplete restoration and transposable element activation after 3-month recovery of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We sought to identify potentially modifiable determinants associated with variability in leptomeningeal collateral status in patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS Data are from the Keimyung Stroke Registry. Consecutive patients with M1 segment middle cerebral artery  intracranial internal carotid artery occlusions on baseline computed tomographic angiography (CTA) from May 2004 to July 2009 were included. Baseline and follow-up imaging was analyzed blinded to all clinical information. Two raters assessed leptomeningeal collaterals on baseline CTA by consensus, using a previously validated regional leptomeningeal score (rLMC). RESULTS Baseline characteristics (N = 206) were: mean age = 66.9  11.6 years, median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale = 14 (interquartile range [IQR] = 11-20), and median time from stroke symptom onset to CTA = 166 minutes (IQR = 96-262). Poor collateral status at baseline (rLMC score = 0-10) was seen in 73 of 206 patients (35.4%). On univariate analyses, patients with poor collateral status at baseline were older; were hypertensive; had higher white blood cell count, blood glucose, D-dimer, and serum uric acid levels; and were more likely to have metabolic syndrome. Multivariate modeling identified metabolic syndrome (odds ratio [OR] = 3.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.69-6.15, p < 0.001), hyperuricemia (per 1mg/dl serum uric acid; OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.12-1.62, p < 0.01), and older age (per 10 years; OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.02-1.77, p = 0.03) as independent predictors of poor leptomeningeal collateral status at baseline.

Nonetheless, current endeavors mostly focus on Euclidean data, and its formulation for graph-structured data is not clear and remains under-explored, given two-fold fundamental challenges: 1) the inter-connection among nodes in one graph, which induces non-IID generation of data points even under the same environment, and 2) the structural information in the input graph, which is also informative for prediction. In this paper, we formulate the OOD problem on graphs and develop a new invariant learning approach, Explore-to-Extrapolate Risk Minimization (EERM), that facilitates graph neural networks to leverage invariance principles for prediction. EERM resorts to multiple context explorers (specified as graph structure editers in our case) that are adversarially trained to maximize the variance of risks from multiple virtual environments. Such a design enables the model to extrapolate from a single observed environment which is the common case for node-level prediction. We prove the validity of our method by theoretically showing its guarantee of a valid OOD solution and further demonstrate its power on various real-world datasets for handling distribution shifts from artificial spurious features, cross-domain transfers and dynamic graph evolution.","output":"Handling Distribution Shifts on Graphs: An Invariance Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: C5AR2 (GPR77, C5L2) is the second receptor for C5a that is a potent protein generated by complement activation. C5AR2 can mediate its own signaling events and exert significant immunomodulatory effects through those events. However, research of C5AR2 in cancer is limited, and its function remains unclear in breast cancer. METHODS: The expression of C5AR2 and its correlations with prognosis, immune infiltration, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) in more than thirty types of cancers were described through GTEx, TCGA, PrognoScan, TIMER2.0, CCLE, HPA, and TISIDB database. C5AR2 showed strong relationships to those immune marker sets in breast cancer. Otherwise, CCK8 assay and Transwell assay were conducted to illustrate the role of C5AR2 in migration, invasion, and proliferation of breast cancer cells. RESULTS: Generally, C5AR2 expression differed across most cancerous and noncancerous tissues, and high C5AR2 expression significantly related to poor prognosis in BRCA, GBM, KICH, LAML, LGG, LIHC, PAAD, and STAD. Moreover, C5AR2 expression levels were dramatically correlated with recognized immune infiltration, especially the polarization of macrophages in breast cancer. Gene set enrichment analysis confirmed that C5AR2 participates in regulating multiple signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis as well as tumor immunity. C5AR2 overexpression facilitated the functions such as migration, invasion, and proliferation in breast cancer cells, which is consistent with bioinformatics analysis. CONCLUSIONS: C5AR2 is involved in immune infiltration and malignant characteristics of breast cancer, which may be a prospective biomarker for breast cancer.","output":"An Integrated Analysis of C5AR2 Related to Malignant Properties and Immune Infiltration of Breast Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: lack of medical practitioners knowledge about oral cancer has contributed to delays in referral and treatment. Oral cancer is amenable to treatment when detected early, which leads to better prognosis and survival rates. In this study, we aimed to assess the knowledge of the Syrian medical students about the risk factors of oral cancer, oral cavity changes associated with oral cancer, and the relation between the relation with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) and oral cancer. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted at the Syrian Private University. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires, which targeted social demographic information, general knowledge, risk factors, oral changes and HPV knowledge associated with oral cancer. Data was categorized and analyzed to assess and compare the levels of knowledge between clinical and preclinical students. RESULTS: 301 out of 401 medical students responded to the questionnaires bringing the response rate to 75.25%. The study revealed adequate knowledge about oral cancer, general information, clinical features, risk factors and relation to HPV. Clinical students showed higher levels of awareness compared to pre-clinical students. No significance in knowledge was found between the genders.

We found that companies always adopt IoT when equipment operation cost is low and not when the cost is high. Otherwise, the optimal IoT adoption strategy for a company depends on multiple factors, for example, the internal operation efficiency of a company. Providing high-traceability service as one kind of public service does not necessarily optimize social welfare even if the overall delivery failure is reduced. The customers preference for traceability significantly affects the companys decision.

The country has also experienced the worst economic recession in its history, with real GDP contracting 7% in 2020. This paper describes Colombia's pre-pandemic context and the overall effect of the pandemic on health and economic indicators and examines the government's response to COVID-19. METHODS: Descriptive chronologic policy analysis on the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia and the measures and interventions implemented, using publicly available secondary data from Colombia's official agencies and international sources published from March 2020 to February 2022. RESULTS: The Colombian healthcare system increased its capacity in terms of infrastructure and human resources (from 8.6 ICU beds per 100,000 pre-pandemic to 21.9 in 2020, from 1.7 to 1.3 per 1000 doctors and nurses, respectively in 2019 to 1.8 and 1.5 per 1000 in 2020). The government commenced the National Vaccination Strategy on February 17, 2021, despite a slow start it managed to fully vaccinate 65.1% of its population, including Venezuelan immigrants, by February 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Colombia's response to the pandemic combines hits and misses. The country organized an early and robust response; increased its healthcare system capacity; designed a risk-based, equitable, and inclusive national vaccination strategy; and introduced a flexible and responsive vaccine rollout. However, the government chose the wrong timing for reform, implemented a long and unpredictable lockdown, was late to procure COVID-19 vaccines and has not appropriately tackled vaccine hesitancy. PUBLIC INTEREST SUMMARY: Colombia has been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 138,000 COVID-19 deaths and over 6 million cases by the end of February 2022. According to number of deaths per 100,000 people, Colombia ranks 22nd in the world, among 187 countries. The country has also experienced the worst economic recession in its history. The Colombian healthcare system has been able to cope with a high number of COVID-19 cases without collapsing, but some public health indicators deteriorated.

Wide variability in the implementation of practices designed to promote patient and family engagement in hospitals has been noted. Approaches aimed at promoting patient and family engagement in treatment share the over-arching goal of changing behaviors of patients, families, and healthcare providers and possibly administrators. Behavior change techniques (BCTs) can be a key element of patient and family engagement approaches. This scoping review will contribute to the development of an evidence base detailing that the BCTs have potential to be effective in patient and family engagement interventions. The specific objectives of this review are to (a) identify and classify approaches used in acute care hospitals to engage patient and families in treatment according to the behavior change technique taxonomy; and (b) evaluate and synthesize the outcomes for these approaches for patients and families, healthcare providers, and health administrators/funders. METHODS This systematic scoping review will allow us to determine the extent, range, and nature of research activity related to initiatives designed to promote patient and family engagement in care. A comprehensive electronic literature search will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Studies will be included if they report on outcomes of a structured or systematic approach to the promotion of adult inpatient and family engagement in treatment in acute care settings. Studies will be selected in a two-stage screening process (title and abstract; full text) and quality will be assessed using the mixed methods assessment tool. Data extraction will include narrative descriptions of the intervention and classification of the behavior change techniques employed. DISCUSSION This review aims to identify and classify the specific behavior change techniques underpinning patient and family engagement interventions used in acute care hospital settings.

In the current study, a prophylactic MAYV vaccine expressing the complete viral structural polyprotein was developed based on a non-replicating human adenovirus V (AdV) platform. Vaccination with AdV-MAYV elicited potent neutralizing antibodies that protected WT mice against MAYV challenge by preventing viremia, reducing viral dissemination to tissues and mitigating viral disease. The vaccine also prevented viral-mediated demise in IFN?R1(-/-) mice. Passive transfer of immune serum from vaccinated animals similarly prevented infection and disease in WT mice as well as virus-induced demise of IFN?R1(-/-) mice, indicating that antiviral antibodies are protective. Immunization with AdV-MAYV also generated cross-neutralizing antibodies against two related arthritogenic alphavirusesCchikungunya and Una viruses.

Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is urgently required to improve the efficiency of clinical diagnosis of TB using computed tomography (CT) images. However, classical machine learning with handcrafted features generally has low accuracy, and deep learning with self-extracting features relies heavily on the size of medical datasets. Therefore, CAD, which effectively fuses multimodal features, is an alternative solution for spinal TB detection. METHODS: A new deep learning method is proposed that fuses four elaborate image features, specifically three handcrafted features and one convolutional neural network (CNN) feature. Spinal TB CT images were collected from 197 patients with spinal TB, from 2013 to 2020, in the Peoples Hospital of Tibet Autonomous Region, China; 3,000 effective lumbar spine CT images were randomly screened to our dataset, from which two sets of 1,500 images each were classified as tuberculosis (positive) and health (negative). In addition, virtual data augmentation is proposed to enlarge the handcrafted features of the TB dataset. Essentially, the proposed multimodal feature fusion CNN consists of four main sections: matching network, backbone (ResNet-18/50, VGG-11/16, DenseNet-121/161), fallen network, and gated information fusion network. Detailed performance analyses were conducted based on the multimodal features, proposed augmentation, model stability, and model-focused heatmap. RESULTS: Experimental results showed that the proposed model with VGG-11 and virtual data augmentation exhibited optimal performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and area under curve. In addition, an inverse relationship existed between the model size and test accuracy. The model-focused heatmap also shifted from the irrelevant region to the bone destruction caused by TB. CONCLUSION: The proposed augmentation effectively simulated the real data distribution in the feature space. More importantly, all the evaluation metrics and analyses demonstrated that the proposed deep learning model exhibits efficient feature fusion for multimodal features.

However, numerosity is underestimated when a few items are connected by illusory contours (ICs) lines without changing other physical cues, suggesting in turn that numerosity processing may rely on discrete visual input. Yet, in these previous works, ICs were generated by black-on-gray inducers producing an illusory brightness enhancement, which could represent a further continuous sensory confound. To rule out this possibility, we tested participants in a numerical discrimination task in which we manipulated the alignment of 0, 2, or 4 pairs of open/closed inducers and their contrast polarity. In Experiment 1, aligned open inducers had only one polarity (all black or all white) generating ICs lines brighter or darker than the gray background. In Experiment 2, open inducers had always opposite contrast polarity (one black and one white inducer) generating ICs without strong brightness enhancement. In Experiment 3, reverse-contrast inducers were aligned but closed with a line preventing ICs completion. Results showed that underestimation triggered by ICs lines was independent of inducer contrast polarity in both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, whereas no underestimation was found in Experiment 3. Taken together, these results suggest that mere brightness enhancement is not the primary cause of the numerosity underestimation induced by ICs lines. Rather, a boundary formation mechanism insensitive to contrast polarity may drive the effect, providing further support to the idea that numerosity processing exploits discrete inputs.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Keratoconus patients, aged 18 to 40, with a refractive error between -6 and +4 diopters were considered eligible. An uncorrected visual acuity and an assessment of refractive error was taken web-based (index test) and by manifest refraction (reference test) by an optometrist. Corrected visual acuity was assessed with the prescription derived from both the web-based tool and the manifest refraction. Non-inferiority was defined as the 95% limits-of-agreement (95%LoA) of the differences in spherical equivalent between the index and reference test not exceeding +/- 0.5 diopters. Agreement was assessed by a Bland-Altman analyses. RESULTS: A total of 100 eyes of 50 patients were examined. The overall mean difference of the uncorrected visual acuity measured -0.01 LogMAR (95%LoA:-0.63C0.60). The variability of the differences decreased in the better uncorrected visual acuity subgroup (95%LoA:-0.25C0.55). The overall mean difference in spherical equivalent between the index and reference test exceeded the non-inferiority margin: -0.58D (95%LoA:-4.49C3.33, P = 0.008). The mean differences for myopic and hyperopic subjects were 0.09 diopters (P = 0.675) and -2.06 diopters (P<0.001), respectively. The corrected visual acuities attained with the web-based derived prescription underachieved significantly (0.220.32 logMAR vs. -0.010.13 LogMAR, P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Regarding visual acuity, the web-based tool shows promising results for remotely assessing visual acuity in keratoconus patients, particularly for subjects within a better visual acuity range. This could provide physicians with a quantifiable outcome to enhance teleconsultations, especially relevant when access to health care is limited. Regarding the assessment of the refractive error, the web-based tool was found to be inferior to the manifest refraction in keratoconus patients. This study underlines the importance of validating digital tools and could serve to increase overall safety of the web-based assessments by better identification of outlier cases.","output":"The evaluation of a web-based tool for measuring the uncorrected visual acuity and refractive error in keratoconus eyes: A method comparison study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity in asymptomatic pregnant women admitted to hospital for delivery in a Turkish pandemic center. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective cohort study was conducted in Ankara City Hospital between April, 15, 2020 and June, 5, 2020. A total of 206 asymptomatic pregnant women (103 low-risk pregnant women without any defined risk factor and 103 high-risk pregnant women) were screened for SARS-CoV-2 positivity upon admission to hospital for delivery. Detection of SARS-CoV2 in nasopharyngeal samples was performed by Real Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method targeting RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) gene. Two groups were compared in terms of demographic features, clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. RESULTS: Three of the 206 pregnant women participating in the study had positive RT-PCR tests (1.4%) and all positive cases were in the high-risk pregnancy group. Although, one case in the high-risk pregnancy group had developed symptoms highly suspicious for COVID-19, two repeated RT-PCR tests were negative. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity rate was significantly higher in the high-risk pregnancy group (2.9% vs 0%, p = 0.04).

This virus is the causative agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and spreads primarily through human-to-human transmission via infected droplets and aerosols generated by infected persons. Although COVID-19 is a respiratory virus, the potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via food is considered theoretically possible and remains a concern for Canadian consumers. We have conducted an exposure assessment of the likelihood of exposure of SARS-CoV-2 in Canadian food sources at the time of consumption. This article describes the exposure routes considered most relevant in the context of food contamination with SARS-CoV-2, including contaminated food of animal origin, other contaminated fresh foods, fomites, and SARS-CoV-2-contaminated feces. The likelihood of foodborne infection of SARS-CoV-2 via the human digestive tract also was considered. Our analysis indicates that there is no evidence that foodborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred, and we consider the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 via food and food packaging in Canada as low to remote.

The aim of this multicentre nationwide prospective cross-sectional survey was to evaluate the impact of pandemic on emotional status and fear of SARS-CoV-2 contagion in a cohort of elective surgical patients in Italy, scheduled for surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Twenty-nine Italian centres were involved in the study, for a total of 2376 patients surveyed (mean age of 58 years  16.61; 49.6% males). The survey consisted of 28 total closed questions, including four study outcome questions. More than half of patients had at least one chronic disease (54%), among which cardiovascular diseases were the commonest (58%). The most frequent type of surgery was abdominal (20%), under general anaesthesia (64%). Almost half of the patients (46%) declared to be frightened of going to the hospital for routine checkups; 55% to be afraid of getting SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization and 62% were feared of being hospitalised without seeing family members. Having an oncological disease and other patient-related, centre-related or perioperative factors were independently associated with an increased risk of fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization and of being hospitalised without seeing family members. A previous infection due to SARS-COV-2 was associated with a reduced risk of worse emotional outcomes and fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization. Patients who showed the most emotionally vulnerable profile (e.g. use of sleep-inducing drugs, higher fear of surgery or anaesthesia) were at higher risk of worse emotional status towards the hospitalization during COVID-19 pandemic. Being operated in hospitals with lower surgical volume and with COVID-19 wards was associated with worse emotional status and fear of contagion. CONCLUSIONS: Additional fear and worse emotional status may be frequent in patients scheduled for elective surgery during COVID-19 pandemic. More than half of the participants to the survey were worried about not being able to receive family visits. Psychological support may be considered for patients at higher risk of psychological distress to improve perioperative wellbeing during the pandemic.

However, the management of these two conditions has rarely been discussed. We aimed to describe the clinical outcomes of pleural drainage in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 17 pleural drainages were performed in 11 critically ill patients with pneumothorax or hydrothorax. Either chest tubes or central venous catheters (CVCs) were used. The clinical outcomes, including respiratory and circulation indicators at 24 h and 1 h before the procedure and 24 h and 48 h after the procedure, were retrospectively recorded. RESULTS: (1) Following pleural drainage, there was a 19.1% improvement in the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio from 147.4 mmHg (-1 h) to 175.5 mmHg (24 h), while the mean positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) decreased from 10.7 cmH(2)O (-1 h) to 8.9 cmH(2)O (24 h) and 8.1 cmH(2)O (48 h). The A-a gradients decreased from 313.3 mmHg (-1 h) to 261.3 mmHg (24 h). (2) The dosage of norepinephrine increased from 0.15 g/kg/min (-1 h) to 0.40 g/kg/min (24 h). (3) No haemorrhagic or infectious complications were observed. (4) A total of 41.6% of CVCs were partially or fully obstructed, while no chest tubes were obstructed. CONCLUSION: For critically ill patients with COVID-19, pleural drainage leads to a significant improvement in oxygenation and gas exchange, but the deterioration of circulation is not reversed.

To date, there have been no studies that have examined the readability of meningococcal vaccine patient-facing information, including information contained within the vaccine PIL. Given the role of pharmacists in presenting PILs to patients, it was, therefore, the aim of this study to quantitatively analyse the readability of Patient Leaflets, which accompany licensed meningococcal vaccines in the UK and US and to compare PILs to vaccine pharmaceutical manufacturers' summary of product characteristics (SPC), as well as other patient-facing vaccine-related information. METHODS Five sources of meningococcal vaccine information were examined for the licensed meningococcal vaccines in the UK (Bexsero, Menveo, Menitorix, Trumenba, Nimenrix & NeisVac-C) and in the United States (Bexsero, Menveo, Trumenba, Menactra, Menomune-A/C/Y/W-135, Menquadfi), including as follows: (i) SPC (Electronic Medicines Compendium, UK), (ii) Package Insert (FDA; USA), (iii) Patient Leaflet (Electronic Medicines Compendium, UK), (iv) Vaccine pharmaceutical websites and (v) government web resources. Readability was examined employing 10 readability metrics, including the Flesch Reading Ease and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade level. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The information source with the greatest readability scores was the UK Patient Leaflet, which had a mean Flesch Reading Ease score of 58.1 and a mean Flesch-Kincaid Grade score of 7.3, followed by the US Department of Health & Human Services patient-facing website for vaccines (55.9 & 8, respectively), followed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Vaccine Information Statement (47.3 & 9.4, respectively). Pharmaceutical patient-facing websites for meningococcal vaccines had mean scores of 44.6 and 9.9, respectively. When compared with UK Patient Leaflets, pharmaceutical websites were statistically different with poorer readability with both Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level indices (p = 0.02 & p = 0.04, respectively). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION Pharmaceutical meningococcal vaccine PILs were easily read and had statistically significant good readability scores in comparison with vaccine SPCs and US Package Inserts, pharmaceutical product websites and other government patient-facing meningococcal vaccine information. Preparation of patient-facing materials of a complex topic, such as describing meningococcal vaccines, is difficult to accomplish. Although there is a plurality of sources of information through websites and social media, PILs are one of the few sources that are provided directly to patients. This underpins the potential importance of PILs and the importance of their readability. Adoption of readability calculators and scrutiny of materials for their readability will help authors develop materials with improved understanding for vaccine recipients, potentially leading to improved health literacy and vaccine uptake. Renewed efforts should be sought to promote the information within the PIL, thereby maximizing the value of this resource with vaccine recipients, their carers and family.","output":"Improving meningococcal MenACWY and 4CMenB/meningococcal group B vaccine-related health literacy in patients: Importance of readability of pharmaceutical Patient Leaflets."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives The pandemic COVID-19 currently reached 213 countries worldwide with nearly 9 million infected people and more than 460,000 deaths. Although several Chinese studies, describing the laboratory findings characteristics of this illness have been reported, European data are still scarce. Furthermore, previous studies often analyzed the averaged laboratory findings collected during the entire hospitalization period, whereas monitoring their time-dependent variations should give more reliable prognostic information. Methods We analyzed the time-dependent variations of 14 laboratory parameters in two groups of COVID-19 patients with, respectively, a positive (40 patients) or a poor (42 patients) outcome, admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy). We focused mainly on laboratory parameters that are routinely tested, thus, prognostic information would be readily available even in low-resource settings. Results Statistically significant differences between the two groups were observed for most of the laboratory findings analyzed. We showed that some parameters can be considered as early prognostic indicators whereas others exhibit statistically significant differences only at a later stage of the disease. Among them, earliest indicators were: platelets, lymphocytes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, white blood cells and neutrophils. Conclusions This longitudinal study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first study describing the laboratory characteristics of Italian COVID-19 patients on a normalized time-scale.

As of August 2021, only remdesivir has been approved in Japan as an antiviral drug for the treatment of COVID-19. However, in cases of kidney failure, remdesivir administration should be considered only if the therapeutic benefits outweigh the risks because of concern about the accumulation of its solubilizing excipient sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin and subsequent renal tubular injury or liver injury. Recently, reports from overseas indicating the safety of the use of remdesivir for COVID-19 patients on dialysis have been gathered. Case presentation From June 2021, in our hospital, we started the administration of remdesivir to patients with moderate cases of COVID-19 undergoing hemodialysis, with careful consideration of the dosage and timing. Since then, six out of seven COVID-19 patients on hemodialysis who had received remdesivir have completely recovered. In a patient who died, the initial dose of remdesivir was administered after the case developed into severe COVID-19. All six patients who were able to start receiving remdesivir immediately at the stage of moderate COVID-19 recovered and were discharged without the need for mechanical ventilation. While, two out of four patients before May 2021 who had not been administered remdesivir at admission became severe, transferred to another tertiary hospital, and died. During and after remdesivir administration, no increase in serum transaminase to five times or more of the normal upper limit was observed in any of the cases. There were no other adverse drug reactions, such as infusion reaction, gastrointestinal symptoms, or anemia. Conclusions We were able to administer remdesivir to six Japanese patients with moderate COVID-19 on hemodialysis safely. It is expected that the safe use of remdesivir will bring an increase in treatment options for moderate cases of COVID-19 in dialysis patients as well as subsequent improvement in treatment outcomes. However, to confirm the efficacy and safety of such use, further careful observation in more cases is required.","output":"Remdesivir administration for Japanese COVID-19 patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis: a retrospective observation with six case reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explores the implications of plastic waste and recycling management on recyclates for manufacturing clean-energy harvesting devices.

Both countries have strict recycling goals and have instituted different waste and recycling management regulations. The findings show that the waste policies and legislations, responsibilities and heterogeneity in collection systems and infrastructure of the respective country are the pivotal attributes to successful recycling. Challenges to recycle plastic include segregation, adulterants and macromolecular structure degradation which could influence the recyclate properties and pose challenges for manufacturing products. A model was developed to evaluate the economic value and mechanical potential of PET recyclate. The model predicted a 30% loss of material performance and a 65% loss of economic value after the first recycling cycle. The economic value depreciates to zero with decreasing mechanical performance of plastic after multiple recycling cycles. For understanding how TENG technology could be incorporated into the circular economy, a model has estimated about 20 million and 7300 billion pieces of aerogel mats can be manufactured from the PET bottles disposed in Singapore and India, respectively which were sufficient to produce small-scale TENG devices for all peoples in both countries.

Between 16 April and 15 June 2020, 2312 residual sera were collected from patients with a blood analysis conducted in one of the participating laboratories. Residual sera obtained from persons of all ages were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin G (IgG) using the EUROIMMUN enzyme immunoassay kit for semiquantitative detection of IgG antibodies against the S1 domain of viral spike protein (ELISA-S). Borderline and positive samples in ELISA-S were also tested with an in-house virus neutralization test (VNT). Prevalence values were adjusted for sex and age. A total of 1973 residual sera samples were included in the study. The overall seroprevalence based on ELISA-S was 5.27% (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.33C6.35) and 5.46% (4.51C6.57) after adjustment. Sex was not associated with IgG detection. However, significant differences were observed between age groups (p-value = 1 E-5). The highest values were observed among 10C19, 30C39, and 40C49 year-old age groups, ranging around 8C10%. The prevalence of neutralizing antibody titers 40 was 3% (2.28C3.84).

Recently, VR technology has proven its profound value in the psychological evaluation and treatment, rehabilitation, and immersive training of people in need. We have proposed, designed, and developed a VR rock-climbing game for youths with lower-limb dysfunction that allows them to engage in enjoyable and purposeful in-game tasks that simultaneously bring about intensive real-world exercise. METHODS: Pilot studies were conducted on college students whose lower limbs were fixed to chairs. Heart rate monitoring, a flow questionnaire, interviews, and observation were conducted for each participant to evaluate the impact of the VR rock-climbing game. The collected data were trimmed on the basis of Cronbach's alpha and corrected item-total correlation (CITC) to guarantee the data's reliability. RESULTS: The average value of each flow experience dimension was greater than 4 (0.76 < SD < 0.91). According to the flow-based analysis and the whole-process feeling distribution (WPFD), the evaluated study brought about the participants' happiness and a sense of mastery and achievement.

Treatment relies on the accurate diagnosis of hearing loss; however, this first step is out of reach for >80% of those affected. Increasingly automated approaches are being developed for self-administered digital hearing assessments without the direct involvement of professionals. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide an overview of digital approaches in automated and machine learning assessments of hearing using pure-tone audiometry and to focus on the aspects related to accuracy, reliability, and time efficiency. This review is an extension of a 2013 systematic review. METHODS: A search across the electronic databases of PubMed, IEEE, and Web of Science was conducted to identify relevant reports from the peer-reviewed literature. Key information about each reports scope and details was collected to assess the commonalities among the approaches. RESULTS: A total of 56 reports from 2012 to June 2021 were included. From this selection, 27 unique automated approaches were identified. Machine learning approaches require fewer trials than conventional threshold-seeking approaches, and personal digital devices make assessments more affordable and accessible. Validity can be enhanced using digital technologies for quality surveillance, including noise monitoring and detecting inconclusive results. CONCLUSIONS: In the past 10 years, an increasing number of automated approaches have reported similar accuracy, reliability, and time efficiency as manual hearing assessments. New developments, including machine learning approaches, offer features, versatility, and cost-effectiveness beyond manual audiometry.

Fecal samples collected five to eight days after diagnosis and three weeks after a negative COVID-19 PCR test were used for microbiome analysis. Except for two individuals, all subjects reported very mild and/or mild symptoms of COVID-19 and stayed at home under quarantine. Significant differences were not found in the bacterial flora of trained and untrained subjects. On the other hand, during COVID-19 infection, at the phylum level, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was elevated during COVID-19 compared to the level measured three weeks after a negative PCR test (p < 0.05) when all subjects were included in the statistical analysis. Since it is known that Bacteroidetes can suppress toll-like receptor 4 and ACE2-dependent signaling, thus enhancing resistance against pro-inflammatory cytokines, it is suggested that Bacteroidetes provide protection against severe COVID-19 infection.

While acute stress negatively impacts health, defining exact consequences and behavioral interventions can be difficult. We hypothesized that a generalized increase in stress and anxiety caused by continuation of the global pandemic would negatively impact sleep quality and that ever users of e-cigarettes and conventional tobacco would have more profound alterations over time. Participants were recruited via social media to complete an online survey in April 2020 (n = 554). Inhalant use was assessed through the UCSD Inhalant Questionnaire and sleep quality was gauged through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A set of participants (n = 217) retook the survey in June 2020. Inhalant usershistorical or current e-cigarette vapers, conventional tobacco smokers, and dual usershad higher PSQI scores than never smoker/never vapers, demonstrating worse sleep quality in inhalant users. Non-smoking/non-vaping subjects who retook the survey in June 2020 had improvement in their PSQI scores by paired t test, indicating better sleep quality as the pandemic continued, while inhalant users of all types had persistently high PSQI scores (poor sleep quality). These data suggest that ever users of tobacco products may be susceptible to overall diminished sleep quality in the setting of stressful life circumstances. These data also suggest that pandemic-initiated lifestyle changes may have led to improvements in sleep quality.

The burden of late effects across a large number of conditions, in-patient hospitalisation and critical care admissions have not been described using a population-based dataset. We aim to systematically quantify the cumulative burden of late effects across all cancer subtypes, treatment modalities and chemotherapy drug classes. METHODS: We employed primary care records linked to hospitals, the death registry and cancer registry from 1998C2020. CTYA survivors were 25 years or younger at the time of cancer diagnosis had survived 5 years post-diagnosis. Year-of-birth and sex-matched community controls were used for comparison. We considered nine treatment types, nine chemotherapy classes and 183 physical and mental health late effects. Cumulative burden was estimated using mean cumulative count, which considers recurring events. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the association between treatment exposures and late effects. Excess years of life lost (YLL) attributable to late effects were estimated. FINDINGS: Among 4,063 patients diagnosed with cancer, 3,466 survived  5 years (85%); 13,517 matched controls were identified. The cumulative burden of late effects at age 35 was the highest in survivors of leukaemia (23.52 per individual [95% CI:19.85C29.33]) and lowest in survivors of germ cell tumours (CI:6.04 [5.32C6.91]). In controls, the cumulative burden was 3.99 (CI:3.93C4.08) at age 35 years. When survivors reach age 45, the cumulative burden for immunological conditions and infections was the highest (3.27 [CI:3.01C3.58]), followed by cardiovascular conditions (3.08 [CI:1.98C3.29]). Survivors who received chemotherapy and radiotherapy had the highest disease burden compared to those who received surgery only. These patients also had the highest burden of hospitalisation (by age 45: 10.43 [CI:8.27C11.95]). Survivors who received antimetabolite chemotherapy had the highest disease and hospitalisation burden, while the lowest burden is observed in those receiving antitumour antibiotics. Regression analyses revealed that survivors who received only surgery had lower odds of developing cardiovascular (adjusted odds ratio 0.73 [CI:0.56C0.94]), haematological (aOR 0.51 [CI:0.37C0.70]), immunology and infection (aOR 0.84 [CI:0.71C0.99]) and renal (aOR 0.51 [CI:0.39C0.66]) late effects. By contrast, the opposite trend was observed in survivors who received chemo-radiotherapy. High antimetabolite chemotherapy cumulative dose was associated with increased risks of subsequent cancer (aOR 2.32 [CI:1.06C4.84]), metastatic cancer (aOR 4.44 [CI:1.29C11.66]) and renal (aOR 3.48 [CI:1.36C7.86]) conditions. Patients who received radiation dose of 50 Gy experienced higher risks of developing metastatic cancer (aOR 5.51 [CI:2.21C11.86]), cancer (aOR 3.77 [CI:2.22C6.34]), haematological (aOR 3.43 [CI:1.54C6.83]) and neurological (aOR 3.24 [CI:1.78C5.66]) conditions. Similar trends were observed in survivors who received more than three teletherapy fields. Cumulative burden analyses on 183 conditions separately revealed varying dominance of different late effects across cancer types, socioeconomic deprivation and treatment modalities. Late effects are associated with excess YLL (i.e., the difference in YLL between survivors with or without late effects), which was the most pronounced among survivors with haematological comorbidities. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to dissect and quantify the importance of late morbidities on subsequent survival using linked electronic health records from multiple settings. The burden of late effects is heterogeneous, as is the risk of premature mortality associated with late effects. We provide an extensive knowledgebase to help inform treatment decisions at the point of diagnosis, future interventional trials and late-effects screening centred on the holistic needs of this vulnerable population.","output":"Late effects of cancer in children, teenagers and young adults: Population-based study on the burden of 183 conditions, in-patient and critical care admissions and years of life lost"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To address the changes in health care and the needs of society related to medicines, we must redefine the profession of pharmacy.

Yet, their ability to regulate emotions is crucial for everyday functioning during times of crisis. The question of how adaptive emotion regulation (ER) strategies, which help an individual maintain appropriate and stable mood states, might affect bilinguals' creativity remains unexplored. The present study investigated this issue by measuring various indicators of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, L2 proficiency, adaptive ER strategies, and bilinguals' cognitive creativity (CC) and emotional creativity (EC) during the pandemic. Results from a sample of 235 bilingual participants who completed a battery of survey instruments showed that: (1) bilinguals' negative mood significantly increased during the pandemic compared with their mood state before the pandemic; (2) their negative mood during the pandemic was positively associated with their adaptive ER strategies; (3) L2 proficiency had a direct effect on bilinguals' cognitive flexibility, CC, and EC; (4) L2 proficiency also indirectly influenced bilinguals' CC through cognitive flexibility. These results suggest that cognitive flexibility had a simple mediation effect on the association between L2 proficiency and CC. However, the current study further found that bilinguals had different cognitive patterns in EC. L2 proficiency influenced bilinguals' EC through cognitive flexibility indirectly only when adaptive ER strategies had a moderation effect on the association between cognitive flexibility and EC. However, this moderated mediation effect was not significant in CC.

We designed an online questionnaire and sent it to Iranian people via available social platforms. The questionnaire contained questions on the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants. We used Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2 (GAD-2) for detailed characterization of insomnia and its symptoms. Results. In total, 675 people with insomnia with the mean age of 40.28 years (SD=11.15) participated in our study. Prevalence of difficulty initiating sleep (DIS), difficulty maintaining sleep (DMS), and early morning awakening (EMA) were 91.4%, 86.7%, and 77%, respectively. DIS, DMS, and EMA were more common in people with depression and anxiety. FCV-19 score was higher in those with more severe types of DIS, DMS, and EMA (P<0.001).

This framework, combined with the prediction bands for each policy, provides a real-time decision support tool for policymakers. The application is demonstrated with the spread of COVID-19 in China.","output":"Multi-Objective Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Infectious Disease Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVETo determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in employees of the Cantonal Police Bern, Switzerland; to investigate individual and work-related factors associated with seropositivity; and to assess the neutralizing capacity of the antibodies of seropositive study participants. DESIGNCross-sectional analysis of a cohort study. SETTINGWearing face masks was made mandatory for employees of the police during working hours at the rise of the second wave of the pandemic in mid-October 2020. Protests and police fieldwork provided a high exposure environment for SARS-CoV-2 infections. The investigation was performed prior to initiation of a vaccine programme. Study participants were invited for serological testing of SARS-CoV-2 and to complete questionnaires on sociodemographic, work and health-related questions. PARTICIPANTS978 police personnel working in four different geographic districts, representing 35% of the entire staff, participated from February to March 2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESSeroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in February to March 2021, geographic and work-related risk factors for seropositivity, and serum neutralization titres towards the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (expressing D614G) and the alpha and beta variants. RESULTSSeroprevalence was 12.9% (126 of 978 employees). It varied by geographic region within the canton; ranged from 9% to 13% in three regions, including the city; and was 22% in Bernese Seeland/Jura. Working in the latter region was associated with higher odds for seropositivity (odds ratio 2.38, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 4.44, P=0.006). Job roles with mainly office activity were associated with a lower risk of seropositivity (0.33, 0.14 to 0.77, P=0.010). Most seropositive employees (67.5%) reported having had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 3 months or longer prior to serological testing, and the proportion of agreement between positive nasopharyngeal test results and seroconversion was 95% to 97%. Among reported symptoms, new loss of smell or taste was the best discriminator for seropositivity (odds ratio 52.4, 30.9 to 89.0, P<0.001). Compliance with mask wearing during working hours was 100%, and 45% of all seropositive versus 5% of all seronegative participants (P<0.001) reported having had contact with a proven COVID-19 case living in the same household. The level of serum antibody titres correlated well with neutralization capacity. Antibodies derived from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection effectively neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (expressing D614G), but were less effective against the alpha and beta variants. A regression model demonstrated that anti-spike antibodies had higher odds for neutralization than did anti-nucleocapsid protein antibodies. CONCLUSIONSSeroprevalence in the pre-vaccinated police cohort was similar to that reported in the general population living in the same region. The high compliance with mask wearing and the low proportion of seroconversion after contact with a presumed or proven COVID-19 case during working hours imply that personal protective equipment is effective and that household contacts are the leading transmission venues. The level of serum antibody titres, in particular that of anti-spike antibodies, correlated well with neutralization capacity. Low antibody titres were not effective against the alpha and beta variants. SUMMARY BOXESO_ST_ABSWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICC_ST_ABSO_LIThe seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the general population shows variations, depending on the geographic location of investigated study participants. C_LIO_LISocial distancing by avoiding crowds and maintaining a distance of 6 feet from others when in public are recommended. These recommendations are not realistic for security personnel and employees of a police department. C_LIO_LIPreventive strategies for individuals in a health care setting are warranted and effective to reduce potential exposures. The effect of preventive strategies on individuals working for the police force has not been investigated. C_LI WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSO_LIThe study suggests that the overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among police officers is not higher than that in the general population, despite presumed higher exposure (e.g., public protests). C_LIO_LICompliance with use of personal protective equipment among police officers was very high. The study results suggested that household contacts, rather than exposure during working hours, is the main source for viral transmission. C_LIO_LIAnti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies derived from natural infection demonstrated good neutralization capacity towards strains that epidemiologically likely caused the infection, but moderate to poor neutralization capacity towards the alpha and beta variant.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted significant gaps in perinatal mental health care, especially among women who identify as Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC). While psychotherapeutic (cognitive, behavioral and interpersonal) interventions are endorsed for perinatal mood disorders, barriers to access and uptake contribute to inequitable access to treatment at the population level. To effectively address these barriers and increase the scalability of psychotherapy among perinatal women, we suggest four pragmatic questions to be answered from a patient-centered lens;namely, who, what, how, and when. Promising avenues include task-sharing among mental health non-specialists, an emphasis on culturally sensitive care, web-based delivery of psychotherapy with some caveats, and a lifespan approach to perinatal mental health. Innovative research efforts are seeking to validate these approaches in diverse contexts across North America and the UK, lending optimism toward scalable and long-term solutions for equitable perinatal mental health care.","output":"Scaling Up Patient-Centered Psychological Treatments for Perinatal Depression in the Wake of a Global Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To exam ine the frequency, dem ographics, clinical profile and outcom es of corona virus in patients with s ym ptom s of corona virus s uch as fever, s ore throat, res piratory problem, d iarrhea, cough and abdom inal pain Study Design: Cros s -s ectional s tudy Place and Duration of Study: Departm ent of Medicine, Chandka Medical College Hos pital Larkana from 1st March 2020 to 31st May 2020 Methodology: Four hundred patients of both genders with ages 20 to 80 years s us pected to have corona virus were enrolled in this s tudy Patients detailed dem ographics including age, s ex, res idence and co -m orbidities were recorded after taking written cons ent Real tim e PCR was done to confirm the cas es Com plete clinical profile of corona virus patients was exam ined Results: There were 115 (28 75%) diagnos ed to have corona virus while 285 (71 25%) had negative for corona virus Out of 115 patients, 82 (71 30%) were m ale while 33 (2 8 70%) were fem ales Mean age of patients was 56 4510 85 years Majority of patients 100 (86 96%) were as ym ptom atic, 8 (6 96%) patients were critically ill and 7 (6 09%) patients were s ym ptom atic Mean tim e to recovery was 12 422 76 days Mortality found in 3 (2 61%) patients and all were critically ill Conclusion: Majority of corona virus patients were m ale, older age group and as ym ptom atic Only 6 96% patients were critically ill Majority of patients were recovered while only 2 61% patients were died ? 2020 Lahore Medical And Dental College All rights reserved","output":"Determine the frequency of corona virus and examine the demographics and clinical profile of coronavirus patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, posing a renewed threat to COVID-19 containment and to vaccine and drug efficacy.

Conjunctivitis is also reported in a small number of cases. We evaluated ocular symptoms and ocular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in a group of patients with COVID-19. METHOD: Fifty-six patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were recruited as subjects. Relevant medical histories were obtained from the electronic medical record system. Ocular history and ocular symptoms data were obtained by communicating directly with the subjects. The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Salisbury Eye Evaluation Questionnaire (SEEQ) were used to assess the anterior ocular surface condition before and after the onset of disease. RESULTS: Patients classified as severe COVID-19 cases were more likely to have hypertension compared to mild cases (p = 0.035). Of the 56 subjects, thirteen patients (23%) were infected in Wuhan, 32 patients (57%) were community-infected, 10 patients (18%) were unknown origin, 1 (2%) was a physician likely infected by a confirmed patient. Three patients wore face mask with precaution when contacting the confirmed patients. Fifteen (27%) had aggravated ocular symptoms, of which 6 (11%) had prodromal ocular symptoms before disease onset. The differences in mean scores of OSDI questionnaire and SEEQ between before and after onset of COVID-19 were all significant (p < 0.05 for both).

The chief purpose of new regimes of street management is to expand spaces for walking and bicycling, and to ease business interactions such as curbside pickup and dining while maintaining social distancing guidelines. We investigated how North Americans on Twitter viewed alternative uses and forms of street reallocation, specifically during the early months of the pandemic from April 1, 2020 to July 1, 2020. Relying on a crowdsourced dataset of government actions (Combs and Pardo 2021), we identified five areas of policy initiative that were broadly representative of government actions: cycling, walking, driving, business, and curbside. First, we identified a corpus of 292,108 geolocated tweets from the U.S. and Canada. Next, we used word vectors, built on this Twitter corpus, to generate similarity scores across the five areas of policy initiative for each tweet. Finally, we selected the top tweets that closely matched ideas contained in the areas of policy initiative, thus creating a finer corpus of 1,537 tweets. Using the five categories as guideposts, we conducted an inductive content analysis to understand opinions expressed on Twitter. Our analysis suggests that renewed use of the curb has opened up possibilities for reimaging this space. Particularly, business uses of the curb for dining and pick up zones have expanded widely, and there is more use of sidewalks; yet both spaces have limited capacity.

METHODS: A retrospective study including COVID-19 patients admitted to an Italian hospital between March 1 and July 1, 2020. Predictors of viral clearance (VC) and prolonged VS from the upper respiratory tract were assessed by Poisson regression and logistic regression analyses. The causal relation between VS and clinical outcomes was evaluated through an inverse probability weighted Cox model. RESULTS: The study included 536 subjects. The median duration of VS from symptoms onset was 18 days. The estimated 30-day probability of VC was 70.2%. Patients with comorbidities, lymphopenia at hospital admission, or moderate/severe respiratory disease had a lower chance of VC. The development of moderate/severe respiratory failure, delayed hospital admission after symptoms onset, baseline comorbidities, or D-dimer >1000ng/mL at admission independently predicted prolonged VS. The achievement of VC doubled the chance of clinical recovery and reduced the probability of death/mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory disease severity, comorbidities, delayed hospital admission and inflammatory markers negatively predicted VC, which resulted to be associated with better clinical outcomes.

This literature review explores the published pre-registration MRS education curriculum adaptations implemented in response to the pandemic and effects of the adaptations on stakeholders. Key Findings Eleven articles were identified through a systematic literature search. The included articles covered the pre-registration MRS curriculum adaptations implemented in response to the pandemic in 12 countries of five continents. Through changing content delivery and assessment modes from face-to-face to online, non-practical classes and academic assessments could continue without significant interruptions. However, cancellation/postponement of practical classes and clinical placements was common during COVID-19 lockdown. Simulated learning was used by some institutions to replace some practical classes and placements. Among the stakeholders of MRS education (students, academics and clinical educators), the students were most affected. The main impacts were negative psychological effects and learning experiences. For the academics, they had common concerns about online learning quality and assessment integrity. Conclusion This review of the early publications in the first year of the pandemic provides an illustration of the MRS curriculum adaptations implemented in five continents covering both English and non-English speaking countries and their effects on the stakeholders as yet. It is expected that more articles on this area will be published over time and hence allowing a more comprehensive review in the future.

DESIGN: This study was designed as a cross-sectional, single-center case series. SETTING: This study took place from May 15,2020, to June 30, 2020 at the Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Pandemia Services. POPULATION: Hospitalized 150 adults with laboratory and radiological confirmation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) according to WHO interim guidance were included in the study. METHODS: The disease severity 2007 idsa/ats guidelines for community acquired pneumonia was used. Myalgia severity was assessed by numerical rating scale (NRS). Visual analog scale and Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS) were used for fatigue severity determination. Handgrip strength (HGS) was measured by Jamar hand dynamometer. RESULTS: 103 patients (68.7%) were non-severe and 47 patients (31.3%) were severe. The most common musculoskeletal symptom was fatigue (133 [85.3%]), followed by myalgia (102 [68.0%]), arthralgia (65 [43.3%]) and back pain (33 [22.0%]). Arthralgia, which was mostly notable at wrist (25 [16.7%]), ankle (24 [16.0%]) and knee (23 [15.3%]) joints, was significantly higher among the severe group. Severe myalgia was prevalent among myalgia sufferers regardless of COVID-19 severity. The physical fatigue severity score was significantly higher in severe cases, whereas this difference was not significant in mental fatigue score. Female patients with severe infection had \\"lower\\" grip strength, whereas grip strength among males did not differ significantly between non-severe and severe COVID-19 cases. Nevertheless the mean values in both genders and in age decades were below the specified normative values.

The bactericide berberine (Ber) was further loaded to form Ber-loaded ZnO-Z (Ber@ZnO-Z) for control of tomato bacterial wilt disease. Results demonstrated that Ber@ZnO-Z could release Ber rapidly in an acidic environment, which corresponded to the pH of the soil where the tomato bacterial wilt disease often outbreak. In vitro experiments showed that the antibacterial activity of Ber@ZnO-Z was about 4.5 times and 1.8 times higher than that of Ber and ZnO-Z, respectively. It was because Ber@ZnO-Z could induce ROS generation, resulting in DNA damage, cytoplasm leakage, and membrane permeability changes so the released Ber without penetrability more easily penetrated the bacteria to achieve an efficient synergistic bactericidal effect with ZnO-Z carriers after combining with DNA. Pot experiments also showed that Ber@ZnO-Z significantly reduced disease severity with a wilt index of 45.8% on day 14 after inoculation, compared to 94.4% for the commercial berberine aqueous solution.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to assess public health workforce informatics competencies in select Georgia health districts and determine the correlates of PHI proficiency. METHODS This study is based on a cross-sectional quantitative study design. We conducted an online self-administered survey of employees from 3 selected district health departments to assess proficiency in foundational PHI competency domains. Three hundred thirty-three respondents completed the survey, with a response rate of 32.5%. A gap score was calculated as a proxy to identify informatics training needs. A path analysis was conducted to assess the relationships among contextual factors and foundational PHI competency domains. RESULTS The public health employees participating in this study reported relatively high proficiency in foundational PHI competency. Psychometric testing of the competency assessment instrument revealed 2 foundational informatics competency domains-effective information technology (IT) use and effective use of information. The effective use of IT mediated the relationship between employee-level factors of age and past informatics training and the effective use of information. CONCLUSION The study highlights the importance of improving the ability of public health professionals to leverage IT and information to advance population health. Periodic assessment of staff PHI competencies can help proactively identify competency gaps and address needs for additional training. Short assessment tools, such as presented in this study, can be validated and used for such assessments.","output":"Assessing Public Health Workforce Informatics Competencies: A Study of 3 District Health Departments in Georgia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, a global pandemic, has provided a unique background for examining the commonalities and differences in the rules of public mood change under different cultures. This study used China and the United States as the representative countries of tight and loose cultures, respectively. We constructed an attention index of the pandemic and five emotion indexes of China and the US, respectively, to examine the commonness of human emotional responses to crises and the gradual change law among different types of emotions, and the influence of tight-loose cultures on various kinds of public emotions. The trend data of Baidu Index and Google Trends was collected for a three-step analysis. First, the time series chart of the attention index and public emotion index of the COVID-19 pandemic in the two countries were compared;Second, the Granger causality test was used to analyze the relationship among different types of emotions. Finally, the differences in the proportion of various emotional indexes during the outbreak period between China and the US were compared using the t-test. The results showed that in both countries, fear was the dominant emotion at the beginning of the pandemic, and it was gradually taken over by depression and sadness. We also found that fear and anger can be used to predict sadness and depression in the middle and long term. Moreover, our data showed that the proportion of anger and fear in China was significantly higher than that in the US, while the proportion of sadness in China was significantly lower. The positive emotion index was significantly higher in China than in the US. The results can relatively verify the response to stress at the group level and the psychological characteristics of tight-loose cultures, which to some extent can be used as a general reference for crisis psychological assistance under different cultures. ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Facing COVID-19 in China and the US: Do we have the same emotions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The aim of our study is to present the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnancy and evaluate its impact on maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Populations in complex humanitarian emergencies have higher risks of multiple co-morbidities: mental disorders, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and chronic non-communicable diseases. However, there is wide variation in the health impacts both across and within humanitarian emergencies. Syndemic theory is an approach to conceptualizing disease and social determinants to understand differential patterns of multi-morbidity, elucidate underlying mechanisms, and better design interventions. Syndemic theory, if applied to complex humanitarian emergencies, has the potential to uncover origins of localized patterns of multi-morbidity resulting from political violence and historical inequities. In this paper, we present two case studies based on mixed-methods research to illustrate how syndemic models can be applied in complex humanitarian emergencies. First, in a Nepal case study, we explore different patterns of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression co-morbidity among female former child soldiers returning home after war. Despite comparable exposure to war-related traumas, girl soldiers in high-caste Hindu communities had 63% co-morbidity of PTSD and depression, whereas girl soldiers in communities with mixed castes and religions, had 8% PTSD prevalence, but no cases of PTSD and depression co-morbidity. In the second case study, we explore the high rates of type 2 diabetes during a spike in political violence and population displacement. Despite low rates of obesity and other common risk factors, Somalis in Ethiopia experienced rising cases of and poor outcomes from type-2 diabetes. Political violence shapes healthcare resources, diets, and potentially, this epidemiological anomaly. Based on these case studies we propose a humanitarian syndemic research agenda for observational and intervention studies, with the central focus being that public health efforts need to target violence prevention at family, community, national, and global levels.","output":"Syndemic effects in complex humanitarian emergencies: A framework for understanding political violence and improving multi-morbidity health outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Cardiac muscle injury has been described as a known consequence of coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) with poor clinical outcome We aim to study the correlation between myocardial muscle injury and specific echocardiographic findings and, hence the association with mortality Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort at the University Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas, under IRB of L20-172 We included COVID-19 patients from March 2020 until July 2020 who had transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) during their hospital admission Myocardial muscle injury was defined by elevated troponin Results A total of 101 patients were included The mean age was 60 years, and 69 3 % were males A total of 66 patients had a myocardial injury Patients with myocardial injury had higher mortality than those without myocardial injury with a P-value of &lt; 0 05, and this value remained significant after running a multiple regression analysis model Only 4 patients had an ejection fraction of less than 40% 11 patients had pericardial effusion Only 4 patients had tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)&lt;1 5 cm The mortality rate was 29 7%, and only 6 patients developed acute myocardial infarction No difference was found between the two groups regarding the different echocardiographic findings Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 and myocardial injury had higher mortality than those without myocardial injury with no difference regarding the different echocardiographic findings [Formula presented]","output":"Cardiac Muscle Injury and Right Ventricular Echocardiographic Correlations in Patients with Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had caused a worldwide pandemic with public health emergencies since 2020. For the symptomatic patients, high mortality rate was observed if without timely and optimized management. In this study, we aimed to investigate the predictive and prognostic roles of hematologic and biochemical parameters obtained in the emergency department (ED) for COVID-19 patients. We conducted a retrospective study in a dedicated COVID-19 medical center, recruiting a total of 228 COVID-19 patients with 86 severe and 142 non-severe cases. Both the hematologic and biochemical parameters obtained in the ED upon arrival were analyzed to evaluate the association of the biomarkers with disease severity and prognosis among COVID-19 patients. Among these parameters, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and D-dimer were significantly higher in the severe group than the non-severe one, whereas the platelet count and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio were significantly lower. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the areas under curve of CRP, PCT, LDH, ferritin, D-dimer, and NLR for differentiating the severity of COVID-19 were 0.713, 0.755, 0.763, 0.741, 0.733, and 0.683, respectively, whereas the areas under curve of CRP, PCT, LDH, ferritin, D-dimer, and NLR for differentiating the mortality of COVID-19 were 0.678, 0.744, 0.680, 0.676, 0.755, and 0.572, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that CRP, PCT, LDH, ferritin, D-dimer, and NLR were independent indicators for prediction of severe COVID-19, and LDH and ferritin were independent factors associated with the mortality in COVID-19. In conclusion, higher CRP, PCT, LDH, ferritin, D-dimer, and NLR were associated with severe COVID-19, whereas higher LDH and ferritin were associated with the mortality in COVID-19.

These effects considered in conjunction could provide a considerable decrease in the public health risk posed by still infectious individuals being released back into the population by actively monitoring their infection status throughout their isolation period. Such an approach could also help lighten the impact incurred on the individual by reducing the amount of time spent in isolation while posing no further public health risk, in addition to alleviating pressures on the economy and in healthcare settings caused by mass isolation in times of high prevalence.","output":"Mitigating isolation: further comparing the effect of LFD testing for early release from self-isolation for COVID-19 cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Covid-19 pandemic is burning all over the world National healthcare systems are facing the contagion with incredible strength, but concern regardin","output":"COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy: Are We Ready for the Psychosocial and Economic Crisis?

Cancer patients regularly attend specialized healthcare centres for management and treatment, where they are in contact with healthcare workers (HCWs). Numerous recommendations target both patients with cancer and HCWs, to minimize the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during these interactions. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the parallel evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in these 2 populations over time, we studied the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after both the first and second waves of the pandemic, and in both cancer patients and HCWs from a single specialized anticancer centre. Factors associated with seropositivity were identified in both populations. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study after the second wave of the COVID pandemic in France. All participants were invited to undergo serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 and to complete a questionnaire collecting data about their working conditions (for HCWs), or medical management (for patients) during this period. Results after the second wave were compared to those of a previous study among 1011 cancer patients and 663 HCWs performed in the same centre after the first wave, using the same evaluations. FINDINGS: We included 502 HCWs and 507 cancer patients. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was higher after the second wave than after the first wave in both HCWs (15.1% vs 1.8%; p<0.001), and patients (4.1% vs 1.7%; p=0.038). By multivariate analysis, the factors found to be associated with seropositivity after the second wave for HCWs were: working in direct patient care (p=0.050); having worked in a dedicated COVID-19 unit (p=0.0036); contact with a COVID-19-positive person in the workplace (p=0.0118), or outside of the workplace (p=0.0297). Among patients with cancer, only a contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 was found to be significantly associated with positive serology. The proportion of reported contacts with COVID-19-positive individuals was significantly lower among cancer patients than among HCWs (7.6%, vs 40.7% respectively; p<0.0001) INTERPRETATION: Between the first and second waves of the epidemic in France, seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies increased to a lesser extent among patients with cancer than among their HCWs, possibly due to better self-protection, notably social distancing. The risk factors for infection identified among HCWs plead in favour of numerous intra-hospital contaminations, especially for HCWs in contact with high-risk patients. This underlines the compelling need to pursue efforts to implement strict hygiene and personal protection measures (including vaccination), to protect HCWs and cancer patients.","output":"Parallel Evolution and Differences in Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Between Cancer Patients and Health Care Workers in a Tertiary Cancer Center During First and Second Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic: canSEROcov-II Cross Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: vaccinations for COVID-19 have been prioritised for older people living in care homes.

Empirical multidrug therapeutic approaches to treat COVID-19 are currently used with extremely uncertain outcomes, and many others are being tested in clinical trials. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has both anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects.

Patients were assigned to the ATS group if they underwent  1 ATS fraction (n = 51); the remainder were assigned to the ATP group (n = 56). The online plan adaptation records of 535 (107  5) fractions were retrospectively reviewed. Rationales for ATS decision-making were determined and analyzed using predefined criteria. Statistics of ATS fractions were summarized. Associations of patient characteristics and clinical factors with ATS utilization were investigated. RESULTS: There were 87 (16.3%) ATS fractions and 448 ATP fractions (83.7%).

This applies to arranging a conference that includes conference organizers, plenary speakers, performers, conference presenters, and audio describers preparing to provide information and sensorial accessibility to the conference participants. Unfortunately for contemporary conferences, individuals with different needs are likely to experience language barriers due to their linguistic differences, hearing loss, and/or challenges in understanding and/or accessing visual information. A performing arts conference, Partition/Ensemble 2020, hosted by the Canadian Association of Theatre Research, serves as a case study for examining the process of arranging and providing language interpreters and text transcriptions, including audiovisual descriptions. During the COVID pandemic in the summer of 2020, the conference organizers decided to have a relaxed virtual conference.

The aim of this rapid systematic review was to investigate measures implemented in long term care facilities to reduce transmission of COVID-19 and their effect on morbidity and mortality of residents, staff, and visitors. Databases (including MedRXiv pre-published repository) were systematically searched to identify studies reporting assessment of interventions to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in nursing homes among residents, staff, or visitors. Outcome measures include facility characteristics, morbidity data, case fatalities, and transmission rates. Due to study quality and heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was conducted. The search yielded 1414 articles, with 38 studies included. Reported interventions include mass testing, use of personal protective equipment, symptom screening, visitor restrictions, hand hygiene and droplet/contact precautions, and resident cohorting. Prevalence rates ranged from 1.2-85.4% in residents and 0.6-62.6% in staff. Mortality rates ranged from 5.3-55.3% in residents.

Twenty-seven healthy students took part on a randomized single-blinded crossover study, testing the effects that involved three modalities of unilateral stimulation (tRNS, anodal tDCS, and sham) over the DLPFC, during the performance of the attention network test (ANT) in three different conditions: standard, speed and accuracy. Results showed that tRNS was able to increase attention during more complex situations, namely by increasing alerting and decreasing conflict effect in the executive network. Under the Speed condition, tRNS increased efficiency of the alerting network, as well as under the more demanding conflict network, tRNS overall increased the performance when comparing to sham. No statistical significant effects of tDCS were observed. These results are compatible with the attention requiring the synchronization of pre-existing networks, rather the reinforcement or creation of new pathways.","output":"The effects of direct current stimulation and random noise stimulation on attention networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted the daily routine of the population worldwide, including autistic people and their caregivers, with severe consequences on mental health. On one hand, the reduced social contacts and the interruption of outpatient and daycare services during the lockdown have represented a real challenge for autistic people and their caregivers. On the other hand, confinement has allowed individuals to spend more time pursuing their interests and stay home with their family members without feeling the pressure of social expectations. The present study aimed to compare the levels of personal wellbeing, family distress, insomnia, and resilience between caregivers of autistic people and caregivers of people with other neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, or relational disabilities. A web survey was completed by 383 participants, of which 141 were primary caregivers of autistic people. We did not find any significant difference between caregivers of autistic and non-autistic people in any of the considered psychological variables. Lower age of the autistic family member and lower resilience levels were significantly associated with higher individual distress in the group of caregivers of autistic people. Our findings do not corroborate the hypothesis that caregivers of autistic individuals have had more severe consequences than other caregivers during the lockdown. However, they confirm the importance of promoting resilient coping strategies in autistic people and their caregivers.","output":"The Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown: A Comparison between Caregivers of Autistic and Non-Autistic Individuals in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION An increasing proportion of thoracic procedures are performed using video-assisted thoracic surgery. This minimally invasive technique places special demands on the surgeons. Using simulation-based training on artificial models or animals has been proposed to overcome the initial part of the learning curve. This study aimed to investigate the effect of simulation-based training and to compare self-guided and educator-guided training. METHODS The study included a surgeon group (n = 10) and 30 randomized novices in 3 groups. A control group (n = 10) and the group of surgeons (n = 10) were tested with no previous simulator training. A self-guided training group (n = 10) and an educator-guided training group (n = 10) trained for 3 hours on 3 scenarios of increasing fidelity and difficulty before taking a standardized test consisting of performing a wedge resection on a porcine lung, which was recorded and assessed blindly and independently by 2 thoracoscopic experts using a modified version of a validated assessment tool. RESULTS Interrater reliability was acceptable (Spearman  = 0.73, P < 0.001). The control group and the self-guided training group performed significantly worse than the experienced surgeons (P = 0.012 and P = 0.010, respectively). There was no significant difference between the educator-guided training group and the experienced surgeons (P = 0.271). CONCLUSIONS This randomized study concerning simulation-based training for thoracoscopy showed that 3 hours of intensive simulator training with a dedicated educator enables novices to perform an acceptable wedge resection in a simple, simulated model. Although not significant, it seemed that having an educator present during training had a beneficiary effect. Transfer studies are required for further conclusions.","output":"Simulation-based training for thoracoscopy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Many patients who require hemodialysis treatment will often require a prosthetic graft after multiple surgeries. However, the patency rate of grafts currently available commercially has not been satisfactory. Tissue engineering vascular grafts (TEVGs) are biodegradable scaffolds created to promote autologous cell proliferation and functional neotissue regeneration and, accordingly, have antithrombogenicity. Therefore, TEVGs can be an alternative prosthesis for small diameter grafts. However, owing to the limitations of the graft materials, most TEVGs are rigid and can easily kink when implanted in limited spaces, precluding future clinical application. Previously, we developed a novel corrugated nanofiber graft to prevent graft kinking. Reinforcement of these grafts to ensure their safety is required in a preclinical study. In the present study, three types of reinforcement were applied, and their effectiveness was examined using large animals. Methods: In the present study, three different reinforcements for the graft composed of corrugated poly-?-caprolactone (PCL) blended with poly(L-lactide-co-?-caprolactone) (PLCL) created with electrospinning were evaluated: 1) a polydioxanone suture, 2) a 2-0 polypropylene suture, 3) a polyethylene terephthalate/polyurethane (PET/PU) outer layer, and PCL/PLCL as the control. These different grafts were then implanted in a U-shape between the carotid artery and jugular vein in seven ovine models for a total of 14 grafts during a 3-month period. In evaluating the different reinforcements, the main factors considered were cell proliferation and a lack of graft dilation, which were evaluated using ultrasound examinations and histologic and mechanical analysis. Results: No kinking of the grafts occurred. Overall, re-endothelialization was observed in all the grafts at 3 months after surgery without graft rupture or calcification. The PCL/PLCL grafts and PCL/PLCL grafts with a polydioxanone suture showed high cell infiltration; however, they had become dilated 10 weeks after surgery. In contrast, the PCL/PLCL graft with the 2-0 suture and the PCL/PLCL graft covered with a PET/PU layer did not show any graft expansion. The PCL/PLCL graft covered with a PET/PU layer showed less cell infiltration than that of the PCL/PLCL graft. Conclusions: Reinforcement is required to create grafts that can withstand arterial pressure. Reinforcement with suture materials has the potential to maintain cell infiltration into the graft, which could improve the neotissue formation of the graft.","output":"Novel reinforcement of corrugated nanofiber tissue-engineered vascular graft to prevent aneurysm formation for arteriovenous shunts in an ovine model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Emergency Department (ED) visits and health care costs are increasing globally, but little is known about contributing factors of ED resource consumption. This study aims to analyse and to predict the total ED resource consumption out of the patient and consultation characteristics in order to execute performance analysis and evaluate quality improvements. METHODS: Characteristics of ED visits of a large Swiss university hospital were summarized according to acute patient condition factors (e.g. chief complaint, resuscitation bay use, vital parameter deviations), chronic patient conditions (e.g. age, comorbidities, drug intake), and contextual factors (e.g. night-time admission). Univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted with the total ED resource consumption as the dependent variable. RESULTS: In total, 164,729 visits were included in the analysis. Physician resources accounted for the largest proportion (54.8%), followed by radiology (19.2%), and laboratory work-up (16.2%). In the multivariable final model, chief complaint had the highest impact on the total ED resource consumption, followed by resuscitation bay use and admission by ambulance. The impact of age group was small. The multivariable final model was validated (R2 of 0.54) and a scoring system was derived out of the predictors. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the variation in total ED resource consumption can be predicted by our suggested model in the internal validation, but further studies are needed for external validation.

METHODS: The Medline and PsycInfo databases were searched on November 29, 2020, for prediction models estimating the risk of death in persons with dementia. Study quality was assessed using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool. RESULTS: The literature search identified 2,828 studies, of which 18 were included. These studies described 16 different prediction models with c statistics mostly ranging from 0.67 to 0.79. Five models were externally validated, of which four were applicable. There were two models that were both applicable and had reasonably low risk of bias. One model predicted risk of death at six months in persons with advanced dementia residing in a nursing home. The other predicted risk of death at three years in persons seen in primary care practice or a dementia specialty clinic, derived from a nationwide registry in Sweden but not externally validated. CONCLUSION: Valid, applicable models with low risk of bias were found in two settings: advanced dementia in a nursing home and outpatient practices. The outpatient model requires external validation. Better models are needed for persons with mild to moderate dementia in nursing homes, a common demographic.

We investigated the association between changes in economic activity and health behaviours of the working-age participants of eight longitudinal studies, during the early stages of the pandemic.

We obtained study-specific estimates using modified Poisson regression, adjusting for a comparable set of potential confounders, and combined results in a random-effects meta-analyses. Compared to those who continually worked, furloughed workers were more likely to report an increase in their fruit and vegetable consumption (1.22 [1.04-1.43]; I2 = 52%), and an increase in their physical activity (1.19 [1.04-1.35]; I2 = 73%).

Although several vaccines have been approved for emergency use, the emergence and rapid spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants have sparked fears of vaccine failure due to immune evasion. Massive viral genome sequencing has been recommended to track the genetic changes that could lead to adverse consequences. METHODS: We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 respiratory isolates from the National Public Health Laboratory, Malaysia and examined them together with viral genomes deposited in GISAID by other Malaysian researchers, to understand the evolutionary trend of the virus circulating in the country. We studied the distribution of virus lineages and site-wise mutations, analysed genetic clustering with the goeBURST full Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm, examined the trend of viral nucleotide diversity over time and performed nucleotide substitution association analyses.

B.1.524 was the largest lineage group. The number of mutations per genome ranged from 0 to 19. The mean genomic diversity value over 12 months was 3.26  10(?4). Of 359 mutations detected, 60.5% of which were non-synonymous, the most frequent were in the ORF1ab (P4715L), S (D614G and A701V) and N (S194L) genes. CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 virus accumulated an abundance of mutations in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. Its overall genetic diversity, however, is relatively low compared to other Asian countries with larger populations. Continuous genomic and epidemiological surveillance will help to clarify the evolutionary processes determining viral diversity and impacting on human health.","output":"Genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 provided significant challenges for community services and care homes.

The objective of this study is to explore the changing characteristics and environmental behaviors of disposable masks when exposed to the shoreline environment. The transformation of chain structure and chemical composition of masks as well as the decreased mechanical strength of masks after UV weathering were observed. The melt-blown cloth in the middle layer of masks was found to be particularly sensitive to UV irradiation. A single weathered mask can release more than 1.5 million microplastics to the aqueous environment. The physical abrasion caused by sand further exacerbated the release of microplastic particles from masks, with more than 16 million particles released from just one weathered mask in the presence of sand. The study results indicate that shorelines are not only the main receptor of discarded masks from oceans and lands, but also play host to further transformation of masks to plastic particles.","output":"Disposable masks release microplastics to the aqueous environment with exacerbation by natural weathering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine-induced protection of the population against severe COVID-19, hospitalization and death is of utmost importance, especially in the elderly.

However, in a significant subset of infected individuals, debilitating arthralgia persists for weeks over months up to years. The underlying immunopathogenesis of chronification of arthralgia upon primary RNA-viral infection remains unclear. Here, we analysed cell-intrinsic responses to ex vivo arthritogenic alphaviral infection of primary human synovial fibroblasts isolated from knee joints, one the most affected joint types during acute and chronic CHIKV disease. Synovial fibroblasts were susceptible and permissive to alphaviral infection. Base-line and exogenously added type I interferon (IFN) partially and potently restricted infection, respectively. RNA-seq revealed a CHIKV infection-induced transcriptional profile that comprised upregulation of expression of several hundred IFN-stimulated and arthralgia-mediating genes. Single-cell virus-inclusive RNA-seq uncovered a fine-tuned switch from induction to repression of cell-intrinsic immune responses depending on the abundance of viral RNA in an individual cell. Specifically, responses were most pronounced in cells displaying low-to-intermediate amounts of viral RNA and absence of virus-encoded, fluorescent reporter protein expression, arguing for efficient counteraction of innate immunity in cells expressing viral antagonists at sufficient quantities. In summary, cell-intrinsic sensing of viral RNA that potentially persists or replicates at low levels in synovial fibroblasts and other target cell types in vivo may contribute to the chronic arthralgia induced by alphaviral infections. Our findings might advance our understanding of the immunopathophysiology of long-term pathogenesis of RNA-viral infections.","output":"Single-cell analysis of arthritogenic alphavirus-infected human synovial fibroblasts links low abundance of viral RNA to induction of innate immunity and arthralgia-associated gene expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microfluidic devices can be thought of as comprising interconnected miniaturized compartments performing multiple experimental tasks individually or in parallel in an integrated fashion.

OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of SCRT-TNT vs LCCRT in conjunction with TME for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A decision analytical model with a 5-year time horizon was constructed for patients with biopsy-proven, newly diagnosed, primary locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma treated with SCRT-TNT or LCCRT. Markov modeling was used to model disease progression and patient survival after treatment in 3-month cycles. Data on probabilities and utilities were extracted from the literature. Costs were evaluated from the Medicare payers perspective in 2020 US dollars. Sensitivity analyses were performed for key variables. Data were collected from October 3, 2020, to January 20, 2021, and analyzed from November 15, 2020, to April 25, 2021. EXPOSURES: Two treatment strategies, SCRT-TNT vs LCCRT with adjuvant chemotherapy, were compared. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and net monetary benefits. Effectiveness was defined as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Both costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. Willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $50 000/QALY. RESULTS: During the 5-year horizon, the total cost was $41 355 and QALYs were 2.21 for SCRT-TNT; for LCCRT, the total cost was $54 827 and QALYs were 2.12, resulting in a negative incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (?$141 256.77). The net monetary benefit was $69 300 for SCRT-TNT and $51 060 for LCCRT. Sensitivity analyses using willingness to pay at $100 000/QALY and $150 000/QALY demonstrated the same conclusion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that SCRT-TNT followed by TME incurs lower cost and improved QALYs compared with conventional LCCRT followed by TME and adjuvant chemotherapy.

However, drift, or the accumulation of error over time, inhibits the accurate measurement of movement over long durations. We sought to develop an open-source workflow to estimate lower extremity joint kinematics from IMU data that was accurate and capable of assessing and mitigating drift. METHODS: We computed IMU-based estimates of kinematics using sensor fusion and an inverse kinematics approach with a constrained biomechanical model. We measured kinematics for 11 subjects as they performed two 10-min trials: walking and a repeated sequence of varied lower-extremity movements. To validate the approach, we compared the joint angles computed with IMU orientations to the joint angles computed from optical motion capture using root mean square (RMS) difference and Pearson correlations, and estimated drift using a linear regression on each subject's RMS differences over time. RESULTS: IMU-based kinematic estimates agreed with optical motion capture; median RMS differences over all subjects and all minutes were between 3 and 6 degrees for all joint angles except hip rotation and correlation coefficients were moderate to strong (r = 0.60-0.87). We observed minimal drift in the RMS differences over 10 min; the average slopes of the linear fits to these data were near zero (- 0.14-0.17 deg/min). CONCLUSIONS: Our workflow produced joint kinematics consistent with those estimated by optical motion capture, and could mitigate kinematic drift even in the trials of continuous walking without rest, which may obviate the need for explicit sensor recalibration (e.g. sitting or standing still for a few seconds or zero-velocity updates) used in current drift-mitigation approaches when studying similar activities. This could enable long-duration measurements, bringing the field one step closer to estimating kinematics in natural environments.","output":"OpenSense: An open-source toolbox for inertial-measurement-unit-based measurement of lower extremity kinematics over long durations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has led to the rapid and widespread adoption of telehealth. There is a need for more evidence regarding the appropriateness of telehealth, as well as greater understanding of barriers to its sustained use within surgery in Australia. METHODS: A survey weblink was sent via email to 5558 Australian Fellows of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in August 2020. A single reminder email followed this 2 weeks later. Mixed methods analysis was performed of the survey data. RESULTS: There were 683 (12.3%) complete responses. Telehealth (telephone or video\\\\link) consultations were undertaken by 638 (85%) respondents as a result of the pandemic, with 583 (85%) of these expressing a desire for continued access to telehealth. Seventy\\\\seven percent of respondents felt that a satisfactory level of care could be delivered via telehealth in half or more consultations. However, only 38% of respondents felt that quality of care was equivalent comparing telehealth and face\\\\to\\\\face consultations, with the inability to perform a clinical examination a frequent concern. The majority agreed that telehealth was appropriate for clinical meetings and arranging investigations (91% each), whereas only 22% and 17%, respectively, felt telehealth was an appropriate means to break bad news and manage conflict. Medicolegal, technical and financial concerns were raised as prominent barriers to the sustained use of telehealth. CONCLUSION: Surgeons show good insight into the clinical appropriateness and limitations of telehealth.

In this paper, we investigate properties of $R_e$ for a modified SEIR model of COVID-19 in the city of Houston, TX USA, in which the population is divided into low-risk and high-risk subpopulations. The response of $R_e$ to two types of control measures (testing and distancing) applied to the two different subpopulations is characterized. A nonlinear cost model is used for control measures, to include the effects of diminishing returns. We propose three types of heuristic strategies for mitigating COVID-19 that are targeted at reducing $R_e$, and we exhibit the tradeoffs between strategy implementation costs and number of deaths. We also consider two variants of each type of strategy: basic strategies, which consider only the effects of controls on $R_e$, without regard to subpopulation;and high-risk prioritizing strategies, which maximize control of the high-risk subpopulation. Results showed that of the three heuristic strategy types, the most cost-effective involved setting a target value for $R_e$ and applying sufficient controls to attain that target value. This heuristic led to strategies that begin with strict distancing of the entire population, later followed by increased testing. Strategies that maximize control on high-risk individuals were less cost-effective than basic strategies that emphasize reduction of the rate of spreading of the disease. The model shows that delaying the start of control measures past a certain point greatly worsens strategy outcomes. We conclude that the effective reproduction can be a valuable real-time indicator in determining cost-effective control strategies.","output":"Cost Effective Reproduction Number Based Strategies for Reducing Deaths from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is posing a threat to global health. This disease has different clinical manifestations and different outcomes. The immune response to the novel 2019 coronavirus is complex and involves both innate and adaptive immunity. In this context, cell-mediated immunity plays a vital role in effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Significant differences have been observed when comparing severe and non-severe patients. Since these immunological characteristics have not been fully elucidated, we aimed to use cluster analysis to investigate the immune cell patterns in patients with COVID-19 who required hospitalization but not intensive care. We identified four clusters of different immunological patterns, the worst being characterized by total lymphocytes, T helper lymphocytes CD4+ (CD4+), T cytotoxic lymphocytes CD8+ (CD8+) and natural killer (NK) cells below the normal range, together with natural killer lymphocyte granzyme < 50% (NK granzyme+) and antibody-secreting plasma cells (ASCs) equal to 0 with fatal outcomes. In the worst group, 50% of patients died in the intensive care unit. Moreover, a negative trend was found among four groups regarding total lymphocytes, CD4+, CD8+ and B lymphocytes (p < 0.001, p < 0.005, p < 0.000, p < 0.044, respectively). This detailed analysis of immune changes may have prognostic value. It may provide a new perspective for identifying subsets of COVID-19 patients and selecting novel prospective treatment strategies. Notwithstanding these results, this is a preliminary report with a small sample size, and our data may not be generalizable. Further cohort studies with larger samples are necessary to quantify the prognostic value's weight, according to immunological changes in COVID-19 patients, for predicting prognoses and realizing improvements in clinical conditions.","output":"Immunological Characteristics of Non-Intensive Care Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Preliminary Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introdu??o A sndrome inflamatria multissistmica peditrica (SIM-P) associada  COVID-19  uma rara complica??o, inicialmente, descrita em crian?as e adolescentes.

Lymph node metastasis is extremely rare in true gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma, and there are no reports of malignant transformation from leiomyoma. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was an old woman who had undergone endoscopic mucosal resection for an Is polyp on the left side of the transverse colon at the age of 73. She was diagnosed with leiomyoma with positive surgical margins. Subsequently, she presented to our institution with a sensation of pressure in the upper abdominal region as a chief complaint at the age of 76 years. Abdominal computed tomography and colorectal endoscopy showed a tumor lesion with invagination of the intestines in the transverse colon, the same site as that of the previously resected leiomyoma. A biopsy suggested a smooth muscle tumor, and we performed partial left transverse colectomy and lymph node dissection under a diagnosis of recurrence and enlargement of the previously incompletely resected leiomyoma. Histopathological examination revealed spindle-shaped tumor cells, and the mitotic activity was 30-40/10 high-power field. Tumor cells were immunohistologically positive for &#945;-smooth muscle actin and h-caldesmon; partially positive for desmin; negative for c-kit, CD34, DOG-1, and the S-100 protein; and showed a Ki-67 labeling index of 70-80%.

Here, a detailed time-course study was performed to compare the apoptosis and necrosis profiles induced by full-length 3b, a 3b mutant that was deleted by 30 amino acids from the C terminus (3b124-154) and the classical apoptosis inducer, Bax.

This study was aimed at evaluating the quality of the ECG signal from the ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor compared to standard 12-lead ECG. METHODS: ECG recordings with ECG247 Smart Heart Sensor and a standard 12-lead ECG recorder were performed in 97 volunteers at Sorlandet Hospital, Arendal, Norway, in 2019. All ECGs were analysed by two independent cardiologists. RESULTS: A total of 97 participants (53% men, age 48 (14) years) were included in the study.

GDM is associated with short-term and long-term consequences for both mother and child. Therefore, it is crucial we efficiently identify all cases and initiate early treatment, reducing fetal exposure to hyperglycemia and reducing GDM-related adverse pregnancy outcomes. For this reason, GDM screening is recommended as part of routine pregnancy care. The current screening method, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), is a lengthy, cumbersome and inconvenient test with poor reproducibility. Newer biomarkers that do not necessitate a fasting sample are needed for the prompt diagnosis of GDM. The aim of this scoping review is to highlight and describe emerging protein biomarkers that fulfill these requirements for the diagnosis of GDM. Materials and Methods: This scoping review was conducted according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for scoping reviews using Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, Embase and Web of Science with a double screening and extraction process. The search included all articles published in the literature to July 2020. Results: Of the 3519 original database citations identified, 385 were eligible for full-text review. Of these, 332 (86.2%) were included in the scoping review providing a total of 589 biomarkers studied in relation to GDM diagnosis. Given the high number of biomarkers identified, three post hoc criteria were introduced to reduce the items set for discussion: we chose only protein biomarkers with at least five citations in the articles identified by our search and published in the years 2017C2020. When applied, these criteria identified a total of 15 biomarkers, which went forward for review and discussion. Conclusions: This review details protein biomarkers that have been studied to find a suitable test for GDM diagnosis with the potential to replace the OGTT used in current GDM screening protocols. Ongoing research efforts will continue to identify more accurate and practical biomarkers to take GDM screening and diagnosis into the 21st century.","output":"Emerging Protein Biomarkers for the Diagnosis or Prediction of Gestational DiabetesA Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research into the syndrome could help others with similarly mysterious conditions","output":"The long covid dividend"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: People's adherence to control measures is imperative in the fight against COVID-19.

Clinical practice statements were more likely to diverge in explicit judgment of strength or direction compared to public health statements (Cramers V = 0.7, Fishers exact test; P <0.001). Statements were more likely to diverge in strength than direction. Date of publication, utilized evidence, interpretation of evidence, and contextualization considerations were associated with divergence. Conclusion More than half of the assessed guidelines issued at least one diverging statement. This study helps understanding the types of differences between guidelines issuing comparable statements and factors associated with their divergence.","output":"An evaluation of the eCOVID19 Recommendation Map identified diverging Clinical and Public Health guidance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Synthetic biology aims to redesign and reconstruct living systems for understanding life or for useful real-world applications In the past two decades, scientists have been able to use engineered living systems to produce many kinds of products from bioplastics to drugs, to construct a minimal bacterium with a fully synthetic genome and to store huge amount of information within a cell And in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world, the synthetic biology community became one of the major forces to develop effective diagnostic approaches as well as the drugs and vaccines, to rapidly cope with this great challenge with the state-of-the-art technologies in their hands In this panel discussion held on 3rd August 2020, eleven pioneering synthetic biologists from six countries across four continents gathered to discuss the development trend, challenges and biosafety issues concerning synthetic biology George Church Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and Professor of Health Sciences and Technology at Harvard and MIT, USA Paul Freemont Professor of Structural Biology in the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial College and a member of the Science Advisory Board of Tierra Biosciences, UK Akihiko Kondo Professor in School of Science, Technology and Innovation, and Department of Chemical Science and Engineering at Kobe University, Japan Christina Smolke Professor of Bioengineering and of Chemical Engineering at Stanford University and CEO of Antheia Inc , USA Xian-En Zhang Professor at the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China Chenli Liu (Chair) Professor and Director of Shenzhen Institute of Synthetic Biology, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China Jim Collins Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering & Science and Professor of Biological Engineering at MIT, USA Jay Keasling Professor of Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering at the University of California, Berkeley, USA Sang Yup Lee Dean of KAIST Institutes and Distinguished Professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), South Korea Claudia Vickers Director of the Future Science Platform in Synthetic Biology at Commonwealth Science and Industry Research Organization (CSIRO), Australia Guoping Zhao Professor at the Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China ? 2021 The Author(s) 2020 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of China Science Publishing & Media Ltd","output":"A forum on synthetic biology: Meet the great challenges with new technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the recent outbreak of COVID-19, many countries have enacted various kinds of quarantine measures to slow down the explosive spread of COVID-19. Although these measures were proven to be successful in stopping the outbreak in China, the potential adverse effects of countrywide quarantine have not been thoroughly investigated. METHODS: In this study, we performed an online survey to evaluate the psychological effects of quarantine using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale in February 2020 when the outbreak had nearly peaked in China. Along with the anxiety scores, limited personal information, such as age, gender, region, education, occupation, and specifically, the type and duration of quarantine, was collected for analysis. RESULTS: From a total of 992 valid questionnaires from 23 provinces in China, clinically significant anxiety symptoms were observed in 9.58% of respondents according to clinical diagnostic standards in China. The specific groups of people showing higher levels of anxiety were (a) adolescents (<18 years); (b) respondents with education lower than junior high school; (c) people with chronic diseases; and (d) frontline medical personnel. Other characteristics, such as gender, marital status, region, and acquaintance with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19, did not affect anxiety levels significantly. Respondents who experienced different forms of quarantine showed different anxiety levels. People undergoing centralized quarantine have higher levels of anxiety. Unexpectedly, longer durations of quarantine did not lead to a significant increase in anxiety level.

These products induce changes in pH around electrodes and cause dehydration resulting from electroosmotic pressure, leading to changes in microenvironment and thus metabolism of the tissues, yielding apoptosis. The procedure requires adequate time for electrochemical reactions to yield products sufficient to induce apoptosis of the tissues. Incorporation of electroporation into electrolysis can decrease the treatment time and enhance the efficiency of electrolytic ablation. Electroporation causes permeabilization in the cell membrane allowing the efflux of potassium ions and extension of the electrochemical area, facilitating the electrolysis process. However, little is known about the combined effects on apoptosis in liver ablation. In this study, we performed an immunohistochemical evaluation of apoptosis for the incorporation of electroporation into electrolysis in liver tissues. To do so, the study was performed with microelectrodes for fixed treatment time while the applied voltage varied to increase the applied total energy for electrolysis. The apoptotic rate for electrolytic ablation increased with enhanced applied energy. The apoptotic rate was 4.31  1.73 times that of control in the synergistic combination compared to 1.49  0.33 times that of the control in electrolytic ablation alone. Additionally, tissue structure was better preserved in synergistic combination ablation compared to electrolysis with an increment of 3.8 mA.

The highly contagious nature of the virus makes it difficult for educational institutions to continue their studies as usual, thus affecting the medical and health professions education which is based on face-to-face lectures, practicum, skills laboratories, and clinical practice in health facilities. AIM: This paper discovers clinical learning initiatives across the globe and highlights the contribution toward educational processes. METHODOLOGY: This study utilized an integrated literature review method. A systematic search for articles published was performed in Springer, ScienceDirect, PubMed, and EBSCOHost. Primary search monetary terms were e-learning (all synonyms) and health sciences education (all synonyms), including COVID-19. Articles published within the period of COVID-19 pandemic included in this study. For the synthesis, the 20 included studies selected were coded. In this study, data were synthesized through narrative synthesis using thematic analysis (TA). To identify the recurrent themes author followed six steps when synthesizing data using TA, for example, familiarizing with the data, developing initial (sub) codes, searching for (sub) themes, reviewing (sub) themes, compiling ideas or issues, and producing final data in line with the study aims and objectives. RESULTS: Out of records identified, a total of citations was screened, of which 20 were found to be of relevance to this study most were quantitative (14.70%) in design. Studies were published in 2020 since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic. The geographical range of papers covered mostly the moderate-income regions. On conducting TA of the included studies, it was possible to obtain two broad descriptive themes/categories: enablers or drivers of, and barriers or challenges to, under which important themes have emerged. CONCLUSION: Study suggests that developing e-learning in effective clinical learning is needed, not only limited to moving the learning process but also needing to follow the instructional design, so that learning outcomes can be achieved by students. In addition, a learning process that promotes self-directed-learning is needed so that students have flexibility, use relevant learning styles and are able to integrate knowledge, skills and attitudes as a meaningful learning process. ? 2021 Totok Harjanto, Sri Setiyarini, Titi S.

Many natural biomolecules (steroid hormones, fatty acids, vitamins) and ~60% of prescribed medications are processed by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. The objective of this work was to determine the impact of infection and vaccines on drug metabolism. METHODS: The impact of an adenovirus-based vaccine expressing Ebola glycoprotein (AdEBO) and H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses on hepatic CYP 3A4 and associated nuclear receptors was evaluated in human hepatocytes (HC-04 cells) and in mice. RESULTS: CYP3A activity was suppressed by 55% in mice 24 h after administration of mouse-adapted H1N1, while ??10% activity remained in HC-04 cells after infection with H1N1 and H3N2 due to global suppression of cellular translation capacity, indicated by reduction (70%, H1N1, 56%, H3N2) of phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e (eIF4E). AdEBO suppressed CYP3A activity in vivo (44%) and in vitro (26%) 24 hours after infection. CONCLUSION: As the clinical evaluation of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 and other global pathogens rise, studies to evaluate the impact of new vaccines and emerging pathogens on CYP3A4 and other metabolic enzymes are warranted to avoid therapeutic failures that could further compromise the public health during infectious disease emergencies.","output":"Immunization and Drug Metabolizing Enzymes: Focus on Hepatic Cytochrome P450 3A"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extreme polarization can undermine democracy by making compromise impossible and transforming politics into a zero-sum game. \\"Ideological polarization\\"-the extent to which political views are widely dispersed-is already strong among elites, but less so among the general public [N.

Strong mutual distrust and hostility between Democrats and Republicans in the United States, combined with the elites' already strong ideological polarization, could lead to increasing ideological polarization among the public. The paper addresses two questions: 1) Is there a level of ideological polarization above which polarization feeds upon itself to become a runaway process? 2) If so, what policy interventions could prevent such dangerous positive feedback loops? To explore these questions, we present an agent-based model of ideological polarization that differentiates between the tendency for two actors to interact (\\"exposure\\") and how they respond when interactions occur, positing that interaction between similar actors reduces their difference, while interaction between dissimilar actors increases their difference. Our analysis explores the effects on polarization of different levels of tolerance to other views, responsiveness to other views, exposure to dissimilar actors, multiple ideological dimensions, economic self-interest, and external shocks.

A deep understanding of the variation of biological characteristics in severe COVID-19 patients is crucial for the detection of individuals at high risk of critical condition for the clinical management of the disease. Herein, by profiling the gene expression spectrum deduced from DNA coverage in regions surrounding transcriptional start site in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of COVID-19 patients, we deciphered the altered biological processes in the severe cases and demonstrated the feasibility of cfDNA in measuring the COVID-19 progression. The up- and downregulated genes in the plasma of severe patient were found to be closely related to the biological processes and functions affected by COVID-19 progression. More importantly, with the analysis of transcriptome data of blood cells and lung cells from control group and cases with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we revealed that the upregulated genes were predominantly involved in the viral and antiviral activity in blood cells, reflecting the intense viral replication and the active reaction of immune system in the severe patients. Pathway analysis of downregulated genes in plasma DNA and lung cells also demonstrated the diminished adenosine triphosphate synthesis function in lung cells, which was evidenced to correlate with the severe COVID-19 symptoms, such as a cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress. Overall, this study revealed tissue involvement, provided insights into the mechanism of COVID-19 progression, and highlighted the utility of cfDNA as a noninvasive biomarker for disease severity inspections.","output":"Transcriptional Start Site Coverage Analysis in Plasma Cell-Free DNA Reveals Disease Severity and Tissue Specificity of COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019 a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan, China, and soon became a global health problem.

Major advances in the study of the molecular biology of IBV have resulted from the development of reverse genetics systems for the highly attenuated, cell culture-adapted, IBV strain Beaudette. However, most IBV strains, amongst them virulent field isolates, can only be propagated in embryonated chicken eggs, and not in continuous cell lines. METHODS: We established a reverse genetics system for the IBV strain H52, based on targeted RNA recombination in a two-step process. First, a genomic and a chimeric synthetic, modified IBV RNA were co-transfected into non-susceptible cells to generate a recombinant chimeric murinized (m) IBV intermediate (mIBV). Herein, the genomic part coding for the spike glycoprotein ectodomain was replaced by that of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), allowing for the selection and propagation of recombinant mIBV in murine cells. In the second step, mIBV was used as the recipient. To this end a recombination with synthetic RNA comprising the 3-end of the IBV genome was performed by introducing the complete IBV spike gene, allowing for the rescue and selection of candidate recombinants in embryonated chicken eggs. RESULTS: Targeted RNA recombination allowed for the modification of the 3-end of the IBV genome, encoding all structural and accessory genes. A wild-type recombinant IBV was constructed, containing several synonymous marker mutations. The in ovo growth kinetics and in vivo characteristics of the recombinant virus were similar to those of the parental IBV strain H52. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted RNA recombination allows for the generation of recombinant IBV strains that are not able to infect and propagate in continuous cell lines. The ability to introduce specific mutations holds promise for the development of rationally designed live-attenuated IBV vaccines and for studies into the biology of IBV in general.

METHODS: To evaluate the early impact of a structured risk-management for exposed COVID-19 HCWs and describe how their characteristics contributed to infection and diffusion. Socio-demographic and clinical data, aspects of the event-exposure (date, place, length and distance of exposure, use of PPE) and details of the contact person were collected. RESULTS: The 2411 HCWs reported 2924 COVID-19 contacts. Among 830 HCWs who were at 'high or medium risk', 80 tested positive (9.6%).

This study aimed to explore parental views and attitudes towards alcohol use during adolescence, among their offspring and among young people in general. METHODS: Twenty-three parents (21 mothers, 2 fathers) of children aged 13C18 years were recruited via schools, workplaces and community settings, predominantly in the West of England (n = 19) between 2017 and 2018. Data were collected via in-depth one-to-one interviews and analysed thematically, using an inductive, constructionist approach. RESULTS: Five major themes were identified in the data: (1) the parental alcohol environment, (2) balance and acceptance, (3) influences of the parental approach, (4) boundaries and parental monitoring, and (5) wider influences shaping young peoples behaviour. Overall, parents were aware of the risks and consequences of alcohol use and the wide range of influences shaping drinking behaviour, and expressed broad disapproval of alcohol use among young people. However, adolescent alcohol use was viewed as inevitable, and set within a context of a tolerant drinking culture. Many parents therefore chose a balanced and reluctantly accepting approach. This approach was determined by weighing disapproval of drinking against consistency with wider culture and parental behaviour, support for autonomy of the child, and avoidance of social sanctions. Parents responses were also determined by a desire to protect the parentCchild relationship, maintain an open, communicative and trusting relationship, and ultimately limit risk and minimise harm. Various boundaries and strategies were employed to this end, including care around role modelling, gradual introductions to alcohol, boundaried provision, clear risk reduction messaging and parental monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Parents employ a range of mechanisms to reduce alcohol-related risk and to balance harms of alcohol use among their offspring against adolescent behavioural norms. A downward shift in community consumption and changing socio-cultural norms could alter the accepting context in which parents are required to navigate adolescent alcohol use.","output":"Parent/caregiver attitudes, motivations and behaviours in relation to alcohol use among offspring aged 13C18 years: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several prior single-location case studies have found that the sensescape of a natural environment contributes to visitors' attention restoration.

Moreover, the risk factors for the underlying changes of PBICs and their predicting role in severe COVID-19 patients remain uncertain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study including two cohorts: the main cohort enrolling 45 patients of severe type serving as study group, and the secondary cohort enrolling 12 patients of no-severe type serving as control group. The PBICs analysis was based on blood routine and lymphocyte subsets. The inflammatory cell levels were compared among patients according to clinical classifications, disease-associated phases, as well as one-month outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with patients of non-severe type, the patients of severe type suffered from significantly decreased counts of lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, but increased counts of neutrophils. These PBICs alterations got improved in recovery phase, but persisted or got worse in aggravated phase. Compared with patients in discharged group, the patients in un-discharged/died group suffered from decreased counts of total T lymphocytes, CD4 + T lymphocytes, CD8 + T lymphocytes, as well as NK cells at 2 weeks after treatment. Clinical classification-critically severe was the independently risk factor for lymphopenia (OR = 7.701, 95%CI:1.265-46.893, P = 0.027), eosinopenia (OR = 5.595, 95%CI:1.008-31.054, P = 0.049), and worse one-month outcome (OR = 8.984; 95%CI:1.021-79.061, P = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Lymphopenia and eosinopenia may serve as predictors of disease severity and disease progression in COVID-19 patients, and enhancing the cellular immunity may contribute to COVID-19 treatment.

Pulmonary fibrosis, which may be one of the sequela caused by COVID-19, not only brings dyspnea and deterioration of lung function, but also affects patients' life because of its high mortality and poor prognosis. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor(VEGFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor(FGFR) can inhibit the proliferation, activation and migration of fibroblasts by regulating the signal transduction pathway involved in the process of pulmonary fibrosis. Chinese herbal formulas pose a good therapeutic effect on pulmonary fibrosis. Present study explores the intervention effect on pulmonary fibrosis of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) by screening the potential inhibitors of VEGFR and FGFR. The docking models of VEGFR and FGFR were established to obtain the potential active ingredients which were filtered by the docking score. According to 2 prescriptions in the Protocol for the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019(7th edition)and 9 prescriptions in Traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions for treating blight, 959 and 1 047 potential ingredients were obtained as the inhibitors of VEGFR and FGFR respectively with the screening thres-hold set as eighty percent of the docking score of the initial ligands. The potential herbs were then filtered by the components with a hit rate higher than 30%, such as Scutellariae Radix, Adenophorae Radix, Pinelliae Rhizoma, Coicis Semen, etc. To discuss the rule of TCM in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis, the networks of TCM-channel tropism and TCM-efficacy of the potential herbs was constructed.

OBJECTIVES: To conduct a within-city analysis of spatial variations in COVID-19 incidence and the estimated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lung lining fluid attributable to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). METHODS: Sporadic and outbreak-related COVID-19 case counts, testing data, population and sociodemographic data for 140 neighbourhoods were obtained from the City of Toronto. ROS estimates were based on a mathematical model of ROS generation in lung lining fluid in response to iron and copper in PM2.5. Spatial variations in long-term average ROS were predicted using a land use regression model derived from measurements of iron and copper in PM2.5. Data were analyzed using negative binomial regression models adjusting for covariates identified using a directed acyclic graph and accounting for spatial autocorrelation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A significant positive association was observed between neighbourhood level ROS and COVID-19 incidence (incidence rate ratio = 1.07, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.15 per interquartile range ROS). Effect modification by neighbourhood-level measures of racialized group membership and socioeconomic status was also identified.

The ongoing coronavirus has created severe threats to global mental health, which have resulted in crisis management challenges and international concerns related to health issues. As of September 9, 2021, there were over 223.4 million patients with COVID-19, including 4.6 million deaths and over 200 million recovered patients reported worldwide, which has made the COVID-19 outbreak one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. The aggressive public health implementations endorsed various precautionary safety and preventive strategies to suppress and minimize COVID-19 disease transmission. The second, third, and fourth waves of COVID-19 continue to pose global challenges to crisis management, as its evolution and implications are still unfolding. This study posits that examining the strategic ripostes and pandemic experiences sheds light on combatting this global emergency. This study recommends two model strategies that help reduce the adverse effects of the pandemic on the immune systems of the general population. This present paper recommends NPI interventions (non-pharmaceutical intervention) to combine various measures, such as the suppression strategy (lockdown and restrictions) and mitigation model to decrease the burden on health systems. The current COVID-19 health crisis has influenced all vital economic sectors and developed crisis management problems. The global supply of vaccines is still not sufficient to manage this global health emergency. In this crisis, NPIs are helpful to manage the spillover impacts of the pandemic. It articulates the prominence of resilience and economic and strategic agility to resume economic activities and resolve healthcare issues. This study primarily focuses on the role of social media to tackle challenges and crises posed by COVID-19 on economies, business activities, healthcare burdens, and government support for societies to resume businesses, and implications for global economic and healthcare provision disruptions. This study suggests that intervention strategies can control the rapid spread of COVID-19 with hands-on crisis management measures, and the healthcare system will resume normal conditions quickly.

Among these 27 proteins, the present study aimed to discover likely antigenic proteins and epitopes to be used for during the development of a vaccine or serodiagnostic assay using a reverse vaccinology in silico approach. For this purpose, after the full genome analyses of SARS-CoV-2 isolates, viral surface proteins including spike, envelope and membrane proteins as well as proteins with predicted signal peptide were determined as probable vaccine candidates whereas the remaining were considered as possible antigens to be used during development of serodiagnostic assays. According to results, the phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from 31 different countries showed two significant clusters in which one was clustered with China-Wuhan and the other one with China-Yunnan isolates. During the analyses, 105 SNPs were identified that resulted in change in 70 amino acid positions. Among the 27 proteins, 26 of them were predicted as probable antigen, except nsp-16. In 26 proteins, spike protein was selected as the best vaccine candidate because of having a signal peptide, negative grand average of hydropathicity value, one transmembrane helix, moderate aliphatic index, a big molecular weight, a long-estimated half-life, beta wrap motifs as well as having a stable, soluble and non-allergic features.

Although prior research works have rigorously explored the adverse effects of COVID-19 on mental health, investigations linking the impact of COVID-19 with parental stress and flourishing are very scarce. Rooted in boundary theory, the authors examined the influence of COVID-19 on flourishing and parental stress, respectively. Furthermore, predicated on spillover theory, the study explored the mediating effect of parental stress. Method: In this research, 259 IT employees in India were prospectively followed from the second week until the twentieth week of lockdown as part of a longitudinal population. A three-stage data collection method was employed. The employee completed the COVID-19 impact scale in the 2nd and 10th week of lockdown in India. Subsequently, the authors administered parental stress and flourishing surveys online in the 20th week. Results: Findings revealed that COVID-19 negatively impacted employee flourishing, via parental stress that had a partial mediating effect. Conclusion: This study is the first of its kind to theoretically and empirically investigate the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on employees' flourishing via parental stress.

There is an urgent need to identify laboratory markers of disease progression for optimum allocation of resources in developing countries like India. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 COVID-19 positive patients over two months. The cases were sub-classified based on disease severity into mild to moderate (n=61), severe (n=26) and very severe (n=13) and into survivors (n=85) and non-survivors (n=15) based on survivor status. These patients were tested for hematological parameters (total blood lymphocyte counts, NLR, PLR, platelet indices etc.), coagulation markers (D-dimer, fibrin degradation products (FDP), fibrinogen etc.) and biochemical markers (LDH, ferritin, IL-6, procalcitonin, hs-CRP). RESULTS Statistically significant differences were observed in hematological variables (ANC, NLR and ESR), coagulation parameters (D-dimer, FDP, fibrinogen and thrombin time) and biochemical markers (LDH, ferritin, IL-6, procalcitonin and hs-CRP) with regard to subcategories based of disease severity as well as survivor status. There was strong correlation between NLR, D-dimer, IL-6, procalcitonin and ferritin. IL-6 emerged as the single best marker of disease severity (AUC: 0.997, P=0.00), however procalcitonin, LDH, D-dimer, FDP and NLR could also predict severe disease with a good sensitivity and specificity.

These patients, therefore, require specific advice regarding isolation and changes to their usual treatment schedules. Their disease can also be associated with significant burden, and they necessitate life-long and regular access to therapy, and regular follow-up consultations and hospital visits. The current COVID-19 pandemic is therefore presenting many challenges for these patients, their families, and health-care professionals. AREAS COVERED This review provides an overview of the reported COVID-19 cases in the literature in patients with certain benign hematological disorders including thalassemia, sickle cell disease, hemophilia, immune thrombocytopenia, venous thromboembolism, and aplastic anemia. The review also outlines some recommendations on how to manage these patients if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2. To review the literature on benign hematological disorders and COVID-19, a bibliographic search was performed using PubMed for articles published between January 2020 and June 2020. EXPERT OPINION International efforts must be made to continue reporting and better understanding the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in these patients and accordingly develop a set of recommendations to optimize the treatment of future infected patients.","output":"COVID-19 in benign hematology: emerging challenges and special considerations for healthcare professionals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although Germanys performance in terms of the number of infections and fatalities as well as the economic and social consequences associated with COVID-19 can be considered as satisfactory in an EU27 comparison, it raises the question of input legitimacy through democratic procedures.

It is then argued that the decision-making during the pandemic waves in 2020 and 2021 formed a framework within the federal state that largely removed the basis for parliamentary functions. Essential for the analysis is the outline of the change in the multi-level governance that the pandemic brought about through the conference of the Chancellor and the 16 state prime ministers. The impact of this governmental crisis management politics are discussed for the most important state parliamentary functions, the oversight through co-governance, oversight by the opposition, legislation, and the public debate.

METHODS: The main active chemical components of Zhishi and Baizhu were screened through Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database and selected by using the thresholds of oral bioavailability 30% and drug-likeness 18%. The targets of Zhishi and Baizhu were obtained from TCMSP, Therapeutic Targets Database (TTD), and the DrugBank database. The corresponding genes of the targets were retrieved from the UniProt database, and the gastric cancer targets were obtained from the GeneCards database and TTD. Subsequently, the networks were built between the main drug components, drug targets, and gastric cancer targets. Then, the enrichment analyses of GO and KEGG were applied to predict the potential roles of gastric cancer pathogenesis via the R package clusterProfiler. Finally, molecular docking was used to determine the affinity between the targets and components. RESULTS: Twenty-seven main active components were predicted from the Zhishi-Baizhu herb pair, and a total of 120 intersection genes were screened from 303 potential medicine genes and 1,839 disease genes. The enrichment included the PI3K-Akt and IL-17 signaling pathways, and the network analysis showed that the Zhishi-Baizhu herb pair acted on seven key targets, namely, AKT1, MMP9, IL-6, CCND1, BCL2, MTOR, and MDM2 (where they played a role in treating gastric cancer). Molecular docking showed that luteolin and naringenin could stably bind to the targets. CONCLUSION: The possible mechanisms of the components of the Zhishi-Baizhu herb pair in treating gastric cancer might be related to luteolin and naringenin, which intervened with the targets AKT1, MMP9, IL-6, CCND1, BCL2, MTOR, and MDM2, and are linked with the PI3K-Akt and IL-17 signaling pathways.

This project evaluated the respiratory toxicity of sand particles collected at military bases near Fort Irwin USA, in Iraq (Camp Victory, Taji and Talil), and Khost Afghanistan. Our primary focus was on assessing the role of soluble metals in the respiratory toxicity of the sand particles using in vitro and in vivo methods. Replicating rat type II alveolar cell cultures (RLE-6TN) were exposed to sand extracts or vehicle control in serum-free media for 24 h. Cytotoxicity was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and assessment of lactate dehydrogenase leakage. The relative in vitro cytotoxicity of the sand extracts was Taji  Talil > Afghanistan > Camp Victory  Fort Irwin. We also assessed extracts of Camp Victory, Afghanistan, and Taji sand for acute and delayed pulmonary toxicity in rats following intratracheal administration. Assessments included biochemical analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung histopathology. The in vitro cytotoxicity assay results were partially predictive of in vivo responses. The more cytotoxic Taji sand extract induced an acute irritant response in rats following intratracheal administration. Rats given the less cytotoxic Camp Victory sand extract had minimal biochemical or cytological BALF changes whereas rats given either the Afghanistan or Taji sand extracts demonstrated BALF changes that were suggestive of mild lung inflammation. Unexpectedly, we observed similar lung pathology in all extract-exposed rats.

We report the results of upscaling a longitudinal telehealth training course on stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for clinicians in Latin America, after successfully developing a pilot course. MATERIALS/METHODS A longitudinal training program on implementing SBRT and SRS was provided to several radiation oncology centers in Peru and Colombia at no cost. The program consisted of regular 1-hour live video conferencing sessions weekly for 4 months with interactive didactics and a cloud-based platform for case-based learning. Participant-reported changes in confidence levels were measured in 16 practical domains of SBRT/SRS, based on 1-to-5 Likert scale levels. Pre- and post-curriculum practical knowledge-based exams were required for participation credit. Participant baseline features, completed pre- and post-curriculum surveys, overall and single professional-group confidence changes, and exam results are analyzed and reported. RESULTS One hundred and seventy-five different radiotherapy professionals participated. An average of 56 (SD  18) attendees per session were registered. Fifty (29.7%) participants completed the pre- and post-curriculum surveys, of which 30% were radiation oncologists (RO), 26% radiation therapists (RTT), 20% residents, 18% medical physicists and 6% neurosurgeons. Significant improvements were found across all 16 domains with overall mean +0.55 (SD  0.17, P < 0.001) Likert-scale points.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an observational retrospective cohort study which includes the patients diagnosed as COVID-19 and received aluminum salts in addition to actual treatments during hospitalization as the treatment group (Alum Group). Patients who received standard COVID-19 treatment protocols in the Infectious Diseases Clinics were included as the Control Group. Clinical findings, laboratory parameters, length of stay, survival, radiological follow-up, intensive care and mechanical ventilation needs, the presence of comorbidity, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, symptoms, symptom recovery times, hospital stay times, treatment protocols, and clinical presence of pneumonia were examined in all patients. Advanced chemical composition analyzes of existing aluminum salts were also performed. RESULTS: A total of 109 patients, 54 in the alum group and 55 in the control group, were included in the study. None of the patients in the aluminum group developed side effects due to the intake of aluminum salt. Survival status was significantly different between the two groups as there were 5 loss in the Control Group and none in the Alum Group (P = 0.023). The symptom recovery time was significantly shorter in the Alum Group; 2 (1C3) vs. 1 (1C2) days, P = 0.003. According to the paired samples analyses of the comparison between hospitalization and discharge, CRP levels significantly drops in the Alum Group (from 54.09 to 27, P = 0.001) but not in the Control Group. The drop was significantly same for the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and procalcitonin levels with P = 0.001. CONCLUSION: It has been observed that aluminum salts have beneficial effects in COVID-19 infected cases.

However, the effectiveness of these support methods for relieving ASSs has not yet been assessed. Objective: The current study sought to examine the underlying mechanisms by which social support relieves ASSs, among primary and secondary school teachers. Method: A sample of 751 primary and secondary school teachers was selected to answer self-reported questionnaires regarding ASSs, social support, psychological needs, and the sense of control. Results: Structural equation modelling revealed that social support had a non-significant direct relationship with ASSs, and a significant indirect relationship with reduced ASSs via the needs for autonomy and relatedness, and via the paths from three types of psychological needs to the sense of control. Conclusion: These findings suggest that social support can play a relieving role in ASSs when the support satisfies individuals psychological needs and improves their sense of control. To alleviate ASSs among primary and secondary school teachers, more attention should be paid to satisfying their specific psychological needs and improving their sense of control.","output":"Social support and acute stress symptoms (ASSs) during the COVID-19 outbreak: deciphering the roles of psychological needs and sense of control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Evaluate six commercial serological assays for detection of IgA, IgM or IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in different disease severities.

In June 2021, the World Health Organization categorized it as a variant of concern (VOC). Therefore, it is vital to develop tests that can exclusively identify the Delta variant. Here, we developed a rapid screening assay to detect characteristic mutations observed in the Delta variant using high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. In this assay, we determined L452R and T478K, among which T478K is an identifier of the Delta variant since L452R is seen in other strains (Kappa and Epsilon variants). Additionally, nested PCR-based HRM analysis, which involved RT-PCR (1st PCR) and HRM analysis (2nd PCR), was developed to improve the specificity and sensitivity. Our method discriminated between the L452R mutant and wild-type L452. In addition, HRM analysis distinguished the T478K mutant from the wild-type T478. Seven clinical samples containing the Delta variant were successfully identified as L452R/T478K mutants. These results indicate that this HRM-based genotyping method can identify the Delta variant.

As such, \\"mechanisms\\" in ecoimmunology can refer to both the within-host processes that shape immunological phenotypes, or it can refer the ways in which different immunological phenotypes alter between-organism processes at ecological and evolutionary scales. The mechanistic questions ecoimmunologists can ask, both within-organisms and between-organisms, however, often have been limited by techniques that do not easily transfer to wild, non-model systems. Thus, a major focus in ecoimmunology has been developing and refining the available toolkit. Recently, this toolkit has been expanding at an unprecedented rate, bringing new challenges to choosing techniques and standardizing protocols across studies. By confronting these challenges, we will be able to enhance ecoimmunological inquiries into the physiological basis of life-history trade-offs; the development of low-cost biomarkers for susceptibility to disease; and the investigation of the ecophysiological underpinnings of disease ecology, behavior, and the coevolution of host-parasite systems. The technical advances in, and crossover technologies from, disciplines associated with ecoimmunology and how these advances can help us understand the mechanistic basis of immunological variability in wild species were the focus of the symposium, Methods and Mechanisms in Ecoimmunology.","output":"Mechanisms and methods in ecoimmunology: integrating within-organism and between-organism processes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The December 2019 COVID-19 outbreak in China has led to worldwide quarantine, as recommended by local governments and the World Health Organization. Particularly affected are older adults (i.e., those aged  65 years) who are at elevated risk for various adverse health outcomes, including declines in motor ability and physical activity (PA) participation, increased obesity, impaired cognition, and various psychological disorders. Thus, given the secular increases in the older adult population, novel and effective intervention strategies are necessary to improve physical activity behaviors and health in this population. Virtual reality (VR)-integrated exercise is a promising intervention strategy, which has been utilized in healthcare fields like stroke rehabilitation and psychotherapy. Therefore, the purpose of this editorial is to synthesize recent research examining the efficacy and effectiveness of VR exercise in the promotion of favorable health outcomes among the older adults. Results indicate the application of VR exercise to facilitate improved physical outcomes (e.g., enhanced motor ability, reduced obesity), cognition and psychological outcomes. VR exercise has also been observed to be an effective intervention strategy for fall prevention in this population. Future research should employ more rigorous research designs to allow for a more robust quantitative synthesis of the effect of VR exercise on the preceding outcomes to elucidate which type(s) of VR-based PA interventions are most effective in promoting improved health outcomes among older adults. Findings from this study will better inform the development of technology-savvy PA programs for wellness promotion in older adults who practice social distancing and exercise from home under the unprecedented global health crisis.","output":"Virtual reality exercise as a coping strategy for health and wellness promotion in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Adherence to therapy is one of the most important elements during the therapeutic process ensuring the predefined therapeutic outcomes. The aim is to analyze the need and importance of treatment adherence guideline for acromegaly patients and the possibilities for its development and implementation in Bulgaria. Methods: A set of methods was applied: (1) a literature review in the electronic database for identification of articles and guidelines related to adherence and acromegaly; (2) analysis of Bulgarian legislative documents; (3) a pilot study for assessment of the level of treatment adherence among hospitalized Bulgarian acromegaly patients in 2018; (4) a plan for development and implementation of specific guideline was created entitled BULMEDACRO - BULgarian guideline for MEdication aDherence assessment and improvement in ACROmegaly. Results: No specific guidelines for evaluation, monitoring, reporting and/or improving adherence in acromegaly patients has been found in the literature. Requirements for regular assessment of the level of adherence, application of appropriate methods for improvement and monitoring are not sufficiently formulated and mandatory. The pilot study confirmed that therapy adherence among Bulgarian patients with acromegaly is relatively high as almost 90% of patients report that they strictly comply with their prescribed treatment regimen. It is necessary, however, a specific guideline focused on the methods for assessment and improvement of adherence, in order to ensure monitoring and follow-up of acromegaly patients. Conclusions: Patients with acromegaly should be the focus of specially designed national programs, initiatives and/or guidelines for regular evaluation and improvement of the adherence level.

METHODS: This retrospective observational study compared hospital use and mortality in the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic with the year before the onset of the pandemic in six Brazilian capitals (S?o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Manaus, Fortaleza, Recife, and Brasilia). It was based on secondary administrative data from the SUS Hospital Information System (SIH), focusing on the number of hospitalizations per fortnight, age, and gender of patients, hospital length of stay, and the proportions of surgical, elective, with the use of ICU, and resulting in death hospitalizations. It also compared the number of hospitalizations and mortality related to frequent diagnostic groups. RESULTS: A significant drop was identified in the number of hospitalizations as of March 2020, with the first peak of COVID-19 hospitalizations in five capitals recorded in May 2020. In the six capitals, we observed significant reductions in the mean number of hospitalizations per fortnight from the beginning of the pandemic. We also identified an increase in the mean age of the patients and the proportion of male patients. The proportion of surgical and elective hospitalizations dropped significantly in all capitals, while the proportion of hospitalizations with ICU use increased significantly. Significant increases in-hospital mortality were also recorded in the six capitals with the pandemic, including or excluding COVID-19 hospitalizations from the comparison.

Methods Patient records were abstracted for the Mi-COVID19 data registry, including the hospital and insurer data of patients discharged from one of 38 participating hospitals in Michigan between March 16, 2020, and July 1, 2020. Registry data also included patient responses to a brief telephone survey on postdischarge employment, mental and emotional health, persistence of COVID-19Crelated symptoms, and medical follow-up. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data;analysis of variance and Pearson chi-squared test were used to evaluate racial and ethnic variances among patient outcomes and survey responses. Results Black patients experienced the lowest physician follow-up postdischarge (n = 65, 60.2%) and the longest delays in returning to work (average 35.5 days). More than half of hospital readmissions within the 60 days following discharge were among nonwhite patients (n = 144, 55%). The majority of postdischarge deaths were among white patients (n = 153, 21.5%), most of whom were discharged on palliative care (n = 103).

There is no precise vaccine/therapeutic agents available to combat the COVID-19 disease. Some repurposed drugs are saving the life of diseased, but the complete cure is relatively less. Several drug targets have been reported to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, in that TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2) is one of the potential targets; inhibiting this protease stops the virus entry into the host human cell. Camostat mesylate, nafamostat, and leupeptin are the drugs, in which the first two drugs are being used for COVID-19 and leupeptin also tested. To consider these drugs as the repurposed drug for COVID-19, it is essential to understand their binding affinity and stability with TMPRSS2. In the present study, we performed the molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of these molecules with the TMPRSS2. The docking study reveals that leupeptin molecule strongly binds with TMPRSS2 protein than the other two drug molecules. The RMSD and RMSF values of MD simulation confirm that leupeptin and the amino acids of TMPRSS2 are very stable than the other two molecules. Furthermore, leupeptin forms interactions with the key amino acids of TMPRSS2 and the same have been maintained during the MD simulations. This structural and dynamical information is useful to evaluate these drugs to be used as repurposed drugs, however, the strong binding profile of leupeptin with TMPRSS2, suggests, it may be considered as a repurposed drug for COVID-19 disease after clinical trial.

Thus, hypertension is one of the major global causes of premature death. Regarding the prevention and treatment of hypertension with no or few side effects, antihypertensive peptides (AHTPs) obtained from natural sources might be useful as nutraceuticals. Therefore, the search for alternative/novel AHTPs in food or natural sources has received much attention, as AHTPs may be functional agents for human health. AHTPs have been observed in diverse organisms, although many of them remain underinvestigated. The identification of peptides with antihypertensive activity in the laboratory is time- and resource-consuming. Alternatively, computational methods based on robust machine learning can identify or screen potential AHTP candidates prior to experimental verification. In this paper, we propose Ensemble-AHTPpred, an ensemble machine learning algorithm composed of a random forest (RF), a support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB), with the aim of integrating diverse heterogeneous algorithms to enhance the robustness of the final predictive model. The selected feature set includes various computed features, such as various physicochemical properties, amino acid compositions (AACs), transitions, n-grams, and secondary structure-related information; these features are able to learn more information in terms of analyzing or explaining the characteristics of the predicted peptide.

To better understand the predictors and impact of symptom persistence we analysed a prospective cohort of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients were followed for 9 months after COVID-19 onset. Duration and predictors of persistence of symptoms, physical health and psychological distress were assessed. RESULTS: 465 patients (54% males, 51% hospitalised) were included; 37% presented with at least 4 symptoms and 42% complained of symptom lasting more than 28 days. At month 9, 20% of patients were still symptomatic, showing mainly fatigue (11%) and breathlessness (8%). Hospitalisation and ICU stay vs. non-hospitalised status increased the median duration of fatigue of 8 weeks. Age > 50 years (OR 2.50), ICU stay (OR 2.35), and presentation with 4 or more symptoms (OR 2.04) were independent predictors of persistence of symptoms at month 9.

Examples of EIDs include COVID-19, Middle East respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus disease. EIDs are known for their complexity. Multiple factors play a role in their spread, including increases in human population, conflicts, urbanisation, air travel, global trade and inequalities in wealth distribution and access to healthcare. In order to gain a better understanding of such complexity, we aim to explore the role of systems science, which allows us to view EIDs in the context of complex adaptive systems rather than simple causes and effects. The objectives of this scoping review are to explore and map the theoretical concepts and key characteristics of studies that use systems methods in controlling EIDs, to identify the gaps in knowledge and disseminate the results. METHODS: We will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute guidance for this scoping review, comprising the following stages: formulating the research question and subquestions, scanning the literature for available data, selecting relevant publications, charting the data by two independent reviewers, aggregating the findings, reporting, summarising and disseminating the results. We will review peer-reviewed articles, preprints and grey literature available in all languages. DISCUSSION: We intend that this scoping review will contribute to a better understanding of the use of systems methods to inform policymakers about how to prevent and control EIDs.

Most places in Norway this practice has, however, been neglected over the last 5C7 decades, resulting in accumulation of above ground biomass including degenerated Calluna and successional fire-prone species, e.g., native juniper (Juniperus communis) and exotic blacklisted Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). Today, in dry periods, the heathland represents a fire threat to the increasing number of homes in the wildlandCurban interface (WUI), as exemplified by the June 2021 Sotra Island WUI fire. The fire burned 700 ha of encroached heathlands, destroyed three buildings, and threatened settlements. In the present study, the Sotra fire was investigated to understand the fire development and analyse possible risk reducing measures. Photographic material obtained during the fire, weather conditions prior to and during the fire, involved fire fuel, fire spread mechanisms, firefighting response, and possible consequences under slightly changed circumstances were analysed. Compared to previous fires in coastal Norway, the Sotra fire represents a step change in fire development including, e.g., pyrocumulus-like clouds, fire whirls, and fire spread 270 m across a fjord. Preventive measures based on the local context are analysed, including engaging voluntary communities to remove fire-prone fuel, e.g., juniper and Sitka, to create defensible space. Moreover, strategic fire breaks in the terrain, e.g., well-managed heathland strengthening existing fuel breaks, e.g., lakes, cultivated fields, naked rock, and roads, are recommended. Mechanical cutting is suggested as a short-term measure while fenceless grazing may represent a long-term solution to prevent regrowth.

By testing an array of mutated spike receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins, cell-expressed spike proteins from VOCs, and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs as pseudoviuses, or as the authentic viruses in culture, we show that mAbs directed against the ACE2 binding site (ACE2bs) are far more sensitive to viral evolution compared to anti-RBD non-ACE2bs mAbs, two of which kept their potency against all VOCs tested. At the second part of our study, we reveal the neutralization mechanisms at high molecular resolution of two anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs by structural characterization. We solved the structures of the Delta-neutralizing ACE2bs mAb TAU-2303 with the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer and RBD at 4.5 A? and 2.42 A?, respectively, revealing a similar mode of binding to that between the RBD and the ACE2 receptor.

We recorded total time and % of work hours spent on EHR, and differences in those based on seniority. Physicians reported duty hours using a standardized toolkit. RESULTS Physicians spent 3.8 (2) hours on EHR daily, which accounted for 37% (17%), 41% (14%), and 45% (12%) of their day for all clinicians, residents, and interns, respectively. With the progression of training, there was a reduction in EHR time (all p values <0.01).

At steps 1 and 2, data was synthesized and categorized using a thematic and content analysis approach, and this guided the formulation of the draft guideline. Within step 3, the draft Thai critical care allocation guideline was debated and finalized before entering the policy-decision stage. RESULTS: Three-order prioritization criteria consisting of (1) clinical prognosis using four tools (Charlson Comorbidity Index, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, frailty assessment and cognitive impairment assessment), (2) number of life-years saved and (3) social usefulness were proposed by the research team based on literature reviews and interviews. At consultations, stakeholders rejected using life-years as a criterion due to potential age and gender discrimination, as well as social utility due to a concern it would foster public distrust, as this judgement can be arbitrary. It was agreed that the attending physician is required to be the decision-maker in the Thai medico-legal context, while a patient review committee would play an advisory role. Allocation decisions are to be documented for transparency, and no appealing mechanism is to be applied. This guideline will be triggered only when demand exceeds supply after the utmost efforts to mobilize surge capacity. Once implemented, it is applicable to all patients, COVID-19 and non-COVID-19, requiring critical care resources prior to ICU admission and during ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: The guideline development process for the allocation of critical care resources in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand was informed by scientific evidence, medico-legal context, existing norms and societal values to reduce risk of public distrust given the sensitive nature of the issue and ethical dilemmas of the guiding principle, though it was conducted at record speed. Our lessons can provide an insight for the development of similar prioritization guidelines, especially in other low- and middle-income countries.","output":"Developing a Thai national critical care allocation guideline during the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review and stakeholder consultation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 25 participants came from across the country, including South Dakota and California, and taught in a wide variety of settings: public schools, private schools, charter schools, prisons, and institutions focusing on immigrants and ESL students.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The calcification insert of an anthropomorphic cardiac phantom was replaced with an aortic aneurysm model containing a stent, simulated endoleaks, and an intraluminal thrombus. CT was performed at tube energies of 120, 100, and 80 kVp with incrementally increasing noise indexes (NIs) of 16, 25, 34, 43, 52, 61, and 70 and a 2.5-mm section thickness. NI directly controls radiation exposure; a higher NI allows for greater image noise and decreases radiation. Images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and hybrid and fully iterative algorithms. Five radiologists independently analyzed lesion conspicuity to assess sensitivity and specificity. Mean attenuation (in Hounsfield units) and standard deviation were measured in the aorta to calculate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Attenuation and SNR of different protocols and algorithms were analyzed with analysis of variance or Welch test depending on data distribution. RESULTS Both sensitivity and specificity were 100% for simulated lesions on images with 2.5-mm section thickness and an NI of 25 (3.45 mGy), 34 (1.83 mGy), or 43 (1.16 mGy) at 120 kVp; an NI of 34 (1.98 mGy), 43 (1.23 mGy), or 61 (0.61 mGy) at 100 kVp; and an NI of 43 (1.46 mGy) or 70 (0.54 mGy) at 80 kVp. SNR values showed similar results. With the fully iterative algorithm, mean attenuation of the aorta decreased significantly in reduced-dose protocols in comparison with control protocols at 100 kVp (311 HU at 16 NI vs 290 HU at 70 NI, P  .0011) and 80 kVp (400 HU at 16 NI vs 369 HU at 70 NI, P  .0007). CONCLUSION Endoleaks and in-stent thrombus of thoracic aorta were detectable to 1.46 mGy (80 kVp) with FBP, 1.23 mGy (100 kVp) with the hybrid algorithm, and 0.54 mGy (80 kVp) with the fully iterative algorithm.","output":"Endoleak and in-stent thrombus detection with CT angiography in a thoracic aortic aneurysm phantom at different tube energies using filtered back projection and iterative algorithms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Functional status is a key patient-centric outcome, but there are little data on whether functional recovery post-stroke varies among hospitals. This study examined the distribution of functional status 3 months after stroke, determined whether these outcomes vary among hospitals, and identified hospital characteristics associated with better (or worse) functional outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS Observational analysis of the AVAIL study (Adherence Evaluation After Ischemic Stroke-Longitudinal) included 2083 ischemic stroke patients enrolled from 82 US hospitals participating in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke and AVAIL. The primary outcome was dependence or death at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of 3-6). Secondary outcomes included functional dependence (mRS score of 3-5), disabled (mRS score of 2-5), and mRS evaluated as a continuous score. By 3 months post-discharge, 36.5% of patients were functionally dependent or dead. Rates of dependence or death varied widely by discharging hospitals (range: 0%-67%). After risk adjustment, patients had lower rates of 3-month dependence or death when treated at teaching hospitals (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.96) and certified primary stroke centers (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.91). In contrast, a composite measure of hospital-level adherence to acute stroke care performance metrics, stroke volume, and bed size was not associated with downstream patient functional status. Findings were robust across mRS end points and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS One third of acute ischemic stroke patients were functionally dependent or dead 3 months postacute stroke; functional recovery rates varied considerably among hospitals, supporting the need to better determine which care processes can maximize functional outcomes.","output":"Hospital Variation in Functional Recovery After Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as an acute respiratory illness leading to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. As the disease spread, demands on health care systems increased, specifically the need to expand hospital capacity. Alternative care hospitals (ACHs) have been used to mitigate these issues; however, establishing an ACH has many challenges. The goal of this session was to perform systems testing, using a simulation-based evaluation to identify areas in need of improvement. METHODS: Four simulation cases were designed to depict common and high acuity situations encountered in the ACH, using a high technology simulator and standardized patient. A multidisciplinary observer group was given debriefing forms listing the objectives, critical actions, and specific areas to focus their attention. These forms were compiled for data collection. RESULTS: Logistical, operational, and patient safety issues were identified during the simulation and compiled into a simulation event report. Proposed solutions and protocol changes were made in response to the identified issues. CONCLUSION: Simulation was successfully used for systems testing, supporting efforts to maximize patient care and provider safety in a rapidly developed ACH. The simulation event report identified operational deficiencies and safety concerns directly resulting in equipment modifications and protocol changes.","output":"The Calm Before the Storm: Using In Situ Simulation to Evaluate for Preparedness of an Alternative Care Hospital During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The best treatment options of patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases (CIRD) in the pandemic have not been completely clear, especially in the beginning of the lockdown. Whether and to which degree pandemic-related therapy changes have occurred, has not been studied in detail. Objectives: To study the behaviour of patients with CIRD initially facing the COVID 19 pandemic related to their disease status and medication. Methods: Patients with CIRD were contacted by telephone to assess their health status and ask for changes in medication. Standardized assessment tools were used to assess disease activity, depression and anxiety. High disease activity was assumed if RADAI-5  3.2 and BASDAI  4. Anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D) of patients were assessed using HADS. A score < 8 was taken as indication of no major problem in this regard. Results: A total of 886 patients was interviewed between April 15 and June 15 of 2020. Here we report on 550 patients with complete information on standard assessments (62%). About 60% were female, mean age 54.413.7, mean disease duration 12.210.5 years. Most had spondyloarthritis (SpA, n=287) including axial SpA (axSpA, n=172) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA, n=116), in total 52.2%, while 40.2% had rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=221), and 7.6% connective tissue diseases (CTD, n=42). Most RA patients were on methotrexate (48.8%), while 43.8% took glucocorticoids. In addition, 61.0% of patients were on bDMARDs, mostly on TNF inhibitors (59.6%). More SpA than RA patients were on bDMARDs: 71.0% vs 49.7% respectively. A recent change in medication was reported by 182 patients (33.1%): 89 with RA (40.2%), 88 with SpA (30.6%) and 5 with CTD (11.9%). Half of those who changed (n=92;50.5%) admitted that the change was mainly made due to fear of the pandemic (16.7% of all patients).

The subsequent necessary lockdown decreed by the Italian Government had an outstanding impact on the daily life of the entire population, including that of Italian surgical residents activity. Our survey aims to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the training programme of Italian surgical residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a 12-item-electronic anonymous questionnaire on SurveyMonkey? web application. The survey was composed of different sections concerning demographic characteristics and impacts of COVID-19 on the concrete participation in clinical, surgical and research activities. Future perspectives of responders after the pandemic were also investigated. RESULTS: Eighty hundred responses were collected, and 756 questionnaires were considered eligible to be included in the study analysis. Almost 35 and 27% of respondents experienced, respectively, complete interruption of surgical and clinical activities. A subgroup analysis, comparing the COVID-19 impact on clinical activities with demographics data, showed a statistically significant difference related to specialties (p = 0.0062) and Italian regions (p < 0.0001). Moreover, 112 residents have been moved to non-surgical units dealing with COVID-19 or, in some case, they voluntarily decided to interrupt their residency programme to support the ongoing emergency. CONCLUSION: Our survey demonstrated that COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the educational programme of Italian surgical residents.

To date, there has been limited data available to understand the associations between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic and related characteristics with COVID-19 vaccine initiation and planned vaccination in the United States. To better characterize COVID-19 vaccinations nationally, the present study leveraged nationally-representative data with relatively complete race/ethnicity and socioeconomic data to estimate levels of vaccine initiation and the adjusted relative odds of vaccine initiation and planned vaccination among adults by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic and other characteristics. METHODS. Using pooled cross-sectional data from 66,994 adults aged 18-85 years in nationally-representative surveys by the U.S. Census Bureau administered between January 6, 2021 and January 18, 2021 and multivariable logistic regression, this study estimated the associations between race/ethnicity, education, and pre-pandemic (2019) household income with the self-reported: 1) receipt of []1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine; and 2) either receipt of []1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or the plan to definitely receive a vaccine once available to the respondent. RESULTS. In Hispanics and Black non-Hispanics, the estimated prevalences of vaccine initiation were 6.1% and 6.2%, respectively, compared to 8.7% in White non-Hispanics and 15.1% in Asian non-Hispanics. Controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors, Hispanics and Black non-Hispanics were no more or less likely than White non-Hispanics to have received []1 vaccine dose. However, for the combined outcome of either vaccine initiation or planned vaccination, Black non-Hispanics were 52% less likely than White non-Hispanics to have reported either outcome (P<.001). Meanwhile, both education and pre-pandemic income levels exhibited evidence of positive dose-response relationships with vaccine initiation (P for linear trend = .01 and <.001, respectively). Substantial (vs. no) financial hardship was linked to 44% lower odds of vaccination (P<.001). The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy were concerns about side effects and safety. CONCLUSIONS. In this large, nationally-representative study with relatively complete race/ethnicity and socioeconomic data, we find that being Black non-Hispanic and having the least education and income were each independently associated with a markedly lower likelihood of definitely planning to get vaccinated or having been vaccinated. In the ensuing months of the pandemic, addressing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities in vaccination due to differential access and vaccine hesitancy will be critical to mitigate the pandemic's disproportionately higher risks of infection and adverse outcomes in Black non-Hispanics and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups and to help maximize vaccination coverage nationwide.","output":"Associations of Race/Ethnicity and Other Demographic and Socioeconomic Factors with Vaccination During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The high energy consumption of cryptocurrency transactions has raised concerns about the environment and sustainability among green investors and regulatory authorities.

What are the characteristics of less economic oilfields, fields whose profitably is at the margin? These oilfields may differ from average fields in terms of geographical location, crude type, production practices, and carbon intensity (CI). Because these economically-marginal fields are the ones likely to respond to drop in demand (e.g., due to 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, or a rapid shift to alternatives), they represent the likely sources of oil that would be displaced. The present paper links the field-by-field costs of 1933 oilfields (representing ~ 90% of 2015 worldwide crude production) with their production environmental footprint. We show that many marginal fields also have high CI. We estimate that the fields at margin due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic demand reduction have upstream CI and marginal cost of production ~ 35% and 3 times higher than global average, respectively. The production termination of these fields could result in 181 Mtonne CO 2 Eq. annual reduction in upstream emissions in the short-term. The marginal producers in a generic small demand shock (5% or ~ 3.6 mmbbl/d drop) have an upstream CI 26% higher than average global oil producers, and at our larger generic demand shock (20% or ~ 14.3 mmbbl/d drop) have CI that is 5% higher than average. Heavy oilfields have the highest volume share in marginal crudes in all scenarios. These results further suggest that life cycle benefits of alternative fuels or vehicles or regulations that lead to reduced oil consumption are systematically larger than those typically estimated when displaced emissions are modeled using average crudes. The results only cover the upstream production CI and do not include synergistic impacts of differences in refining CI of different types of crudes, and thus could underestimate the total life cycle differences between marginal and average crudes.","output":"Oil carbon intensity impacts of COVID-19 and other short-term demand shocks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Analyzing the metabolic dependencies of tumor cells is vital for cancer diagnosis and treatment.

However, other mistletoe species including Taxillus sutchuenensis var. duclouxii, Korthalsella japonica, and Loranthus tanakae are frequently distributed as authentic V. coloratum in Korean markets because of similarities in the branches morphology and Korean names of these species with V. coloratum.

This course is a pioneering effort in the field of Indias PG medical education. NMC entrusted Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE) to design and offer the MOOC, named as Basic Course in Biomedical Research (BCBR). We describe the experience of designing and that of implementation challenges in the inaugural cycle of the course. METHODS: The course objective was to inculcate the fundamental concepts in research methods covering epidemiology and biostatistics in the form of video lectures, resource materials, discussion forum, assignments, feedback and a final proctored examination. The course was delivered over 16 weeks through MOOCs platform under the Indian Ministry of Education. We reviewed records, documents and faculty notes and described the course conceptualization, development, design and implementation process. We abstracted information from course portal on enrolment profile of the participants, self-reported course feedback (structured and open-ended on format, lectures and quality of contents), examination registration form, scores obtained in the assignments/examination and that of the participant queries. We described quantitative data using descriptive statistics. We presented the thematic analysis of qualitative data from open-ended questions in the feedback system and that of email interactions.

Respiratory features were often severe as 48% needed oxygen support upon admission. Twenty-eight out of 43 patients (65%) with a CT-scan had mild to severe parenchymal impairment, and 38/43 (88%) had bilateral impairment. Thirty-two patients presented respiratory distress requiring oxygen support &#8805;6 liters/minute. Twenty-four deaths occurred, including 21 during hospitalization in our unit, 2 among the 8 patients transferred to ICU, and one at home after discharge from hospital, leading to a global mortality rate of 24% at W4. Age, acute renal failure and respiratory distress were associated with mortality at W4. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of elderly COVID-19 patients with several comorbidities and severe clinical features survived, a finding that could provide arguments against transferring the most fragile patients to ICU.","output":"Clinical, biological and radiological features, 4-week outcomes and prognostic factors in COVID-19 elderly inpatients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drugs targeting host proteins can act prophylactically to reduce viral burden early in disease and limit morbidity, even with antivirals and vaccination. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is a human protease required for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and may represent such a target. We hypothesized that drugs selected from proteins related by their tertiary structure, rather than their primary structure, were likely to interact with TMPRSS2. We created a structure-based phylogenetic computational tool named 3DPhyloFold to systematically identify structurally similar serine proteases with known therapeutic inhibitors and demonstrated effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo. Several candidate compounds, Avoralstat, PCI-27483, Antipain, and Soybean-Trypsin-Inhibitor, inhibited TMPRSS2 in biochemical and cell infection assays. Avoralstat, a clinically tested Kallikrein-related B1 inhibitor, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in human airway epithelial cells. In an in vivo proof of principle, Avoralstat significantly reduced lung tissue titers and mitigated weight-loss when administered prophylactically to SARS-CoV-2 susceptible mice indicating its potential to be repositioned for COVID-19 prophylaxis in humans.","output":"Structure-based phylogeny identifies Avoralstat as a TMPRSS2 inhibitor that prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary fibrosis is a severe chronic lung disease that causes irreversible scarring in the tissues of the lungs, which results in the loss of lung capacity.

Our research intent is to understand how branded app quality counters perceived counterfeit deception (PCD) and engenders trust while analyzing consumer willingness to buy (WillB) in an emerging market. This work captures the perception of 1,146 online shoppers through a questionnaire-based survey and uses SPSSv23 and Amos 21 to construct a structural equation model to test the conceptual model. The results indicate that information quality (IQ), system quality (SysQ), and service quality (ServQ) of branded apps negatively affect PCD, and IQ and SysQ positively affect consumers trust in the seller. The study establishes stronger effects of SysQ and ServQ on PCD than on trust, and alongside this, a stronger effect of IQ on trust than on PCD is witnessed. Hence, the study proves that ServQ and SysQ are sale qualifiers and IQ is a sale enabler in counterfeiting contexts. A strong direct negative effect of PCD on WillB seems to overwhelm the positive effect of trust on WillB.

In this before-and-after study design, 199 patients and 248 patients were included in a 3-day SDD group and a 2-day SDD group, respectively. The rates of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ICU infections were similar in both groups. The rates of bloodstream infection and bacteriuria were significantly lower in the 2-day SDD group than in the 3-day SDD group. Compared with the patients in the 3-day group, the patients in the 2-day SDD group received fewer antibiotics and less exposure to mechanical ventilation, and they used fewer ICU resources.

However, an in-depth understanding of how microalgae respond to temperature stress is still unclear. In particular, the regulation mechanism under opposite temperature (heat and cold) stress had not yet been reported. In this study, the physicochemical properties and transcription level of related genes of microalgae Auxenochlorella protothecoides UTEX 2341 under heat and cold stress were investigated. Heat stress (Hs) caused a drastic increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in UTEX 2341. As key elements responded to Hs, superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme increased by 150%, 70%, and 30% in activity, and nitric oxide (NO) grew by 409.6%, 212.5%, and 990.4% in content compared with the control at 48a?h, 96a?h, 168a?h. Under cold stress (Cs), ROS increased in the early stage and decreased in the later stage. As key factors responded to Cs, proline (Pro) increased respectively by 285%, 383%, and 81% in content, and heat shock transcriptional factor HSFA1d increased respectively by 161%, 71%, and 204% in transcript level compared with the control at 48a?h, 96a?h, 168a?h. Furthermore, the transcript level of antioxidant enzymes or antioxidant coding genes was consistent with the changing trend of enzymes activity or antioxidant content. Notably, both glutathione (GSH) and heat shock protein 97 (hsp 97) were up-regulated in response to Hs and Cs. In conclusion, GSH and hsp 97 were the core elements of UTEX 2341 in response to both Hs and Cs.

Methods: We used prospective data from 3041 participants in four cohorts of community-dwelling individuals aged []65 years in Spain. Data were obtained using validated questionnaires through a pre-pandemic face-to-face interview and a telephone interview conducted between weeks 7 to 15 after the beginning the COVID-19 lockdown. Lineal or multinomial, as appropriate, regression models with adjustment for the main confounders were used to assess changes in the outcome variables from the pre-pandemic to the confinement period, and to identify their associated factors. Results: On average, the confinement was not associated with a deterioration in lifestyle risk factors (smoking, alcohol intake, diet or weight), except for a decreased physical activity and increased sedentary time, which reversed with the end of confinement. However, chronic pain worsened, and moderate declines in mental health, that did not seem to reverse after restrictions were lifted, were observed. Several subgroups of individuals were at increased risk of developing unhealthier lifestyles or mental health decline with confinement: (i)-males (for physical activity and sedentariness), (ii)-those with greater social isolation (for diet, physical activity, mental health), (iii)-feelings of loneliness (for diet, sleep quality, mental health), (iv)-poor housing conditions (for diet, physical activity, TV viewing time), (v)-unhealthy sleep duration (for physical activity and sedentariness), and (vi-worse overall health or chronic morbidities (for physical activity, screen time, mental health). On the other hand, previously having a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet and doing more physical activity protected older adults from developing unhealthier lifestyles with confinement. Conclusions: The lockdown during the first wave of the COVID-19 in Spain, which was one of the most restrictive in Europe, only led to minor average changes in health behaviors among older adults.

However, noncommunicable and communicable diseases comprise much of the burden of disease in women. METHODS: A quantitative analysis of the main health content of articles published in six women's health journals (WHJ) and five general medical journals (GMJ) in 2010 and 2020 was conducted to categorize the main medical area topics of published articles and the life stage under study. Findings were compared with the leading causes of disease in women according to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. RESULTS: There were 1483 articles eligible for analysis. In total, in WHJ, 44% of topics were reproductive health, increasing from 36% in 2010 to 49% in 2020, which was similar to GMJ. Noncommunicable disease was the next most addressed topic, with cancer being the major disease area covered. When compared with the GBD study, major disease areas such as infectious disease, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal disorders were underrepresented as topics in women's health publications. Most articles that focused on a particular life stage were on pregnancy or the reproductive years, with very few articles on menopause. CONCLUSION: Women's health publishing remains largely focused on reproductive health topics, with few articles on many of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in women.

More and more physicians began offering video consultations at their clinics, and the market of commercial telemedicine platforms proliferated. Despite increased availability and obvious benefits, such as convenience, many patients remain hesitant about using video consultations.OBJECTIVE: This thesis aims to evaluate the relative importance of the consultation mode in a patients appointment choice and provide insights to practitioners and policymakers to promote video consultation uptake. This study further investigates individual characteristics that may affect preferences for video over in-clinic consultations.METHODS: An online self-administered discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted with adults living in Germany through a crowdsourcing provider in November 2020. Based on interviews with patients and healthcare experts, consultation mode, the waiting time until the next available appointment, the waiting time on appointment day, opening hours, and continuity of care were included as attributes. Mixed logit models were used to analyze the choice data. Predictive analyses based on individual choice probabilities were performed to determine the impact of univariate and multivariate attribute level changes on the choice probability of a video compared to a typical in-clinic consultation and opt-out.RESULTS: A total of 459 participants started the survey, of which 350 (76.3%) complete and valid responses were included. The sample was representative of the German adult population in gender and age. Among the included participants, 79 (22.6%) had experience with telemedicine. Participants largely preferred in-clinic over video consultations (=-1.429, P<.001). The level of continuity of care (46%) and the waiting time until the next available appointment (22%) were shown to have a higher relative importance than consultation mode (18%). If the consultation mode was in-clinic, the level of continuity of care (54%) was shown to be twice as important as the waiting time until the next available appointment (27%). In contrast, the waiting time until the next available appointment (33%) was shown to be almost as important as the level of continuity of care (34%) if the consultation mode was video. Significant increases in the utility of video compared to in-clinic consultations were observed for participants with less data privacy concerns (P=.001), higher technology proficiency (P<.001), and more fear of Covid-19 (P=.018). The predicted probability of choosing a video over a typical in-clinic consultation and opt-out increased from <1% for the worst-case to 40% for the best-case video consultation scenario.CONCLUSION: This study provides insights on the effect of consultation mode on appointment choice in a time when telemedicine gains momentum. The results of this DCE suggest that policymakers and providers of video consultations should focus on increasing the level of continuity of care and decreasing the waiting time until the next available appointment to prompt the adoption of video consultations.

The objective of our study was to describe the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infections in different pediatric age groups during the first 2 months of the fall back-to-school period, in the context of increasing viral transmission in France. METHODS: Weekly epidemiological data provided by Sant Publique France and the Ministry of National Education were analyzed according to the age groups defined by the different school levels. Weeks (W) 34-42 were considered for analysis. RESULTS: The PCR positivity rate and incidence rate increased in all age groups during the study period, in an age-dependent manner. At W42, with adults being considered as reference, the risk ratio for a positive PCR test was 0.46 [95% CI: 0.44-0.49] and 0.69 [0.68-0.70] for children aged 0-5 years and 6-17 years, respectively. Similarly, the incidence rate ratio was 0.09 [0.08-0.09], 0.31 [0.30-0.32], 0.64 [0.63-0.66], and 1.07 [1.05-1.10] for children aged 0-5 years, 6-10 years, 11-14 years, and 15-17 years, respectively. Children and adolescents accounted for 1.9% of the newly hospitalized patients between W34 and W42, and for 1.3% of new intensive care admissions. No death was observed. Among infected children and adolescents, the percentage of asymptomatic individuals was 57% at W34 and 48% at W42. The number of schools closed remained low, less than 1% throughout the study period. The number of confirmed cases among school staff was consistent with the data measured in the general population. CONCLUSION: In the context of increasing viral transmission in the population, the spread among children and adolescents remained lower than that observed among adults, despite keeping schools open. However, the impact was age-dependent, with data in high schools close to those observed in adults.","output":"Reopening schools in the context of increasing COVID-19 community transmission: The French experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the spread of COVID-19 on a global scale, most of efforts at national and international levels were directed to mitigate the spread of the disease and its physical harm, paying less attention to the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on global mental health especially at early stages of the pandemic. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess and explore (i) The levels of psychological distress and its correlates (ii) Motivation for distance learning (iii) Coping activities and pandemic related concerns, among university students in Jordan in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire. The measure of psychological distress was obtained using the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, while other questions have explored our studys second and third aims. RESULTS: A total of 381 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis. Female participants slightly predominated the sample (n = 199, 52.2%). The respondents aged 18C38 years (mean 22.6 years, SD: 3.16). Concerning distress severity, most of respondents were regarded as having severe psychological distress (n = 265, 69.5%). 209 students (54.9%) reported that they had no motivation for distance learning. Ordinal logistic regression revealed a significant correlation between distress severity and many predictors. Among the predictors that were found to act as protective factors against higher levels of distress included older age (aOR = 0.64, P = 0.022; 95% CI: 0.44C0.94), and having a strong motivation for distance learning (aOR = 0.10, P = 0.048; 95% CI: 0.01C0.96). In contrary, being a current smoker (aOR = 1.99, P = 0.049; 95% CI: 1.10C3.39), and having no motivation for distance learning (aOR = 2.49, P = 0.007; 95% CI: 1.29C4.80) acted as risk factors for having higher levels of psychological distress among the students. The most common coping activity reported was spending more time on social media platforms (n = 269, 70.6%), and 209 students (54.9%) reported distance learning as their most distressing concern.

We calculate the annualized volatility per sector, screen the contents of the reports for stated effects of the pandemic on profits, and analyze stock price reactions in four different phases of the pandemic. The results show that stock markets have reacted with an increased price volatility. Manufacturers of fertilizers and agrochemicals as well as food distributors show particularly high volatilities in their stock prices. Low price volatility was observed in the stocks of food retailers. This pattern is also reflected in the profits of companies published in financial reports.

Although its prevailing symptoms include anosmia, ageusia, dry couch, fever, shortness of brief, arthralgia, myalgia, and fatigue, regional and methodological assessments vary, leading to heterogeneous clinical descriptions of COVID-19. Aging, uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and exposure to androgens have been correlated with worse prognosis in COVID-19. Abnormalities in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and the androgen-driven transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) have been elicited as key modulators of SARS-CoV-2. MAIN TEXT: While safe and effective therapies for COVID-19 lack, the current moment of pandemic urges for therapeutic options. Existing drugs should be preferred over novel ones for clinical testing due to four inherent characteristics: 1. Well-established long-term safety profile, known risks and contraindications; 2. More accurate predictions of clinical effects; 3. Familiarity of clinical management; and 4. Affordable costs for public health systems. In the context of the key modulators of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, endocrine targets have become central as candidates for COVID-19. The only endocrine or endocrine-related drug class with already existing emerging evidence for COVID-19 is the glucocorticoids, particularly for the use of dexamethasone for severely affected patients. Other drugs that are more likely to present clinical effects despite the lack of specific evidence for COVID-19 include anti-androgens (spironolactone, eplerenone, finasteride and dutasteride), statins, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), ACE inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and direct TMPRSS-2 inhibitors (nafamostat and camostat). Several other candidates show less consistent plausibility. In common, except for dexamethasone, all candidates have no evidence for COVID-19, and clinical trials are needed. CONCLUSION: While dexamethasone may reduce mortality in severely ill patients with COVID-19, in the absence of evidence of any specific drug for mild-to-moderate COVID-19, researchers should consider testing existing drugs due to their favorable safety, familiarity, and cost profile. However, except for dexamethasone in severe COVID-19, drug treatments for COVID-19 patients must be restricted to clinical research studies until efficacy has been extensively proven, with favorable outcomes in terms of reduction in hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death.","output":"Repurposing existing drugs for COVID-19: an endocrinology perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The COVID-19 epidemic has forced a change in the way contact with the physiotherapist is organised. This sitaution has created a risk for infants exposed to worsening disorders resulting from rehabilitation measures not being implemented or being interrupted. The online physiotherapy consultations, which were practised thus far, have become widespread. Material and methods: An online diagnostic survey was conducted among 151 parents of infants who had received an online physiotherapy consultation during the pandemic period. The survey comprised 25 questions. These questions concerned the impact of online consultation on increasing parents' sense of competence, the possibility of replacing in-clinic consultation with online consultation, and identifying the benefits and limitations of conducting this form of support. Relationships between variables were tested using the chi-square test with a significance level of p = 0.05. Results: The questionnaire data showed that the reasons for using online consultation were: muscle tone disorders, positioning asymmetry, motor development delay, assessing the child's development and learning how to properly care for the infant. The benefits of an online visit included saving time by not travelling to the physiotherapist and the opportunity to consult a specialist who would otherwise be impossible to meet due to distance. The respondents indicated the lack of physiotherapists in their place of residence. The sense of security for the child in a familiar environment was emphasised, while challenges were posed by the lack of direct contact with the physiotherapist and the organisational and equipment requirements of the visit. Conclusions: Online consultations restore the possibility of continuing therapy and early diagnosis, as well as increasing parents' sense of competence.

We calculated recurrence odds ratios in the medium group and the high group compared to the low group using multivariate logistic analysis. After we examined the relationship between SUV(max) and recurrence in a crude model, we adjusted for some factors. Tumors with higher SUV(max) showed higher recurrence odds ratios (medium group; 1.84, high group; 4.14, respectively). The tumor size also increased the recurrence odds ratio (2.67); we thought this was mainly due to selection bias because we excluded tumors less than 10mm in diameter.

Here, we developed recombinant human ACE2-Fc fusion protein (hACE2-Fc) and a hACE2-Fc mutant with reduced catalytic activity. hACE2-Fc and the hACE2-Fc mutant both efficiently blocked entry of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63 into hACE2-expressing cells and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cellCcell fusion. hACE2-Fc also neutralized various SARS-CoV-2 strains with enhanced infectivity including D614G and V367F mutations, as well as the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), and B.1.617.2 (Delta), demonstrating its potent and broad-spectrum antiviral effects. In addition, hACE2-Fc proteins protected HBE from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies, hACE2-Fc treatment did not induce the development of escape mutants. Furthermore, both prophylactic and therapeutic hACE2-Fc treatments effectively protected mice from SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by reduced viral replication, weight loss, histological changes, and inflammation in the lungs.

Limited availability of contact information made contact tracing diffcult or impractical in combating the outbreak. METHODS We consider the development of multi-scale public health strategies that act on individual and community levels. We simulate policies for community-level response aimed at early screening all members of a community, as well as travel restrictions to prevent inter-community transmission. RESULTS Our analysis shows the policies to be effective even at a relatively low level of compliance and for a variety of local and long range contact transmission networks. In our simulations, 40% of individuals conforming to these policies is enough to stop the outbreak. Simulations with a 50% compliance rate are consistent with the case counts in Liberia during the period of rapid decline after mid September, 2014. We also find the travel restriction to be effective at reducing the risks associated with compliance substantially below the 40% level, shortening the outbreak and enabling efforts to be focused on affected areas.

These organisms have been isolated from shaded environments such as microbial mats, soil, rock, and stromatolites.

Currently, discovering new chlorophyll f cyanobacteria involves lengthy incubation times under selective far-red light. We have used a marker gene to detect chlorophyll f organisms in environmental samples and metagenomic data. This marker, apcE2, encodes a phycobilisome linker associated with FRL-photosynthesis. By focusing on a far-red motif within the sequence, degenerate PCR and BLAST searches can effectively discriminate against the normal chlorophyll a-associated apcE. Even short recovered sequences carry enough information for phylogenetic placement. Markers of chlorophyll f photosynthesis were found in metagenomic datasets from diverse environments around the globe, including cyanobacterial symbionts, hypersaline lakes, corals, and the Arctic/Antarctic regions.

The graphical interpretation justify that the effective utilization of keeping the social-distancing, making the quarantine of people (or contact-tracing policy) and to make hospitalization of confirmed infected people that dramatically reduces the number of infected individuals (enhancing the quarantine or contact-tracing by 50% from its baseline reduces 84% in the predicted number of confirmed infected cases). Moreover, it is observed that without quarantine and hospitalization the scenario of the disease in Pakistan is very worse and the infected cases are raising rapidly.

Many providers are interested in understanding the quality of their telehealth services from the patients' experience. Materials and Methods: A telehealth patient satisfaction survey (TPSS) was developed by using an iterative stakeholder-centered design approach, incorporating elements from validated telemedicine and customer service survey instruments, and meeting the operational needs and constraints. A cross-sectional study design was employed to collect survey responses from patients and families of a large pediatric hospital. Finally, we performed exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to extract latent constructs and factor loadings of the survey items to further explain relationships. Results: A 22-item TPSS closely matched the existing in-person patient satisfaction survey and mapped to a revised SERVPERF conceptual model that was proposed by the interdisciplinary committee. Survey was implemented in the HIPPA-compliant online platform REDCap? with survey link embedded in an automated Epic MyChart (Verona, WI) visit follow-up message. In total, 2,394 survey responses were collected between July 7, 2020, and September 2, 2020. EFA revealed three constructs (with factor loadings >0.30): admission process, perceived quality of services, and telehealth satisfaction.

The virus surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) is responsible for both viral attachment and release. Similarity to bovine and porcine torovirus hemagglutinin-esterase (BToV HE, PToV HE), bovine coronavirus HE (BCoV HE) and influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (InfC HEF) proteins were exploited in a computational homology-based structure analysis of ISAV HE. The analysis resolved structural aspects of the protein and identified important features of relevance to ISAV HE activity. By recombinant expression and purification of secretory HE (recHE) proteins, receptor-binding and quantitative analyses of enzymatic activities displayed by ISAV HE molecules are presented for the first time. Three different recHE molecules were constructed: one representing a high virulent isolate, one a low virulent, while in the third a Ser(32) to Ala(32) amino acid substitution was introduced in the enzymatic catalytic site as inferred from the model. The three amino acid differences between the high and low virulent variants, of which two localized to the putative receptor-binding domain and one in the esterase domain, had no impact on receptor-binding or -release activities. In contrast, the Ser(32) amino acid substitution totally abolished enzymatic activity while receptor binding increased, as observed by agglutination of Atlantic salmon red blood cells. This demonstrates the essential role of a serine in the enzyme's catalytic site. In conclusion, structural analysis of ISAV HE in combination with selected recHE proteins gave insights into structureCfunction relationships and opens up for further studies aiming at dissecting molecular determinants of ISAV virulence.","output":"Structural and functional analysis of the hemagglutinin-esterase of infectious salmon anaemia virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psoriasis is defined as chronic, immune-mediated disease. Regardless of the development of new therapeutic approaches, the precise etiology of psoriasis remains unknown and speculative. The aim of this review was to systematize the results of previous research on the role of oxidative stress and aberrant immune response in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, as well as the impact of certain therapeutic modalities on the oxidative status in patients with psoriasis. Complex immune pathways of both the innate and adaptive immune systems appear to be major pathomechanisms in the development of psoriasis. Oxidative stress represents another important contributor to the pathophysiology of disease, and the redox imbalance in psoriasis has been reported in skin cells and, systemically, in plasma and blood cells, and more recently, also in saliva. Current immune model of psoriasis begins with activation of immune system in susceptible person by some environmental factor and loss of immune tolerance to psoriasis autoantigens. Increased production of IL-17 appears to be the most prominent role in psoriasis pathogenesis, while IL-23 is recognized as master regulator in psoriasis having a specific role in cross bridging the production of IL-17 by innate and acquired immunity. Other proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-, TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-22, IL-26, IL-29, or IL-36, have also been reported to play important roles in the development of psoriasis. Oxidative stress can promote inflammation through several signaling pathways. The most noticeable and most powerful antioxidative effects exert various biologics compared to more convenient therapeutic modalities, such as methotrexate or phototherapy. The complex interaction of redox, immune, and inflammatory signaling pathways should be focused on further researches tackling the pathophysiology of psoriasis, while antioxidative supplementation could be the solution in some refractory cases of the disease.","output":"Psoriasis between Autoimmunity and Oxidative Stress: Changes Induced by Different Therapeutic Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) have been at high risk of infection This study investigated clinical and treatment characteristics of infected HCWs at a cardiovascular hospital METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary cardiovascular hospital and included HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 Subjects completed a questionnaire on health status, symptoms, admission to hospital and treatment Vaccination status against tuberculosis, hepatitis B and seasonal influenza was assessed Pneumonia was defined as ground glass opacifications (GGOs) and consolidations on computed tomography (CT) RESULTS: This study included 107 HCWs with confirmed COVID-19, representing 15% of all HCWs (n = 726) at the study hospital Most of the confirmed cases worked in the cardiac surgery department, the anaesthesiology and intensive care medicine department, and the postoperative ward [74/107 (69%)] A substantial number of infected HCWs were asymptomatic [31 (28 9%)], and 38 (35 5%) were admitted to hospital The mean +/- standard deviation length of hospital stay was 8 1 +/- 5 6 days Seventy-five of 107 (70 1%) confirmed cases had been vaccinated against seasonal influenza Pneumonia with GGOs and consolidations on CT occurred in 25 of 107 (23 4%) HCWs, with 14 (13 1%) cases of bilateral involvement On multivariate logistic regression analysis including characteristics known to be associated with poorer outcomes in COVID-19 (i e obesity, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, current smoking, heart failure, seasonal influenza immunization), only seasonal influenza immunization remained an independent predictor of the occurrence of bilateral pneumonia (odds ratio 0 207, 95% confidence interval 0 050-0 847;P = 0 029) CONCLUSIONS: The association found between seasonal influenza immunization and less-aggressive COVID-19 pneumonia may support the implementation of preventive measures to reduce the global burden of COVID-19","output":"Pneumonia in healthcare workers during a COVID-19 outbreak at a cardiovascular hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The restrictions imposed by the Italian government because of the coronavirus outbreak have been shown to be demanding on the Italian population.

We planned to study the survival rate, early and late mortality and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in patients undergoing DVR for rheumatic heart disease, with various generations of prosthetic valves ranging from ball in cage to bileaflet prosthesis and tilting disc valves. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY: We followed up 277 patients with rheumatic heart disease who underwent DVR between August 1999 and November 2009, retrospectively, at Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram. Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were followed up for a minimum period of 10 years, and the follow-up period varied between 10 and 20 years. Eighteen patients were lost to follow-up after the surgery and could not be contacted. Their data was included till the time they appeared for follow-up last, for survival analysis. Survival analysis was carried out using the life table method to calculate the freedom from reoperation, survival rates and freedom from MACCE at 1 year, 5 years and 10 years post-DVR. RESULTS: The median duration of hospital stay was 8 days. The number of patients with stroke was 11 (4.26%), 21 (8.7%) and 29 (12%) at the end of 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years, respectively. A total of 5 (2%) patients underwent reoperation by the end of 10 years. Seven patients died either in hospital or in the first 30 days following operation, making the early mortality 2.5%. At the end of 1 year, a total of 16 patients (5.8%) died. The mortality at the end of 5 years was 6.8% (19 patients), and at the end of 10 years, it was 7.2% (20 patients). The survival rate of the study population was 94.9%, 93.02% and 93.02% at the completion of 1 year, 5 years and 10 years, respectively. The freedom from MACCE was 93.8%, 88.6% and 85% at 1 year, 5 years and 10 years, respectively. The freedom from re-operation was 98% at 10 years. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an overall survival time of 226.3 months in the entire study population. The mean survival time in males was 227.5 months and in females was 206.3 months, with no statistically significant difference between the two. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed an association with mortality when DVR was combined with concomitant tricuspid valve repair procedures, with an odds ratio of 4.5 (p value 0.005). Multivariate logistic regression analysis also showed an association with mortality when tricuspid valve procedures were combined with DVR with an odds ratio of 5.25 (p value 0.003). CONCLUSION: The operative mortality and morbidity for DVR have been significantly reduced with advancements in operative techniques, myocardial preservation and postoperative care.

deaths was registered in May and June in Moscow, St Petersburg, Leningrad and Moscow regions and the Republic of Dagestan (in May) There was no increase in mortality in 3 regions during any of the 6 months Unstable dynamics was determined in the majority of RF regions, and no region revealed any monthly increase in the number of deaths as compared to the previous 3 years In general for the Russian Federation the proportion of deaths with any mention of COVID-19 on the medical certificate of death (MSD) in both May and June 2020 was 7 3 and 4 3%, respectively, as the main cause of death, varying significantly in the regions In May 55 3% of ?excessive? deaths and in June 39 7% of cases were due to COVID-19 as the main cause of death (in Moscow 47 5 and 43 5%;in Moscow region 52 2 and 60 4%;in St Petersburg 50 and 69 3% respectively) In some regions, deaths from COVID-19 were recorded as the main cause of death without an ?excessive? number of deaths, while in others the opposite situation was observed When comparing regions according to the data specified in the MSD, the variability of the fraction of causes of death was revealed: a) from COVID-19 as the main cause of death (with an identified and unidentified virus), b) as the cause contributing to death;c) not affecting the cause of death in the regions under consideration Conclusions The received results testify to the expressed variability of influence COVID-19 on ?excessive mortality?

A 'primary' intramolecular polyprotein processing event mediated by 2A occurs at its own C terminus. FMDV 2A activity was studied in artificial polyproteins in which sequences encoding reporter proteins flanked the 2A sequence such that a single, long, open reading frame was created. The self-processing properties of these artificial polyproteins were investigated and the co-translational 'cleavage' products quantified. The processing products from our artificial polyprotein systems showed a molar excess of 'cleavage' product N-terminal of 2A over the product C-terminal of 2A. A series of experiments was performed to characterize our in vitro translation systems. These experiments eliminated the translational or transcriptional properties of the in vitro systems as an explanation for this imbalance. In addition, the processing products derived from a control construct encoding the P1P2 region of the human rhinovirus polyprotein, known to be proteolytically processed, were quantified and found to be equimolar. Translation of a construct encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP), FMDV 2A and beta-glucuronidase, also in a single open reading frame, in the presence of puromycin, showed this antibiotic to be preferentially incorporated into the [GFP2A] translation product. We conclude that the discrete translation products from our artificial polyproteins are not produced by proteolysis. We propose that the FMDV 2A sequence, rather than representing a proteolytic element, modifies the activity of the ribosome to promote hydrolysis of the peptidyl(2A)-tRNA(Gly) ester linkage, thereby releasing the polypeptide from the translational complex, in a manner that allows the synthesis of a discrete downstream translation product to proceed. This process produces a ribosomal 'skip' from one codon to the next without the formation of a peptide bond.","output":"Analysis of the aphthovirus 2A/2B polyprotein 'cleavage' mechanism indicates not a proteolytic reaction, but a novel translational effect: a putative ribosomal 'skip'."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a pandemic since March 2020 and led to significant challenges to over 200 countries and regions all over the world.

METHODS: Using a general questionnaire, a self-designed new coronavirus pneumonia knowledge and cognitive behavior questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), we conducted an internet-based questionnaire survey of 3881 college students in Guangdong Province. A multinomial-logistic regression model was used to analyze the collected data. RESULTS: The survey showed that 69.47% of the college students had a high level of awareness of COVID-19; the overall incidence of anxiety was 26.60%, and the incidences of mild, moderate and severe anxiety were 23.19%, 2.71%, and 0.70%, respectively. Depressive emotions were detected in 21.16% of the students, and the incidences of mild, moderate, and moderate-to-severe depression were 16.98%, 3.17%, and 1.01%, respectively. The results of multivariate analysis showed that an older age was associated with a higher level of awareness of COVID-19 and greater changes in future health behaviors were associated with less anxiety and depression among the students. The students currently in rural areas, of non-medical majors, and reporting half of their information concerning the epidemic being negative were more likely to have anxiety; female gender, residence in suburbs, a drinking history, and excessive negative information concerning the epidemic were all associated with the likeliness of depression. CONCLUSIONS: The college students have different levels of anxiety and depression during the epidemic. Depression and anxiety are closely related, but the factors contributing to different levels of such emotions can be different, and colleges and related departments are urged to provide precision mental health education for college students.","output":"[Mental health status and its influencing factors among college students during the epidemic of COVID-19]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite a large volume of research in prevention, central line-associated bloodstream infections and catheter-related bloodstream infections continue to cause significant morbidity, mortality, and increased health care costs.

Understanding of this disease is limited, and literature regarding prevalence in North America is scarce. Herein, we summarize our experience. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of T cell-EBV-HLH patients admitted to Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta (GA, USA) from 2010 to 2020 was conducted. Additional immune studies were completed in a subset of patients. RESULTS: We report 15 patients (10 monthsC19 years of age) diagnosed with T cell-EBV-HLH. Nine patients were Hispanic, and the majority did not have primary HLH (p-HLH) gene defects. Soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels in T cell-EBV-HLH were significantly higher than other forms of secondary-HLH but comparable to p-HLH, and it correlated with disease severity at presentation. Natural killer cell function was decreased in most patients despite a negative workup for p-HLH. Depending on disease severity, initial therapy included dexamethasone or dexamethasone and etoposide. Refractory patients were managed with blended regimens that included one or more of the following therapies: combination chemotherapy, alemtuzumab, emapalumab, and nivolumab. Rituximab did not appreciably decrease EBV viremia in most patients. Non-critically ill patients responded well to immunosuppressive therapy and are long-term survivors without undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

The urgent demand for effective quality filtering devices has been underlined during the COVID-19 pandemic, when large quantities of information about COVID-19 and its treatments was of questionable or poor quality [3]. The main objective of this Ph.D. thesis is to study how end-users judge correctness and credibility and provide them with a series of tools to assist them in assessing health-related information content. To that end, I will study a series of open research questions related to extracting and analysing the correctness and credibility of health-related online content. Previous research has focused on assessing the reliability of health-related content on the web. For instance, Matthews et al. [5] analysed a corpus about alternative cancer treatments and found that almost 90% contained false claims. Other teams focused on how to present medical information on a search engine result page to improve credibility judgments [6], and Sondhi and his colleagues presented a seminal automatic approach for reliability prediction at a document-level [7]. Main Research Questions: What sources of evidence (content and non content-based) could be used to determine credibility and correctness of online contents? How could we combine them? In this area of research, it is common the lack of enough training data. In this respect, what methods could be used to enrich the training data? Which semi-supervised learning methods could be applied to this task? How can we effectively employ different sources of evidence in order to extract additional data that enhance the reliability prediction capabilities? How all this knowledge can be exploited to help end-users better determine correct and credible information? What presentation cues do a better job at directing the users towards the most reliable contents? I anticipate that multiple ingredients (e.g., search models, text classifiers at document, passage or sentence-level, subjectivity estimators, etc.) will be needed to support the estimation of reliability of health-related contents. As a result, I will also need to study how to combine multiple signals (e.g. multiple rankers or the output of several classifiers) in order to produce a final output (which could be in the form of a ranking of contents by decreasing estimated reliability). To this end, I will start from simple solutions, like voting methods [1] or mean aggregation, but I will also research on how to employ state-of-the-art learning-to-rank techniques [4] (pointwise, pairwise, and listwise techniques) to support this type of combination of evidence. Finally, I will also study in depth how health-related reliability judgments are influenced by certain aspects of information presentation or certain user characteristics.","output":"Estimating the Reliability of Health-related Search Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"College students in Kenya have experienced many mental health issues, and there is little well-grounded research on this topic. Therefore, in this current study, we aimed to explore college students biopsychosocial spiritual wellbeing and problems from an Ecological Systems Theory (EST) perspective. Due to lack of previous well-grounded mental health research and services, we collaborated with the college students from the beginning of the study and acted with them to shape the research. Based on all these, we called our theoretical framework for this current paper as exploring college students biopsychosocial spiritual wellbeing and problems from the EST perspective. We examined college students (N = 518) mental health experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic through six items to measure psychosomatic problems (sadness, anxiety, frustration, stress, loneliness, and withdrawal) and their coping mechanisms (talking to family/friends, physical exercise, social media, reading books, hobbies, spiritual activities, alcohol/drugs, COVID-19 information). Gender and age explained a trivial amount of variance, about 1%, in psychosomatic problems in model one. With the inclusion of the coping strategies and demographic factors (age and gender), the second model explained 24% of the variance in psychosomatic problems. In the second model, the highest effect size originated from talking to family/friends and use of social media. In addition, change in sleeping patterns, sadness, anxiety, and frustration were reported with one in three reporting poor or fair mental health.

The generation of efficacious vaccines and antiviral drugs remains a challenge due to the rapid appearance of new influenza virus types and antigenic variants. Consequently, novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of IAV infections are needed, given the limitations of the presently available antivirals. Here, we used enzymatically produced IAV-specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules and Giardia intestinalis Dicer for the generation of a swarm of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules. The siRNAs target multiple conserved genomic regions of the IAVs. In mammalian cells, the produced 25- to 27-nucleotide-long siRNA molecules are processed by endogenous Dicer into 21-nucleotide siRNAs and are thus designated Dicer-substrate siRNAs (DsiRNAs). We evaluated the efficacy of the above DsiRNA swarm at preventing IAV infections in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. The replication of different IAV strains, including avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 viruses, was significantly inhibited by pretransfection of the cells with the IAV-specific DsiRNA swarm. Up to 7 orders of magnitude inhibition of viral RNA expression was observed, which led to a dramatic inhibition of IAV protein synthesis and virus production. The IAV-specific DsiRNA swarm inhibited virus replication directly through the RNA interference pathway although a weak induction of innate interferon responses was detected. Our results provide direct evidence for the feasibility of the siRNA strategy and the potency of DsiRNA swarms in the prevention and treatment of influenza, including the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.IMPORTANCE In spite of the enormous amount of research, influenza virus is still one of the major challenges for medical virology due to its capacity to generate new variants, which potentially lead to severe epidemics and pandemics. We demonstrated here that a swarm of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules, including more than 100 different antiviral RNA molecules targeting the most conserved regions of the influenza A virus genome, could efficiently inhibit the replication of all tested avian and seasonal influenza A variants in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. The wide antiviral spectrum makes the virus-specific siRNA swarm a potentially efficient treatment modality against both avian and seasonal influenza viruses.","output":"Efficient Inhibition of Avian and Seasonal Influenza A Viruses by a Virus-Specific Dicer-Substrate Small Interfering RNA Swarm in Human Monocyte-Derived Macrophages and Dendritic Cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prolongation of the Ebola epidemic may have allowed some countries to prepare and respond to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.

The questionnaire evaluated burnout and depression as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and depression and anxiety symptoms (HADS) respectively.ResultsThe participants were aged between 24 and 64 years and 61.5% had more than one child. Mean score on the BMS10 was 4.11 out of 7 maximum score with 71.8% of participants fulfilling criteria for maternal burn-out. Among them, 30.1% had high level of burn out and 9.6% extreme burn out. The main factors associated with maternal burn out were age of children, financial difficulties and lack of leisure activities. Mothers age, perceived husband support, medical or psychiatric history havent been associated with maternal burn out. HADS questionnaire indicated that 38.5% of mothers had moderate to severe anxiety disorder and 35,9% had moderate to severe depressive disorder. A postive correlation was found between burnout and anxiety (r=0.634, p<0.001) and burn out and depression (r=0.515, p<0.001).ConclusionsThe prevalence of maternal burn out during lockdown was significantly high resulting in higher rate of depression than ususal.

Blocking the interaction between S protein and ACE2 receptor is a novel approach to prevent the viral entry into the host cell. The present study is aimed at the identification of small molecules which can disrupt the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and human ACE2 receptor by binding to the interface region. A chemical library consisting of 1,36,191 molecules were screened for drug-like compounds based on Lipinski's rule of five, Verber's rule and in silico toxicity parameters. The filtered drug-like molecules were next subjected to molecular docking in the interface region of RBD. The best three hits viz; ZINC64023823, ZINC33039472 and ZINC00991597 were further taken for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies and binding free energy evaluations using Molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) and Molecular mechanics-Generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA).

During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, as core European countries such as Italy, Spain, or the United Kingdom reported hundreds of confirmed cases and even deaths per day, all CEE countries managed to contain the disease with considerably lower rates of infection and deaths. Description This changed in late summer and fall of 2020, when many CEE countries overtook western Europe in the number of new COVID-19 cases, as well as deaths, per population, but for a few months the region could enjoy its unusual accomplishment. A number of hypotheses have been suggested to explain the surprising containment success in the spring, including the widespread prevalence of the bacille Calmette-Gurin tuberculosis vaccine, lower population density and exposure to tourism, lack of trust in the healthcare system and government in general, low testing numbers (which may have led to underreporting of cases), and an autocratic advantage leaders of imperfect democracies, such as in CEE, enjoy when imposing lockdowns and other restrictive policies. Results In the spring, CEE governments implemented strict measures to protect public health at a time when their countries had few COVID-19 cases and deaths at most in the single digits. Lessons The Russian approach to addressing COVID-19 reflects the messiness of classifying regime type. Some of the responses used were more authoritarian in their approach. A greater flow of information and more transparency in the data would allow a more complete assessment of Russia's response to COVID-19.

Evaluation of public perceptions, attitudes and the individuals experience towards mask-wearing is integral to ensuring reasonable compliance and allows authorities to address concerns held by the population. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of lay-people was conducted within a high volume tertiary level institution in Singapore, from 16 October to 16 November 2020. Surveys administered evaluated five questions: 1) duration of mask wear per day, 2) mask-type used, 3) perceived necessity, 4) discomfort level experienced and 5) causes for discomfort. RESULTS: Out of 402 respondents, 67.2% primarily wore disposable surgical masks. 72% felt mask-wearing was necessary to control COVID-19 transmission. 78.4% reported discomfort while wearing masks, with mean discomfort levels of 4.21 out of 10. Impairment to breathing and communication difficulties were the most common discomforts faced. Younger respondents complained of higher incidence of dermatological issues and sweating (p < 0.05). Respondents who wore masks for longer duration reported higher incidence of dermatological issues (p = 0.001) and sweating (p = 0.032). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Even with an available vaccine, adjunctive public health measures such as mask-wearing will likely continue in order to curb COVID-19 transmission. Experience from past pandemics is likely to propagate self-protective behavior within a community. Our study identified several common mask-wearing discomforts, allowing respective organizations valuable market feedback for research and development.

METHODS Seventy-three patients with ICAVD who received Willis covered stent implantation between November 2013 and September 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical data of endoleak management and postoperative surveillance were analyzed. RESULTS Seventy-three cases with ICAVD, including 57 aneurysms, 11 carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas (CCF), and 5 surgical injuries, were all successfully installed with covered stents. Total isolation of ICAVDs was achieved in 59 patients (80.8%), and endoleaks were observed in 14 patients (19.2%). Of the 14 patients with endoleaks, 12 had type I endoleaks and 2 had type II; 13 had aneurysms and one had CCF. 10 patients with type I endoleaks received balloon dilatation, and 7 of them underwent a second stent-graft implantation after then. One patient with type II endoleak received embolization of the branch artery, and another one received follow-up observation. Endoleaks resolved in 6 patients and were minimal in 5 patients after balloon dilatation or the second stent implantation. During the follow-up period, minor endoleaks spontaneously resolved in 4 patients and minimal endoleaks were still demonstrated in 4 patients without enlargement of residual lumen and rupture.

Molnupiravir (MK-4482), an orally administered nucleoside analog, has demonstrated efficacy against earlier SARS-CoV-2 lineages and was recently approved for SARS-CoV-2 infections in high-risk adults. Here we assessed the efficacy of MK-4482 against the earlier Alpha, Beta and Delta VOCs and Omicron in the Syrian hamster COVID-19 model. Omicron replication and associated lung disease in vehicle treated hamsters was reduced compared to the earlier VOCs. MK-4482 treatment inhibited virus replication in the lungs of Alpha, Beta and Delta VOC infected hamsters. Importantly, MK-4482 profoundly inhibited virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract of hamsters infected with the Omicron VOC.

METHODS Biomarkers were assessed (1) cross-sectionally (stable vs. AECOPD; 62 individuals) and (2) longitudinally with repeated measures (baseline vs. AECOPD vs. convalescence; 78 episodes in 37 individuals). Event severity was graded (I, ambulatory; II, hospitalized; III, respiratory failure) based on consensus guidelines. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Presumptively newly acquired pathogens were associated with onset of symptomatic AECOPD. In the cross-sectional study, both SAA and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated at AECOPD onset compared with stable disease (SAA median, 7.7 vs. 57.6 mg/L; P < 0.01; CRP median, 4.6 vs. 12.5 mg/L; P < 0.01).

The initial tiling strategy was developed with the reference genome Wuhan-01, and subsequent iterations have addressed areas of low amplification and sequence drop out. Recently, a new version (V4) was released, based on new variant genome sequences, in response to the realization that some V3 primers were located in regions with key mutations. Herein, we compare the performance of the ARTIC V3 and V4 primer sets with a matched set of 663 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples sequenced with an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument. We observe general improvements in sequencing depth and quality, and improved resolution of the SNP causing the D950N variation in the spike protein. Importantly, we also find nearly universal presence of spike protein substitution G142D in Delta-lineage samples. Due to the prior release and widespread use of the ARTIC V3 primers during the initial surge of the Delta variant, it is likely that the G142D amino acid substitution is substantially underrepresented among early Delta variant genomes deposited in public repositories. In addition to the improved performance of the ARTIC V4 primer set, this study also illustrates the importance of the primer scheme in downstream analyses. IMPORTANCE ARTIC Network primers are commonly used by laboratories worldwide to amplify and sequence SARS-CoV-2 present in clinical samples.

It is well-established that males are more likely to acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection and exhibit more severe outcomes. Similarly, exposure to air pollutants and pre-existing respiratory chronic conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive respiratory disease (COPD) confer an increased risk to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We investigated molecular patterns associated with risk factors in 398 candidate genes relevant to COVID-19 biology. To accomplish this, we downloaded DNA methylation and gene expression data sets from publicly available repositories (GEO and GTEx Portal) and utilized data from an empirical controlled human exposure study conducted by our team. RESULTS: First, we observed sex-biased DNA methylation patterns in autosomal immune genes, such as NLRP2, TLE1, GPX1, and ARRB2 (FDR < 0.05, magnitude of DNA methylation difference  > 0.05). Second, our analysis on the X-linked genes identified sex associated DNA methylation profiles in genes, such as ACE2, CA5B, and HS6ST2 (FDR < 0.05,  > 0.05). These associations were observed across multiple respiratory tissues (lung, nasal epithelia, airway epithelia, and bronchoalveolar lavage) and in whole blood. Some of these genes, such as NLRP2 and CA5B, also exhibited sex-biased gene expression patterns. In addition, we found differential DNA methylation patterns by COVID-19 status for genes, such as NLRP2 and ACE2 in an exploratory analysis of an empirical data set reporting on human COVID-9 infections. Third, we identified modest DNA methylation changes in CpGs associated with PRIM2 and TATDN1 (FDR < 0.1,  > 0.05) in response to particle-depleted diesel exhaust in bronchoalveolar lavage. Finally, we captured a DNA methylation signature associated with COPD diagnosis in a gene involved in nicotine dependence (COMT) (FDR < 0.1,  > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings on sex differences might be of clinical relevance given that they revealed molecular associations of sex-biased differences in COVID-19. Specifically, our results hinted at a potentially exaggerated immune response in males linked to autosomal genes, such as NLRP2. In contrast, our findings at X-linked loci such as ACE2 suggested a potentially distinct DNA methylation pattern in females that may interact with its mRNA expression and inactivation status. We also found tissue-specific DNA methylation differences in response to particulate exposure potentially capturing a nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) effecta contributor to COVID-19 susceptibility. While we identified a molecular signature associated with COPD, all COPD-affected individuals were smokers, which may either reflect an association with the disease, smoking, or may highlight a compounded effect of these two risk factors in COVID-19. Overall, our findings point towards a molecular basis of variation in susceptibility factors that may partly explain disparities in the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods A multi-institutional database was created and utilized to assess all patients with COVID-19 who were supported with ECMO. A Bayesian mixed-effects logistic regression model was estimated to assess the effect on survival of days between COVID-19 diagnosis and intubation, as well as age at ECMO cannulation. Results Median time on ECMO was 18 days (interquartile range=10-29). All 505 patients have separated from ECMO: 194 patients (38.4%) survived and 311 patients (61.6%) died. Survival with veno-venous ECMO was 184 of 466 patients (39.5%), while survival with veno-arterial ECMO was 8 of 30 patients (26.7%). Survivors had lower median age (44 versus 51 years, p<0.001) and shorter median time interval from diagnosis to intubation (7 days versus 11 days, p=0.001). Adjusting for several confounding factors, we estimated that an ECMO patient intubated on day 14 post COVID-19 diagnosis vs day 4 had a relative odds of survival of 0.65 (95% Credible Interval [CrI]:0.44-0.96, posterior probability of negative effect: 98.5%).

One way in which location-based media are refiguring previously taken-for-granted spatial traditions is via GPS-enabled online dating and hook-up apps. For sexual minorities, these apps can reconfigure any street, park, bar, or home into a queer space through a potential meeting between mutually attracted individuals, but what does this signify for already-existing queer spaces? This chapter examines how smartphone apps including Grindr, Tinder, and Blued synthesize online queer encounter with offline physical space to create a new hybrid terrain predicated on availability, connection, and encounter. It is also a terrain that can sidestep established gay neighborhoods entirely. I explore how this hybridization impacts on older, physically rooted gay neighborhoods and the role that these neighborhoods have traditionally played in brokering social and sexual connection for sexual minorities. Few would deny that location-based apps have come to play a valuable role in multiplying opportunities for sexual minorities. However, the stratospheric rise of these technologies also provokes questions about their impact on embodied encounter, queer community, and a sense of place.

The secondary objective was to investigate the status of systemic inflammatory parameters, such as neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and platelet-monocyte ratio (PMR). MATERIALS AND METHODS The records of patients with primary TCBC who underwent transurethral resection were retrospectively evaluated. The relationship of DRR and systemic inflammatory parameters with clinicopathological findings, recurrence, and progression status was evaluated separately. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the DRR according to the clinicopathological findings, recurrence, and progression. Significant differences were found between the NLR and the patient groups for tumor diameter, tumor stage, tumor grade, and progression. In univariate analysis, the LMR was found to be associated with progression, and also the PLR and LMR were found to be associated with recurrence. Decrease in LMR and increase in LMR score demonstrated by multiple analysis was shown as independent predictors of progression and recurrence development.

Surveillance studies often pose questions about malaria parasite ancestry (e.g. how antimalarial resistance has spread) and employ statistical methods that characterise parasite population structure. Many of the methods used to characterise structure are unsupervised machine learning algorithms which depend on a genetic distance matrix, notably principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC). PCoA and HAC are sensitive to both the definition of genetic distance and algorithmic specification. Importantly, neither algorithm infers malaria parasite ancestry. As such, PCoA and HAC can inform (e.g. via exploratory data visualisation and hypothesis generation), but not answer comprehensively, key questions about malaria parasite ancestry. We illustrate the sensitivity of PCoA and HAC using 393 Plasmodium falciparum whole genome sequences collected from Cambodia and neighbouring regions (where antimalarial resistance has emerged and spread recently) and we provide tentative guidance for the use and interpretation of PCoA and HAC in malaria parasite genetic epidemiology. This guidance includes a call for fully transparent and reproducible analysis pipelines that feature (i) a clearly outlined scientific question; (ii) a clear justification of analytical methods used to answer the scientific question along with discussion of any inferential limitations; (iii) publicly available genetic distance matrices when downstream analyses depend on them; and (iv) sensitivity analyses. To bridge the inferential disconnect between the output of non-inferential unsupervised learning algorithms and the scientific questions of interest, tailor-made statistical models are needed to infer malaria parasite ancestry.

However, the shift from directly observed administration of these therapies to home administration means that continuous monitoring is needed. The oral anti-cancer therapy market is rapidly growing, with an ever-increasing number of new medicines available for the patients presenting with cancer illnesses. This study aims to (i) evaluate both the cost of providing monitoring consultations of oral anti-cancer therapies, and (ii) to assess the experience of cancer therapy nurses responsible for the monitoring and their opinions of the quality of the service. METHODS This study provides a mixed methods evaluation of the monitoring of oral anti-cancer therapies. Nurses were asked to record the time taken for them to perform their monitoring duties, and staff related costs were calculated using publicly available salary data. Patient-related costs were calculated using the Human Capital method. Nurses were asked to discuss their experience of monitoring oral anti-cancer therapies in semi-structured interviews. These interviews were subsequently analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS 201 recordings and their associated costs were documented. The median consultation time was 33 min, costing 22.10 using Clinical Nurse Specialist salary figures and 26.51 using Advanced Nurse Practitioner salary figures. The associated patient cost was 14.06. Themes of the effect of Covid-19 on the service, expanding and complicated care package requirements, the need for dedicated oral clinics and the future of the service emerged from the interview data. CONCLUSION The monitoring service provided by nurses may be undervalued.

Findings indicated that DOL increased the risk of SRIM. Protective factors identified for DOL and SRIM were hospital practices, such as timely breastfeeding (BF) initiation, avoiding in-hospital commercial milk formula supplementation, and BF counselling/support. By contrast, maternal overweight/obesity, caesarean section, and poor maternal physical and mental health were risk factors for DOL and SRIM. SRIM was associated with primiparity, the mother's interpretation of the baby's fussiness or crying, and low maternal BF self-efficacy.

In Scotland, lockdown measures during the first wave of the pandemic commenced on 23rd March 2020 and only began to ease after 29th May 2020. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number and type of referrals made to the adult psychiatric liaison nursing service (PLNS) at University Hospital Hairmyres, NHS Lanarkshire. METHOD: We collated all of the archived referrals made by our local emergency department to the PLNS at University Hospital Hairmyres for adults (aged 18C65 years) during the period of the first COVID-19 national lockdown (April-July 2020) and the corresponding period one-year prior (April-July 2019) to analyse differences in referral numbers and demographics. Additionally, for referrals made during 2020, we conducted a qualitative review of electronic records to determine the reason for referral, contributory stressors to presentation, and in particular any effect from COVID-19. RESULT: A total of 549 referrals were made over the study period, with 320 in 2019 and 229 in 2020, a decrease of almost 30%. In 2019, referrals fell each month from April (n = 89) to July (n = 74), while this trend was reversed in 2020, rising from April (n = 45) to near-usual levels by July (n = 68). Compared to baseline, referrals in April 2020 were for a higher proportion of men (62.2%). On qualitative analysis, 26 records (11.3%) could not be found. Otherwise, the most common reasons for referral were suicidal ideation (43.3%) and/or deliberate self-harm (39.9%). Many patients presented with comorbid substance misuse (54.2%) and the majority were not known to community services (64.5%). COVID-19 was implicated in 48 referrals (23.6%), but only 2 of these arose as a direct result of infection. CONCLUSION: We have observed clear differences in the pattern of referrals made to the adult PLNS during the first COVID-19 national lockdown. COVID-19 was implicated in a minority of referrals, but most were related to secondary effects of lockdown restrictions rather than COVID-19 infection. Possible reasons for fewer referrals during this time could be non-presentation through fears of contracting COVID-19 or altruistic avoidance of putting pressure on the NHS. Further studies would be insightful; in particular, equivalent analysis of contacts with community services; and qualitative patient perspectives regarding reasons for non-presentation during this time.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on referrals to liaison psychiatry services at University Hospital Hairmyres, NHS Lanarkshire"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Italy and especially Lombardy region was the first European Country hit by the covid 19 pandemic, without a proper preparedness plan.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two different methods for projecting the future annual cancer incidence have been applied: (1) using the International Agency on Research on Cancer@World Health Organization's (WHO) Globocan model which uses country's demographic factors, and (2) averaging the crude incidence data of 3 SEE countries with available national cancer registries, using a linear regression model of combined incidence per 100,000, and applying it to the entire SEE region. Cancer epidemiology data were collected and studied by using the countries cancer datasheets from WHO. The top 10 cancers were presented for the SEE region. Studies of other countries were used to develop a primordial model for estimating the number of SEE patients who could be treated most successfully with HT upon SEEIIST commissioning in 2030. RESULTS: A model was developed to estimate the number of eligible patients for HT from SEE. It is estimated that 2900 to 3200 patients per year would be eligible for HT in the new SEEIIST facility in 2030. CONCLUSIONS: After commissioning, SEEIIST will initially treat approximately 400 patients per year, progressing toward 1000. Creation of SEEIIST dedicated patient selection criteria will be both necessary and highly challenging.","output":"Patients With Cancer in the Countries of South-East Europe (the Balkans) Region and Prospective of the Particle Therapy Center: South-East European International Institute for Sustainable Technologies (SEEIIST)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, like any other virus, continues to mutate as it spreads, according to an evolutionary process. Unlike any other virus, the number of currently available sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in public databases such as GISAID is already several million. This amount of data has the potential to uncover the evolutionary dynamics of a virus like never before. However, a million is already several orders of magnitude beyond what can be processed by the traditional methods designed to reconstruct a virus's evolutionary history, such as those that build a phylogenetic tree. Hence, new and scalable methods will need to be devised in order to make use of the ever increasing number of viral sequences being collected. Since identifying variants is an important part of understanding the evolution of a virus, in this paper, we propose an approach based on clustering sequences to identify the current major SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using a $k$-mer based feature vector generation and efficient feature selection methods, our approach is effective in identifying variants, as well as being efficient and scalable to millions of sequences. Such a clustering method allows us to show the relative proportion of each variant over time, giving the rate of spread of each variant in different locations -- something which is important for vaccine development and distribution. We also compute the importance of each amino acid position of the spike protein in identifying a given variant in terms of information gain. Positions of high variant-specific importance tend to agree with those reported by the USA's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), further demonstrating our approach.","output":"Effective and scalable clustering of SARS-CoV-2 sequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When almost all underlying assets suddenly lose a certain part of their nominal value in a market crash, the diversification effect of portfolios in a normal market condition no longer works.

Past research suggests that boredom depends on specific cognitive appraisals, such as how people can control the task and how much they value it. Research further suggests that boredom is related to negative academic outcomes such as lower grades and a higher risk of dropping out. Here, we tested a mediation model on 324 pre-service teachers during the first lockdown of 2020 in Switzerland to assess (1) how control and value predicted boredom, and (2) how boredom was related to the intention to persist at university. We hypothesized that (1) the more participants felt lacking in control and low in value, the higher their boredom and (2) the more intense their boredom, the lower their intention to persist. We further hypothesized that both control and value would be positively related to the intention to persist, and this link may be mediated by boredom. Our results provide partial support for our mediation model as we found a significant indirect link between control and intention to persist through boredom. More specifically, the more participants lost control over their studies, the more they felt bored, which in turn was negatively related to their intention to persist.","output":"Bored to Be Wild: How Boredom Is Related to Pre-Service Teachers' Intention to Persist in Their Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Selecting a vaccine for fighting a pandemic is one of the serious issues in healthcare. Novel decision models for vaccine selection need to be developed. In this study, a novel vaccine selection decision-making model (VSDMM) was proposed and developed, based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique, which assesses many alternatives (vaccines) using multi-criteria to support decision making. To feed data to the VSDMM, six coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) vaccines were selected in a case study to highlight the applicability of the proposed model. Each vaccine was compared to the others with respect to six criteria and all criteria were compared to calculate the relative weights. The proposed criteria include (1) vaccine availability; (2) vaccine formula; (3) vaccine efficacy; (4) vaccine-related side effects; (5) cost savings, and (6) host-related factors. Using the selected criteria, experts responded to questions and currently available COVID-19 vaccines were ranked according to their weight in the model. A sensitivity analysis was introduced to assess the model robustness and the impacts of changing criteria weights on the results. The VSDMM is flexible in terms of its ability to accept more vaccine alternatives and/or more criteria. It could also be applied to other current or future pandemics/epidemics in the world.

Clopidogrel is commonly used as a short-term adjunct to aspirin after endovascular revascularization, whether clopidogrel modifies the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban has not been described. Methods: VOYAGER PAD was a phase 3, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in symptomatic PAD patients undergoing LER randomized to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus 100 mg aspirin daily or rivaroxaban placebo plus aspirin. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of acute limb ischemia, major amputation of a vascular cause, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke or cardiovascular death. The principal safety endpoint was TIMI major bleeding with ISTH major bleeding a secondary safety outcome. Clopidogrel use was allowed at the discretion of the investigator for up to six months following the qualifying revascularization. Results: 3313 (50.6%) of the randomized patients received clopidogrel, median duration of 29.0 days. Over 3-years the hazard ratio (HR) for the primary outcome of rivaroxaban versus placebo was 0.85 (95% CI 0.71-1.01) with clopidogrel and 0.86 (95% CI 0.73-1.01) without, without statistical heterogeneity (p-interaction =0.92). Rivaroxaban resulted in an early apparent reduction in acute limb ischemia (ALI) within 30 days, HR 0.45 (95%CI 0.14-1.46) with and HR 0.48 (95% CI 0.22-1.01) without clopidogrel (p-interaction = 0.93). Compared with aspirin, rivaroxaban increased TIMI major bleeding similarly regardless of clopidogrel use (p-interaction 0.71). With clopidogrel use >30 days, rivaroxaban was associated with more ISTH major bleeding within 365 days (HR 3.20, 95% CI 1.44-7.13) compared with shorter durations of clopidogrel (p-trend 0.06). Conclusions: In the VOYAGER PAD trial, rivaroxaban plus aspirin reduced the risk of adverse cardiovascular and limb events with an early benefit for ALI regardless of clopidogrel use. The safety of rivaroxaban was consistent regardless of clopidogrel use, but with a trend for more ISTH major bleeding with clopidogrel use > 30 days than a shorter duration. These data support the addition of rivaroxaban to aspirin after LER regardless of concomitant clopidogrel with a short (course &#8804; 30 days) associated with less bleeding.

In contrast, comparatively few studies exists on the role of online activists, defined informally as users who actively participate in socially-minded online campaigns. Automatically discovering activists who can potentially be approached by organisations that promote social campaigns is important, but not easy, as they are typically active only locally, and, unlike influencers, they are not central to large social media networks. We make the hypothesis that such interesting users can be found on Twitter within temporally and spatially localised contexts. We define these as small but topical fragments of the network, containing interactions about social events or campaigns with a significant online footprint. To explore this hypothesis, we have designed an iterative discovery pipeline consisting of two alternating phases of user discovery and context discovery. Multiple iterations of the pipeline result in a growing dataset of user profiles for activists, as well as growing set of online social contexts. This mode of exploration differs significantly from prior techniques that focus on influencers, and presents unique challenges because of the weak online signal available to detect activists. The paper describes the design and implementation of the pipeline as a customisable software framework, where user-defined operational definitions of online activism can be explored. We present an empirical evaluation on two extensive case studies, one concerning healthcare-related campaigns in the UK during 2018, the other related to online activism in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"A customisable pipeline for the semi-automated discovery of online activists and social campaigns on Twitter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since end of March, the health care system in Germany has been placed into a state of emergency in order to gain resources for the spreading coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the number of emergency room patients at the time of the pandemic in order to draw conclusions about the influence of the COVID 19 pandemic on the number of patients in an emergency department. Materials and methods: With this descriptive epidemiologic study we collected and analyzed anonymized patient-related data of 19,357 cases presenting to the emergency department of the Klinikum rechts der Isar (Munich) from 01 February 2019 to 30 April 2019 and from 01 February 2020 to 30 April 2020. Results: Despite an increase in the number of patients from 2019 to 2020, there was a significant drop in the number of emergencies from February to March 2020 and proceeding in April to a level below that of 2019. This was particularly observed in the field of trauma surgery, with a 40% decrease in the number of patients. With regard to the individual complaint patterns in March 2020, it was found that an increased incidence of malaise (+47%) and breathing problems (+36%) was recorded, whereas back pain (-41%), wounds (-29%), thoracic (-24%) and abdominal pain (-23%) were significantly less common than in the previous year. In terms of the severity of the complaints, the decline was mainly due to complaints with a low degree of urgency.

METHODS: We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews in patients with POMC (n = 3) and LEPR (n = 2) deficiencies participating in an ongoing open-label extension of phase 3 clinical trials with the melanocortin receptor 4 agonist setmelanotide to describe the patient experience of hyperphagia and characterize changes following treatment with setmelanotide. RESULTS: Prior to setmelanotide treatment, all five patients described abnormal sensations of hunger with none indicating feeling satiated after meals and also reported that the burden of hyperphagia impacted their families, emotions, and work and/or school functioning. Following setmelanotide treatment, all five patients reported consistent reductions in hunger and weight, decreased eating, and feeling satiated after meals in addition to substantial improvements in each area of functioning they had previously reported. All five patients indicated they were very satisfied with the impact of setmelanotide on their quality of life and would be upset if treatment was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with POMC or LEPR deficiency, hyperphagia and the inability to feel satiety negatively impacted quality of life. By reducing hunger and improving satiety, setmelanotide facilitated important changes in the lives of these patients. This qualitative research study suggests that the impact of setmelanotide goes beyond favorable clinical changes (e.g., weight and hunger) to also include quality of life improvements that are highly meaningful to patients.

The costs associated with adhering to pumping maternal breast milk are borne by mothers and contribute to this disparity. This randomized controlled trial tests the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an intervention to offset maternal costs associated with pumping. METHODS: This randomized control trial will enroll 284 mothers and their VP infants to test an intervention (NICU acquires MOM) developed to facilitate maternal adherence to breast pump use by offsetting maternal costs that serve as barriers to sustaining MOM feedings and the receipt of MOM at NICU discharge. Compared to current standard of care (mother provides MOM), the intervention bundle includes three components: a) free hospital-grade electric breast pump, b) pickup of MOM, and c) payment for opportunity costs. The primary outcome is infant receipt of MOM at the time of NICU discharge, and secondary outcomes include infant receipt of any MOM during the NICU hospitalization, duration of MOM feedings (days), and cumulative dose of MOM feedings (total mL/kg of MOM) received by the infant during the NICU hospitalization; maternal duration of MOM pumping (days) and volume of MOM pumped (mLs); and total cost of NICU care. Additionally, we will compare the cost of the NICU acquiring MOM versus NICU acquiring donor human milk if MOM is not available and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention (NICU acquires MOM) versus standard of care (mother provides MOM). DISCUSSION: This trial will determine the effectiveness of an economic intervention that transfers the costs of feeding VLBWand VP infants from mothers to the NICU to address the disparity in the receipt of MOM feedings at NICU discharge by Black infants.

The typical symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath, evolving to a clinical picture of pneumonia and, ultimately, death. Nausea and diarrhea are equally frequent, suggesting viral infection or transmission via the gastrointestinal-enteric system. SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells by using angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, which is cleaved by transmembrane proteases during host cells infection, thus reducing its activities. ACE2 is a relevant player in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), counterbalancing the deleterious effects of angiotensin II. Furthermore, intestinal ACE2 functions as a chaperone for the aminoacid transporter B(0)AT1. It has been suggested that B(0)AT1/ACE2 complex in the intestinal epithelium regulates gut microbiota (GM) composition and function, with important repercussions on local and systemic immune responses against pathogenic agents, namely virus. Notably, productive infection of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE2(+) mature human enterocytes and patients GM dysbiosis was recently demonstrated.

The strong correlation between a high body temperature and SARS-CoV-2 infection has motivated the governments of several countries to restrict access to public indoor places simply based on a persons body temperature. Negating/allowing entrance to a public place can have a strong impact on people. For example, a cancer patient could be refused access to a cancer centre because of an incorrect high temperature measurement. On the other hand, underestimating an individuals body temperature may allow infected patients to enter indoor public places where it is much easier for the virus to spread to other people. Accordingly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the reliability of body temperature measurements has become fundamental. In particular, a debated issue is the reliability of remote temperature measurements, especially when these are aimed at identifying in a quick and reliable way infected subjects. Working distance, bodyCdevice angle, and light conditions and many other metrological and subjective issues significantly affect the data acquired via common contactless infrared point thermometers, making the acquisition of reliable measurements at the entrance to public places a challenging task. The main objective of this work is to sensitize the community to the typical incorrect uses of infrared point thermometers, as well as the resulting drifts in measurements of body temperature. Using several commercial contactless infrared point thermometers, we performed four different experiments to simulate common scenarios in a triage emergency room. In the first experiment, we acquired several measurements for each thermometer without measuring the working distance or angle of inclination to show that, for some instruments, the values obtained can differ by 1 C. In the second and third experiments, we analysed the impacts of the working distance and angle of inclination of the thermometers, respectively, to prove that only a few cm/degrees can cause drifts higher than 1 C. Finally, in the fourth experiment, we showed that the light in the environment can also cause changes in temperature up to 0.5 C. Ultimately, in this study, we quantitatively demonstrated that the working distance, angle of inclination, and light conditions can strongly impact temperature measurements, which could invalidate the screening results.","output":"Reliability of Body Temperature Measurements Obtained with Contactless Infrared Point Thermometers Commonly Used during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic.

Monitoring HCWs, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, through screening programs, are critical to avoid the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the hospital environment to rapidly identify and isolate infected individuals and to allow their prompt return to work as soon as necessary. We aim to describe our healthcare surveillance experience (April 2CMay 6, 2020) based on a combined screening consisting of real-time PCR (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and rapid serologic tests (RST) for SARS-CoV-2 in all HCWs of Meyer Children's University Hospital in Florence. Among the analyzed workers, 13/1690 (0.8%), all of them without clinical manifestations, was found positive for SARS-CoV-2 by using RT-PCR on NP swab: 8/1472 (0.5%) were found positive during the screening, 1/188 (0.5%) during contact with a positive individual (p > 0.05 vs. screening group), while 4/30 (13.3%) were found positive on the day of re-admission at work after an influenza-like-illness (p < 0.05). Concerning working areas, the majority of RT-PCR positivity (12/13) and serologic positivity (34/42) was found in non-COVID-19 dedicated areas (p > 0.05 vs. COVID-19 dedicated areas). No cases were registered among non-patients-facing workers (p = 0.04 vs. patient-facing group). Nurses and residents represented, respectively, the working role with the highest and lowest percentage of RT-PCR positivity. In conclusion, accurate surveillance is essential to reduce virus spread among HCWs, patients, and the community and to limit the shortage of skilled professionals. The implementation of the surveillance system through an efficient screening program was offered to all professionals, regardless of the presence of clinical manifestations and the level of working exposure risk, maybe wise and relevant.","output":"Surveillance on Healthcare Workers During the First Wave of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in Italy: The Experience of a Tertiary Care Pediatric Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The alphaviruses Chikungunya (CHIKV), Mayaro (MAYV), Una (UNAV), and the flavivirus Zika (ZIKV) are emerging or re-emerging arboviruses which are responsible for frequent epidemic outbreaks. Despite the large impact of these arboviruses on health systems, there are no approved vaccines or treatments to fight these infections. As a consequence, there is an urgent need to discover new antiviral drugs. Natural products are a rich source of compounds with distinct biological activities, including antiviral properties. Thus, we aimed to explore the potential antiviral activity of Ginkgolic acid against the arboviruses CHIKV, MAYV, UNAV, and ZIKV. Viral progeny production in supernatants from cells treated or not treated with Ginkgolic acid was quantified by plaque-forming assay. Ginkgolic acids direct virucidal activity against these arboviruses was also determined. Additionally, viral protein expression was assessed using Western blot and immunofluorescence. Our results reveal that Ginkgolic acid promotes a dose-dependent decrease in viral titers in all tested viruses. Moreover, the compound demonstrated strong virucidal activity. Finally, we found that viral protein expression was affected by treatment with this drug. Collectively, these findings suggest that Ginkgolic acid could have broader antiviral activity.","output":"Broad Antiviral Activity of Ginkgolic Acid against Chikungunya, Mayaro, Una, and Zika Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is a new phenomenon and has affected the populations lifestyle in many ways, such as panic buying (the so-called hamster shopping), adoption of home-office, and decline in retail shopping For transportation planners and operators, it is interesting to analyze the spatial factors role in the demand patterns at a POI (Point of Interest) during the COVID-19 lockdown viz-a-viz before lockdown Data and MethodsThis study illustrates a use-case of the POI visitation rate or popularity data and other publicly available data to analyze demand patterns and spatial factors during a highly dynamic and disruptive event like COVID-19 We develop regression models to analyze the correlation of the spatial and non-spatial attributes with the POI popularity before and during COVID-19 lockdown in Munich by using lockdown (treatment) as a dummy variable, with main and interaction effects ResultsIn our case-study for Munich, we find consistent behavior of features like stop distance and day-of-the-week in explaining the popularity The parking area is found to be correlated only in the non-linear models Interactions of lockdown with POI type, stop-distance, and day-of-the-week are found to be strongly significant The results might not be transferable to other cities due to the presence of different city-specific factors ConclusionThe findings from our case-study provide evidence of the impact of the restrictions on POIs and show the significant correlation of POI-type and stop distance with POI popularity These results suggest local and temporal variability in the impact due to the restrictions, which can impact how cities adapt their transport services to the distinct demand and resulting mobility patterns during future disruptive events","output":"Explaining demand patterns during COVID-19 using opportunistic data: a case study of the city of Munich"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current article discusses an efficient way to assess the effect of COVID-19 on mental health in the general population.

However, there is a lack of a structured summary of guidelines and recommendations for applying these measures in practice. This protocol describes a systematic review of guidelines and recommendations for child and proxy completion of child-specific measures of HRQoL. The aims of the review are to (1) identify and summarise published guidelines and recommendations for existing child-specific measures of HRQoL, (2) determine whether the identified guidelines and recommendations differ by instrument and child characteristics, (3) identify current gaps in these guidelines and recommendations and (4) identify best practices for child self and proxy assessment in paediatric HRQoL measurement for economic evaluation and health technology assessment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The review will identify, collate and synthesise published guidelines and recommendations for existing child-specific utility measures of HRQoL.

The outbreak is a new type of coronavirus which is named as COVID-19 disease (2019 C nCoV, Novel Coronavirus). COVID 19 disease is a viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, namely the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 which emerged in Wuhan, China. Vaccines and antiviral drugs have not been found, meanwhile COVID-19 are prevented by using non-pharmacological interventions, one of the actions taken by several countries is to create policy protocols such as lockdowns. The results of this study indicate that lockdown is effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19, it can be seen from the significant decrease in R0 and Rt, <1 in several countries after lockdown such as UK 0.99 (0.96C1.02), Italy 0.89 (0.87C0.91), French 0.76 (0.72C0.82) and Spain 0.74 (0.71C0.78) which means that someone who is infected cannot infect other people and the disease will die (disappear). The value of Rt also shows a consistent decline Rt to <1 (0.88) after 2 weeks of lockdown in Italy. The conclusion from this literature show that lockdowns can reduce the spread of COVID-19 which is shown by the number of incidents before and after the lockdown which has decreased to zero cases in China.

In this paper, a dynamic programming model based on nonlinear integer programming (NIP) is established to study the problem of boarding and alighting planning at various CB stops under the influence of COVID-19. Using Gurobi 9.1.1 solver, the optimal plan for passengers boarding and deboarding CB buses could be obtained. Besides, the mathematical model established in this paper can obtain the minimum value of the total number of contacts between passengers during travel under different CB numbers.

Methods: Data on all laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia from January 2019 to 20 October 2020 were retrieved from the Health Electronic Surveillance Network of the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia. Data collected were: demographic characteristics of cases, clinical course of the infection, related mortality and association with exposure to confirmed cases or camels. Results: In total, 299 cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported in the study period. The mean age of cases was 52.4 years. Most of the cases were males (78.9%) and had comorbidities (72.7%), and 11.9% of cases were health care providers. Of the 299 cases, 83 (27.7%) died. Older age and having comorbidities were associated with higher mortality. Exposure to camels was associated with lower mortality. Health care providers also had a lower mortality rate than non-health care providers. Compared with COVID-19, MERS-CoV infection still has a higher mortality rate but with a more predictable pattern and an anticipated deterioration. Conclusion: MERS-CoV infection remains a public health concern. The percentage of cases that were health care providers (11.9%) is lower than previously reported (19.1-25.0%), possibly due to the various preventive measures put in place to control COVID-19.","output":"MERS-CoV in the COVID-19 era: update from Saudi Arabia, 2019-2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a tool used to integrate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics knowledge to optimize and personalize various drug therapies. The optimization of drug dosing may improve treatment outcomes, reduce toxicity, and reduce the risk of developing drug resistance. To adequately implement TDM, accurate and precise analytical procedures are required. In clinical practice, blood is the most commonly used matrix for TDM; however, less invasive samples, such as dried blood spots or non-invasive saliva samples, are increasingly being used. The choice of sample preparation method, type of column packing, mobile phase composition, and detection method is important to ensure accurate drug measurement and to avoid interference from matrix effects and drug metabolites. Most of the reported procedures used liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques due to its high selectivity and sensitivity. High-performance chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) methods are also used when a simpler and more cost-effective methodology is desired for clinical monitoring. The application of high-performance chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) with and without derivatization processes and high-performance chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED) techniques for the analysis of various drugs in biological samples for TDM have been described less often. Before chromatographic analysis, samples were pretreated by various procedures-most often by protein precipitation, liquid-liquid extraction, and solid-phase extraction, rarely by microextraction by packed sorbent, dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction.

Methods: We collected the daily number of 197 symptomatic cases, and that of the 146 passenger cases in two categories, i.e. those who stayed and did not stay in the same stateroom. We retrieved the quarantine details and the ship's 14-day itinerary. We searched the websites of national/local health authority along the cruise routes and local news using Google for locally confirmed cases associated with the ship. We obtained the design of air conditioning and sewage treatment of the ship from literature. We back-calculated the dates of infection from the epidemic curve and compared with the start of on-board quarantine. Results: Major infections started on Jan 28 and completed by Feb 6 for passengers except those who stayed in the same stateroom with infected individual(s). No other confirmed cases were identified among the disembarked people in Hong Kong except an 80 years old passenger. No confirmed cases were reported in three other stopovers between Jan 27-31 associated with disembarked passengers or visitors from the ship, however two Okinawa taxi drivers became confirmed cases in association with driving the ship passengers. Infection among passengers after Feb 6 was limited to those who stayed in the same stateroom with an infected passenger. Infections in crew members peaked on Feb 7, suggesting significant transmission among crew members after quarantine on Feb 5.

While studies regarding virtual fracture clinics have shown these to be useful and effective, they focus exclusively on remote consultations. However, our service was bespoke to the patient - either a face-to-face, a telephone consultation or both, depending on patient need - a 'hybrid virtual fracture clinic' (HVFC). We report patient satisfaction and outcomes with this service from the first wave of the pandemic. Methods We retrospectively interviewed patients who availed of the HVFC service at our institution during the first two weeks of national lockdown in England from March 23 to April 5, 2020. The number and type of consultations, patient vulnerability to COVID-19, and type of management (surgical vs non-surgical) were among the factors taken into consideration. Patient experience was assessed using the Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Effort Score (CES), and Customer Satisfaction Score (CSS) on a scale of 0-10. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the EuroQol-5D-5L score (including EQ Visual Analogue Scale {EQVAS} scoring on a scale of 0-1(X)).

MATERIALS AND METHODS The women undergoing vNOTES hysterectomies and salpingo-oophorectomies at a tertiary referral medical center between April 2016 and April 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. In all of the vNOTES procedures, a handmade glove port system comprised of a glove-wound retractor NOTES port was used. RESULTS Thirteen patients underwent gynecological procedures with benign indications via vNOTES. Of the 13 operations, 6 of the patients had salpingo-oophorectomies and 7 had hysterectomies, and all of the surgeries were performed by the same surgeon (Dr. Ahmet Kale). No conversion to a conventional laparoscopy or even a laparotomy was needed in any of the procedures. The mean operation time was 73.14 min in the hysterectomy patients and 40.8 min in the salpingo-oophorectomy patients. The mean drop in the hemoglobin (Hb) level was 1.4 g/dl in the hysterectomy patients and 1.6 g/dl in the salpingo-oophorectomy patients. For these patients undergoing vNOTES, the mean postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain score at 6 h was 4.38 and at 24 h it was 0.62. There were no intraoperative complications in any of the cases. The mean length of the hospital stay was 1.8 days in the hysterectomy patients and 1.5 days in the salpingo-oophorectomy patients. CONCLUSION The vNOTES procedure overcomes the surgical and technical difficulties of conventional vaginal surgery by incorporating the advantages of endoscopic surgery. Moreover, vNOTES uses inexpensive, reusable, handmade conventional laparoscopic instruments and avoids those problems related to abdominal wall incisions and trocar-related complications. Overall, this procedure results in high patient satisfaction, cosmetic advantages, and decreased postoperative pain.","output":"Hysterectomy and salphingoopherectomy by Transvaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery(NOTES): Turkish surgeons' initial experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little is known about the factors associated with lack of T-cell response to mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

These findings were consistent in the healthy normal lung, suggesting these transcriptional programs may be due to the normal lung biology and not necessarily a byproduct of carcinogenesis.ConclusionsThese results highlight the potential for dual characteristics of MAIT cells in neoadjuvant anti-PD-1-treated NSCLCs and provide an important foundation in our study of the often dichotomous responses between males and females to immunotherapy. Future analyses will focus on the interplay of MAIT cells with other cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a function of immunotherapy treatment and clinical response.ReferencesChen Z, Wang H, DSouza C, et al.

Here we propose a low-cost and privacy-preserving anti-cheating scheme by programmatically minimizing the cheating gain. A novel anti-cheating scheme we developed theoretically ensures that the cheating gain of all students can be controlled below a desired level aided by the prior knowledge of studentsabilities and a proper assignment of question sequences. Furthermore, a heuristic greedy algorithm we developed can refine an assignment of questions from a cyclic pool of question sequences to efficiently reduce the cheating gain. Compared to the integer linear programming and min-max matching methods in a small-scale simulation, our heuristic algorithm provides results close to the optimal solutions offered by the two standard discrete optimization methods. Hence, our anti-cheating approach could potentially be a cost-effective solution to the well-known cheating problem even without proctoring.","output":"Anti-cheating Online Exams by Minimizing the Cheating Gain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An understanding of how broadly neutralizing activity develops in HIV-1-infected individuals is needed to guide vaccine design and immunization strategies. Here we used a large panel of 44 HIV-1 envelope variants (subtypes A, B, and C) to evaluate the presence of broadly neutralizing antibodies in serum samples obtained 3 years after seroconversion from 40 women enrolled in the CAPRISA 002 acute infection cohort. Seven of 40 participants had serum antibodies that neutralized more than 40% of viruses tested and were considered to have neutralization breadth. Among the samples with breadth, CAP257 serum neutralized 82% (36/44 variants) of the panel, while CAP256 serum neutralized 77% (33/43 variants) of the panel. Analysis of longitudinal samples showed that breadth developed gradually starting from year 2, with the number of viruses neutralized as well as the antibody titer increasing over time. Interestingly, neutralization breadth peaked at 4 years postinfection, with no increase thereafter. The extent of cross-neutralizing activity correlated with CD4(+) T cell decline, viral load, and CD4(+) T cell count at 6 months postinfection but not at later time points, suggesting that early events set the stage for the development of breadth. However, in a multivariate analysis, CD4 decline was the major driver of this association, as viral load was not an independent predictor of breadth. Mapping of the epitopes targeted by cross-neutralizing antibodies revealed that in one individual these antibodies recognized the membrane-proximal external region (MPER), while in two other individuals, cross-neutralizing activity was adsorbed by monomeric gp120 and targeted epitopes that involved the N-linked glycan at position 332 in the C3 region. Serum antibodies from the other four participants targeted quaternary epitopes, at least 2 of which were PG9/16-like and depended on the N160 and/or L165 residue in the V2 region. These data indicate that fewer than 20% of HIV-1 subtype C-infected individuals develop antibodies with cross-neutralizing activity after 3 years of infection and that these antibodies target different regions of the HIV-1 envelope, including as yet uncharacterized epitopes.","output":"The neutralization breadth of HIV-1 develops incrementally over four years and is associated with CD4+ T cell decline and high viral load during acute infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, large numbers of people will receive one of the several medications proposed to treat COVID-19, including patients of reproductive age. Given that some medications have shown adverse effects on sperm quality, there might be a transgenerational concern. We aim at examining the association between drugs proposed to treat COVID-19 when taken by the father around conception and any pre-term birth or major birth defects in offspring in a nation-wide cohort study using Danish registry data. Offspring whose father filled at least one prescription of the following medications in the 3 months preceding conception were considered exposed: chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, losartan, azithromycin, naproxen, dexamethasone and prednisone. RESULTS: For azithromycin and naproxen, large numbers of offspring were exposed (> 1800 offspring), and we found no association with adverse birth outcomes. For chloroquine, losartan and dexamethasone, exposure was intermediate (~ 900 offspring), and there was no statistically significant association with birth defects. For hydroxychloroquine and prednisone, exposure was limited (< 300 offspring). Our evidence suggests that azithromycin and naproxen are safe with respect to pre-term birth and birth defects. For the other drugs investigated larger exposures are needed for conclusive statements.","output":"Risk of pre-term births and major birth defects resulting from paternal intake of COVID-19 medications prior to conception"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"consultation/29.md","filePath":"consultation/29.md"}'),R={name:"consultation/29.md"},E=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{z as __pageData,E as default};
