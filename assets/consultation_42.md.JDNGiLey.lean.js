The International Classification of Service Organizations in Rehabilitation (ICSO-R) 2.0 was published for this purpose. The ICSO-R was criticized for being tested mainly in high-income countries, and because the testing in lower-income countries did not include community-based rehabilitation services. Therefore, this study was performed to describe community-based rehabilitation services by using ICSO-R 2.0. METHODS: The ICSO-R 2.0 was used to describe 8 community-based rehabilitation services located in 3 cities in 3 different provinces in Indonesia: 6 community-based rehabilitation services in Bandung, West Java; 1 in Tanah Datar, West Sumatra; and 1 in Gowa, South Sulawesi. RESULTS: All the community-based rehabilitation services were owned by the government, as a public body, and in the context of the community. The 6 community-based rehabilitation services in Bandung, West Java, are under the government city of Bandung, while the other 2, from Tanah Datar and Gowa, are integrated within primary healthcare centres. Social welfare supports all 6 community-based rehabilitation services in Bandung. The other 2 community-based rehabilitation services are supported by their respective primary healthcare centres.

The main objective of this study is to propose a conceptual framework to provide a rapid and responsive surveillance system against pandemics. METHODS: A three\\\\step approach was employed in this research to develop a conceptual framework. These three steps comprise (1) literature review, (2) extracting and coding concepts, and determining main themes based on thematic analysis using ATLAS.ti? software, and (3) mapping concepts. Later, all of the results synthesized under expert consultation to design a conceptual framework based on the main themes and identified strategies related to medical informatics. RESULTS: In the literature review phase, 65 articles were identified as eligible studies for analysis. Through line by line coding in thematic analysis, more than 46 themes were extracted as potential foremost themes. Based on the key themes and strategies were employed by studies, the proposed framework designed in three main components. The most appropriate strategies that can be used in each section were identified based on the demands of each part and the available solutions. These solutions were employed in the final framework.

The multiplex-based analysis was calibrated against the Elecsys? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay on a Roche Cobas? instrument, using positive and negative samples. The calibration of the multiplex based assay yielded a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97.7%. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels were analyzed by multiplex in 251 samples from 221 patients. A significant increase in all antibody types (IgM, IgG, and IgA) against RBD was observed between the first and the third weeks of disease. Additionally, the S1 IgG antibody response increased significantly between weeks 1, 2, and 3 of disease. Class switching appeared to occur earlier for IgA than for IgG. Patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care had higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA levels than outpatients.

We investigated the role and underlying mechanism of sulfiredoxin-1 (Srxn1) in AP. Mild AP was induced by intraperitoneal injection of cerulein and severe AP was induced by partial duct ligation with cerulein stimulation or intraperitoneal injection of L-arginine in mice. Acinar cells, neutrophils, and macrophages were isolated. The pancreas was analyzed by histology, immunochemistry staining, and TUNEL assays, and the expression of certain proteins and RNAs, cytokine levels, trypsin activity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were determined. Srxn1 was inhibited by J14 or silenced by siRNA, and overexpression was introduced by a lentiviral vector. Transcriptomic analysis was used to explore the mechanism of Srxn1-mediated effects. We also evaluated the effect of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of Srxn1 by intraductal administration and the protection of AP. We found that Srxn1 expression was upregulated in mild AP but decreased in severe AP. Inhibition of Srxn1 increased ROS, histological score, the release of trypsin, and inflammatory responses in mice. Inhibition of Srxn1 expression promoted the production of ROS and induced apoptosis, while overexpression of Srxn1 led to the opposite results in acinar cells. Furthermore, inhibition of Srxn1 expression promoted the inflammatory response by accumulating and activating M1 phenotype macrophages and neutrophils in AP. Mechanistically, ROS-induced ER stress and activation of Cathepsin B, which converts trypsinogen to trypsin, were responsible for the Srxn1 inhibition-mediated effects on AP. Importantly, we demonstrated that AAV-mediated overexpression of Srxn1 attenuated AP in mice. Taken together, these results showed that Srxn1 is a protective target for AP by attenuating acinar injury and inflammation through the ROS/ER stress/Cathepsin B axis.","output":"Sulfiredoxin-1 attenuates injury and inflammation in acute pancreatitis through the ROS/ER stress/Cathepsin B axis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intra-abdominal thromboses are a poorly characterised thrombotic complication of COVID-19 and are illustrated in this case.

METHODS: We recruited 48 patients (26 males/22 females) admitted to our Rehabilitation Unit after discharge from acute Covid Hospitals in northern Italy with negative swab for SARS-Cov2. We used the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria to identify patients with different degrees of malnutrition. Patients underwent a 3 to 4-week individual multidisciplinary rehabilitation program consisting of nutritional intervention (energy intake 27to30 kcal/die/kg and protein intake 1C1.3 g/die/kg), exercise for total body conditioning and progressive aerobic exercise with cycle- and arm-ergometer (45 min, 5 days/week). At admission and discharge from our Rehabilitation Unit, body composition and phase angle (PhA) (BIA101 Akern), muscle strength (handgrip, HG) and physical performance (Timed-Up-and-Go, TUG) were assessed. RESULTS: At admission in all patients the mean weight loss, as compared to the habitual weight, was ?12.1 (7.6)%, mean BMI was 25.9 (7.9) kg/m(2), mean Appendicular Skeletal Muscle Index (ASMI) was 6.6 (1.7) kg/m(2) for males and 5.4 (1.4) kg/m(2) for females, mean phase angle was 2.9 (0.9), mean muscle strength (HG) was 21.1 (7.8) kg for males and 16.4 (5.9) kg for females, mean TUG value was 23.7 (19.2) s.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of 76 severe COVID-19 cases admitted to 2 hospitals in Wuhan, China, from December 2019 to March 2020. The thymus output in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID-19 patients was measured by T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). The levels of T-cell exhaustion markers programmed death-1 (PD-1) and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain protein 3 (Tim-3) on CD8+ T cells were detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Compared with the untreated group, T&#945;1 treatment significantly reduced the mortality of severe COVID-19 patients (11.11% vs 30.00%, P = .044). T&#945;1 enhanced blood T-cell numbers in COVID-19 patients with severe lymphocytopenia. Under such conditions, T&#945;1 also successfully restored CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell numbers in elderly patients.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to find out if using cadaver dissections is still the golden standard for surgical training or using the medical simulators in surgery could replace cadaver dissections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study is conducted during the European Orthopaedics & Traumatology Education Platform accredited Shoulder Club International Cadaver Course including a number of 34 orthopedics trainees. The participants were randomly divided into two groups to be trained with the simulator (Group 1) and on cadavers (Group 2), followed by a test performed on shoulder arthroscopy simulator (Virtamed ArthroS, Switzerland). There was no conflict of interest before, during, or after the study. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. RESULTS: Group 2 had statistically significant higher simulation overview procedure time values than Group 1 (p < 0.05), the meaning of which is participants trained with the simulator completed the given tasks in a shorter period of time. Group 2 had statistically significant higher scratching of humerus cartilage values than Group 1 (p < 0.05), which means that participants trained with simulation have less scratching done on the humerus cartilage than the participants trained on a cadaver. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one to compare virtual reality (VR) simulators with cadavers for surgical education in an objective manner, while using qualitative and quantitative data. According to this study, it is possible to state that VR simulators are just as effective as cadavers in means of training subjects.

METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched for articles published from 2007 to 2018. Articles written in English reporting outbreaks in LTCFs were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the risk-of-bias assessment tool for nonrandomized studies. FINDINGS: A total of 37 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. The most commonly reported single pathogen was influenza virus, followed by group A streptococcus (GAS). Of the studies that identified the cause, about half of them noted outbreaks transmitted via person-to-person. Suboptimal infection control practice including inadequate decontamination and poor hand hygiene was the most frequently raised issue propagating transmission.

In the USA approximately 55 million individuals are above that age range and more than 23 million are elderly obese individuals, alongside the high mortality rate in this population and lack of proven effective medicine against Covid-19, therapeutic alternatives against this disease are sought. With the occurrence of inflammatory pulmonary conditions increased by SARS-Cov-2 infection, irisin was indicated as having a potential preventive action. This peptide is secreted endogenously by striated skeletal muscles with fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) proteolysis, when preceded by continued exercise of low to moderate intensity for more than 20 uninterrupted minutes. Regarding the weight variant, previous studies showed low levels of FNDC5 in people with excess fatty acids (in humans, adipose tissue divides into white, favoring the deposit of lipids, triglycerides and fat, more easily inflamed, and brown that stimulates thermogenesis). Among other functions, FNDC5 also stimulates the coactivator 1-alpha of PPAR gamma (PGC-1) which corroborates with the uncoupling between the Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1) and the mitochondria. When UCP1 is disincorporated from this organelle, it becomes active and inhibits ATP synthesis, releasing heat, as well as favoring fatty acid oxidation and provides the mechanism of browning of white fat. After this conversion, irisin reduces ? of lipid accumulation present in the adipocyte by lipolysis, significantly increasing the levels of serum triglycerides and glycerols, as well as considerably reducing oxidative stress and DNA damage. Other genes expressed by irisin also assist in the fat browning process, such as TMEM26, ELOVL3, CIDEa and COX7a. Regarding the age variant, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein benefits from the high concentration of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, present in elderly pulmonary alveoli, which bind to the airway and enable contagion. However, ACE2 is negatively regulated by Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) protein from its connection to the nucleocapsid protein of the virus, generating some protection for the individual when TRIB3 is at satisfactory levels. In elderly men, this protein is below normal levels, making this population more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, it was verified that irisins weekly synthesis promoted by regular physical exercises triples TRIB3 levels in pulmonary alveoli. In short, this hormone was able to negatively modulate two important risk factors related to the inflammatory profile of this elderly population (weight and age), and thus irisin should be considered a potential molecule in the prevention against Covid-19.","output":"Favorable Prognostics of Post-Exercise Irisine Released as Prophylaxis of Serious Covid-19 in Obese Elderly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TOPIC: Education, Research, and Quality Improvement TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: Asthma is a common illness affecting 8% of the US population and costing $81.9 billion per year. Due to its chronic and variable nature, asthmatics need frequent medication adjustments, making management challenging for both physicians and patients. Patients can control their asthma with an asthma action plan (AAP), which has directions for daily assessment, medications, and steps to detect and treat exacerbations. Self-management using AAPs is associated with a reduction in hospital admissions and ED visits by 40% and 20%, respectively. Despite evidence that AAPs are efficacious, the exact reason for their success is not known. We hypothesized that AAPs increase patient confidence managing asthma and that this is a reason for AAPs success. Our study explored whether AAP use increases confidence in self-management and asthma control. METHODS: Patients with a physician diagnosis of asthma were recruited. An eight-question Likert Scale survey developed prior gauged confidence about asthma management. At the initial visit, each patient completed the survey, received a personalized AAP, and was taught to use a peak flow meter. The same survey was given at a follow-up scheduled at the providers discretion. Asthma control was assessed pre and post-AAP use with the Asthma Control Test (ACT), a validated measure of asthma control. An ACT score of  19 indicates good control. All data was collected using REDCap. Results were calculated using the student t-test. RESULTS: We recruited 71 patients, and 17 were excluded for lack of follow-up.

Confidence understanding medications was not impacted by AAPs, with 94% (51/54) of patients rating confidence at  3 pre and post-AAP use. Mean pre and post-AAP survey scores were 23.28 and 25.89, respectively. AAP use was associated with significantly higher mean survey scores (25.894.16, p =.0001). ACT data was available for 87% (47/54) of patients and 68% (32/47) scored a  19 on the follow-up ACT. Mean pre and post-AAP scores were 18.49 and 20.11, respectively. AAP use was associated with significantly higher mean ACT scores (20.113.35, p =.0043). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that shows AAP use increases patient confidence in asthma management. All but one survey question gauged at measuring increased confidence improved post-AAP use. Understanding of asthma medications likely did not see improved confidence due to a lack of discussion about this during AAP education at the initial visit. AAP use resulted in an improved mean ACT score. It is unclear if this is due to AAP use or changes made in medications. Limitations include the variable time interval for follow-up and the lack of ongoing assessment to account for the variable nature of asthma control. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: With an increasing reliance on telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of self-management has been brought to the forefront. AAPs are a simple and effective tool that help physicians hand control over care to their patients. The routine use of AAPs can revolutionize how providers approach asthma management and reduce asthma morbidity.

The ability to express and purify SARS-CoV proteins in large quantities is critical for basic research and for development of pharmaceutical agents. The work reported here demonstrates: (1) fusion of SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier), a 100 amino acid polypeptide, to the N-termini of SARS-CoV proteins dramatically enhances expression in Escherichia coli cells and (2) 6 His-tagged SUMO-fusions facilitate rapid purification of the viral proteins on a large scale. We have exploited the natural chaperoning properties of SUMO to develop an expression system suitable for proteins that cannot be expressed by traditional methodologies. A unique feature of the system is the SUMO tag, which enhances expression, facilitates purification, and can be efficiently cleaved by a SUMO-specific protease to generate native protein with a desired N-terminus. We have purified various SARS-CoV proteins under either native or denaturing conditions. These purified proteins have been used to generate highly specific polyclonal antibodies.

FACETS (Fatigue: Applying Cognitive Behavioral and Energy Effectiveness Techniques to Lifestyle) is an evidence-based, face-to-face, 6-session group fatigue management program for people with MS. Homework tasks are an integral part of FACETS and are currently undertaken in a paper-based form. Feedback from a consultation undertaken with FACETS attendees and health care professionals with experience in delivering the FACETS program suggested that being able to complete the homework tasks digitally would be desirable, potentially enhancing engagement and adherence and enabling on-the-go access to fit into busy lifestyles. Relative to other long-term conditions, there are few apps specifically for MS and, of those available, many have been developed with little or no input from people with MS. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this mixed methods study was to create a digital toolkit comprising the homework tasks (eg, activity diary, goal planner, thought diary) of the FACETS program for people with MS, considering end users unique requirements throughout the design, build, prototyping, and testing stages. METHODS: Phase 1 involved the elicitation of detailed user requirements for the toolkit via 2 focus groups with previous attendees of FACETS (n=3 and n=6) and wireframing. Phase 2 involved supervised usability testing with people with MS (n=11) with iterative prototyping. The usability sessions involved going through test scenarios using the FACETS toolkit on an Android test phone with video capture and concurrent think-aloud followed by completion of the System Usability Scale (SUS) and a semistructured interview collecting feedback about design, content, and functionality. RESULTS: The mean SUS score for the digital toolkit was 74.3 (SD 16.8, 95% CI 63.2-85.6; range 37.5-95), which equates to an adjective rating of good and a B grade (70th-79th percentile range) on the Sauro-Lewis curved grading scale. A number of usability and design issues (such as simplifying overall screen flow to better meet users needs) and suggestions for improvements (such as using location-based services and displaying personalized information and progress via a central dashboard) were addressed and implemented during the usability testing cycle. CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights the importance of the participation of people with MS across the entire development cycle, working to a human-centered design methodology to enable a considered and MS-centered solution to be developed. Continued horizon scanning for emergent technological enhancements will enable us to identify opportunities for further improvements to the FACETS toolkit prior to launch.

The IBV is a widespread avian coronavirus affecting both vaccinated and unvaccinated chicken flocks and is attributed to significant economic losses, around the globe. In the present study, 58 (n = 58) samples were collected from four different commercial poultry flocks from 8 KSA districts during 2019. A total of nine positive isolates (9/58; 15.5%), based on real-time reverse transcriptase PCR targeting nucleocapsid (N) gene, were used for further genetic characterization and evolutionary analysis. Genetic characterization of the partial spike (S1) gene revealed the clustering of the reported isolates into three different genotypes, whereas four additional isolates were grouped within 4/91 genotype, two isolates within IS/885 genotype, one isolate was closely related to IS/1494/06, and two isolates were grouped within classic serotype (vaccine-like strains). Phylodynamic revealed clustering of four isolated viruses within GI-13 lineage, three isolates within GI-23 lineage, and two isolates within GI-1 lineage. Results indicate that there are high evolutionary distances between the newly identified IBV strains in this study and the commercially used vaccines (GI-1), suggesting that IBV strains circulating in the KSA are under constant evolutionary pressures. Selective pressure biostatistics analyses consistently demonstrate the presence of a higher positive score which highlights the role of natural selection, a mechanism of virus evolution on sites located on the protein surface, within or nearby domains involved in viral attachment or related functions. Recombination analysis revealed emergence of two isolates through recombination events resulting in new recombinant viruses. Taken together, these finding demonstrate the genetic and evolutionary insights into the currently circulating IBV genotypes in KSA, which could help to better understand the origin, spread, and evolution of infectious bronchitis viruses, and to ascertain the importance of disease monitoring as well as re-evaluation for the currently used vaccines and vaccination programs.","output":"Evolutionary Analysis of Infectious Bronchitis Virus Reveals Marked Genetic Diversity and Recombination Events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, an at-home enzyme assay was developed for a biochemistry laboratory course at Arizona State University The experiment was designed to use items that could be easily obtained and safe to use The experiment focused on the analysis of salivary amylase using starch from food as a substrate, black tea as an inhibitor, and tincture of iodine to quantify the amount of starch present In this article, we describe the design of the experiment and an analysis of the student performance with specific mention of the common problems that the students experienced While this experiment was specifically designed as an at-home experiment, it could easily be adapted to use in a typical undergraduate biochemistry laboratory","output":"Analysis of Amylase in the Kitchen: An At-Home Biochemistry Experiment for the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to evaluate the rate of workplace violence in county hospitals in China and its impact on healthcare workers and to explore the relationship between hospital violence, coping styles and anxiety to provide effective procedures for reducing anxiety among healthcare workers. METHODS: The study used stratified sampling to select 1200 healthcare workers from 30 county hospitals in China to conduct a questionnaire survey. Of these, 1030 were valid questionnaires, and the effective response rate was 85.83%. We collected demographic characteristics of our participants and administered the following scales to them: Workplace Violence, Trait Coping Style, Self-rating Anxiety. Data were statistically analysed. RESULTS: The results showed that 67.28% of healthcare workers in county hospitals in China had experienced workplace violence in the previous 12 months, with prevalent verbal violence (66.12%) followed by physical violence (15.24%). Workplace violence in hospitals was negatively related to positive coping (r=?0.091, p<0.01) but positively related to negative coping (r=0.114, p<0.001) and anxiety (r=0.298, p<0.001). Positive and negative coping was negatively (r=?0.085, p<0.01) and positively (r=0.254, p<0.001) associated with anxiety respectively.

The incidence of metabolic syndrome is expected to increase in the near future because of the reduced opportunities for exercise caused by COVID-19. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common cause of chronic liver disease. Changes in diet and lifestyle have led to a dramatic increase in the prevalence of NAFLD in the world. NAFLD is characterized by excessive triglyceride (TG) accumulation in the hepatocytes due to both increased inflow of free fatty acids and de novo hepatic lipogenesis. Thus far, no study quantitatively assessed the liver fat deposition after a rapid decline in physical activity. Herein, we describe a case of a 17-year-old Japanese boy with severe fat infiltration of the liver, due to a rapid decline in physical activity, treated at our facility.

Often selected just to represent standard single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses in early studies, the Flavivirus genus over time has taught us how truly unique it is in its remarkable ability to target not just the RNA sensory pathways but also the cytosolic DNA sensing system for its successful replication inside the host cell. This review summarizes the main developments on the unexpected antagonistic strategies utilized by different flaviviruses, with RNA genomes, against the host cyclic GAMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) cytosolic DNA sensing pathway in mammalian systems. On the basis of the recent advancements on this topic, we hypothesize that the mechanisms of viral sensing and innate immunity are much more fluid than what we had anticipated, and both viral and host factors will continue to be found as important factors contributing to the host innate immune system in the future.","output":"Innate Immune DNA Sensing of Flaviviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] mRNA-based therapies and vaccines constitute a disruptive technology with the potential to revolutionize modern medicine. Chemically modified 5 cap structures have provided access to mRNAs with superior translational properties that could benefit the currently flourishing mRNA field. Prime examples of compounds that enhance mRNA properties are antireverse cap analog diastereomers that contain an O-to-S substitution within the -phosphate (-S-ARCA D1 and D2), where D1 is used in clinically investigated mRNA vaccines. The compounds were previously found to have high affinity for eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and augment translation in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular basis for the beneficial thio-effect remains unclear. Here, we employed multiple biophysical techniques and captured 11 cap analog-eIF4E crystallographic structures to investigate the consequences of the -O-to-S or -Se substitution on the interaction with eIF4E. We determined the S(P)/R(P) configurations of -S-ARCA and related compounds and obtained structural insights into the binding. Unexpectedly, in both stereoisomers, the -S/Se atom occupies the same binding cavity between Lys162 and Arg157, indicating that the key driving force for complex stabilization is the interaction of negatively charged S/Se with positively charged amino acids. This was observed for all structural variants of the cap and required significantly different conformations of the triphosphate for each diastereomer. This finding explains why both -S-ARCA diastereomers have higher affinity for eIF4E than unmodified caps. Binding affinities determined for di-, tri-, and oligonucleotide cap analogs suggested that the thio-effect was preserved in longer RNAs. Our observations broaden the understanding of thiophosphate biochemistry and enable the rational design of translationally active mRNAs and eIF4E-targeting drugs.","output":"Structural Insights into the Interaction of Clinically Relevant Phosphorothioate mRNA Cap Analogs with Translation Initiation Factor 4E Reveal Stabilization via Electrostatic Thio-Effect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious disease that has led to large hospital and community outbreaks, necessitating stringent infection control in its management.

It has been proposed that the neuroinvasive potential of the novel SARS-CoV-2 could be due to olfactory bulb invasion, conversely studies suggest it could be a good prognostic factor. The aim of the current study was to investigate the prognosis value of OGD in COVID-19. These symptoms were recorded on admission from a cohort study of 5868 patients with confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19 infection included in the multicenter international HOPE Registry (NCT04334291). There was statistical relation in multivariate analysis for OGD in gender, more frequent in female 12.41% vs 8.67% in male, related to age, more frequent under 65 years, presence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoke, renal insufficiency, lung, heart, cancer and neurological disease. We did not find statistical differences in pregnant (p = 0.505), patient suffering cognitive (p = 0.484), liver (p = 0.1) or immune disease (p = 0.32). There was inverse relation (protective) between OGD and prone positioning (0.005) and death (< 0.0001), but no with ICU (0.165) or mechanical ventilation (0.292).

From late fall 2019 until summer 2021, two series of events unfolded, one that everyone was talking about, and one that hardly anyone noticed. The most reported news story of that period related to the greatest world-health crisis in at least 100 years, the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, in a story that received next to no news attention, the Personal Data Protection Act Committee of the Uniform Law Commissioners in the United States was busy working on a new model law. By July 2021, each of these stories had reached a turning point. In the developed, Western world, most people who wanted to receive the vaccine against COVID-19 could do so, and nearly 60% of people in the United States had received at least one vaccine dose. Nevertheless, the COVID pandemic surged in late summer. Meanwhile, the Uniform Law Commission adopted the Uniform Personal Data Protection Act (UPDPA) at its annual meeting, paving the way for state legislatures to consider adopting the uniform act in 2022 legislative sessions. At roughly the same time, Virginia and Colorado state legislatures also adopted comprehensive data privacy acts.<br><br>These stories intersect in the public-health space. Public health researchers struggled with COVID-19 in the United States because they lacked information about individuals who were exposed and their contacts, among other matters. When the next pandemic arrives (and it is almost certain to do so), public health researchers will again have a critical need for access to personal data to monitor the progress of the disease and identify and implement population and individual interventions. In the meantime, understanding existing public health threats (e.g., obesity, opioid abuse, racism) requires leveraging and linking diverse data on the contributing social, environmental, and economic factors. The UPDPA does not clear the dense underbrush of barriers resulting from the patchwork of federal data privacy laws that interfere with public health practice and research. But it does provide an important route forward for public health, the full potential of which can be achieved only with active involvement of public health researchers and professionals. This article provides a conceptual framework for analyzing the regulation of uses of personal data and for public health and applies those frameworks to an analysis of UPDPA and other comprehensive state privacy statutes, focusing particularly on the ways that state adoption of UPDPA could promoteand hinderpublic health. It concludes with recommendations for public health researchers and professionals to get involved in upcoming legislative debates on data privacy.

Nevertheless, strategies for the modification of docking recognition and antifouling elements to obtain covalent-like stability without the disruption of the graphene band structure are still needed. In this work, we conducted surface engineering of graphene through heterofunctional supramolecular-covalent scaffolds based on vinylsulfonated-polyamines (PA-VS). In these scaffolds, one side binds graphene through multivalent - interactions with pyrene groups, and the other side presents vinylsulfonated pending groups that can be used for covalent binding. The construction of PA-VS scaffolds was demonstrated by spectroscopic ellipsometry, Raman spectroscopy, and contact angle measurements. The covalent binding of -SH, -NH2, or -OH groups was confirmed, and it evidenced great chemical versatility. After field-effect studies, we found that the PA-VS-based scaffolds do not disrupt the semiconducting properties of graphene. Moreover, the scaffolds were covalently modified with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), which improved the resistance to nonspecific proteins by almost 7-fold compared to the widely used PEG-monopyrene approach. The attachment of recognition elements to PA-VS was optimized for concanavalin A (ConA), a model lectin with a high affinity to glycans. Lastly, the platform was implemented for the rapid, sensitive, and regenerable recognition of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ferritin in lab-made samples. Those two are the target molecules of major importance for the rapid detection and monitoring of COVID-19-positive patients. For that purpose, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were bound to the scaffolds, resulting in a surface coverage of 436  30 ng/cm2.

Our results confirm that government social expenditure decreases once fiscal austerity measures are implemented, practically when they are spending-driven. Fiscal consolidation may hurt important social expenditure allocation mainly on education and health components. Furthermore, we find that fiscal consolidation improves the current account deficit, providing support for the twin deficits hypothesis. These findings indicate that fiscal consolidation will eventually contribute to medium- and long-term external debt stability through the current account improvement.

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Workflow, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus on stainless steel surfaces as part of the AOAC Performance Tested Method (SM) Emergency Response Validation program. METHODS: The Applied Biosystems? TaqMan? 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1, as part of the Thermo Scientific SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Workflow was evaluated for specificity using in silico analysis of 15,764 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and 65 exclusivity organisms. The Thermo Scientific SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Workflow was evaluated in an unpaired study for one environmental surface (stainless steel) and compared to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019-Novel Coronavirus RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, Instructions for Use (Revision 4, Effective 6/12/2020). RESULTS: In silico analysis showed that of the 15,756 target SARS-CoV-2 genomes analyzed, 99% of the strains/isolates are perfectly matched to at least two of the three assays, and more than 90% have 100% homology to all three assays (ORF1ab, N-gene, S-gene) in the SARS-CoV-2 Kit. None of the 65 non-target strain genomes analyzed showed matching sequences. In the matrix study, the Thermo Scientific SARS-CoV-2 workflow showed comparable detection to the CDC method. CONCLUSIONS: The Thermo Scientific SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Workflow is an effective procedure for detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 virus from stainless steel. HIGHLIGHTS: The workflow provides equivalent performance results with the two tested RNA extraction platforms and the two tested RT-PCR Instruments.","output":"Validation of the Thermo Scientific?

Reward crowdfunding is considered a suitable tool for meeting the financing needs of social ventures, whose backers are particularly interested in firm ideas and core values rather than in collaterals or business plans. A strategic factor that is able to influence the outcome of crowdfunding campaigns is the entrepreneurial narrative. Very few scholars have examined the key factors that support a crowdfunding campaign, particularly those on reward-based crowdfunding platforms, and the effects of entrepreneurial narratives on investors decisions. Aiming to fill this research gap, this paper investigates how entrepreneurs in the technology industry describe their social ventures and projects on Eppela, an Italian reward-based crowdfunding platform. Thematic analysis was applied to detect the five following key factors of effective entrepreneurial narratives in reward-based crowdfunding campaigns for social ventures: 1) problem/need; 2) project; 3) product; 4) team; and 5) venture. Each key factor includes specific subfactors. Lexical data analysis was then performed to identify the following expected effects of the examined entrepreneurial narratives on potential investors, leading these investors to understand, trust, and approve the project proposal, and thus, finance the social ventures project: 1) reassurance, 2) reliability, and 3) credibility. Based on these results, this study proposes an explanatory model about how to design effective entrepreneurial narratives to be presented to contribute as much as possible to the success of projects in crowdfunding platforms.","output":"Effective entrepreneurial narrative design in reward crowdfunding campaigns for social ventures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article takes up and make the case for the study of Covid-19 through the lens of feminist new materialism and asks how this approach might draw out perspectives and insights overlooked by other frameworks I begin with a brief introduction to Covid-19 followed by an analysis of the virus through the lens of feminist new materialism by drawing on the work of Karan Barad (2003), Rosi Braidoitti (2011), and Jane Bennett (2004) I contend that the interconnected frameworks articulated by each of these theorists provides the basis for a more robust understanding of the viral non-human (Covid 19) and everyday objects (the toilet roll and medical masks) whose agentic power is embedded in larger assemblages of natureculture This kind of analysis is urgent in light of our current media-saturated, interconnected, highly politicized, and expert-adverse environment","output":"Feminist Materialism and Covid-19: The Agential Activation of Everyday Objects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AI is increasingly used to aid decision-making about the allocation of scarce societal resources, for example housing for homeless people, organs for transplantation, and food donations.

In addition to the countries affected by the COVID-19, such as China, European and American countries, Iran has appeared as one of the most affected countries with high infected cases and deaths. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the role of self-talk in predicting death anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and coping strategies in the face of COVID-19. Method: This descriptive and correlational study was conducted on 354 adults living in Ardabil, Iran, who were selected using cluster sampling from 21 January to 19 March 2020. Self-Talk questionnaires, Coping Strategies, Death Anxiety, and Obsessive-Compulsive questionnaires were used for data collection. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression were used for data analysis. Results: The findings revealed a significant positive relationship between self-talk and problem-centered coping style. Also, significant negative relationships were found between self-talk and emotional coping style, death anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Furthermore, based on the results of the regression test, self-talk predicted problem-centered style, emotional-coping style, death anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Conclusion: The results of this study emphasize the need for psychological crisis intervention during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Despite these growing perils, there remains a notable paucity of data science research to scientifically inform equitable public policy decisions for improving the livelihood of at-risk populations.

The aim of this study was to provide a detailed epidemiologic account of a hospital-wide SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and provide a description of case evaluations, transmission networks and the interventions implemented to stem the outbreak. METHODS We conducted a retrospective descriptive study of a hospital-wide SARS-CoV-2 outbreak at the Misericordia Community Hospital (Edmonton) from June 21 to Aug. 14, 2020. We reviewed hospital chart, public health and occupational health records to determine demographics, case type (community- or hospital-acquired), need for critical care and outcome for each case linked to the outbreak (patients, hospital staff, and community and patient visitors). We developed detailed transmission networks using epidemiologic data to determine what variables may have contributed to transmission. RESULTS Fifty-eight cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were linked to this hospital outbreak (31 patients, 25 staff members and 2 visitors; 66% female, age range 19-97 years). One patient required critical care, and 11 deaths were recorded (all among inpatients). Most cases were hospital-acquired (91%), and 28% were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. The outbreak was composed of 2 clusters driven by protective equipment breaches, premature removal of precautions, transmission in small staff quarters and infection of a staff member after exposure to a wandering patient with dementia and asymptomatic, undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTERPRETATION A detailed epidemiologic review of this hospital-wide outbreak shows that a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak can involve complex transmission chains and clusters. Multipronged bundled approaches, aggressive contact tracing, and patient and staff prevalence screening are important to help bring such outbreaks under control, along with ongoing vigilance in detecting delayed cases.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a Canadian suburban tertiary hospital necessitating full facility closure: a descriptive observational study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the Research Letter titled Clinical Characteristics and Disease Severity Among Infants With SARSCoV-2 Infection in Montreal, Quebec, Canada,1 published December 14, 2020, an error occurred in the byline such that the third authors first name was misspelled His full name should have appeared as Olivier Drouin, MDCM, MSc, MPH  This article has been corrected","output":"Error in Byline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, Omicron (B.1.1.529), has been identified based on genomic sequencing and epidemiological data in South Africa.

In the beginning, the only services maintained were in-hospital and emergency services, while daily hospitals and ambulatory visits were disrupted. Psychiatric resources were not formally implemented in the treatment and management of COVID-19 and majority of mental health workers remained within the boundaries of psychiatric services. In the following period, some of the services reopened, with reorientation to online provision. However, the interference of services gradually occurred as the second wave started, with some psychiatric departments being repurposed for non-psychiatric use. Psychiatric care was organized in some of the COVID-19 departments as liaison service. Some of the psychiatric services offered consultation and prevention of burn-out for frontline personnel.

METHODS: A multi-center retrospective observational cohort study measured hospital admission and death to 180 days after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in 308 adult patients. RESULTS: The median age was 57 years, 64.9% were male. All patients had at least one comorbidity, and 26.3% had diabetes. Data on post-COVID-19 course was available for 267 patients, and 49 of them (15.9%) required hospital treatment after recovery from the acute infection.

These epigenetic modifications have been linked to perturbations to the epigenetic clock, development of long COVID-19 syndrome, and all-cause mortality risk.

Although sit-ups are simple to perform, the perceived high effort is the reason why training the abdominal muscles is seldom continued over a longer period of time. It is well known that the abdominal muscles are inferior to the back muscles in terms of force, but this cannot explain the extreme difference in perceived effort between trunk flexion and extension tasks. Therefore, this study was aimed at the identification of control strategy influences on the muscular stress level. Thirty-nine subjects were investigated. The performed tasks were restricted to the sagittal plane and were implemented with simulated and realized tilt angles. Subjects were investigated in an upright position with their lower bodies fixed and their upper bodies free. Posture-controlled tasks involved graded forward and backward tilting, while force-controlled tasks involved the application of force based on a virtual tilt angle. The Surface EMG (SEMG) was taken from five trunk muscles on both sides. Control strategies seemed to have no systematic influence on the SEMG amplitudes of the back muscles.

A nucleic acid real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) test of nasopharyngeal samples is the standard method for the diagnosis of an active SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, many limitations of the RQ-PCR tests make them unsuitable for the simple and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, some individuals with COVID-19 present an asymptomatic infection. Thus, assessing the asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19, especially in healthcare workers (HCWs), is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of the current preventive measures. Serological tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are needed to quickly identify a large number of asymptomatic carriers to prevent the further spread of the virus and assess level of possible serological immunity in a community. Method Between April 18 and June 17, 2020, 330 HCWs from five Madinah region-affiliated hospitals underwent a seroprevalence screening for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (immunoglobulin [Ig]M/IgA and IgG) using indirect ELISA testing. Result Among the 330 samples, 80 (24.24%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA and/or IgG antibodies. There were no significant differences observed in the seroprevalence among the different occupations of the HCWs (excluding the pharmacists) with respect to the percentage of their seropositive samples. Conclusion The current study presented the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA and IgG antibodies in HCWs. The regular screening of HCWs for these antibodies is necessary; subsequently, a molecular test is recommended for those with seropositive (IgM, IgA, and IgG) samples to assess their viral load and potential shedding.","output":"Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgM/IgA and IgG Antibodies Among Healthcare Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A maternal woman was positive for SARS-CoV-2 tested in throat swabs but negative tested in other body fluids, and she had IgG and IgA detected in breast milk.

This study aimed to describe the frequency of ED in male adults with T1D (MAWT1D) followed in a Brazilian tertiary hospital and verify which sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory factors were related to ED. In a cross-sectional study, 48 MAWT1D were evaluated. Inclusion criteria were T1D diagnosis for  5 years and age  18 years. We excluded MAWT1D in which other clinical conditions were present (e.g. COVID-19 infection, alcohol abuse). Patients' characteristics were evaluated through medical records and a standard questionnaire displayed by Google Forms. Severe hypoglycemia was defined when PWT1D required another person assistance. Sexual hormones were measured by electrochemiluminescence and free androgen index (FAI) was calculated by multiplying total testosterone (ng/ml) by 347, then dividing by the sex hormone binding globulin (nmol/L). The scale 5-Item Version of the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction (IIEF-5) assessed ED. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - HAD measured anxiety and depressive symptoms (Cut point  8 indicated clinically relevant symptoms).

Specific diagnosis therefore relies on laboratory investigation. This study developed and evaluated five groups of multiplex nested PCR assays that could simultaneously detect 21 different respiratory pathogens: influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1); influenza B virus; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, 4a, and 4b; respiratory syncytial virus A and B; human rhinoviruses; human enteroviruses; human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; human metapneumoviruses; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; Legionella pneumophila; and adenoviruses (A to F). These multiplex nested PCRs adopted fast PCR technology. The high speed of fast PCR (within 35 min) greatly improved the efficiency of these assays. The results show that these multiplex nested PCR assays are specific and more sensitive (100- to 1,000-fold) than conventional methods. Among the 303 clinical specimens tested, the multiplex nested PCR achieved an overall positive rate of 48.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 42.9 to 54.1%), which was significantly higher than that of virus isolation (20.1% [95% CI, 15.6 to 24.6%]) and that of direct detection by immunofluorescence assay (13.5% [95% CI, 9.7 to 17.4%]). The improved sensitivity was partly due to the higher sensitivity of multiplex nested PCR than that of conventional methods in detecting cultivatable viruses. Moreover, the ability of the multiplex nested PCR to detect noncultivatable viruses, particularly rhinoviruses, coronavirus OC43, and metapneumoviruses, contributed a major gain (15.6%) in the overall positive rate. In conclusion, rapid multiplex nested PCR assays can improve the diagnostic yield for respiratory infections to allow prompt interventive actions to be taken.","output":"Rapid multiplex nested PCR for detection of respiratory viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The consumption of ultra\\\\processed foods is one of the main drivers of the global obesity and non\\\\communicable disease (NCDs) epidemic(1).

Yet some studies have shown improvements in obesity-related metabolic comorbidities with more modest weight loss. By closely monitoring patients undergoing bariatric surgery, we aimed to determine the effects of weight loss on the metabolic syndrome and its components and determine the weight loss required for their resolution. METHODS We performed a prospective observational study of obese participants with metabolic syndrome (Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) who underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Participants were assessed for all criteria of the metabolic syndrome monthly for the first 9 months, then 3-monthly until 24 months. RESULTS There were 89 participants with adequate longitudinal data. Baseline body mass index was 42.46.2 kg m-2 with an average age was 48.210.7 years. There were 56 (63%) women. Resolution of the metabolic syndrome occurred in 60 of the 89 participants (67%) at 12 months and 60 of the 75 participants (80%) at 24 months. The mean weight loss when metabolic syndrome resolved was 10.97.7% total body weight loss (TBWL). The median weight loss at which prevalence of disease halved was 7.0% TBWL (17.5% excess weight loss (EWL)) for hypertriglyceridaemia; 11% TBWL (26.1-28% EWL) for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hyperglycaemia; 20% TBWL (59.5% EWL) for hypertension and 29% TBWL (73.3% EWL) for waist circumference. The odds ratio for resolution of the metabolic syndrome with 10-12.5% TBWL was 2.09 (P=0.025), with increasing probability of resolution with more substantial weight loss. CONCLUSIONS In obese participants with metabolic syndrome, a weight loss target of 10-12.5% TBWL (25-30% EWL) is a reasonable initial goal associated with significant odds of having metabolic benefits. If minimal improvements are seen with this initial target, additional weight loss substantially increases the probability of resolution.","output":"Weight loss after laparoscopic adjustable gastric band and resolution of the metabolic syndrome and its components."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the effect of 4 weeks of home-based balance training (HBBT) on the performance of individuals with functional ankle instability (FAI) in daily activities and sports.

Additionally, RSV is responsible for 10,000 deaths annually among the elderly across the United States, and accounts for nearly as many hospitalizations as influenza. Currently, several RSV vaccine candidates are under development to target different age groups. To evaluate the potential effectiveness of age-specific vaccination strategies in averting RSV incidence, we developed a transmission model that integrates data on daily infectious viral load and changes of behavior associated with RSV symptoms. Calibrating to RSV weekly incidence rates in Texas, California, Colorado, and Pennsylvania, we show that in all states considered, an infected child under 5 y of age is more than twice as likely as a person over 50 y of age to transmit the virus. Geographic variability in the effectiveness of a vaccination program across states arises from interplay between seasonality patterns, population demography, vaccination uptake, and vaccine mechanism of action. Regardless of these variabilities, our analysis showed that allocating vaccine to children under 5 y of age would be the most efficient strategy per dose to avert RSV in both children and adults. Furthermore, due to substantial indirect protection, the targeting of children is even predicted to reduce RSV in the elderly more than directly vaccinating the elderly themselves.

OBJECTIVE: To validate the CP-GEP model in an independent Dutch cohort of melanoma patients. METHODS: Patients (aged &#8805;18 years) with primary cutaneous melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) between 2007-2017 at the Erasmus Medical Centre Cancer Institute were eligible. The CP-GEP model combines clinicopathological features (age and Breslow thickness) with the expression of eight target genes involved in melanoma metastasis (ITGB3/PLAT/SERPINE2/GDF15/TGFBR1/ LOXL4/IL8/MLANA). Using the pathology result of SLNB as gold standard, performance measures of the CP-GEP model were calculated, resulting in CP-GEP high risk or low risk for nodal metastasis. RESULTS: In total, 210 patients were included in the study. Most patients presented with T2 (n=94,45%) or T3 (n=70,33%) melanoma. Of all patients, 27% (n=56) had a positive SLNB, with nodal metastasis in 0%, 30%, 54%, and 16% of T1, T2, T3, and T4 melanoma patients, respectively. Overall, the CP-GEP model had a negative predictive value (NPV) of 90.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]77.9-96.2), with an NPV of 100% (95%CI:72.2-100) in T1, 89.3% (95%CI:72.8-96.3) in T2, and 75.0% (95%CI:30.1-95.4) in T3 melanomas. The CP-GEP indicated high risk in all T4 melanomas.

Physical health monitoring of these patients can have positive effects on outcomes. Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust (BSMHFT) states that a physical health assessment (PHA) should be completed within 72 hours of admission. This comprises a physical health form (PHF) and minimum data set (MDS): BP, BMI, TB and BBV status, alcohol and drug screen, smoking status, Hba1c and lipids. In a 2017 audit, compliance was shown to need improvement, with 28.3% of admissions not having a PHF documented. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether PHAs for new admissions to the Oleaster, Birmingham during the first wave of COVID-19 were completed in line with trust policy To compare findings with a previous audit To make recommendations to improve inpatient physical health and compliance with trust policy METHOD: A retrospective audit was conducted, with PHA details accessed via the electronic medical records system RiO. Admissions from 16/03/2020-30/06/2020 were accessed and 158 admissions (155 patients) were included. 21 admissions were excluded as they were internal transfers; only data from the initial admission were included. Data were collected by 2 medical students and a psychiatry trainee using a data collection tool. Data were recorded and analysed on Excel. RESULT: Of 158 admissions, 81 had PHFs (51.3%). 59 were completed within 72 hours of admission (34.3%); 39 were completed fully (24.7%). Of incomplete PHFs, 2 explicitly stated incompletion due to COVID-19. 22 PHFs were created but not completed within 72 hours. 15 gave a deferral reason e.g., refusal to consent or agitation. For 77 admissions (47.3%), no assessment was documented, with no reason given. 2 admissions (1.3%) recorded the full MDS within 72 hours of admission. 2 admissions (1.3%) had fully complete PHAs (PHF and MDS) within 72 hours of admission, fulfilling trust policy. CONCLUSION: 51.3% of admissions had a PHF, with 34.3% documented within 72 hours of admission. However, only 1.3% of admissions fulfilled trust policy of both a completed PHF and MDS within 72 hours of admission. There were more admissions without a PHF than in the previous 2017 audit; 47.33% compared to 28.3% previously.

Evidence for change within the ORF1ab coding sequence during the SARS epidemic, as well as evidence from studies with other coronaviruses, indicates that it is likely that the ORF1ab proteins play roles in virus pathogenesis distinct from or in addition to functions directly involved in viral replication. Recent reverse genetic studies have confirmed that proteins of ORF1ab may be involved in cellular signaling and modification of cellular gene expression, as well as virulence by mechanisms yet to be determined. Thus, the evolution of the ORF1ab proteins may be determined as much by issues of host range and virulence as they are by specific requirements for intracellular replication.","output":"SARS coronavirus replicase proteins in pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data on diagnosis of infection in the general population are strategic for different applications in the public and private spheres.

Transfer learning (TL) is a phenomenon that enables deep learning algorithms to overcome the issue of shortage of training data in constructing an efficient model by transferring knowledge from a given source task to a target task. However, in most cases, ImageNet (natural images) pre-trained models that do not include medical images, are utilized for transfer learning to medical images. Considering the utilization of microscopic cancer cell line images that can be acquired in large amount, we argue that learning from both natural and medical datasets improves performance in ultrasound breast cancer image classification. The proposed multistage transfer learning (MSTL) algorithm was implemented using three pre-trained models: EfficientNetB2, InceptionV3, and ResNet50 with three optimizers: Adam, Adagrad, and stochastic gradient de-scent (SGD). Dataset sizes of 20,400 cancer cell images, 200 ultrasound images from Mendeley and 400 ultrasound images from the MT-Small-Dataset were used. ResNet50-Adagrad-based MSTL achieved a test accuracy of 99  0.612% on the Mendeley dataset and 98.7  1.1% on the MT-Small-Dataset, averaging over 5-fold cross validation. A p-value of 0.01191 was achieved when comparing MSTL against ImageNet based TL for the Mendeley dataset.

One less-commonly-reported presentation of COVID-19 infection is chilblain-like lesions. Aims We conducted an ecological analysis of chilblain presentations in comparison with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infections in a primary care setting to establish that a relationship exists between the two. Study Design Our study collated data from three Primary Health Networks across Victoria, Australia, from 2017-2021, to understand patterns of chilblain presentations prior to and throughout the pandemic. Using a zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis, we estimated the relationship between local minimum temperature, COVID-19 infections and the frequency of chilblain presentations. Results We found a 5.72 risk ratio of chilblain incidence in relation to COVID-19 infections and a 3.23 risk ratio associated with suspected COVID-19 infections. COVID-19 infections were also more strongly associated with chilblain presentations in 0-16-year-olds throughout the pandemic in Victoria. Conclusion Our study statistically demonstrates that chilblains are significantly associated with COVID-19 infections in a primary care setting. This has major implications for clinicians aiming to diagnose COVID-19 infections or determine the cause of a presentation of chilblains. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of large-scale primary care data and its potential application to monitoring the spread of COVID-19 infections across the state, supporting current epidemiological efforts for COVID-19 tracking.","output":"Snotwatch COVID-Toes: An ecological study of chilblains and COVID-19 diagnoses in Victoria, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To determine the mechanisms of injury associated with occupational injuries (OI) to genitourinary (GU) organs and compare GU OIs with GU non-OIs. METHODS: A single institution, retrospective study was conducted at a level 1 trauma center between 2010 and 2016 of all patients with GU injuries. OI was defined as any traumatic event that occurred in the workplace requiring hospital admission. Types of occupations were recorded in addition to the location of injury, mechanisms of injury, concomitant injuries, operative interventions, total cost, and mortality. GU OI patients were then compared to GU non-OI patients. RESULTS: 623 patients suffered a GU injury, of which 39 (6.3%) had a GU OI. Fall (43%) was the most common mechanism of injury; followed by motor vehicle collision/motorcycle crash (31%), crush injury (18%), and pedestrian struck (8%). The adrenal gland (38%) and kidney (38%) were the most commonly injured organs. There was no difference in mortality (13% GU OI vs. 15% GU non-OI, p = 0.70) or total direct cost ($21,192  28,543 GU OI vs. $28,215  32,332 GU non-OI, p = 0.45). Total costs were decreased with mortality from a GU injury (odds ratio (OR) 0.3, CI 0.26C0.59; p = < 0.001) and increased with higher injury severity scores (OR 1.1, CI 1.09C1.2; p = < 0.0001).

Approaches with high throughput and high sensitivity for assaying low-expression transcripts are urgently needed for functional genomic studies. Combination of the suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) and cDNA microarray techniques using the subtracted cDNA clones as probes printed on chips has greatly improved the efficiency for fishing out the differentially expressed clones and has been used before. However, it remains tedious and inefficient sequencing works for identifying genes including the great number of redundancy in the subtracted amplicons, and sacrifices the original advantages of high sensitivity of SSH in profiling low-expression transcriptomes. RESULTS: We modified the previous combination of SSH and microarray methods by directly using the subtracted amplicons as targets to hybridize the pre-made cDNA microarrays (named as \\"SSH/microarray\\"). mRNA prepared from three pairs of hepatoma and non-hepatoma liver tissues was subjected to the SSH/microarray assays, as well as directly to regular cDNA microarray assays for comparison. As compared to the original SSH and microarray combination assays, the modified SSH/microarray assays allowed for much easier inspection of the subtraction efficiency and identification of genes in the subtracted amplicons without tedious and inefficient sequencing work. On the other hand, 5015 of the 9376 genes originally filtered out by the regular cDNA microarray assays because of low expression became analyzable by the SSH/microarray assays. Moreover, the SSH/microarray assays detected about ten times more (701 vs. 69) HCC differentially expressed genes (at least a two-fold difference and P < 0.01), particularly for those with rare transcripts, than did the regular cDNA microarray assays. The differential expression was validated in 9 randomly selected genes in 18 pairs of hepatoma/non-hepatoma liver tissues using quantitative RT-PCR. The SSH/microarray approaches resulted in identifying many differentially expressed genes implicated in the regulation of cell cycle, cell death, signal transduction and cell morphogenesis, suggesting the involvement of multi-biological processes in hepato-carcinogenesis. CONCLUSION: The modified SSH/microarray approach is a simple but high-sensitive and high-efficient tool for differentially profiling the low-expression transcriptomes. It is most adequate for applying to functional genomic studies.","output":"Differentially profiling the low-expression transcriptomes of human hepatoma using a novel SSH/microarray approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effects of the promotion of active breaks and postural shifts on new onset of neck and low-back pain during a 6-month follow-up among high-risk office workers. METHODS: A 3-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial with 6-month follow-up was conducted among healthy but high-risk office workers. Participants were recruited from six organizations in Bangkok, Thailand (N=193) and randomly assigned at cluster level into active break intervention (N=47), postural shift intervention (N=46), and control (N=100) groups. Participants in the intervention groups received a custom-designed apparatus to facilitate designated active breaks and postural shifts during work. Participants in the control group received a placebo seat pad. The primary outcome measure was new onset of neck and low-back pain during 6-month follow-up. Analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: One-hundred and eighty-six (96%) predominantly female participants were successfully followed up over six months. New onset of neck pain during the 6-month follow-up occurred in 17%, 17%, and 44% of the participants in the active break, postural shift, and control groups, respectively. For new onset of low-back pain, these percentages were 9%, 7%, and 33%, respectively.

Rural areas of developing countries pose particular difficulties for developing and implementing effective responses owing to underdeveloped health infrastructure, uneven state capacity for infection control, and endemic poverty. This paper makes the case for the critical role of local governance in coordinating pandemic response by examining how state authorities are attempting to bridge the gap between the need for rapid, vigorous response to the pandemic and local realities in three Indian states -- Rajasthan, Odisha, and Kerala. Through a combination of interviews with mid and low-level bureaucrats and a review of policy documents, we show how the urgency of COVID-19 response has galvanized new kinds of cross-sectoral and multi-scalar interaction between administrative units involved in coordinating responses, as local governments have assumed central responsibility in the implementation of disease control and social security mechanisms. Evidence from Kerala in particular suggests that the state's long term investment in democratic local government and arrangements for incorporating women within grassroots state functions (through its Kudumbashree program) has built a high degree of public trust and cooperation with state actors, while local authorities embrace an ethic of care in the implementation of state responses. These observations, from the early months of the pandemic in South Asia, can serve as a foundation for future studies of how existing institutional arrangements and their histories pattern the long-term success of disease control and livelihood support as the pandemic proceeds.

The nucleocapsid (N) proteins of CoVs are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm where the viruses replicate, but in some cases the proteins are partially located in the nucleolus. Many studies have investigated the subcellular localization and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signals of the CoV N-proteins, but little is known about ToV N-proteins. Here, we studied the subcellular localization of the bovine ToV (BToV) N-protein (BToN) and characterized its nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signals. Unlike other CoVs, BToN in infected cells was transported mainly to the nucleolus during early infection but distributed predominantly in the nucleoplasm rather than in the nucleolus during late infection. Interestingly, a small quantity of BToN was detected in the cytoplasm during infection. Examination of a comprehensive set of substitution or deletion mutants of BToN fused with EGFP revealed that clusters of arginine (R) residues comprise nuclear/nucleolar localization signals (NLS/NoLS), and the C-terminal region served as a chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1)-independent nuclear export signal (NES). Moreover, recombinant viruses with mutations in the NLS/NoLS, but retaining nuclear accumulation, were successfully rescued and showed slightly reduced growth ability, while the virus that lost the NLS/NoLS-mediated nuclear accumulation of BToN was not rescued. These results indicate that BToN uniquely accumulates mainly in nuclear compartments during infection, regulated by an R-rich NLS/NoLS and a CRM1-independent NES, and that the BToN-accumulation in the nuclear compartment driven by NLS/NoLS is important for virus growth.IMPORTANCE ToVs are diarrhea-causing pathogens detected in many species, including humans. BToV has spread worldwide, leading to economic loss, and there is currently no treatment or vaccine available. Positive-stranded RNA viruses, including ToVs, replicate in the cytoplasm, and their structural proteins generally accumulate in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, BToN predominantly accumulated in the nucleus/nucleolus during all infectious processes, with only a small fraction accumulating in the cytoplasm despite being a major structural protein. Furthermore, we identified unique nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signals and demonstrated the importance of NLS/NoLS for virus growth. This study is the first to undertake an in-depth investigation of the subcellular localization and intracellular trafficking signals of BToN. Our findings additionally suggest that the NLS/NoLS-mediated nuclear accumulation of BToN is important for virus replication. Understanding its unique features, BToV may provide novel insights into the assembly mechanisms of not only ToVs but also other positive-stranded RNA viruses.","output":"Characterization of localization and export signals of bovine torovirus nucleocapsid protein responsible for extensive nuclear and nucleolar accumulation and their importance for virus growth."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leukemia is a leukocyte cancer that is characterized by anarchic growth of immature immune cells in the bone marrow, blood and spleen.

Due to the adverse effects associated with such therapies and drug resistance, the search for safer and more effective drugs remains one of the most challenging areas of research. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are important to improving outcomes. Almost half of the drugs utilized nowadays in treating cancer are from natural products and their derivatives. Medicinal plants have proven to be an effective natural source of anti-leukemic drugs. The cytotoxicity and the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of these plants to leukemic cells and their isolated compounds were investigated. Effort has been made throughout this comprehensive review to highlight the recent developments and milestones achieved in leukemia therapies using plant-derived compounds and the crude extracts from various medicinal plants. Furthermore, the mechanisms of action of these plants are discussed.","output":"Medicinal Plants with Anti-Leukemic Effects: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infestation was the most widespread STD (sexually transmitted diseases) among humans and was the leading cause of infectious recurrent genital herpes. Existing therapies against HSV-2 did incompletely restrain the comeback of activated HSV-2 infestation. Geranium wilfordii Maxim had long been used as traditional Chinese medicine for treating the diseases owing to its anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects. Herein, the study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of G.wilfordii and its potential effect in regulating the host's immune response. METHODS: To identify the stage of infection at which the compounds inhibited HSV-2, we performed virucidal, therapeutic, and prophylactic assays. The antiviral efficacy was evaluated by the analysis of viral components HSV-2 gD and VP16. The antiviral activities of these compounds were also evaluated by phenotypic analysis, such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. Molecular docking studies on candidate compounds were done to indicate binding interactions between the compounds and adopted compound targets. RESULTS: Quercetin, corilagin, and geraniin inhibited the replication of HSV-2, with geraniin showing greater TI. The obtained IC(50) value of quercetin was 204.7 M and TI (IC(50)/EC(50)) was 5.1, whereas the obtained IC(50) value of corilagin was 118.0 g/ml and TI was 4.05. Geraniin exhibited prominent antiviral activity with an IC(50) of 212.4 M and an EC(50) of 18.37 M, resulting in a therapeutic index (TI) of 11.56. Geraniin showed important in vitro virucidal activity through blocking viral attachment. Compared with the virus group, the apoptosis rates in quercetin-, corilagin-, and geraniin-treated groups were significantly decreased (p < 0.001).The expressions at the transcription genes of virus own replication key factors (including HSV-2 gD and VP16) and cytokines (including TBK1) of infected cells treated with quercetin, corilagin, and geraniin were inhibited. The in silico approaches demonstrated a high number of potential strong intermolecular interactions as hydrogen bonds between geraniin, corilagin, and the activity site of HSV-2 gD. Molecular docking studies demonstrated the effects of corilagin by targeting TBK1. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results highlighted the importance of G.wilfordii treatment in HSV-2 infection and underscored its therapeutic potential. However, additional in vitro and in vivo research was required to validate our findings.","output":"Antiviral Effect of Polyphenolic Substances in Geranium wilfordii Maxim against HSV-2 Infection Using in vitro and in silico Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced a re-design of care in radiation oncology.

Thus, an additional pathway was created with the aid of a trailer-mounted Computed Tomography (CT) scanner devoted to positive patients. We evaluated the performance of our approach from February 21 through April 12 in terms of workload (e.g., number of CT examinations) and safety (COVID-19-positive healthcare workers). There was an average of 72.2 and 17.8 COVID-19 patients per day in wards and the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), respectively. A total of 176 high-risk and positive patients were examined. High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) was one of the most common exams, and 24 pulmonary embolism scans were performed. No in-hospital transmission occurred in the DDI neither among patients nor among health personnel. The weekly number of in-patient CT examinations decreased by 27.4%, and the surgical procedures decreased by 29.5%.

Genetic variation generated through hybridization between distantly related lineages can promote AR. This mechanism, however, requires rare coincidence in space and time between a hybridization event and opening of ecological opportunity, because hybridization generates large genetic variation only locally and it will persist only for a short period. Hence, hybridization seems unlikely to explain recurrent AR in the same lineage. Contrary to these expectations, our evolutionary computer simulations demonstrate that admixture variation can geographically spread and persist for long periods if the hybrid population becomes separated into isolated sub-lineages. Subsequent secondary hybridization of some of these can reestablish genetic polymorphisms from the ancestral hybridization in places far from the birthplace of the hybrid clade and long after the ancestral hybridization event. Consequently, simulations revealed conditions where exceptional genetic variation, once generated through a rare hybridization event, can facilitate multiple ARs exploiting ecological opportunities available at distant points in time and space.","output":"The propagation of admixture-derived adaptive radiation potential."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exosomes are lipid bilayer vesicles released by multiple cell types.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study of data collected by the COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System (CHESS). Data were analysed using multivariate regression analysis. SETTING: Acute hospital trusts in England that submit data to CHESS routinely. PARTICIPANTS: Of 14 150 patients included in CHESS until 13 May 2020, 401 lacked a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and 7666 lacked a recorded date of symptom onset. This left 6083 individuals, of whom 15 were excluded because the time between symptom onset and hospital admission exceeded 3 months. The study cohort therefore comprised 6068 unique individuals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause mortality during the study period. RESULTS: Timing of hospital admission was an independent predictor of mortality following adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, ethnicity and obesity. Each additional day between symptom onset and hospital admission was associated with a 1% increase in mortality risk (HR 1.01; p<0.005). Healthcare workers were most likely to have an increased interval between symptom onset and hospital admission, as were people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, and patients with obesity. CONCLUSION: The timing of hospital admission is associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19. Healthcare workers and individuals from a BAME background are at greater risk of later admission, which may contribute to reports of poorer outcomes in these groups. Strategies to identify and admit patients with high-risk and those showing signs of deterioration in a timely way may reduce the consequent mortality from COVID-19, and should be explored.","output":"Retrospective cohort study of admission timing and mortality following COVID-19 infection in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pemerintah telah menetapkan bahwa pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) sebagai bencana non-alam.

METHODS The training workloads and heart rate variability (assessed through the log-transformed root mean square of successive R-R intervals) of 7 elite badminton players were registered daily during 4 weeks of normal training (baseline), 7 to 10 weeks of lockdown, and 6 to 8 weeks of retraining. Physical performance was assessed at baseline and after each phase by means of a countermovement jump and the estimated squat 1-repetition maximum. RESULTS A reduction in training workloads was observed in all participants during the lockdown (-63.7%), which was accompanied by a reduced heart rate variability in all but one participant (-2.0%). A significant reduction was also observed for countermovement jump (-6.5%) and 1-repetition maximum performance (-11.5%), which decreased in all but one participant after the lockdown. However, after the retraining phase, all measures returned to similar values to those found at baseline. At the individual level, there were divergent responses, as exemplified by one athlete who attenuated the reduction in training workloads and increased her performance during the lockdown and another one who markedly reduced his workload and performance, and got injured during the retraining phase.

Such information could be useful in decision-making in Kenya as well as in the greater sub-Saharan Africa region. METHODS: This narrative review is based on information obtained from official government documents released from 13th March 2020, the beginning of the pandemic in Kenya, up to 31st July 2020. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 response in Kenya has no formal mental health response plan. There is an unmet need for psychological first aid in the community. While guidelines for the management of mental health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been prepared, implementation remains a major challenge due to a poorly resourced mental health system. There is no mental health surveillance system in place limiting ability to design evidence-based interventions. CONCLUSION: We propose four key strategies for strengthening the mental health response in order to mitigate the harmful impact of COVID-19 on public mental health in Kenya: (1) preparation of a formal mental health response plan specific to the COVID-19 pandemic with allocation of funding for the response (2) training of community health workers and community health volunteers on psychological first aid to enable access to support for those in need during the pandemic (3) scaling up of mobile health to increase access to care (4) conducting systematic and continuous text message surveys on the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to inform decision-making.","output":"Mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ravages caused by the disease known as COVID-19 has led to a worldwide healthcare and social emergency requiring an effective combined effort from everyone to reduce contagion.

Electronic health records (EHRs) have been widely employed to conduct observational studies in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). However, there has been little research into how to make the most of SBDH information from EHRs. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in six databases to find relevant peer-reviewed publications that had recently been published. Relevance was determined by screening and evaluating the articles. Based on selected relevant studies, a methodological analysis of AI algorithms leveraging SBDH information in EHR data was provided. Results: Our synthesis was driven by an analysis of SBDH categories, the relationship between SBDH and healthcare-related statuses, and several NLP approaches for extracting SDOH from clinical literature. Discussion: The associations between SBDH and health outcomes are complicated and diverse; several pathways may be involved. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to support the extraction of SBDH and other clinical ideas simplifies the identification and extraction of essential concepts from clinical data, efficiently unlocks unstructured data, and aids in the resolution of unstructured data-related issues. Conclusion: Despite known associations between SBDH and disease, SBDH factors are rarely investigated as interventions to improve patient outcomes. Gaining knowledge about SBDH and how SBDH data can be collected from EHRs using NLP approaches and predictive models improves the chances of influencing health policy change for patient wellness, and ultimately promoting health and health equity.

The real world tolerability of the Q6W remains unknown. The COVID-19 pandemic led to rapid adoption of the Q6W tx, usually in patients (pts) previously receiving Q3W tx, as it facilitates less hospital visits. We report the toxicity profile of pts treated with Q6W pembro and the comparison of the preceding Q3W tx. Methods: We retrospectively analysed adverse events for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial cancer (UC) and melanoma pts, who received at least 1 cycle of Q6W pembro. Pts that received pembro in combination tx were excluded. Previous Q3W monotherapy was permitted. Toxicity was graded as per CTCAE v5.0. Results: We included 94 pts (melanoma=39, NSCLC=38, UC=17). Median number of Q6W cycles received was 3 (range 1-6). 71% received the Q3W regimen (median 7 cycles, range 1-32) prior to switching to Q6W. New toxicity of any severity was recorded in 52% (49/94) during Q6W versus 70% (47/67) during Q3W tx. G 3/4 toxicities occurred in 15% (15) during Q6W versus 0% during previous Q3W tx. Of the 27 who started de novo with Q6W, 4 (15%) developed G 3/4 toxicities. G 3/4 toxicities were: GI (4% [colitis = 2, gastritis =1, oral lichen planus = 1]), nephritis (3%), arthralgia (2%), skin (2%), myositis/CK rise (2%), anaemia (1%), myocarditis (1%). Steroids for management of toxicity were initiated in 22% (21) pts, including 8 with G2 toxicity. Three (3%) pts switched back to Q3W administration. None of them received Q6W again. In total 9% of pts in Q6W discontinued tx due to toxicity. Conclusions: In our cohort of pts, the majority were previously treated with the Q3W regimen without significant toxicity. Switch to Q6W or de novo Q6W pembro led to a 15% rate of G 3/4 toxicity and 9% discontinuation rate. In pts pre-treated with Q3W, we cannot distinguish whether this was due to cumulative toxicity or due to switch to Q6W. More studies are required to ascertain the safety of the Q6W schedule.

We present a new four-stage procedure involving the application of a two-component mesh and vacuum conditioning for abdominal wall closure of even large defects. The aim is to prevent the development of a giant ventral hernia and the eventual need for the repair of the abdominal wall. METHODS Nineteen of 62 patients treated by open abdomen over a two-year period could not receive primary abdominal wall closure. To achieve closure in these patients, we applied the following four-stage procedure: stage 1: abdominal damage control and conditioning of the abdominal wall; stage 2: attachment of a tailored two-component mesh of polyglycolic acid (PGA) and large pore polypropylene (PP) in intraperitoneal position (IPOM) plus placement of a vacuum bandage; stage 3: vacuum therapy for 3-4 weeks to allow granulation of the mesh and optimization of dermatotraction; stage 4: final skin suture. During stage 3, eligible patients were weaned from respirator and mobilized. RESULTS The abdominal wall gap in the 19 patients ranged in size from 240 cm(2) to more than 900 cm(2). An average of 3.44 vacuum dressing changes over 19 days were required to achieve 60-100 % granulation of the surface area, so final skin suture could be made. Already in stage 3, 14 patients (73.68 %) could be weaned from respirator an average of 6.78 days after placement of the two-component mesh; 6 patients (31.57 %) could be mobilized on the edge of the bed and/or to a bedside chair after an average of 13 days. No mesh-related hematomas, seromas, or intestinal fistulas were observed. CONCLUSION The four-stage procedure presented here is a viable option for achieving abdominal wall closure in patients treated with open abdomen, enabling us to avoid the development of planned giant ventral hernias. It has few complications and has the special advantage of allowing mobilization of the patients before final skin closure. Long-term course in a large number of patients must still confirm this result.","output":"Early repair of open abdomen with a tailored two-component mesh and conditioning vacuum packing: a safe alternative to the planned giant ventral hernia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research analyses ways of articulating aspects related to education, coexistence and democracy, based on the multiple pedagogical constraints generated by the health contingency of COVID-19.

Treatments included drip and spray irrigation, with three levels (0% (low), 50% (medium), 100% (high)) of irrigation and of fertilizer. A rain-fed crop (no irrigation or fertilizer) was included as the control. The results showed that (1) spray irrigation with medium water and high fertilization increased biomass. The optimum combination in sugarcane elongation stage was drip irrigation with medium water and high fertilization, while drip irrigation with high water and high fertilization was the best choice for maturity stage. (2) For sugarcane nitrogen (15N) content, spray irrigation with medium water and high fertilization was the best combination in seedling and tillering stages. The optimum combination in the elongation stage was drip irrigation with medium water and high fertilization, and in maturity stage was drip irrigation with high water and high fertilization. (3) For soil (15N content), drip irrigation with high water and high fertilization proved optimal for seedling, tillering, and maturity stages. (4) In seedling stage, sugarcane (15N content) was found to be strongly correlated with leaf area index, soil water, soil temperature, and soil electrical conductivity. Soil (15N content) was correlated with photosynthesis and soil temperature. In conclusion, drip irrigation appears most suitable for field planting, while the best treatment in seedling and tillering stages is medium water-high fertilization, and that the best in elongation stage is high water-medium fertilization.

In a plutonium inhalation scenario, the greater filtration efficiency for large particles exhibited by cloth masks can reduce early fecal excretion without a corresponding reduction in dose.

This severe acute respiratory syndrome is currently a global health emergency and needs much effort to generate an urgent practical treatment to reduce COVID-19 complications and mortality in humans. Viral infection activates various cellular responses in infected cells, including cellular stress responses such as unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, following the inhibition of mTOR. Both UPR and autophagy mechanisms are involved in cellular and tissue homeostasis, apoptosis, innate immunity modulation, and clearance of pathogens such as viral particles. However, during an evolutionary arms race, viruses gain the ability to subvert autophagy and UPR for their benefit. SARS-CoV-2 can enter host cells through binding to cell surface receptors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and neuropilin-1 (NRP1). ACE2 blockage increases autophagy through mTOR inhibition, leading to gastrointestinal complications during SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. NRP1 is also regulated by the mTOR pathway. An increased NRP1 can enhance the susceptibility of immune system dendritic cells (DCs) to SARS-CoV-2 and induce cytokine storm, which is related to high COVID-19 mortality. Therefore, signaling pathways such as mTOR, UPR, and autophagy may be potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19. Hence, extensive investigations are required to confirm these potentials. Since there is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19 infection, we sought to review and discuss the important roles of autophagy, UPR, and mTOR mechanisms in the regulation of cellular responses to coronavirus infection to help identify new antiviral modalities against SARS-CoV-2 virus.","output":"Autophagy, Unfolded Protein Response, and Neuropilin-1 Cross-Talk in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: What Can Be Learned from Other Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims As a developing country Bangladesh faces challenges in terms of resilience in its health system to manage COVID19 patients successfully Pharmacists and quack physicians (also known as village doctor) are the front-liners of mass population healthcare, functioning by nonstop drug dispensing, pharmaceutical counseling and care even in lockdowns The aim of the study was to introduce a competency framework and an ICT based management system for pharmacies to detect COVID19 suspected patients and accumulate key information in big databases linked to central cloud of architecture Methods Following guidelines provided by Bangladesh Pharmacy Council (BPC), we evaluated the pharmacy practices in current pandemic context in Bangladesh as well as reviewed extant literatures that explored pharmaceutical care A well-known method called Architecturally Significant Requirements (ARS) was used to design the COVID19 based health architecture that satisfies significant requirements for a system architecture development Results The framework illustrated how a pharmacist and quack physician can take part in early COVID19 detection First, the specific and standardized question items of the framework for distinguishing suspected and their contact tracing have been established Then a first ever reference COVID19 based architecture was developed to incorporated the suspects details into the database The proposed cloud based health architecture accumulates the personal details and relevant data obtained from the suspected patients Following screening through the framework, the obtained information is registered, stored and updated regularly into health database to strengthen the health systems Conclusions Pharmacist, quack physicians and suspected clients will be integrated together for an end to end self-adaptive pandemic management by resisting the spread of corona virus, and can be an active participant in the community to combat COVID19 pandemic in Bangladesh","output":"An approach to integrate patient, pharmacist and quack physician in managing covid19 pandemic in bangladesh: A cloud based health management systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) is the most conserved important pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) often stimulated by bacterial flagellins and plays a major role in the first-line defense against invading pathogenic bacteria and in immune homeostasis. Experimental crystallographic studies have shown that the extracellular domain (ECD) of TLR5 recognizes flagellin of bacteria and functions as a homodimer in model organism zebrafish. However, no structural information is available on TLR5 functionality in the major carp Cirrhinus mrigala (mrigala) and its interaction with bacterial flagellins. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to unravel the structural basis of TLR5-flagellin recognition in mrigala using structural homodimeric TLR5-flagellin complex of zebrafish as reference. Integrative structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to explore the structural and mechanistic details of TLR5 recognition. Results from structural snapshots of MD simulation revealed that TLR5 consistently formed close interactions with the three helices of the D1 domain in flagellin on its lateral side mediated by several conserved amino acids. Results from the intermolecular contact analysis perfectly substantiate with the findings of per residue-free energy decomposition analysis. The differential recognition mediated by flagellin to TLR5 in mrigala involves charged residues at the interface of binding as compared to the zebrafish complex. Overall our results shows TLR5 of mrigala involved in innate immunity specifically recognized a conserved site on flagellin which advocates the scientific community to explore host-specific differences in receptor activation.","output":"Insights into structure and dynamics of extracellular domain of Toll-like receptor 5 in Cirrhinus mrigala (mrigala): A molecular dynamics simulation approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The molecular mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike protein was characterized to identify novel therapies.

ACE2 frequency was markedly expanded in M&#934;s compared to T cells and RA FLS. Tofacitinib suppresses Spike protein potentiated STAT1 signaling, whereas this function was unchanged by TNFi. Tofacitinib impairs IL-6/IFN/LPS-induced STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation in RA M&#934;s and FLS. Interestingly, tofacitinib had a broader inhibitory effect on the monokines, glycolytic regulators, or oxidative metabolites compared to IL-6R Ab and TNFi in Spike-protein-activated M&#934;s. In contrast, all three therapies disrupted IFN-&#945; and IFN-? secretion in response to Spike protein; nonetheless, the IFN-?3 was only curtailed by tofacitinib or IL-6R Ab. While tofacitinib counteracted M&#934; metabolic rewiring instigated by Spike protein, it was inconsequential on the glycolysis expansion mediated via HK2 and/or LDHA in the activated RA M&#934; and FLS. Nevertheless, the potentiated inflammatory response and the diminished oxidative phosphorylation modulated by Spike protein and/or LPS/IFN-?3 stimulation in M&#934;s or RA FLS were reversed by tofacitinib.

It uses different strategies for positive and negative SNRs, with the switching between the two steered by a blind decision stage utilizing modulation cues. The output of the model is a single-channel signal with enhanced SNR, which we analyzed using the speech intelligibility index to compare speech intelligibility predictions. In a first experiment, the model was tested on experimental data obtained in a scenario with spatially separated target and masker signals. Predicted speech recognition thresholds were in good agreement with measured speech recognition thresholds with a root mean square error less than 1 dB. A second experiment investigated signals at positive SNRs, which was achieved using time compressed and low-pass filtered speech.

METHODS: We utilize the multi-phase Richards model to fit the weekly cumulative pH1N1 epidemiological data (numbers of confirmed cases and hospitalizations) as well as the daily number of classes suspended under a unique \\"325\\" partial school closing policy in Taiwan, in order to pinpoint the turning points of the summer and fall/winter waves, and to estimate the reproduction numbers R for each wave. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that the summer wave had slowed down by early September when schools reopened for fall. However, a second fall/winter wave began in late September, approximately 4 weeks after the school reopened, peaking at about 2-3 weeks after the start of the mass immunization campaign in November. R is estimated to be in the range of 1.04-1.27 for the first wave, and between 1.01-1.05 for the second wave.

METHODS Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to optimize a relative CBV threshold associated with PH in patients from the Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution 2 (DEFUSE 2) study. Regional reperfused-VLCBV was defined as regions with low relative CBV on baseline imaging that demonstrated normal perfusion (Tmax <6 s) on coregistered early follow-up magnetic resonance imaging. The association between VLCBV, regional reperfused-VLCBV and PH was assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS In 91 patients, the greatest area under the curve for predicting PH occurred at an relative CBV threshold of <0.42 (area under the curve, 0.77). At this threshold, VLCBV lesion volume 3.55 mL optimally predicted PH with 94% sensitivity and 63% specificity. Reperfused-VLCBV lesion volume was more specific (0.74) and equally sensitive (0.94). In total, 18 patients developed PH, of whom 17 presented with VLCBV (39% versus 2%; P=0.001), all of them had regional reperfusion (47% versus 0%; P=0.01), and 71% received intravenous alteplase. VLCBV lesion (odds ratio, 33) and bridging with intravenous alteplase (odds ratio, 3.8) were independently associated with PH. In a separate model, reperfused-VLCBV remained the single independent predictor of PH (odds ratio, 53).

Resultados: Eventos tromboemblicos associados a Covid-19 s?o descritos em casos graves da doen?a. Desta forma,  comum o aparecimento de complica??o hematolgica decorrente de distrbio de coagula??o, o qual predisp?e o desenvolvimento de um estado pr-trombtico. As principais altera??es hematolgicas relatadas nos artigos foram: aumento dos nveis de dmero-D em 86,4% dos artigos, aumento fibrinognio em 30,5% e interleucina-6 em 25,42%. Foi observado tambm aumento do tempo de protrombina e protena C-reativa em 23,72%, aumento de ferritina em 16,94%, linfopenia em 15,25%, aumento de fator VIII em 11,86% e fator de von Willebrand em 8,47% dos artigos selecionados. Discuss?o: De acordo com os estudos publicados at o momento, dentre as altera??es encontradas nos paciente com COVID-19, destacam-se as altera??es hematolgicas tais como aumento dos nveis de dmero-D, prolongamento do tempo de protrombina e aumento de fibrinognio. Outras anormalidades laboratoriais encontradas incluram eleva??o de marcadores pr-inflamatrios e substancias que permitem acompanhar a gravidade da doen?a. Entre eles encontram-se a interleucina-6 e protena C-reativa. Por desencadear uma sndrome do desconforto respiratrio agudo (SDRA), a infec??o por SARS-CoV-2 apresenta um quadro de hipoxemia associado, podendo assim agravar o estado de hipercoagulabilidade, isquemia e les?es pulmonares. Esse estado pode ser devido a tempestade de citocinas relatada em uma fase mais tardia da doen?a. Ainda n?o se sabe ao certo qual o exato mecanismo fisiopatolgico da coagulopatia associada a infec??o por SARS-CoV-2, mas acredita-se haver presen?a de les?o endotelial e hipoxemia nos capilares pulmonares, levando a um processo de isquemia e obstru??o.

Methylene blue, a potent antioxidant, can inhibit the generation of free radicals. This research aimed to study the protective effect of methylene blue against the cisplatin-induced toxicity of the reproductive system in rats. 35 male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control group, the cisplatin group (a single dose of 5 mg/kg cisplatin), the low-dose and high-dose methylene blue + cisplatin (2 and 4 mg/kg of methylene blue, respectively, for 7 days) and the methylene blue group (4 mg/kg of methylene blue, for 7 days). The treatments were applied through intraperitoneal injection. Cisplatin treatment reduced the sperm parameters and serum testosterone levels significantly. Methylene blue treatment increased the sperm count (p < .001), viability (p < .001) and motility (p < .001) compared to the cisplatin group. The methylene blue group showed a significant increase in the levels of testosterone compared to the cisplatin group (p < .001) and reverted histopathological changes in cisplatin-treated groups. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the caspase-3 protein revealed that the treatment with methylene blue has significant anti-apoptotic effects on testicular tissue damage. In conclusion, methylene blue can attenuate the cisplatin-induced histological damages and improve the sperm parameters.","output":"The ameliorative effects of methylene blue on testicular damage induced by cisplatin in rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Attenuated infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) vaccines are available but the relationship between sequence and virulence is not clear. In this study, the sequences of the 3' 7.3 kb of the genome, amplified using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction before and after attenuation, were compared to study the relationship between virulence and the sequences of three IBV strains. After attenuation, two to six amino acid substitutions were found in the spike 1 subunit, and two or three amino acid substitutions were found in the spike 2 subunit. None or one amino acid substitution was found in the small membrane protein, and one or three amino acid substitutions were found in the membrane protein. However, no amino acid substitution was found in the nucleocapsid (N) protein, indicating that the N protein might not be related to this attenuation. The 3' untranslated region after the N gene of one strain was partially deleted after attenuation, and might be correlated with virulence. This study is the first demonstration for IBV comparing sequence changes in the 3' 7.3 kb genome after attenuation.

In this report, we computationally examined the possibility of using a single-chain biparatopic bispecific antibody to target SEB and prevent TCR binding. The design was inspired by the observation that mixing two anti-SEB antibodies 14G8 and 6D3 can block SEB-TCR activation, and we used 14G8-6D3-SEB tertiary crystal structure as a template. Twelve simulation systems were constructed to systematically examine the effects of the designed bispecific scFV MB102a, including isolated SEB, MB102a with different linkers, MB102a-SEB complex, MB102a-SEB-TCR complex, MB102a-SEB-TCR-MHC II complex, and MB102a-SEB-MHC II. Our all atom molecular dynamics simulations (total 18,900 ns) confirmed that the designed single-chain bispecific antibody may allosterically prevent SEB-TCR chain binding and inhibit SEB-TCR-MHC II formation. Subsequent analysis indicated that the binding of scFV to SEB correlates with SEB-TCR binding site motion and weakens SEB-TCR interactions.","output":"Computational Construction of a Single-Chain Bi-Paratopic Antibody Allosterically Inhibiting TCR-Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B Binding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While graphs capture pairwise relations between entities, hypergraphs deal with higher-order ones, thereby ensuring losslessness. However, in hyperlink (i.e., higher-order link) prediction, where hyperlinks and non-hyperlinks are treated as positive and negative classes respectively, hypergraphs suffer from the problem of extreme class imbalance. Given this context, negative samplingunder-sampling the negative class of non-hyperlinksbecomes mandatory for performing hyperlink prediction. No prior work on hyperlink prediction deals with this problem. In this work, which is the first of its kind, we deal with this problem in the context of hyperlink prediction. More specifically, we leverage graph sampling techniques for sampling non-hyperlinks in hyperlink prediction. Our analysis clearly establishes the effect of random sampling, which is the norm in both link- as well as hyperlink-prediction. Further, we formalize the notion of hardness of non-hyperlinks via a measure of density, and analyze its distribution over various negative sampling techniques. We experiment with some real-world hypergraph datasets and provide both qualitative and quantitative results on the effects of negative sampling.

Colovaginal anastomosis is a surgical error which should not occur. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 39-year old woman underwent low anterior resection with double stapling technique, for rectal carcinoma in the City Hospital. On the fifth postoperative day she noticed passage of gas and two days later passage of feces from vagina. The surgeons who performed the operation explained to her that it is a normal condition for such modern procedure that is supervised by international educator engaged by the Government. The patient lived with this condition, passage of gas and feces from the vagina and nothing from anus for three months when her oncologist referred her for a second opinion at the University Clinic for Digestive Surgery. The digital examinations revealed a blind rectal stump, and feces in vagina; thus having the patient's history in mind, we assumed that the patient had a colovaginal anastomosis. Our assumption was confirmed by two succeeding radiological examinations. Initially, water soluble contrast enema was performed to assess the colon, when a clear-cut blind rectal stump was detected. Afterwards, the vaginography revealed a copious flow of contrast material from the vagina toward the sigmoid colon. After a few days, a restorative surgery was done.

We evaluated the vaccination efficacy of these surface-decorated polymersomes (RBD(surf)) in mice compared to RBD-encapsulated polymersomes (RBD(encap)) and unformulated RBD (RBD(free)), using monophosphoryl-lipid-A-encapsulated polymersomes (MPLA PS) as an adjuvant. While all three groups produced high titers of RBD-specific IgG, only RBD(surf) elicited a neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 comparable to that of human convalescent plasma. Moreover, RBD(surf) was the only group to significantly increase the proportion of RBD-specific germinal center B cells in the vaccination-site draining lymph nodes. Both RBD(surf) and RBD(encap) drove similarly robust CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses that produced multiple Th1-type cytokines.

In older individuals, stem cell number and/or function become depleted due to pathways independent of disease-related injury to these subpopulations. Accordingly, pathologic targeting of stem cells in conditions like aGVHD and COVID-19 infection where these cells are already deficient due to the aging process may have dire consequences in elderly individuals.

Currently, no literature exists that examines the difference in SARS-CoV-2 test positivity between student athletes and nonathletes at universities across the country. OBJECTIVE: To identify the difference in risk of COVID-19 infection between student athlete and nonathlete student populations and evaluate the hypothesis that student athletes may display increased SARS-CoV-2 test positivity associated with increased travel, competition, and testing compared with nonathletes at their respective universities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional analysis, a search of publicly available official university COVID-19 dashboards and press releases was performed for all 65 Power 5 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I institutions during the 2020 to 2021 academic year. Data were analyzed at the conclusion of the academic year. Schools that released at least 4 months of testing data, including the fall 2020 football season, for student athletes and nonathlete students were included in the analysis. Power 5 NCAA Division I student athletes and their nonathlete student counterparts were included in the analysis. EXPOSURE: Designation as a varsity student athlete. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 test positivity for student athletes and nonathlete students at the included institutions for the 2020 to 2021 academic year, measured as a relative risk for student athletes. RESULTS: Among 12 schools with sufficient data available included in the final analysis, 555 372 student athlete tests and 3 482 845 nonathlete student tests were performed. There were 9 schools with decreased test positivity in student athletes compared with nonathlete students (University of Arkansas: 0.01% vs 3.52%; University of Minnesota: 0.63% vs 5.96%; Penn State University: 0.74% vs 6.58%; Clemson University: 0.40% vs 1.88%; University of Louisville: 0.75% vs 3.05%; Purdue University: 0.79% vs 2.97%; University of Michigan: 0.40% vs 1.12%; University of Illinois: 0.17% vs 0.40%; University of Virginia: 0.64% vs 1.04%) (P < .001 for each). The median (range) test positivity in these 9 schools was 0.46% (0.01%-0.79%) for student athletes and 1.04% (0.40%-6.58%) for nonathlete students. In 1 school, test positivity was increased in the student athlete group (Stanford University: 0.20% vs 0.05%; P < .001). Overall, there were 2425 positive tests (0.44%) among student athletes and 30 567 positive tests (0.88%) among nonathlete students, for a relative risk of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.48-0.52; P < .001). There was no statistically significant difference in student athlete test positivity between included schools; however, test positivity among nonathlete students varied considerably between institutions, ranging from 133 of 271 862 tests (0.05%) at Stanford University to 2129 of 32 336 tests (6.58%) at Penn State University. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 transmission mitigation protocols implemented by the NCAA, participation in intercollegiate athletics was not associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. This finding suggests that collegiate athletics may be held without an associated increased risk of infection among student athletes.","output":"Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Test Positivity in NCAA Division I Student Athletes vs Nonathletes at 12 Institutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Blood-brain barrier impairment is a major indicator of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes. Studies showed that endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) transplantation promoted angiogenesis and improved function recovery after hind limb ischemia in diabetic mice. The effect of EPC transplantation on blood-brain barrier integrity after cerebral ischemia in diabetic animals is unknown. The aim of this study is to explore the effect of EPC transplantation on the integrity of the blood-brain barrier after cerebral ischemia in diabetic mice. METHODS EPCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and characterized by flow cytometry and immunostaining. Diabetes was induced in adult male C57BL/6 mice by a single injection of streptozotocin at 4 weeks before surgery. Diabetic mice underwent 90-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery and received 1  106 EPCs transplantation immediately after reperfusion. Brain infarct volume, blood-brain barrier permeability, tight junction protein expression, and hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) mRNA level were examined after treatment. RESULTS We demonstrated that neurological deficits were attenuated and brain infarct volume was reduced in EPC-transplanted diabetic mice after transient cerebral ischemia compared to the controls (p < 0.05). Blood-brain barrier leakage and tight junction protein degradation were reduced in EPC-transplanted mice (p <0.05). EPCs upregulated HIF-1 expression while HIF-1 inhibitor PX-478 abolished the beneficial effect of EPCs.

Some methods of supporting healthcare workers in changing their behaviour make use of social norms by exposing healthcare workers to the beliefs, values, attitudes or behaviours of a reference group or person. This review aimed to evaluate evidence on (i) the effect of social norms interventions on healthcare worker clinical behaviour change and (ii) the contexts, modes of delivery and behaviour change techniques (BCTs) associated with effectiveness. METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Searches were undertaken in seven databases. The primary outcome was compliance with a desired healthcare worker clinical behaviour and the secondary outcome was patient health outcomes. Outcomes were converted into standardised mean differences (SMDs). We performed meta-analyses and presented forest plots, stratified by five social norms BCTs (social comparison, credible source, social reward, social incentive and information about others' approval). Sources of variation in social norms BCTs, context and mode of delivery were explored using forest plots, meta-regression and network meta-analysis. RESULTS Combined data from 116 trials suggested that social norms interventions were associated with an improvement in healthcare worker clinical behaviour outcomes of 0.08 SMDs (95%CI 0.07 to 0.10) (n = 100 comparisons), and an improvement in patient health outcomes of 0.17 SMDs (95%CI 0.14 to 0.20) (n = 14), on average.

Credible source was more effective on average, compared to control conditions (SMD 0.30, 95%CI 0.13 to 0.47, n = 7). Social comparison also appeared effective, both on its own (SMD 0.05, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.08, n = 33) and with other BCTs, and seemed particularly effective when combined with prompts/cues (0.33, 95%CI 0.22 to 0.44, n = 5). CONCLUSIONS Social norms interventions appeared to be an effective method of changing the clinical behaviour of healthcare workers and have a positive effect on patient health outcomes in a variety of health service contexts. Although the overall result is modest and variable, there is the potential for social norms interventions to be applied at large scale.

A novel GIS methodology was developed to determine these characteristics from a large amount of data with high spatial detail and accurately assign them to individual bus stops. After processing the data, several multiple linear regression models were developed to determine the variables related to different activities and changes in mobility during lockdown that may explain the variation in demand owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. The characteristics related to population and land use were also studied. The proposed methodology can be used to improve transit planning during exceptional situations, by strengthening public transport in areas with a predictably higher transit demand, instead of uniformly decreasing the availability of public transport services, promoting sustainable mobility. The efficiency of the proposed methodology was shown by performing a case study that analysed the variation in bus demand in A Coru?a, Spain. The areas with the highest sustained demand were those with low inhabitant incomes, a high population density, and significant proportions of land use dedicated to hospitals, offices, or supermarkets.","output":"Analysis of the Relationship between the Characteristics of the Areas of Influence of Bus Stops and the Decrease in Ridership during COVID-19 Lockdowns"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the vast majority of the laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, computed tomography (CT) examinations yield a typical pattern and the sensitivity of this modality has been reported to be 97% in a large-scale study. Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care. PURPOSE: To compose a comprehensive lexicon for description of the imaging findings and propose a grading system and structured reporting format for CT findings in COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We updated our published systematic review on imaging findings in COVID-19 to include 37 published studies pertaining to diagnostic features of COVID-19 in chest CT. Using the reported imaging findings of 3647 patients, we summarized the typical chest CT findings, atypical features, and temporal changes of COVID-19 in chest CT. Subsequently, we extracted a list of descriptive terms and mapped it to the terminology that is commonly used in imaging literature. RESULTS: We composed a comprehensive lexicon that can be used for documentation and reporting of typical and atypical CT imaging findings in COVID-19 patients. Using the same data, we propose a grading system with five COVID-RADS categories. Each COVID-RADS grade corresponds to a low, moderate, or high level of suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.

Driving self-regulation can be regarded as an adjustment strategy for older adults to reduce risks and extend driving lives. Studies abroad mainly stress the three levels and influencing factors of driving self-regulation. China has a long history with a unique cultural background and social reality and relevant research are still in the initial stage. METHOD: This study applied the extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to explore the psychological factors that affected self-regulation of older drivers. 317 participants mainly from Beijing urban area completed the questionnaires including demographic information and extend TPB items. RESULTS: Bivariate correlation analysis showed that self-regulation was negatively correlated with the amount of driving experience (days per week and mileages per month) in a significant way. And so was the number of family-owned motor vehicles. Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the extended TPB questionnaire was reliable and effective for measuring self-regulation. The proposed Structural Equation Model (SEM) explained 73.673% of the variance in self-regulation intention. Attitude (0.50) had the strongest influence among all variables on intention. Subjective norms (0.28), perceived behavior control (0.27), and alternative traffic quality (0.20) significantly influenced intention. Intention (0.34) and physical condition (0.22) imposed significant effect on self-regulation behavior. Practical applications: Feasible suggestions were put forward that contribute to self-regulate reasonably. This study helps to better understand the nature of self-regulation behaviors and provides a theoretical basis for formulating scientific intervention measures.

Here we analysed mutation patterns in 13 human SARS-COV-2 isolates and a closely related RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bat. We also evaluated the CpG dinucleotide contents in SARS-COV-2 and other human and animal coronavirus genomes. Results: Out of 1107 single nucleotide differences (c. 4% divergence) between human SARS-COV-2 and bat RaTG13, 672 (61%) can be attributed to C>U and U>T substitutions significantly (P<0.001) exceeding other types of SNPs. A similar trend was observed among the 13 sequenced SARS-COV-2 genomes. Accumulation of C>U mutations was also observed in a highly variable subregion encoding the ACE2 receptor contact domain. Contrast to most other coronaviruses both SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 exhibited CpG depletion in their genomes. Conclusion: The data support that the C-to-U conversion played a significant role in the evolution of pathogenic RNA coronaviruses including SARS-COV-2. These mutations apparently also influenced amino acid composition of the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein domain receptor implicated in virus pathogenicity.

Over 60% of respondents were interested in the possibility of accessing EHRs in general, and almost 50% of them were ready to pay for it. Nevertheless, when analyzing all the year-on-year trends, they were subject to a gradual decrease.

Admission MELD-lactate was recently demonstrated to be a superior predictor of in-hospital mortality as compared to MELD in limited cohorts. We aimed to identify specific classes of hospitalizations where MELD-lactate may be especially useful, and to evaluate the predictive role of lactate clearance. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of 1,036 cirrhosis hospitalizations for gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, or other portal hypertension-related indications in the Veterans Health Administration where MELD-lactate was measured upon admission. Performance characteristics for in-hospital mortality were compared between MELD-lactate and MELD/MELD-Na, with stratified analyses of MELD categories (15, 15-25, 25) and reason for admission. We also incorporated day 3 lactate levels into modeling, and tested for an interaction between day 1 MELD-lactate and day 3 lactate clearance. RESULTS MELD-lactate had superior discrimination for in-hospital mortality as compared to MELD or MELD-Na (area under the curve [AUC] 0.789 vs. 0.776 vs. 0.760, p<0.001), and superior calibration. MELD-lactate had higher discrimination among hospitalizations with MELD 15 (AUC 0.763 vs. 0.608 for MELD, global p=0.01) and hospitalizations for infection (AUC 0.791 vs. 0.674 for MELD, global p<0.001). We found a significant interaction between day 1 MELD-lactate and day 3 lactate clearance; heat maps were created as clinical tools to risk stratify patients based on these clinical data. CONCLUSION In comparison to MELD or MELD-Na, MELD-lactate has significantly superior performance in predicting in-hospital mortality among patients hospitalized for infection and/or with MELD 15.

However, there are no rigorous estimates of total viral diversity (here termed virodiversity) for any wildlife species, despite the utility of this to future surveillance and control of emerging zoonoses.

We then adapted statistical techniques used to estimate biodiversity in vertebrates and plants and estimated the total viral richness of these nine families in P. giganteus to be 58 viruses. Our analyses demonstrate proof-of-concept of a strategy for estimating viral richness and provide the first statistically supported estimate of the number of undiscovered viruses in a mammalian host. We used a simple extrapolation to estimate that there are a minimum of 320,000 mammalian viruses awaiting discovery within these nine families, assuming all species harbor a similar number of viruses, with minimal turnover between host species. We estimate the cost of discovering these viruses to be ~$6.3 billion (or ~$1.4 billion for 85% of the total diversity), which if annualized over a 10-year study time frame would represent a small fraction of the cost of many pandemic zoonoses.","output":"A Strategy To Estimate Unknown Viral Diversity in Mammals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brazil has experienced some of the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths globally and from May 2021 made Latin America a pandemic epicenter.

Here, we describe the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 using near-full genomes sampled from 27 Brazilian states and a bordering country - Paraguay. We show that the early stage of the pandemic in Brazil was characterised by the co-circulation of multiple viral lineages, linked to multiple importations predominantly from Europe, and subsequently characterized by large local transmission clusters. As the epidemic progressed under an absence of effective restriction measures, there was a local emergence and onward international spread of Variants of Concern (VOC) and Variants Under Monitoring (VUM), including Gamma (P.1) and Zeta (P.2). In addition, we provide a preliminary genomic overview of the epidemic in Paraguay, showing evidence of importation from Brazil.

A large proportion of older adults in Mexico have high prevalence of multimorbidity and live in poverty with limited access to health care services. These statistics are even higher among adults living in rural areas, which suggests that older adults in rural communities may be more susceptible to COVID-19. The objectives of the article were to compare clinical and demographic characteristics for people diagnosed with COVID-19 by age group, and to describe cases and mortality in rural and urban communities. METHODS: We linked publicly available from the Mexican Ministry of Health and the Census. Municipalities were classified based on population as rural (<2500), semi-rural ( 2,500 and <15,000), semi-urban (15,000 and <100,000) and urban (100,000). Zero-inflated negative binomial models were performed to calculate the total number of COVID-19 cases, and deaths per 1,000,000 persons using the population of each municipality as a denominator. RESULTS: Older adults were more likely to be hospitalized and reported severe cases, with higher mortality rates. In addition, rural municipalities reported a higher number of COVID-19 cases and mortality related to COVID-19 per million than urban municipalities. The adjusted absolute difference in COVID-19 cases was 912.7 per million (95% Confidence Interval (CI),79.0 C 1746.4) and mortality related to COVID-19 was 390.6 per million (95% CI, 204.5 C 576.7).

The objective of this study is to evaluate the main precautionary measures in COVID-19 administrative services, using three techniques of multi-criteria decision making. Methods This study was conducted in four stages. In the first stage, there was the characterization of an administrative services company as an analytical model. In the second stage, some prevention measures were defined as choices and their evaluation criteria. The alternatives were: use of masks;use of gel alcohol;handwashing;hygiene of workstations and bathrooms;use of individual utensils;physical-social distance;and education (training on prevention). The criteria were: reduction of the probability of transmission by contact;practicality of behavioral adaptation;and monthly cost. In the third stage, a decision matrix was constructed relating the selected choices and criteria. In the fourth stage there was the application of the techniques PROMETHEE I, PROMETHEE II and ELECTRE III to prioritize the selected prevention measures. Results After the comparative analysis of the results of the applied techniques, it was possible to strongly advise four of the seven measures chosen: use of masks;use of gel alcohol;physical-social distance and education.

Understanding the TRAP-academic performance relationship will assist in identifying mechanisms for improving students' learning and aid policy makers in developing guidance for protecting children in school environments. METHODS This systematic review assessed the relationship between TRAP and academic performance. Web of Science, PubMed, CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, Scopus and ERIC databases were searched for relevant, peer reviewed, articles published in English. Articles assessing exposure to TRAP pollutants (through direct measurement, local air quality monitoring, modelling, or road proximity/density proxy measures) and academic performance (using standardised tests) in children and adolescents were included. Risk of bias was assessed within and between studies. RESULTS Of 3519 search results, 10 relevant articles were included. Nine studies reported that increased exposure to some TRAP was associated with poorer student academic performance. Study methodologies were highly heterogeneous and no consistent patterns of association between specific pollutants, age groups, learning domains, exposure windows, and exposure locations were established. There was a serious risk of bias within individual studies and confidence in the body of evidence was low. CONCLUSIONS This review found evidence suggestive of a negative association between TRAP and academic performance. However, the quality of this evidence was low. The existing body of literature is small, lacks the inclusion of high-quality exposure measures, and presents limitations in reporting.

The LoD (copies/ml) of qRT-PCR, ddPCR, and OSN-qRT-PCR were 520.1 (95% CI): 363.23-1145.69) for ORF1ab and 528.1 (95% CI: 347.7-1248.7) for N, 401.8 (95% CI: 284.8-938.3) for ORF1ab and 336.8 (95% CI: 244.6-792.5) for N, and 194.74 (95% CI: 139.7-430.9) for ORF1ab and 189.1 (95% CI: 130.9-433.9) for N, respectively. Of the 34 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, the positive rates of OSN-qRT-PCR, ddPCR, and qRT-PCR were 82.35% (28/34), 67.65% (23/34), and 58.82% (20/34), respectively. In conclusion, the highly sensitive and specific OSN-qRT-PCR assay is superior to ddPCR and qRT-PCR assays, showing great potential as a technique for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with low viral loads.","output":"Analysis and validation of a highly sensitive one-step nested quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for specific detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the Covid\\\\19 pandemic impacted on professionals and patients receiving cognitive rehabilitation (CR) forcing them to instrument assistance programs through tele\\\\neuropsychology. Many of those who receive CR are older adults who lack the necessary technological knowledge to carry out CR through teleneuropsychology. The present study aims to evaluate the impact of a training program on technological tools, carried out by high school students, for older adults who received CR through teleneuropsychology. METHOD: Design: Pre\\\\post, longitudinal intervention study. Participants: Older adults (n=13) (73.34 +/\\\\ 5.07 years old) and Students (n=20) (16.14 +/\\\\1.33 years old). The intervention consisted of a 4 week program for technological training. Participants were assessed at the beginning and the end of the program which consists in two training sessions of 45 minutes each. Instruments: Older adults were assessed with: Questionnaire of Social Demographic Data and Use of Technology (built ad. Hoc.), Functional Assessment Questionnaire, MOS Scale of Social Support, Try Your Memory Test (TYM). Students were assessed with: Basic data questionnaire and Negative stereotypes questionnaire towards old age (CENVE). RESULT: When comparing pre and post\\\\tests, statistically significant differences were found in the assessed variables.

Unfortunately, no human vaccine against UTIs has been developed. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an efficient and safe vaccine that is able to induce mucosal and systemic immune responses. The use of lactic acid bacteria as a delivery system is a promising method to induce the immune system. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to establish Lactobacillus reuteri harboring the E. coli PapG antigen on its surface. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the gene encoding PapG was fused to the AcmA gene (which encodes an anchor protein in Lactobacillus) and cloned into the pEX A vector. The PapG.AcmA fusion gene was digested with BamHI and NdeI and sub-cloned into the pET21a expression vector at the digestion sites. Subsequently, the recombinant plasmids (pET21a-PapG.AcmA and pET21a-PapG) were transformed into the E. coli Origami strain using the calcium chloride method and the fusion protein was expressed under 1 mM IPTG induction. The expression of the fusion protein was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blotting. Purification of the PapG and PapG.AcmA proteins was carried out using a Ni-NTA column, and surface adsorption was estimated on Lactobacillus. Finally, surface localization of the fusion protein was verified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The PapG.AcmA fusion was successfully sub-cloned in the pET21a expression vector. The expression of PapG and PapG.AcmA proteins in the E. coli Origami strain was indicated as protein bands in SDS-PAGE and confirmed by western blotting. In addition, the fusion protein was displayed on the surface of L. reuteri. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we developed a method to express the PapG.AcmA protein on the surface of Lactobacillus. This is the first report on the successful application of lactic acid bacteria displaying the PapG.AcmA fusion protein. It will be interesting to determine the immune responses against the PapG protein in near future using this surface display strategy.","output":"Expression and Purification of the Uropathogenic Escherichia coli PapG Protein and its Surface Absorption on Lactobacillus reuteri: Implications for Surface Display System Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the psychological state of medical personnel in the Department of Radiotherapy during the COVID-19 epidemic.

Medical management for patients with diabetes in pregnancy typically occurs via frequent face-to-face outpatient appointments. Barriers to face-to-face care during the COVID-19 pandemic have signaled the need for high-quality, patient-centered virtual health care modalities, such as mobile health (mHealth). OBJECTIVE: The objective of the proposed scoping review is to identify the patient-reported benefits and limitations of mHealth technology among women with diabetes in pregnancy. We also aim to determine how the womens experiences align with the best practice standards for patient-centered communication. METHODS: Arksey and OMalleys framework for conducting scoping reviews with refinements by Levac et al will be used to guide the conduct of this scoping review. Relevant studies will be identified through comprehensive database searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, and PsycINFO. Following database searches, studies will be screened for eligibility at the title, abstract, and full-text level by two independent reviewers, with the inclusion of a third reviewer if required to reach consensus. Data charting of included studies will be conducted by one reviewer using a standardized data extraction form and verified independently by a second reviewer. Synthesis of results will be guided by Thomas and Hardens Methods for the Thematic Synthesis of Qualitative Research in Systematic Reviews. RESULTS: As of August 2020, we have carried out the qualitative searches in the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, and PsycINFO (Ovid interface) for a combined total of 8207 articles. Next, we plan to conduct the quantitative searches in the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, and Emcare (Ovid interface).

Frozen foods (FFs) are a significant section of the global food market experiencing rapid growth. It also represents an alternative to small producers in developing countries to add value to their products in a competitive market. However, unfairly, FFs are often perceived as less qualitative than fresh produce, although studies have shown that some FFs have higher nutritional values than fresh products. This studys aim is to analyze consumers perceptions in the two Balkan countries towards FFs. A total of 380 questionnaires were completed in both countries (182 in Kosovo and 198 in Albania). Consumers perceptions towards FFs were measured through eleven items using a five-point Likert scale. The items addressed issues related to the quality and safety of FFs, information on FFs, and the impact of origin on the perception of FFs. The differences between populations were tested with the t-test and correlation analysis with the bootstrapping method for sociodemographic factors. The results show that Kosovo consumers generally show a higher positive attitude toward FFs than Albanian consumers. Albanian consumers prefer fresh foods over FFs. The lack of trust in food safety institutions was expressed with concern for the conditions of the frozen chain applied both on the imported and domestic frozen products. Similarly, the findings show that Albanian consumers are willing to pay more than the baseline price to obtain fresh products instead of frozen compared with Kosovo consumers. Additional studies are needed to explore whether the lack of trust in food safety institutions inhibits the successful development of FFs in Albania and Kosovo.

The impact of this approach on teacher preparation is yet unknown and may render pre-service teachers (PSTs) more vulnerable to the challenges of early professional learning through practice, especially when implementing a methodology they have been insufficiently introduced to. Following three students of primary teacher education who opted for a practicum in a CLIL class at a Finnish teacher training school, this case study examines how the online practicum affected these PSTs' emotions and understanding of CLIL. The case study is based on the analytical categories of teacher identity and emotion and draws on essay, diary, and interview data. The thematic analysis of the data suggests that the online practicum met participants' expectations for building confidence and was perceived as an overall instructive experience, which was improved by the quality of mentorship and peer support they received. However, feelings of frustration or dissatisfaction accompanied moments of conflict with incoming expectations, principally related to using English in CLIL. The analysis further suggests that the online practicum strengthened participants' earlier conception of CLIL as a language-oriented teaching tool. Regardless of whether online CLIL practicums remain a future option, acquiring disciplinary and language knowledge alike are important aspects in teacher preparation for CLIL, which could be an optional part of teacher education programs for PSTs who are aware of or sensitive to language as a tool for learning.","output":"A Case Study of Three Finnish Pre-Service Teachers' Emotions and Understanding of CLIL During an Online Practicum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airport transportation vehicles, such as buses, aerotrains, and shuttles, provide important passenger transfer services in airports. This study quantitatively investigated COVID-19 aerosol infection risk and identified acceptable operational conditions, such as passenger occupancy rates and duration of rides, given the performance of vehicle ventilation. The greatest risk to the largest number of passengers is from an index case whose exhaled breath would take the longest time to exit the vehicle. The study identified such a case based on ventilation patterns, and it tracked the spread of viral aerosols (5 m) by using the Wells-Riley equation to predict aerosol infection risk distribution. These distributions allowed a definition of an imperfect mixing degree () as the ratio of actual risk and the calculated risk under a perfect mixing condition, and further derived regression equations to predict  in the far-field (FF) and near-field (NF) of each passenger. These results revealed an order of magnitude higher aerosol infection risk in NF than in FF. For example, with a ventilation rate of 58 ACH (air changes per hour) and a 45% occupancy rate, unmasked passengers should stay up to 15 min in the bus and 35 min in the shuttle to limit infection risk in NF within 10%. These also indicate that masking is an important and effective risk reduction measure in transportation vehicles, especially important in NF.

We examine how emotion regulation and brain structure and function are associated with internalizing problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, and moderate the association between pandemic-related stressors and internalizing problems. Methods Data are from a longitudinal sample (N=145, aged 10-15) strategically assessed at three crucial timepoints: prior to the pandemic, early during the stay-at-home order period, and again six months later. We examined associations of amygdala and hippocampal volume and amygdala activation during an emotional processing task prior to the pandemic;use of emotion regulation strategies prior to and during the pandemic;and pandemic-related stressors with internalizing problems. Results Greater exposure to pandemic-related stressors was associated with higher internalizing problems both early and later in the pandemic. Youths who reported more frequent use of rumination before the pandemic and higher use of expressive suppression and lower use of cognitive reappraisal early in the pandemic had higher internalizing problems early in the pandemic. Higher left amygdala activation to neutral relative to fearful faces before the pandemic was associated with greater internalizing problems and a stronger link between pandemic-related stressors and internalizing problems early in the pandemic.

As a result of the study, the authors come to the following conclusions: 1) the Russian authorities promptly adopted a package of legislative acts to protect the Russian economy; 2) most government measures can potentially be effective and capable of supporting the Russian economy in the context of the coronavirus epidemic, however, it is too early to talk about the final effectiveness and sufficiency of these measures; 3) some measures, despite the fact that they will accumulate funds in the budget, could potentially have a negative effect on the Russian economy in the future.","output":"State support for the russian economy affected by covid-19 consequences (legal aspects)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic offers an opportunity to examine the impacts of system-wide crises on key supply sectors such as water, energy and food. These sectors are becoming increasingly interlinked in environmental policy-making and with regard to achieving supply security. There is a pressing need for a systematization of impacts and responses beyond individual disruptions. This paper provides a holistic assessment of the implications of COVID-19 on the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus. First, it integrates the academic literature related to single cases and disruptions to provide a broader view of COVID-19 demand- and supply-side disruptions and immediate effects. Then, the major, long-term impact categories of medicalization/hygienization, (re)localization of production, and demand fluctuations are highlighted. These impacts result in priority cross-links such as irrigation, energy requirements for local food production, energy use for water and wastewater treatment, or water for energy use. Finally, sector-level insights on impacts and responses are provided, drawing from illustrative cases. The analysis of impacts of COVID-19 on the WEF nexus reflects heterogeneous experiences of short-term adaptations, and highlights the revaluation of the water-food-trade nexus. Revived debates on food sufficiency can benefit from green applications to minimize expected trade-offs. The current crisis also reveals some gaps in the WEF nexus debates with regard to the lack of risk-based perspectives and the need for a better consideration of spatial aspects in resource integration. Regarding resource-security issues in the WEF nexus, the COVID-19 stress test boosts debates concerning the adequacy of the production value chains (e.g., contingency and storage, diversification, and self-sufficiency) and the value of cross-border integration (e.g., trade, globalization, and aid).","output":"The water-energy-food nexus and COVID-19: Towards a systematization of impacts and responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles have been employed as potential vehicles for a large number of biomedical applications, such as drug delivery.

Poor sepsis prognosis is also associated with low zinc levels and the release of High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) from activated and/or necrotic cells. HMGB1 added to whole blood at physiological pH did not bind leukocyte receptors, but lowering pH with lactic acid to mimic sepsis conditions allowed binding, implying the presence of natural inhibitor(s) preventing binding at normal pH. Testing micromolar concentrations of divalent cations showed that zinc supported the robust binding of sialylated glycoproteins with HMGB1. Further characterizing HMGB1 as a sialic acid-binding lectin, we found that optimal binding takes place at normal blood pH and is markedly reduced when pH is adjusted with lactic acid to levels found in sepsis. Glycan array studies confirmed the binding of HMGB1 to sialylated glycan sequences typically found on plasma glycoproteins, with binding again being dependent on zinc and normal blood pH. Thus, HMGB1-mediated hyperactivation of innate immunity in sepsis requires acidosis, and micromolar zinc concentrations are protective. We suggest that the potent inflammatory effects of HMGB1 are kept in check via sequestration by plasma sialoglycoproteins at physiological pH and triggered when pH and zinc levels fall in late stages of sepsis. Current clinical trials independently studying zinc supplementation, HMGB1 inhibition, or pH normalization may be more successful if these approaches are combined and perhaps supplemented by infusions of heavily sialylated molecules.","output":"Sialoglycan recognition is a common connection linking acidosis, zinc, and HMGB1 in sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report introduces the COVID\\\\19 Family Environment Scale (CHES), which aims to measure the impact of social distancing due to COVID\\\\19 on household conflict and cohesion.

METHODS: A self\\\\administered questionnaire was delivered to solicit hospital health care workers' demographics, intention to leave, workplace environment, and changes related to COVID\\\\19 from July to November 2020 in Taiwan. Principal component analysis was performed to compare group\\\\related factors. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors for the intention of health care workers to leave their job. FINDINGS: Among the 1209 health care workers (mean age, 36.3 years) who participated in the study, intention to leave the job was found to be related to factors relating to COVID\\\\19, including perceived risk, affected social relationships, and increased workload and job stress, after adjustment for demographic and work factors. Supportive administration/management were protective factors against leaving the job. These results were supported by sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the intention of health care workers to leave their job during a pandemic is related to potentially modifiable factors relating to the infection itself and work environment. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: High perceived risk of COVID\\\\19, affected social relationaops, and increased workload and job stress were positively associated with the intention of health care workers to leave their job, whereas supportive administration and management were protective factors against leaving the job.

This axis is emerging as a novel target to attenuate ocular inflammation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the hypothesis that enhancing the activity of the protective axis of RAS by subretinal delivery of an AAV8 (Y733F)-ACE2 vector would protect against the ocular inflammation in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) mice through regulating the local immune responses. Our studies demonstrated that increased ACE2 expression exerts protective effects on inflammation in EAU mouse by modulating ocular immune responses, including the differentiation of Th1/Th17 cells and the polarization of M1/M2 macrophages; whereas the systemic immune responses appeared not affected. These effects were mediated by activating the Ang-(1C7)/Mas and inhibiting the MAPK, NF-B and STAT3 signaling pathways.

It is estimated that 1.5% of patients with ID will have a clinical diagnosis of ADHD. The aim of this audit was to find whether individuals with ID and ADHD, who are prescribed medication for ADHD are adequately monitored and reviewed in accordance with the ADHD medication prescription guidance by NICE and the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych). Method This audit looked at ADHD medication prescription for the ID population within Greater Glasgow & Clyde NHS. This is the 6th audit cycle where electronic records (EMIS) were analysed between 28/9/19 to 09/10/20. (The 5th cycle data collection period ended on 28/9/19). We collected data on all patients aged over 18 years. An audit tool was developed to find whether the following were documented;patient demographics, physical health monitoring, symptom severity, medication dosage, side effects, need for ongoing treatment and frequency of review. 100% of patients should have all components on the ADHD audit tool documented, as per NICE/ RCPsych prescription guidance. Result 32 patients were identified as being diagnosed with ADHD prescribed medication. One patient was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which meant that the required monitoring was not fully carried out. The age ranged from 18 to 56 years. 75% had mild intellectual disability, 19% had moderate and 6% had severe, with no cases of profound intellectual disability. Blood Pressure/pulse was recorded in 84% of patients. Height/weight/ BMI was recorded in 81% of patients. 97% of patients had ADHD symptom severity, medication dosage, side effects, need for ongoing treatment and frequency of review recorded. Conclusion There is further scope for improvement in the monitoring and documentation of physical health observations, however there was a significant improvement compared to the previous cycle of the audit. Other aspects of monitoring and documentation appear to be recorded in almost 100% of patients.

In a healthy general population, wearables have shown promise in providing early alerts for actionable interventions during the pandemic. We tested this promise in a cohort of SNFs patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted for post-acute care under quarantine. We tested if 1) deployment of wearables and contact-free biosensors is feasible in the setting of SNFs and 2) they can provide early and actionable insights into deterioration. Methods: This prospective clinical trial has been IRB-approved (NCT04548895). We deployed two commercially available devices detecting continuously every 2-3 minutes heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and uniquely providing the following biometrics: 1) the wrist-worn bracelet by Biostrap yielded continuous oxygen saturation (O2Sat), 2) the under-mattress ballistocardiography sensor by Emfit tracked in-bed activity, tossing, and sleep disturbances. Patients also underwent routine monitoring by staff every 2-4 h. For death outcomes, cases are reported due to the small sample size. For palliative care versus at-home discharges, we report meanSD at p<0.05. Results: From 12/2020 - 03/2021, we approached 26 PCR-confirmed SarsCoV2-positive patients at two SNFs: 5 declined, 21 were enrolled into monitoring by both sensors (female=13, male=8; age 77.29.1). We recorded outcomes as discharged to home (8, 38%), palliative care (9, 43%) or death (4, 19%). The O2Sat threshold of 91% alerted for intervention. Biostrap captured hypoxic events below 91% nine times as often as the routine intermittent pulse oximetry. In the patient deceased, two weeks prior we observed a wide range of O2Sat values (65-95%) captured by the Biostrap device and not noticeable with the routine vital sign spot checks. In this patient, the Emfit sensor yielded a markedly reduced RR (7/min) in contrast to 18/min from two routine spot checks performed in the same period of observation as well as compared to the seven patients discharged home over a total of 86 days of monitoring (RR 194). Among the patients discharged to palliative care, a total of 76 days were monitored, HR did not differ compared to the patients discharged home (688 vs 707 bpm). However, we observed a statistically significant reduction of RR at 164/min as well as the variances in RR (106 vs 194/min vs1613) and activity of palliative care patients vs. patients discharged home. Conclusion/Discussion: We demonstrate that wearables and under-mattress sensors can be integrated successfully into the SNF workflows and are well tolerated by the patients. Moreover, specific early changes of oxygen saturation fluctuations and other biometrics herald deterioration from COVID-19 two weeks in advance and evaded detection without the devices.

METHODS: The mobile application and back-office of AllergyMonitor (TPS software production, Rome, Italy) enable patients to record their daily allergy symptoms as well as drug and immunotherapy intake plus possible side effects in a customizable way. The results can be accessed by the patient and attending physician as concise reports via a smartphone or computer. This technology has been used in several clinical studies and routine practice since 2009. RESULTS: Our studies showed that A) the etiological diagnosis of SAR may be supported by matching prospectively registered symptoms with pollen counts; B) it is possible to perform a short-term prediction of SAR-symptoms at individual level; C) the adherence to daily symptom monitoring can remain high (> 80%) throughout several weeks when prescribed and thoroughly explained by the treating doctor; D) the use of mobile technology can improve adherence to symptomatic drugs as well as allergen-specific immunotherapy and E) the choice of the correct symptom-severity-score is critical at patient level, but not at group level.

However, no long-term studies exist. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of isolated ACLR versus ACL+ALLR at long-term follow-up. The hypothesis was that patients who underwent combined procedures would experience significantly lower rates of graft rupture. STUDY DESIGN Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS Patients undergoing primary ACL+ALLR between January 2011 and March 2012 were propensity matched in a 1:1 ratio to patients who underwent isolated ACLR during the same period. A combination of face-to-face and telemedicine postoperative follow-up was undertaken. At the end of the study period (March 2020), medical notes and a final telemedicine interview were used to determine whether patients had experienced any complications or reoperations. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score were collected for all patients. Graft survivorship was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Logistic regression was performed to account for the potential effect of activity level on graft rupture rates. RESULTS A total of 86 matched pairs were included in the study. The mean  SD age was 32.2  8.8 years (range, 22-67 years) in the ACL+ALLR group and 34.7  8.5 years (range, 21-61 years) in the isolated ACLR group. The mean duration of follow-up was 104.33  3.74 months (range, 97-111 months). Patients who underwent combined ACL+ALLR versus isolated ACLR experienced significantly better ACL graft survivorship (96.5% vs 82.6%, respectively; P = .0027), lower overall rates of reoperation (15.3% vs 32.6%; P < .05), and lower rates of revision ACLR (3.5% vs 17.4%; P < .05). Patients undergoing isolated ACLR were at >5-fold greater risk of graft rupture (odds ratio, 5.549; 95% CI, 1.431-21.511; P = .0132), regardless of their preinjury activity level. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to other complications or any clinically important differences in patient-reported outcome measures. CONCLUSION Patients who underwent combined ACL+ALLR experienced significantly better long-term ACL graft survivorship, lower overall rates of reoperation, and no increase in complications compared with patients who underwent isolated ACLR. Further, patients who underwent isolated ACLR had a >5-fold increased risk of undergoing revision surgery at a mean follow-up of 104.3 months.","output":"Graft Rupture Rates After Combined ACL and Anterolateral Ligament Reconstruction Versus Isolated ACL Reconstruction: A Matched-Pair Analysis From the SANTI Study Group."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This meta-analysis aims to assess whether elevated De Ritis ratio is associated with poor prognosis in patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).

De Ritis ratio is also known as Aspartate aminotransferase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT) ratio. The main outcome was poor prognosis, a composite of mortality, severity, the need for ICU care, and intubation. The effect measure was odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences. We generated sensitivity and specificity, negative and positive likelihood ratio (NLR and PLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under curve (AUC). Results: There were eight studies with 4,606 patients. De Ritis ratio was elevated in 44% of the patients. Patients with poor prognosis have higher De Ritis ratio [mean difference 0.41 (0.31, 0.50), p < 0.001; I(2): 81.0%] and subgroup analysis showed that non-survivors also have higher De Ritis Ratio [mean difference 0.47 (0.46, 0.48), p < 0.001; I(2): 0%]. Elevated De Ritis ratio was associated with poor prognosis [OR 3.28 (2.39, 4.52), p < 0.001; I(2): 35.8%].

The authors assessed the proportion of individuals presenting IgM and/or IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, and evaluated the association between having positive serological test results, epidemiologic variables and clinical presentations. Reported symptoms were evaluated on their sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. RESULTS: The authors assessed 1696 employees, of whom 22.0% were firefighters, 10.4% were police officers, 10.3% were maintenance workers, and 8.1% were administrative assistants. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 2.9% (95% CI: 2.1-3.7%). Administrative assistants comprised the professional group with highest seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 1.9 in the comparison with other occupational groups, 95% CI: 0.8-4.3, p = 0.126).

Among the putative links between hypertension and COVID-19 is a key counter-regulatory component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS): angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 facilitates entry of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, into host cells. Since RAS inhibitors have been suggested to increase ACE2 expression, healthcare providers and patients have grappled with the decision of whether to discontinue these medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, experimental models of analogous viral pneumonias suggest RAS inhibitors may exert protective effects against acute lung injury. We review how RAS and ACE2 biology may affect outcomes in COVID-19 through pulmonary and other systemic effects.

Previous studies have shown the implication between an impaired cellular degradation homeostasis and cardiomyopathy development. Therefore, uncovering the underlying mechanism responsible for the lack of PLN protein has important implications in understanding the patient pathology, chronic human calcium dysregulation and aid the development of potential therapeutics. METHODS: A panel of mutant and wild-type reporter tagged PLN modified mRNA (modRNA) constructs were transfected in human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Lysosomal and proteasomal chemical inhibitors were used together with cell imaging and protein analysis tools in order to dissect degradation pathways associated with expressed PLN constructs. Transcriptional profiling of the cardiomyocytes transfected by wild-type or L39X mutant PLN modRNA was analysed with bulk RNA sequencing. RESULTS: Our modRNA assay system revealed that transfected L39X mRNA was stable and actively translated in vitro but with only trace amount of protein detectable. Proteasomal inhibition of cardiomyocytes transfected with L39X mutant PLN modRNA showed a fourfold increase in protein expression levels. Additionally, RNA sequencing analysis of protein degradational pathways showed a significant distinct transcriptomic signature between wild-type and L39X mutant PLN modRNA transfected cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the cardiomyopathic PLN null mutant L39X is rapidly, actively and specifically degraded by proteasomal pathways.

While current technologies are sufficient to support commercial deployment of fresh water electrolyzers, there remain a few well-defined challenges in the path of commercializing direct seawater electrolyzers, predominantly related to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and the competing chlorine evolution reaction (CER) at the anode. Herein, we report the facile and swift fabrication of an S,B-codoped CoFe oxyhydroxide via solution combustion synthesis for the OER with apparent CER suppression abilities.

Chronoamperometry testing of the codoped bimetallic oxyhydroxides showed very stable behavior in harsh alkaline saline and in neutral pH saline environments. S,B-(CoFe)OOH-H oxyhydroxide showed a notable decrease in CER production in comparison to the other S,B-codoped counterparts.

However, the role of other trans-Golgi network-late endosome transporters, such as the cation-independent (CI-) M6PR and sortillin-1, has not been evaluated. In this work, we found that several rotavirus strains that require the CD-M6PR for cell entry are also dependent on CI-M6PR and sortilin-1. Furthermore, we showed that the infectivity of all these rotavirus strains also requires cathepsins to enter not only MA104 cells, but also human intestinal Caco-2 cells.

All patients received initial AngioJet (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) thrombectomy followed by continuous catheter directed thrombolysis with Urokinase (Medac, Wedel, Germany) for 22-52 hours. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS), using Viatorr stent grafts (W.L. Gore and Associates, AZ, USA; mean diameter: 10 mm, length: 60-80 mm), were implanted in all patients. Patients were followed clinically and with imaging (mean 646 days, range 392 to 936 days). Results Technical success was 100%. Therapeutic success was achieved in 75% of cases. AngioJet-assisted thrombectomy substantially reduced thrombus load in the acute cases, while only slight improvement was achieved in the acute-on-chronic case. Continuous thrombolysis subtotally re-established PV flow in the acute cases, while only minimal improvement was seen in the acute-on-chronic case. Following TIPS implantation complete PV recanalisation could be achieved in all acute cases. In the acute-on-chronic case initial stagnant PV flow was seen; however, PV and TIPS re-occluded 10 days after implantation. During follow-up PV remained patent in acute cases.

This study examines opioid treatment program (OTP) changes to methadone treatment during COVID-19 and changes in fatal methadone-involved overdose rates in Connecticut. METHODS From July 8th to August 18th, 2020, we conducted a comprehensive state-wide survey of all eight OTPs that dispense methadone in Connecticut to examine programmatic changes during COVID-19. We also analyzed state-level data on confirmed accidental opioid-involved deaths to assess if relaxation of take-home dosing restrictions and in-person attendance requirements correlated with increased methadone-involved fatal overdose rates. RESULTS OTPs reported implementing multiple changes to methadone treatment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The percent of patients receiving 28-day take-home doses increased from 0.1% to 16.8%, 14-day take-home doses increased from 14.2% to 26.8%, and the percent receiving one or no take-home doses decreased from 37.5% to 9.6%. Monthly or more frequent drug testing decreased from 15% to 4.6% and 75.2% of individual counseling for methadone patients transitioned to telehealth. However, changes to methadone treatment varied considerably by program. OTP providers said restrictions on methadone should be relaxed and increases in take-home dosing as well as telehealth should be continued in non-pandemic situations. Methadone-involved fatalities relative to other opioid-involved fatalities did not increase in Connecticut following changes in OTP practices. CONCLUSIONS Connecticut OTPs relaxed methadone treatment requirements during COVID-19.

RESULTS: Of 88 patients with COVID-19, 59 (67%) were discharged with complete cure and 29 (33%) resulted in death. 46 (52.3%) of the patients were men. PTX-3 median value [IQR] was 3.66 ng/mL (0.9-27.9) in all patients, 3.3 ng/mL (0.9-27.9) in survivors and 3.91 ng/mL (1.9-23.2) in non-survivors which was significantly higher (p= 0.045). As a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis the cut-off value of PTX-3 for predicting mortality in patients was 3.73 with 65% sensitivity and 65% specificity (AUC: 0.646, 95% CI: 0.525-0.767, P= 0.045). Also, we found significant cut-off values with respect to D-Dimer, D-Dimer/ PTX-3, high-sensitivity troponin, high-sensitivity troponin/ PTX-3, lymphocyte, PTX-3/ lymphocyte, procalcitonin, procalcitonin/ PTX-3, CRP, and CRP/ PTX-3 (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: In this study, as far as we know, for the first time, we have shown PTX-3 as the new mortality biomarker for COVID-19 disease.","output":"The predictive and diagnostic accuracy of long Pentraxin-3 in COVID-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to develop an easily created tumor-mimic model and evaluate its efficacy for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the lung. The bilateral lungs of eight living adult swine were used. A tumor-mimic model was made by percutaneous injection of 1.0 ml muscle paste through the bone biopsy needle into the lung. An RFA probe was then inserted into the tumor mimics immediately after tumor creation. Ablation time, tissue impedance, and temperature were recorded. The tumor mimics and their coagulated regions were evaluated microscopically and macroscopically. The muscle paste was easily injected into the lung parenchyma through the bone biopsy needle and well visualized under fluoroscopy. In 10 of 12 sites the tumor mimics were oval shaped, localized, and homogeneous on gross specimens. Ten tumor mimics were successfully ablated, and four locations were ablated in the normal lung parenchyma as controls. In the tumor and normal lung parenchyma, ablation times were 8.9 +/- 3.5 and 4.4 +/- 1.6 min, respectively; tissue impedances at the start of ablation were 100.6 +/- 16.6 and 145.8 +/- 26.8 Omega, respectively; and temperatures at the end of ablation were 66.0 +/- 7.9 and 57.5 +/- 7.6 degrees C, respectively. The mean size of tumor mimics was 13.9 x 8.2 mm, and their coagulated area was 18.8 x 13.1 mm. In the lung parenchyma, the coagulated area was 15.3 x 12.0 mm.

Risk of RTIs and non-infectious ILD was compared to placebo by Mantel-Haenszel (MH) risk difference (RD). We divided RTIs into upper RTIs (URTI), viral URTIs, and lower RTIs (LRTIs) including infectious pneumonia. Non-infectious ILD included ILD, eosinophilic pneumonia, and pneumonitis. RESULTS: We identified 54 RCTs including 10,907 patients with six IL-12/23 or IL-23 antagonists and 5,175 patients with placebo. These drugs significantly increased the risk of RTIs (MH RD 0.019, 95% confidence interval 0.005-0.033, P = 0.007) which was attributed to URTIs, but not viral URTIs or LRTIs. There was no significant difference in infectious pneumonia and non-infectious ILD between two groups.

Debriefing can help clinicians process these emotions, but the coronavirus pandemic makes it difficult to create a physically and psychologically safe space in the emergency department (ED) to perform this intervention. In response, we piloted a video-based debriefing program to support emergency clinician well-being. We report the details of our program and results of our evaluation of its acceptability and perceived value to emergency clinicians during the pandemic. METHODS: ED attending physicians, resident physicians, and non-physician practitioners (NPP) at our quaternary-care academic medical center were invited to participate in role-based, weekly one-hour facilitated debriefings using Zoom. ED attendings with experience in debriefing led each session and used an explorative approach that focused on empathy and normalizing reactions. At the end of the pilot, we distributed to participants an anonymous 10-point survey that included multiple-answer questions and visual analogue scales. RESULTS: We completed 18 debriefings with 68 unique participants (29 attending physicians, 6 resident physicians, and 33 NPPs. A total of 76% of participants responded to our survey and 77% of respondents participated in at least two debriefings. Emergency clinicians reported that the most common reasons to participate in the debriefings were \\"to enhance my sense of community and connection\\" (81%) followed by \\"to support colleagues\\" (75%). Debriefing with members of the same role group (92%) and the Zoom platform (81%) were considered to be helpful aspects of the debriefing structure.

We present results from a nonrandomized proof-of-concept study of complement C5 inhibitor eculizumab for treatment of severe COVID-19. Methods: All patients (N = 80) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 admitted to our intensive care unit between March 10 and May 5, 2020 were included. Forty-five patients were treated with standard care and 35 with standard care plus eculizumab through expanded-access emergency treatment. The prespecified primary outcome was day-15 survival. Clinical laboratory values and biomarkers, complement levels, and treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) were also assessed. Findings: At day 15, estimated survival was 82.9% (95% CI: 70.4%a??95.3%) with eculizumab and 62.2% (48.1%a??76.4%) without eculizumab (log-rank test, P = 0.04). Patients treated with eculizumab experienced a significantly more rapid decrease in lactate, blood urea nitrogen, total and conjugated bilirubin levels and a significantly more rapid increase in platelet count, prothrombin time, and in the ratio of arterial oxygen tension over fraction of inspired oxygen versus patients treated without eculizumab. Eculizumab-associated changes in complement levels, laboratory values, and biomarkers were consistent with terminal complement inhibition, reduced hypoxia, and decreased inflammation. TESAEs of special interest occurring in >5% of patients treated with/without eculizumab were ventilator-associated pneumonia (51%/24%), bacteremia (11%/2%), gastroduodenal hemorrhage (14%/16%), and hemolysis (3%/18%). Interpretation: Findings from this proof-of-concept study suggest eculizumab may improve survival and reduce hypoxia in patients with severe COVID-19.

The aim of this study was to estimate the association between RWMA after exercise and in the presence of significant AR in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or volume overload and to predict the eventual need for aortic valve replacement (AVR). METHODS AND RESULTS We retrospectively reviewed 182 patients with significant AR who underwent exercise echocardiography. In addition, we investigated patients with AR who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and were diagnosed with CAD. The presence of RWMA after exercise was defined as newly developed RWMA after exercise and included all changes in wall motion. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of RWMA after exercise: the RWMA group (n = 42) and non-RWMA group (n = 140). In the RWMA group, 31 patients (73.8%) underwent coronary artery evaluation by CAG or CCTA. Only two patients in the RWMA group were diagnosed with current CAD and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients with RWMA were older (61.6  10.8 vs 52.0  13.7 years, P < .001), had more severe AR (54.8% vs 32.9%), and underwent AVR more frequently (40.5% vs 14.3%, P = .001) than patients without RWMA. METs (odds ratio [OR], 0.796; P = .019), difference between rest and postexercise left ventricular end-diastolic volume (OR, 0.967; P = .001), and the difference between pre- and postexercise left ventricular end-systolic volume (OR, 1.113; P < .001) were identified as independent factors associated with RWMA after exercise according to multivariable logistic regression analysis. The majority of wall motion changes were seen in the lateral and inferior segments, and the locations of wall motion changes were relatively consistent with the direction of the AR jet. The relationship between RWMA after exercise and time to AVR was investigated by simple linear regression (hazard ratio [HR], 3.402; P < .001). After adjusting for baseline parameters of diastolic blood pressure, left ventricular end-systolic dimension (LVESD), aorta size, deceleration time, and METs, the presence of RWMA after exercise was not predictive of time to AVR (HR, 1.106; P = .81). On the other hand, without forcible entry of RWMA after exercise, LVESD (HR, 1.119; P < .001) and METs (HR, 0.828; P = .006) independently predicted the eventual need for AVR as an outcome. CONCLUSION The degree of change in wall motion from rest to exercise in those with significant AR was not correlated with CAD, but was correlated with the severity of volume overload and exercise-induced preload changes, as well as the direction of the AR jet. In addition, RWMA after exercise had no role in predicting the need for AVR.","output":"Clinical implications of exercise-induced regional wall motion abnormalities in significant aortic regurgitation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The functioning of the world social and economic order in the 21st century has faced many challenges, but the global Covid-19 pandemic has caused unpredictable tendencies that require immediate, effective and adequate reactions that will respond seriously to the new situation.

The analysis focused on triterpenes (TTs) and caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs), which are known to contribute to C. asiaticas neurological activity. The acute safety of CAP and the effects on NRF2 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were evaluated. Single administration of 2 g or 4 g of CAP was safe and well-tolerated. The TT aglycones, asiatic acid and madecassic acid, were identified in plasma and urine, while the parent glycosides, asiaticoside and madecassoside, although abundant in CAP, were absent in plasma and had limited renal excretion. Similarly, mono- and di-CQAs showed delayed absorption and limited presence in plasma or urine, while the putative metabolites of these compounds showed detectable plasma pharmacokinetic profiles and urinary excretion. CAP elicited a temporal change in NRF2 gene expression, mirroring the TT aglycones pharmacokinetic curve in a paradoxical dose-dependent manner. The oral bioavailability of active compounds or their metabolites, NRF2 target engagement, and the acute safety and tolerability of CAP support the validity of using CAP in future clinical studies.","output":"Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Key Components of a Standardized Centella asiatica Product in Cognitively Impaired Older Adults: A Phase 1, Double-Blind, Randomized Clinical Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Postoperative nutrition support is an essential component of management in upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer resection, however there is limited knowledge of current clinical practice. This study aimed to describe the postoperative nutrition support received by patients undergoing UGI cancer resections, assess adherence with ESPEN surgical guideline recommendations, and to investigate differences between oesophageal, gastric and pancreatic surgeries. The secondary aim was to explore the association of adherence with ESPEN guidelines and provision of nutrition support, with surgical complications and length of stay (LOS). METHODS: The NOURISH point prevalence study was conducted between September 2019-June 2020 across 27 Australian tertiary centres. Malnutrition was diagnosed using subjective global assessment. Data on postoperative diet codes, prescription of nutrition support (oral (ONS), enteral (EN), parenteral (PN)) and nutritional adequacy were collected by dietitians for the first 10 days of admission. Fisher's exact test was used to determine differences in nutritional management and adherence to ESPEN guidelines between surgery types. Multivariate regression analysed associations with surgical outcomes. RESULTS: Two-hundred participants were included (42% pancreatic, 33% oesophageal, 25% gastric surgery). Overall, only 34.9% (n = 53) met the guideline recommendations that were applicable to them. Early oral intake of fluids or solids (within 24 h post surgery) was initiated for 23.5% (n = 47), whilst ONS/EN/PN was initiated for 49.5% (n = 99). Only 25% of pancreatic surgeries had nutrition support initiated on the first postoperative day compared to 86.4% of oesophageal and 42.0% of gastric surgeries (p < 0.001). In those who were 'nil by mouth', EN/PN were commenced within 24 h for 51.0% (n = 78), with 18.5% and 45.2% for pancreatic and gastric surgeries compared to 86.0% in oesophageal surgeries (p < 0.001). In malnourished patients, 35.7% (n = 30) commenced EN within 24 h, with 11.1% and 31.8% for pancreatic and gastric compared to 73.1% in oesophageal surgeries (p < 0.001). For patients meeting <60% energy/protein requirements for 7 days, only 14.8% (n = 9) received EN/PN, with 2.5% and 16.7% of pancreatic and gastric compared to 75.0% of oesophageal surgeries (p < 0.001). The number of days spent 'nil by mouth' or 'clear fluids' without EN/PN, as well as number of days with <60% estimated requirements met were independently associated with increased LOS and complications. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was poor adherence to the majority of assessed ESPEN guidelines, and care for patients undergoing pancreatic and gastric surgeries was less compliant than oesophagectomy. Poor nutritional adequacy was associated with increased LOS and complications. There is a clear need for knowledge translation and implementation studies to increase adherence to evidence-based recommendations in the Australian setting supported by an understanding of barriers and enablers to optimal postoperative nutrition management.","output":"Adherence to ESPEN guidelines and associations with postoperative outcomes in upper gastrointestinal cancer resection: results from the multi-centre NOURISH point prevalence study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 most commonly manifests with fever and respiratory illness.

If the estimated associations are interpreted as causal, the Gini coefficient for income has a significant positive effect on both cases and deaths per capita in regressions using the full sample and for cases but not for deaths when Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD sub-samples are treated separately. The Gini coefficient for wealth has a significant positive effect on cases, but not on deaths, in both sub-samples and in the full sample. Poverty generally has weak positive effects in the full and non-OECD samples, but a relative poverty measure has a strong positive effect on cases in the OECD sample. Analysis of the gap between COVID-19 first-wave cases and deaths per capita in Canada and the higher rates in the United States indicates that 37 percent of the cases gap and 28 percent of the deaths gap could be attributed to the higher-income Gini in the United States according to the full-sample regressions.

The risk of embolism is increased for mobile and complex aortic plaques that are >4 mm thick. The most common manifestations are stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) and peripheral embolization. Imaging modalities used include transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), CT angiography and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). The mainstays of medical treatment are antiplatelets and statin. The role of anticoagulation is reserved for plaques with thrombotic component. There were two patients who presented with large acute ischemic stroke with high grade, floating aortic arch thrombus and complex aortic arch plaques. In one of cases, after 10-day follow-up CT aortic angiography showed completely resolved thrombus after being treated with IV tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) followed by low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The risk of embolism depends on size of aortic plaques and mobility. TEE is modality of choice for thoracic aortic plaques. Aortic plaques >4 mm are independent predictors of recurrent ischemic stroke. There are limited data available for off-label use of intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in presence of aortic arch thrombus in acute ischemic strokes. These two case reports help in recognition of aortic arch complex plaques as independent risk factor for recurrent stroke. The right patients may consider about the use of intravenous alteplase and MT performed via trans-brachial access after excluding aortic dissection and aneurysm.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data were collected through social media. All the participants belonging to the Kashmir valley were included. EA questionnaire developed by Weems et al. was used. RESULTS: A total of 132 subjects were included. The prevalence of EA concerns was death 55%, fate 62%, emptiness 73%, meaninglessness 32%, guilt 55%, and condemnation 64%. The mean EA score was 5.0. EA was higher in those who had been diagnosed with mental illness ever in their life by a psychiatrist than those who had no such history. EA score was much higher in those who had ever felt a need to visit a psychiatrist than those who had not. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean scores of EA for those who never felt this need and those who felt this need since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study with an online questionnaire disseminated through social media, applying the snowball technique. The target population was primary care physicians working in Portugal during the first outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to sociodemographic data, the questionnaire collected responses to the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), the Resilience Scale and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21). Data were collected from May 9 to June 8, 2020, a period comprising the declaration of a national calamity and then state of emergency, and the subsequent ease of lockdown measures. Levels of burnout in 3 different dimensions (personal, work, and patient-related), resilience, stress, depression, and anxiety were assessed. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with burnout levels. RESULTS: Among the 214 physician respondents, burnout levels were high in the 3 dimensions.

There is however limited understanding of differences between sociocultural contexts in psychological response to pandemics and other disasters. OBJECTIVE: To examine how Canadians in different provinces, and with different governance modes and sociocultural contexts, understand and react to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted from April 8C11, 2020, among a representative sample of 600 Canadian adults from two different contexts (n=300 in Quebec, the French part of Canada, and n=300 elsewhere in Canada). Two psychological outcomes were assessed: probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The roles of various stressors (i.e., threat perceived for oneself or family/friends, quarantine or isolation, financial losses, victims of stigma), assets (i.e., trust in authorities, information received, and compliance with directives) and sources of information used on these two outcomes were also examined. Chi-square tests were performed to examine differences in the distribution of probable PTSD and GAD according to these stressors and assets. RESULTS: Probable PTSD and GAD were observed in 25.5% and 25.4% of the respondents, respectively. These proportions were significantly lower in Quebec than elsewhere in Canada. Perceiving a high level of threat and being a victim of stigma were positively associated with probable PTSD and GAD (but not quarantine/isolation and financial losses). A high level of trust in authorities was the only asset associated with a lower risk of PTSD or GAD. Interestingly, this asset was more frequently reported in Quebec than elsewhere in Canada.

Despite this impressive economic development, this growth exists side by side with the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crises and the persisting deficiencies in public health provision in China. Acknowledging the prevailing health problems, the Chinese government has encouraged the development of health non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond to the health challenges and address the gaps in public health provision of the government. HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs have been perceived as the most outstanding civil society group developed in China. Considering the low priority of health policies since the economic reform, the limitation of the third sector activity permitted in authoritarian China, together with the political sensitivity of the HIV/AIDS problem in the country, this article aims to explain the proliferation of HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs in China with the usage of the securitization framework in the field of international relations (IR). METHODS: The research that underpins this article is based on a desk-based literature review as well as in-depth field interviews with individuals working in HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs in China. Face-to-face interviews for this research were conducted between January and May in 2011, and between December 2016 and January 2017, in China. Discourse analysis was in particular employed in the study of the security-threat framing process (securitization) of HIV/AIDS in China. RESULTS: This article argues that the proliferation of HIV/AIDS-related NGOs in China is largely attributed to the normative and technical effects of HIV/AIDS securitization ushered in by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and supported by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (hereinafter Global Fund) observed in China. Despite depicting a positive scenario, the development of HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs in China generated by the international securitization efforts is largely limited. An internal and external factor was identified to verify the argument, namely (1) the reduction of international financial commitments, as well as (2) the fragmentation of HIV/AIDS-focused NGO community in China. CONCLUSIONS: This article shows that international securitization weakened with the rise of Chinese commitment on HIV/AIDS interventions. In other words, HIV/AIDS-related responses delivered by the national government are no longer checked by the global mechanism of HIV/AIDS; thus it is unclear whether these NGOs would remain of interest as partners for the government. The fragmentation of the HIV/AIDS community would further hinder the development, preventing from NGOs with the same interest forming alliances to call for changes in current political environment. Such restriction on the concerted efforts of HIV/AIDS-related NGOs in China would make achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to foster stronger partnerships between the government and civil society difficult, which in turn hindering the realization of ending HIV/AIDS in the world by 2030.","output":"Securitizing HIV/AIDS: a game changer in state-societal relations in China?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infections by coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV) and mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59) result in very little type I interferon (IFN) production by host cells, which is potentially responsible for the rapid viral growth and severe immunopathology associated with SARS. However, the molecular mechanisms for the low IFN production in cells infected with coronaviruses remain unclear. Here, we provide evidence that Papain-like protease domain 2 (PLP2), a catalytic domain of the nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) of MHV-A59, can bind to IRF3, cause its deubiquitination and prevent its nuclear translocation. As a consequence, co-expression of PLP2 strongly inhibits CARDIF-, TBK1- and IRF3-mediated IFN reporter activities. In addition, we show that wild-type PLP2 but not the mutant PLP2 lacking the deubiquitinase (DUB) activity can reduce IFN induction and promote viral growth in cells infected with VSV. Thus, our study uncovered a viral DUB which coronaviruses may use to escape from the host innate antiviral responses.

Indeed, despite considerable evidence of the impending threats of pandemics, for the most part, pandemic preparation was ignored, resulting in wide-scale social and economic losses.The lessons from COVID-19 however should remind us of the perils of ignoring gray rhino risks. Nowhere is this more apparent than with climate change, a highly probable, high impact threat that has largely been ignored to date. Despite those who deny climate change, there remains ample evidence of the increasing temperature of the earth, which like COVID-19, has the potential not only to create public health emergencies but also to create wide scale, enormous adverse impacts on the economy. Indeed, the risks posed by climate change to the economy have the potential to be so far-reaching that it should, as this article argues, be termed a systemic risk. As such, the economic implications of climate change need to be mitigated in order to preserve economic stability. This is necessary not only for prudential and economic reasons, but also to protect citizens health and safety, and to ensure that business does not exceed the limits of the planet.While there has been some attention to addressing the economic implications of climate change at the global level, progress in the US has been minimal. This is surprising, not only because climate change has already caused unprecedented damage in certain parts of the country, but also because, to some extent, existing legislation and models may offer the tools to address the systemic risks of climate change.

We describe the design and use of a case-based, short-course education model to transfer knowledge and skills in equity approaches to pandemic preparedness and response. Methods: This course used case studies of Massachusetts and Navajo Nation in the U.S, and Rwanda to highlight examples of equity-centered pandemic response. A post-session assessment survey was completed by course participants after each of the four modules. A mixed-method analysis was conducted to understand knowledge acquisition on key topics and assess participants experience and satisfaction with the course. Additionally, a landscape analysis was conducted to identify other equity-centered courses for pandemic response offered previously and to compare the content, audience, and intended outcomes. Results: Forty-four percent of participants identified, Immediate need for skills and information to address COVID-19 as their primary reason for attending the course. Participants reported that they are very likely (4.75 out of 5) to use the information, tools, or skills from the course in their work.

This work was aimed to decode rhizosphere microbe interactions and potential ecological hazards associated with GE maize. Rhizobacterial communities of field grown transgenic insect-resistant 2A5 maize carrying mcry1Ab and mcry2Ab genes were compared with control Z58 using PacBio sequencing platform. Also full-length 16S rDNA gene sequencing was used to verify the partial (V3-V4) sequencing results obtained in 2017. Measures of -diversity displayed transgenic 2A5 to be significantly lower in species richness at the flowering stage; however, diversity remained undisturbed. -diversity was least affected by genetic modifications where similar community profiles were shared by transgenic 2A5 and control Z58. In addition, root exudation patterns were found to drive variations in bacterial assemblages based on developmental stages. For example, genus Massilia successfully colonized the rhizosphere at jointing stage, while Mucilaginobacter showed higher relative abundance in flowering stages of both 2A5 and Z58. These members are known to possess attributes related to plant growth. The impact of dual-transgene insertion on nifH gene abundance was also analyzed where no apparent significant difference in nifH gene copy number was observed. Our results confirmed that full-length 16S rDNA sequencing was sufficient to provide higher taxonomic resolution. Also, results of our 2-year field trials confirmed that there is no significant impact of mcry gene integration on belowground biomasses. Therefore, GE insect-resistant 2A5 maize carrying mcry1Ab and mcry2Ab genes can continue to benefit human populations by increasing crop productivity.

The median length of ICU stay was 8 days longer in patients aged 70 years compared to patients aged 60 years. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 70 years had high mortality and longer ICU stay compared to patients aged 60 years. These findings in combination with the patient burden of an ICU admission and possible long term complications after discharge should encourage us to further investigate the benefit of ICU admission in elderly and fragile COVID-19-patients.","output":"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of 952 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in The Netherlands: A retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identification of new disease-associated biomarkers; specific targeting of such markers by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs); and application of advances in recombinant technology, including the production of humanized and fully human antibodies, has enabled many improved treatment outcomes and successful new biological treatments of some diseases previously neglected or with poor prognoses.

Observed effects on the central nervous system include neurological symptoms (headache, nausea, dizziness), fatal microclot formation and in rare cases encephalitis. However, our understanding of how the virus causes these mild to severe neurological symptoms and how the cerebral vasculature is impacted remains unclear. Thus, the results presented in this report explored whether deleterious outcomes from the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs) could be observed. The spike protein, which plays a key role in receptor recognition, is formed by the S1 subunit containing a receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S2 subunit. First, using postmortem brain tissue, we show that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 (a known binding target for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), is ubiquitously expressed throughout various vessel calibers in the frontal cortex. Moreover, ACE2 expression was upregulated in cases of hypertension and dementia. ACE2 was also detectable in primary hBMVECs maintained under cell culture conditions. Analysis of cell viability revealed that neither the S1, S2 or a truncated form of the S1 containing only the RBD had minimal effects on hBMVEC viability within a 48 h exposure window. Introduction of spike proteins to invitro models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) showed significant changes to barrier properties. Key to our findings is the demonstration that S1 promotes loss of barrier integrity in an advanced 3D microfluidic model of the human BBB, a platform that more closely resembles the physiological conditions at this CNS interface. Evidence provided suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins trigger a pro-inflammatory response on brain endothelial cells that may contribute to an altered state of BBB function. Together, these results are the first to show the direct impact that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could have on brain endothelial cells; thereby offering a plausible explanation for the neurological consequences seen in COVID-19 patients.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alters barrier function in 2D static and 3D microfluidic in-vitro models of the human blood-brain barrier"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The multi-omic integration of microbiota data with metabolomics has gained popularity.

Along with this compartment model, a multiplicative process model is introduced to allow for deviation from the deterministic dynamics. We apply this model to observed COVID\\\\19 cases and deaths in several U.S. states and Colorado counties. We find that population mobility measures are highly correlated with transmission rates and can explain complicated temporal variation in infectiousness in these regions.

The article examines the problem of psychological factors of observing stay-at-home recommendations, among which the main attention is paid to two types of optimism in a pandemic situation: constructive optimism and defensive optimism. It was assumed that they would have the opposite effect on adherence to the self-isolation regime, and the negative effect of defensive optimism would be mediated by a decrease in illness anxiety or fear of infection. To test this hypothesis, a longitudinal study (with an interval of six weeks) was carried out in a sample of 306 students (89% of women) using a life orientation test, the scales of constructive and defensive optimism by Gordeeva et al., and anxiety in a pandemic situation questionnaire by Tkhostov and Rasskazova. The results confirm our hypotheses: people who adhere to the stay-at-home recommendations are characterized by a higher level of constructive optimism, i.e. they believe that their efforts will help prevent infection and spread of the virus. In contrast, people who demonstrate unrealistic or defensive optimism, that is, who believe that the issue of coronavirus is exaggerated, fear infection less and admit that they do not strictly adhere to the requirements of self- isolation. These results indicate that, in addition to dispositional optimism, situation specific constructive and defensive optimism are essential in explaining health behavior, with the latter type of optimism serving as a response to anxiety associated with fear of the disease and its consequences.","output":"Optimism and Fear of Infection as Predictors of Observing Stay-at-home Recommendations during Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a great threat to people's health worldwide, with specific implications on patients with underlying heart diseases.

In-hospital mortality was defined as the primary endpoint. Sensitivity and meta-regression analyses were performed. Thirty studies with 21,309 patients were included in this meta-analysis (1465 with COPD and 633 with asthma). Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with COPD had higher risk of death compared to those without COPD (OR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.79C2.93; I(2) 59.6%). No significant difference in in-hospital mortality was seen in patients with and without asthma (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.68C1.10; I(2) 0.0%). The likelihood of death was significantly higher in patients with COPD that were hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to patients without COPD. Further studies are needed to assess whether this association is independent or not. No significant difference was demonstrated in COVID-19-related mortality between patients with and without asthma.","output":"Assessment of the Association of COPD and Asthma with In-Hospital Mortality in Patients with COVID-19.

This contribution asks how societal EU politicization shaped the enforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact up until its COVID-19-induced suspension. It employs causal process-tracing to analyse fiscal rule enforcement under varying levels and constellations of EU politicization. Results indicate that enforcement by the European Commission is shaped both by mandate and exogenous pressures created by politicization and the reputational concerns they induce. Moreover, politicization has gradually pushed the Commission towards increasingly flexible enforcement of EU fiscal rules. These conclusions are relevant because they show that politicization permeates even the most depoliticized areas of EU policy. Additionally, they suggest that the SGP's COVID-19-induced suspension can be understood as a continuation of existing enforcement strategies.","output":"Walking the Tightrope: Politicization and the Commission's Enforcement of the SGP*"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT We aimed to investigate the relationship of radiological features and the corresponding pulmonary pathology of patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pneumonia.In this multicenter study, serial chest CT and radiographic images from 9 patients (51-85 years old, 56% male) were reviewed and analyzed. Postmortem lungs were sampled and studied from these autopsies, with a special focus on several corresponding sites based on imaging features.The predominant pattern of pulmonary injury in these 9 cases was diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and interstitial inflammation. Moreover, acute fibrinous exudates, organization, inflammatory cell infiltration, hyaline membranes, pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, and fibrosis were all observed. The histopathology features varied according to the site and severity of each lesion. In most of the 9 cases, opacities started from a subpleural area and peripheral structures were more severely damaged based on gross views and pathological examinations. Fibrosis could occur in early stages of infection and this was supported by radiological and pathological findings. The radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonia, at the critically ill stage, were diffuse ground-glass opacities with consolidation, interstitial thickening, and fibrous stripes, which was based in the fibrous tissue proliferation in the alveolar and interlobular septa, and filled alveoli with organizing exudation. Fungal and bacterial co-infections were also observed in 6 cases.Typical imaging features can be correlated with underlying pathological findings. Combining assessments of imaging features with pathological findings therefore can enhance our understanding of the histopathological mechanism of COVID-19 pneumonia, and facilitate early radiological diagnosis and prognosis estimation of COVID-19 pneumonia, which has important implications for the development of clinical targeted treatments and research related to COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Correlation of autopsy pathological findings and imaging features from 9 fatal cases of COVID-19 pneumonia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine the relationship between Internet-based health information seeking and the demand for physician services, using data collected from the 28 European Union states in 2014. Unlike previous research, our analysis distinguishes seekers of health information into those who use only non-Internet sources and those who use the Internet and possibly non-Internet sources. By comparing the frequencies of physician visits among the two groups of health information seekers and non-seekers, we infer the net association between online health information and the demand for physician services while partially controlling for the effects of concurrent seeking of offline health information. The following are the two key findings: (1) individuals health status and sociodemographic factors shape online and offline health information seeking patterns in similar ways; and (2) the demand for physician services is positively associated with offline health information seeking and not with online health information. The net association with online health information would be even smaller after controlling for the effect of concurrent offline health information seeking. These results suggest that extending the availability of online health information would potentially reinforce the unequal access to health information, which could create greater variation in individuals health management skills and benefits from health care in the long term.

Tissue-specific outcomes of infection are also evident in many infectious diseases, suggesting that the local microenvironment may instruct complex and diverse innate and adaptive cellular responses resulting in locally distinct molecular signatures. In turn, these molecular signatures may both drive and be responsive to local metabolic changes in immune as well as non-immune cells, ultimately shaping the outcome of infection. Given the spatial complexity of immune and inflammatory responses during infection, it is evident that understanding the spatial organization of transcripts, proteins, lipids, and metabolites is pivotal to delineating the underlying regulation of local immunity. Molecular imaging techniques like mass spectrometry imaging and spatially resolved, highly multiplexed immunohistochemistry and transcriptomics can define detailed metabolic signatures at the microenvironmental level. Moreover, a successful complementation of these two imaging techniques would allow multi-omics analyses of inflammatory microenvironments to facilitate understanding of disease pathogenesis and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, we describe strategies for downstream data analysis of spatially resolved multi-omics data and, using leishmaniasis as an exemplar, describe how such analysis can be applied in a disease-specific context.","output":"Spatially Resolved Immunometabolism to Understand Infectious Disease Progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has plagued the entire world, including Indonesia.

However, it is unclear how the pandemic may influence attitudes and behaviour in relation to vaccines in general. The aim of the current study is to examine older adults changes in vaccination attitudes and behaviour over the first year of the pandemic. METHODS: In February-March 2020 (before the first COVID-19 national lockdown in the UK), 372 older adults (aged 65+) provided sociodemographic information, self-reported influenza vaccine uptake, and completed two measures of vaccination attitudes: the 5C scale and the Vaccination Attitudes Examination Scale. One-year later, following rollout of COVID-19 vaccines to older adults, participants provided information on their COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake in the previous 12 months, and completed the 5C and VAX scales again. Paired samples t-tests were used to examine changes in vaccination attitudes over time. RESULTS: Almost all participants (98.7%) had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and a significant increase in influenza uptake was identified (83.6% in 2020 to 91.6% in 2021). Complacency, mistrust of vaccine benefit, concerns about commercial profiteering, and constraints to vaccination had significantly decreased between Time 1 and Time 2, and collective responsibility had significant increased. However, calculation and worries about unforeseen future effects had increased, indicating that participants now perceived higher risks related to vaccination and were taking a more deliberative information-seeking approach. CONCLUSION: The results show significant changes in vaccination attitudes across the pandemic. These changes suggest that while older adults became less complacent about the importance of vaccines, concerns about potential risks associated with vaccination increased. It will be important for public health communication to address these concerns for all vaccines offered to this group.","output":"Changes in attitudes to vaccination as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study of older adults in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy is used for patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation. Extensive research has described the provision and optimal timing of tracheostomy, but very little describes tracheostomy utilization in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: This prospective cohort study describes patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary hospital in Malawi who received tracheostomy versus those who did not, with a primary outcome of hospital mortality. We performed subgroup analysis of patients with severe head injuries. RESULTS: The analysis included 451 patients admitted to the study ICU between September 2016 and July 2018. Overall hospital mortality was 40% for patients who received tracheostomy and 63% for patients who did not. Logistic regression modeling revealed an odds ratio (OR) of 0.34 (95% CI 0.18C0.64) for hospital mortality among patients who received tracheostomy versus those who did not (p < 0.001). Standardized mortality ratio weighting revealed an odds ratio of 0.81 (95% CI 0.65C0.99, p < 0.001) for hospital death among patients who received tracheostomy versus those who did not. In the subgroup excluding severe head injury, both ICU (50%) and hospital mortality (75%) were higher overall, but hospital mortality was not more common for patients with tracheostomy versus without (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.94C1.74, p = 0.104). CONCLUSIONS: Tracheostomy is not associated with hospital mortality in a Malawi ICU cohort, but these results are affected by the presence of head injury.

Vital sign trends are routinely used to monitor patients with changes in these parameters preceding an adverse event. Wearable sensors can measure vital signs continuously and remotely, outside of hospital facilities, recognising early clinical deterioration. We aim to determine the feasibility & acceptability of remote monitoring systems for quarantined individuals in a hotel suspected of COVID-19. METHODS: A pilot, proof-of-concept, feasibility trial was conducted in engineered hotels near London airports (May-June 2020). Individuals arriving to London with mild suspected COVID-19 symptoms requiring quarantine, as recommended by Public Health England, or healthcare professionals with COVID-19 symptoms unable to isolate at home were eligible. The SensiumVitals&#8482; patch, measuring temperature, heart & respiratory rates, was applied on arrival for the duration of their stay. Alerts were generated when pre-established thresholds were breeched; trained nursing staff could consequently intervene. RESULTS: Fourteen individuals (M = 7, F = 7) were recruited; the mean age was 34.9 (SD 11) years. Mean length of stay was 3 (SD 1.8) days. In total, 10 vital alerts were generated across 4 participants, resulting in telephone contact, reassurance, or adjustment of the sensor. No individuals required hospitalisation or virtual general practitioner review. DISCUSSION: This proof-of-concept trial demonstrated the feasibility of a rapidly implemented model of healthcare delivery through remote monitoring during a pandemic at a hotel, acting as an extension to a healthcare trust. Benefits included reduced viral exposure to healthcare staff, with recognition of clinical deterioration through ambulatory, continuous, remote monitoring using a discrete wearable sensor. CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring systems can be applied to hotels to deliver healthcare safely in individuals suspected of COVID-19. Further work is required to evaluate this model on a larger scale.

METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted after a thorough search of relevant studies from databases. Trials that have evaluated HCQ for COVID-19 treatment were recruited for statistical analysis with fixed- and random-effect models. RESULTS: Nine trials involving 4,112 patients were included in present meta-analysis. It was seen that hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin (HCQ-AZI) combination regimen increased the mortality rate in COVID-19 (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.63-3.36) patients, however, it also showed benefits associated with the viral clearance in patients (OR 27.18, 95% CI 1.29-574.32). HCQ-alone when used as a therapy in COVID-19 did not reveal significant changes in mortality rate, clinical progression, viral clearance and cardiac QT prolongation. Subsequent subgroup analysis showed that HCQ treatment could decrease mortality rate and progression to severe illness in severely-infected COVID-19 patients (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13-0.58). A lower risk of mortality rate was also noted in the stratified group of >14 days follow-up period (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13-0.58) compared to a?|14 days follow-up period group that conversely showed an increased mortality rate (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.41-3.10).

METHODS: We completed an online cross-sectional survey. Participants (n = 207) were staff working on-site in LTCH in Ontario, Canada since March 1, 2020, with direct or indirect experience with the isolation of residents. LTCH staff were recruited through provincial LTCH organizations, social media, and the DIT website. Survey results were summarized, and three groups compared, those: (1) unfamiliar with, (2) familiar with, and (3) users of the DIT. RESULTS: 61% of respondents identified distress of LTCH staff about the harmful effects of isolation on residents as a major barrier to effective isolation. Facilitators for isolation included delivery of 1:1 activity in the residents room (81%) and designating essential caregivers to provide support (67%). Almost all respondents (84%) reported an increase in moral distress.

There are different reports on the yearly case burden of Lassa fever from the Federal Ministry of Health in Nigeria, through the regulatory body C Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Being the epicentre of the disease, Lassa fever has been exported from Nigeria to both neighbouring and distant countries.Methods: The aim of this review was to carry out a retrospective analysis from January 2015 to 26 September 2021 of the weekly and yearly outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria based on selected publications. The focus was on timely diagnosis, treatment option, public health interventions and progress of clinical trials for vaccine candidates, and to identify proactive measures that can be sustained to curb periodic outbreaks. The review was done using percentages, cross-tabulation and graphical charts. RESULTS: The predominant age group infected was 21 to 40 years with a male to female ratio of 1:0.8. A total of 3311 laboratory-confirmed Lassa fever cases out of 20,588 suspected cases were identified from 29 states. Edo, Ondo, Taraba, Ebonyi, Bauchi, Plateau and Nasarawa had yearly Lassa fever incidence over the time frame considered.

If the mouth and nose of patients with infection are irrigated with antimicrobial solutions, this may help the patients by killing any coronavirus present at those sites. It may also reduce the risk of the active infection being passed to HCWs through droplet transmission or direct contact. However, the use of such antimicrobial solutions may be associated with harms related to the toxicity of the solutions themselves or alterations in the natural microbial flora of the mouth or nose. OBJECTIVES To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays administered to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection to both the patients and the HCWs caring for them. SEARCH METHODS Information Specialists from Cochrane ENT and Cochrane Oral Health searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 June 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: This is a question that urgently requires evidence, however at the present time we did not anticipate finding many completed RCTs. We therefore planned to include the following types of studies: randomised controlled trials (RCTs); quasi-RCTs; non-randomised controlled trials; prospective cohort studies; retrospective cohort studies; cross-sectional studies; controlled before-and-after studies. We set no minimum duration for the studies. We sought studies comparing antimicrobial mouthwash and/or nasal spray (alone or in combination) at any concentration, delivered with any frequency or dosage to suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: 1) RECOVERY* (www.recoverytrial.net) outcomes in patients (mortality; hospitalisation status; use of ventilation; use of renal dialysis or haemofiltration); 2) incidence of symptomatic or test-positive COVID-19 infection in HCWs; 3) significant adverse event: anosmia (or disturbance in sense of smell). Our secondary outcomes were: 4) change in COVID-19 viral load in patients; 5) COVID-19 viral content of aerosol (when present); 6) other adverse events: changes in microbiome in oral cavity, nasal cavity, oro- or nasopharynx; 7) other adverse events: allergy, irritation/burning of nasal, oral or oropharyngeal mucosa (e.g. erosions, ulcers, bleeding), long-term staining of mucous membranes or teeth, accidental ingestion. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS We found no completed studies to include in this review. We identified 16 ongoing studies (including 14 RCTs), which aim to enrol nearly 1250 participants. The interventions included in these trials are ArtemiC (artemisinin, curcumin, frankincense and vitamin C), Citrox (a bioflavonoid), cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorhexidine, chlorine dioxide, essential oils, hydrogen peroxide, hypertonic saline, Kerecis spray (omega 3 viruxide - containing neem oil and St John's wort), neem extract, nitric oxide releasing solution, povidone iodine and saline with baby shampoo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no studies for inclusion in this review. This is not surprising given the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19 infection. It is promising that the question posed in this review is being addressed by a number of RCTs and other studies. We are concerned that few of the ongoing studies specifically state that they will evaluate adverse events such as changes in the sense of smell or to the oral and nasal microbiota, and any consequences thereof. Very few interventions have large and dramatic effect sizes. If a positive treatment effect is demonstrated when studies are available for inclusion in this review, it may not be large. In these circumstances in particular it may be a challenge to weigh up the benefits against the harms if the latter are of uncertain frequency and severity.","output":"Antimicrobial mouthwashes (gargling) and nasal sprays administered to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection to improve patient outcomes and to protect healthcare workers treating them."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Although early warning scores were intended to simply identify patients in need of life-saving interventions, prediction has become their commonest metric. This review examined variation in the ability of the National Early Warning Scores (NEWS) in adult patients to predict absolute mortality at different times and cut-offs values. METHOD Following PRISMA guidelines, all studies reporting NEWS and NEWS2 providing enough information to fulfil the review's aims were included. RESULTS From 121 papers identified, the average area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) for mortality declined from 0.90 at 24-hours to 0.76 at 30-days. Studies with a low overall mortality had a higher AUC for 24-hour mortality, as did general ward patients compared to patients seen earlier in their treatment. 24-hour mortality increased from 1.8% for a NEWS 3 to 7.8% for NEWS 7. Although 24-hour mortality for NEWS <3 was only 0.07% these deaths accounted for 9% of all deaths within 24-hours; for NEWS <7 24-hour mortality was 0.23%, which accounted for 44% of all 24-hour deaths. Within 30-days of a NEWS recording 22% of all deaths occurred in patients with a NEWS <3, 52% in patients with a NEWS <5, and 75% in patient with a NEWS <7. CONCLUSION NEWS reliably identifies patients most and least likely to die within 24-hours, which is what it was designed to do. However, many patients identified to have a low risk of imminent death die within 30-days. NEWS mortality predictions beyond 24-hours are unreliable.","output":"A systematic review of the discrimination and absolute mortality predicted by the National Early Warning Scores according to different cut-off values and prediction windows."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a surge in demand for N95 or equivalent respirators that the global supply chain was unable to satisfy. This shortage in critical equipment has inspired research that addresses the immediate problems and has accelerated the development of the next-generation filtration media and respirators. This article provides a brief review of the most recent work with regard to face respirators and filtration media. We discuss filtration efficiency of the widely utilized cloth masks. Next, the sterilization of and reuse of existing N95 respirators to extend the existing stockpile is discussed. To expand near-term supplies, optimization of current manufacturing methods, such as melt-blown processes and electrospinning, has been explored. Future manufacturing methods have been investigated to address long-term supply shortages. Novel materials with antiviral and sterilizable properties with the ability for multiple reuses have been developed and will contribute to the development of the next generation of longer lasting multi-use N95 respirators. Finally, additively manufactured respirators are reviewed, which enable a rapidly deployable source of reusable respirators that can use any filtration fabric.

We herein present a case of DGI involving a Japanese man who latently had a complement 7 deficiency with compound heterozygous variants. PATIENT CONCERNS: A previously healthy 51-year-old Japanese man complained of sudden-onset high fever. Physical examination revealed various skin lesions including red papules on his trunk and extremities, an impetigo-like pustule on left forearm, and tendinitis of his right forefinger. DIAGNOSIS: Blood culture testing detected gram-negative cocci, which was confirmed to be Neisseria gonorrhoeae based on mass spectrometry and a pathogen-specific PCR test. INTERVENTIONS: Screening tests for underlying immunocompromised factors uncovered that complement activities (CH50) was undetectable. With a suspicion of a congenital complement deficiency, genetic analysis revealed rare single nucleotide variants in complement 7 (C7), including c.281-1G>T and a novel variant c.1454C>T (p.A485V). CH50 was normally recovered by adding purified human C7 to the patient's serum, supporting that the patient has C7 deficiency with compound heterozygous variants. OUTCOMES: Under a diagnosis of DGI, the patient underwent an antibiotic treatment with cefotaxime for a week and was discharged without any sequela. LESSONS: DGI is a rare sexually-transmitted infection that potentially induces systemic complications. Complement immunity usually defeats N. gonorrhoeae and prevents the organism from causing DGI. This case highlighted the importance of suspecting a complement deficiency when a person develops DGI.","output":"Disseminated gonococcal infection in a Japanese man with complement 7 deficiency with compound heterozygous variants: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficient production of gaseous oxygen used in many branches of industry to provide human life in anaerobic environments and in medicine (e.g., in the case of acute respiratory failure as one of COVID-19 complications) is challenging nowadays.

However, the health risks posed by sedentary behaviors are not well known. The mean daily duration of sedentary behavior is 8.3 hours among the Korean population and 7.7 hours among the American adult population. Sedentary lifestyles are spreading worldwide because of a lack of available spaces for exercise, increased occupational sedentary behaviors such as office work, and the increased penetration of television and video devices. Consequently, the associated health problems are on the rise. A sedentary lifestyle affects the human body through various mechanisms. Sedentary behaviors reduce lipoprotein lipase activity, muscle glucose, protein transporter activities, impair lipid metabolism, and diminish carbohydrate metabolism. Furthermore, it decreases cardiac output and systemic blood flow while activating the sympathetic nervous system, ultimately reducing insulin sensitivity and vascular function. It also alters the insulin-like growth factor axis and the circulation levels of sex hormones, which elevates the incidence of hormone-related cancers. Increased sedentary time impairs the gravitostat, the bodys weight homeostat, and weight gain, adiposity, and elevated chronic inflammation caused by sedentary behavior are risk factors for cancer. Sedentary behaviors have wide-ranging adverse impacts on the human body including increased all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, cancer risk, and risks of metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia; musculoskeletal disorders such as arthralgia and osteoporosis; depression; and, cognitive impairment.

has a tropism for the gastrointestinal (GI) tract The mechanism of COVID-induced GI symptoms is unknown, though direct viral infection of enterocytes and immunemediated injury have been hypothesized This study evaluated the prevalence of GI symptoms and the frequency at which these symptoms were the initial presentation in hospitalized COVID patients METHODS: A confidential database was created from a registry of patients admitted to an urban university hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and loss of appetite were identified A frequency analysis using SAS was performed to determine prevalence of GI symptoms and timing of presentation The study was IRB approved RESULTS: 283 patients were analyzed, with 37 46% having at least one GI symptom prior to admission to the hospital The most common symptom was nausea/vomiting (33 92%) followed by diarrhea (19 08%), loss of appetite (13 07%), and abdominal pain (3 53%) Two or more symptoms were seen in 13 43% of patients GI symptoms were cited as the initial presentation in 23 32% of cases Diarrhea was the most common initial symptom (11 66%) followed by

As little immunity had developed in most populations, re-establishing higher contact carried substantial risks, and therefore many locations began to see resurgence in COVID-19 cases. We present a Bayesian method to estimate the leeway to reopen, or alternatively the strength of change required to re-establish COVID-19 control, in a range of jurisdictions experiencing different COVID-19 epidemics. We estimated the timing and strength of initial control measures such as widespread distancing and compared the leeway jurisdictions had to reopen immediately after NPI measures to later estimates of leeway. Finally, we quantified risks associated with reopening and the likely burden of new cases due to introductions from other jurisdictions. We found widely varying leeway to reopen. After initial NPI measures took effect, some jurisdictions had substantial leeway (e.g., Japan, New Zealand, Germany) with > 0.99 probability that contact rates were below 80% of the threshold for epidemic growth. Others had little leeway (e.g., the United Kingdom, Washington State) and some had none (e.g., Sweden, California). For most such regions, increases in contact rate of 1.5-2 fold would have had high (> 0.7) probability of exceeding past peak sizes. Most jurisdictions experienced June-August trajectories consistent with our projections of contact rate increases of 1-2-fold. Under such relaxation scenarios for some regions, we projected up to a??100 additional cases if just one case were imported per week over six weeks, even between jurisdictions with comparable COVID-19 risk. We provide an R package covidseir to enable jurisdictions to estimate leeway and forecast cases under different future contact patterns. Estimates of leeway can establish a quantitative basis for decisions about reopening.

METHODS: The study included 142 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Huoshenshan Hospital from February to March 2020. Nursing measures in the treatment (n = 111) and control (n = 31) groups included integrated management care and usual care. The integrated management model had eight components: WeChat group management, early Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatment, emotional nursing, music therapy, observation of tongue coating and pulse, vital Qi strengthening, preventing recurrence after recovery, and an individualized follow-up scheme. The endpoints included clinical outcome, recovery time of clinical symptoms and signs, days of hospital stay, and survival without intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: Recovery time from clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and fatigue in the treatment group was shorter than that in the control group. Less time was required to show negative chest computed tomography findings in the treatment group than in the control group (13.0  2.8 vs. 16.7  3.9, p < .025).

A simple and inexpensive decontamination procedure that does not rely on the use of consumable supplies is dry heat incubation. Although reprocessing with this method has been shown to maintain the integrity of N95 respirators after multiple decontamination procedures, information on the ability of dry heat incubation to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 is largely unreported.

Furthermore, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on N95 respirators that remain at room temperature for at least five days. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that dry heat incubation procedures and ambient temperature for five days are not viable methods for inactivating SARS-CoV-2 on N95 respirators for potential reuse. We recommend that decontamination procedures being considered for the reuse of N95 respirators be validated at each individual site and that validation of the process must be thoroughly conducted using a defined protocol.","output":"COVID-19 global pandemic planning: Dry heat incubation and ambient temperature fail to consistently inactivate SARS-CoV-2 on N95 respirators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to show how full-time telemedicine adoption has impacted patient visit volume and attendance in a comprehensive metabolic and weight loss center. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Elective surgical practices have been profoundly impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a rapid increase in the utilization of telemedicine. The abrupt initiation of audio-video telehealth visits for all providers of a multidisciplinary clinic on March 19 2020 provided unique circumstances to assess the impact of telemedicine. METHODS: Data from the clinical booking system (new patient and follow-up visits) for all clinical provider types of the multidisciplinary metabolic center from the pre-telehealth, post-telehealth, and a 2019 comparative period were retrospectively reviewed and compared. The primary outcome is the change in patient visit volume for all clinical providers from before to after the initiation of telemedicine for both new patient, and follow-up visits. RESULTS: There were a total of 506 visits (162 new patient visits, and 344 follow-ups) in the pre-telehealth period, versus 413 visits (77 new patient visits, and 336 follow-ups) during the post-telehealth period. After telehealth implementation, new visits for surgeons decreased by 75%. Although follow-up visits decreased by 55.06% for surgeons, there was an increase by 27.36% for advanced practitioners. When surgeons were separated from other practitioners, their follow-up visit rate decrease by 55.06%, compared to a 16.08% increase for the group of all other practitioners (P < 0.0001). Dietitians experienced higher rates of absenteeism with new patient visits (10.00% vs 31.42%, P = 0.0128), whereas bariatricians experienced a decrease in follow-up visit absenteeism (33.33% vs 0%, P = 0.0093). CONCLUSIONS: Although new patient visit volume fell across the board, follow-up visits increased for certain nonsurgical providers. This provides a template for adoption of a multidisciplinary telehealth clinic in a post-pandemic world.","output":"The Impact of Telemedicine Adoption on a Multidisciplinary Bariatric Surgery Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) remains the leading cause of mortality globally1. The presence and extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, and CAC scoring has been shown to be more predictive of cardiovascular events than other traditional risk assessment scores2. Incidental coronary calcification can be detected and quantified on nongated CT chest scans covering the heart in the field of view3. This finding is typically not reported4 and hence an opportunity to optimise cardiovascular risk assessment and treatment is missed. Purpose:We sought to investigate whether patients presenting to our centre with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event had historical CT imaging demonstrating coronary artery calcification. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed case records for all patients referred to our centre for an invasive coronary angiogram following their first known admission with an ACS event. ACS were defined according to contemporary guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology. We reviewed a 3 month period prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (01/01/2019- 31/03/2019). The national imaging database was interrogated to identify previous CT imaging that includes the heart in the field of view. The presence of coronary calcification was confirmed and quantified using an ordinal scoring method previously described3. The clinical radiology reports for the scans were reviewed to determine the frequency of CAC being reported. Demographic information was collected from our electronic patient record including the presence of risk factors for IHD. Prescribed medication prior to admission was also recorded using the on-admission medicines reconciliation documented in the electronic patient record. Results: 385 patients with first presentation of ACS were identified. 75 (19%) had a prior non-gated CT chest imaging. The most common indication for CT was for investigation of possible malignancy. The mean interval from CT imaging to ACS admission was 36 months. CAC was present on 67 (89%) scans. The mean ordinal score was 4.04, corresponding to moderate CAC. The distribution of CAC by coronary artery revealed the majority of disease to involve the left anterior descending artery (Table 1). Only 12/67 (18%) of clinical radiology reports mentioned coronary calcification (Figure 1). Patients with CAC frequently had additional risk factors for IHD. Despite this only 42% were prescribed antiplatelet therapy, and only 45% prescribed a statin. Conclusions: A significant proportion of ACS admissions have evidence of CAC on historical CT scans. This finding is often not reported and the majority of patients with demonstrated coronary artery disease are not prescribed appropriate preventative therapies. Systematic reporting of this finding may have a significant impact on the prevention of acute cardiovascular events.

METHODS: We distributed provider (MD, PA or NP, nurse, navigator, and social worker) and survivor surveys through the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer in mid-October 2020. Survivor surveys were also disseminated through patient advocacy organizations. We included questions on demographics, experiences with telehealth, and preferences for future telehealth utilization. RESULTS: Among N = 607 providers and N = 539 cancer survivors, there was overwhelmingly more support from providers than from survivors for delivery of various types of survivorship care via telehealth and greater comfort with telehealth technologies. The only types of appointments deemed appropriate for survivorship care by both > 50% of providers and survivors were discussion of laboratory results or imaging, assessment and/or management of cancer treatment symptoms, nutrition counseling, and patient navigation support. Only a quarter of survivors reported increased access to health care services (25.5%), and 32.0% reported that they would use telehealth again. CONCLUSION: Although there have been drastic changes in technological capabilities and billing reimbursement structures for telehealth, there are still concerns around delivery of a broad range of survivorship care services via telehealth, particularly from the patient perspective. Still, offering telehealth services, where endorsed by providers and if available and acceptable to cancer survivors, may provide more efficient and accessible care following the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Cancer Provider and Survivor Experiences With Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airborne pathogens are small microbes that can cause a multitude of diseases (e.g., the common cold, flu, asthma, anthrax, tuberculosis, botulism, and pneumonia).

We calculated sensitivity and specificity and conducted a receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Of the 192 radiographs from patients with clinical pneumonia, 166 (86%) were classified as pneumonia on the hard copies. Sensitivity and specificity for identifying pneumonia were 89% and 73% for the camera and 90% and 65% for the digitizer.

In fact, for most HCV proteins high-resolution X-ray and NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance)-based structures have been established and profound insights into their biochemical and biological properties have been gained. One example is p7, a small hydrophobic protein that is dispensable for RNA replication, but crucial for the production and release of infectious HCV particles from infected cells. Owing to its ability to insert into membranes and assemble into homo-oligomeric complexes that function as minimalistic ion channels, HCV p7 is a member of the viroporin family. This review compiles the most recent findings related to the structure and dual pore/ion channel activity of p7 of different HCV genotypes. The alternative conformations and topologies proposed for HCV p7 in its monomeric and oligomeric state are described and discussed in detail. We also summarize the different roles p7 might play in the HCV replication cycle and highlight both the ion channel/pore-like function and the additional roles of p7 unrelated to its channel activity. Finally, we discuss possibilities to utilize viroporin inhibitors for antagonizing p7 ion channel/pore-like activity.","output":"Structural and Functional Properties of the Hepatitis C Virus p7 Viroporin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A country-wide \`lock-down' imposed on the 23red March 2020 in the UK had a significant impact on the UK's anthropogenic movements.

Salmonella enterica was detected from 29 samples [26 raccoons, 5.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.8C3.5%; three masked palm civets, 2.0%, 95% CI 4.2C0%]. Many of the isolates belonged to serovars that are commonly isolated from human gastroenteritis patients (e.g. S. Infantis, S. Typhimurium, and S. Thompson). The antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that 26.9 % of the isolates from raccoons were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, whereas none of the isolates from masked palm civets were resistant. Yersinia sp. was detected from 193 samples (177 raccoons, 38.6%, 95% CI 43.0C34.1%; 16 masked palm civets, 10.5%, 95% CI 15.3C5.6%). All virulent Yersinia strains belonged to Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, which was isolated from seven (1.5%, 95% CI 2.6C0.4%) raccoons and six (3.9%, 95% CI 7.0C0.8%) masked palm civets.

AIMS: The study aimed to explore the associations between the psychosocial impact of the COVID 19 pandemic in India, depressive symptomatology, anxiety/stress levels and disordered eating behaviours among adults aged between 18-35years. METHODS: This was a community based, cross sectional study conducted during August 2021. An online survey was circulated, wherein 110 adults participated. Questions about socio-demographic, lifestyle and eating behaviours were asked. Coronavirus Impact Scale (CIS), Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Three Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised 18-item version (TFEQ-R18) were used. Pearsons correlation analysis was used. RESULTS: A total of 101 valid responses were used for statistical analysis. 51% respondents reported mild change in daily routine while 49% reported stress and discord in their families due to the pandemic. Almost 10% of the respondents reported features suggestive of moderate depression and anxiety, while 1.9% reported bingeing on food almost every day in the past month. A positive association was observed between the scores of coronavirus impact scale and that of depression (r=0.366, p=0.000), anxiety (r=0.402, p=0.000), stress (r=0.416, p= 0.000) and uncontrolled eating (r=0.198, r=0.047).

METHODS: The antiviral activity of LH against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in Vero E6 cells using CPE and plaque reduction assay. The effect of LH on virion morphology was visualized under transmission electron microscope. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. RESULTS: LH significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells and markedly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IL-6, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels. Furthermore, LH treatment resulted in abnormal particle morphology of virion in cells.

Among Sri Lankan students, a unidimensional structure expressed good fit, invariance across different groups (gender, ethnicity, income, etc.), adequate criterion validity (strong correlation with motives of internet gaming, daily gaming duration, and sleep quality), and good reliability (alpha = 0.81). Males and online multiplayers expressed higher IGD levels, greater time spent gaming, and more endorsement of gaming motives (e.g., Social and Coping) than females and offline players. Across countries, the IGDS9-SF was invariant at the configural, metric, and scalar levels, albeit strict invariance was not maintained. The lowest and highest IGD levels were reported among Turkish and American respondents, respectively. In conclusion, the IGDS9-SF can be reliably used to measure IGD among Sri Lankan youth.

In March 2020, the Australian Government introduced telehealth services to ensure that people more vulnerable to COVID-19 do not delay routine care from their general practitioners. Evidence about patients experience of telehealth and its impact on patient care is scarce. This study aimed to investigate the experience with telehealth by Australian general practice patients at high risk of poor health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 30 patients from nine general practices in metropolitan Adelaide (May-June 2020). Participants were identified by their regular doctor as being at high risk of poor health outcomes. Interviews sought participants perspectives and experiences about telehealth services in the general practice setting during COVID-19, and the value of offering continued telehealth services post pandemic. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a coding structure developed based on deductive codes derived from the research questions and any additional concepts that emerged inductively from interviews. Results: : Participants expressed satisfaction with telehealth including convenient and timely access to general practice services. Yet, participants identified challenges including difficulties in expressing themselves and accessing physical exams. Prescription renewal, discussing test results and simple follow-ups were the most common reasons that telehealth was used. Telehealth was mainly via phone that better suited those with low digital literacy. Participants indicated that an existing doctor-patient relationship was important for telehealth services to be effective. Subjects believed that telehealth services should be continued but needed to be combined with opportunities for face-to-face consultations after the COVID-19 pandemic was over. Conclusions: : The expansion of telehealth supported access to general practice including chronic disease management during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In Kuwait, little is known about the epidemiological and clinical characterization of the virus and genetic characterization of the virus as a respiratory pathogen is unknown. AIM: This study aims to explore the molecular epidemiology and clinical features of HBoV isolates in patients with respiratory diseases. METHODOLOGY: Retrospectively, between 2018 and 2020, 5941 respiratory samples from patients with respiratory diseases were screened for respiratory viruses using multiplex real-time PCR. Samples that were positive for HBoV were then subjected to NP1 and VP1/PV2 phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: HBoV was detected in 1.9 % of the patients, with a peak incidence of infection among children <1 year old. Co-infection with other respiratory viruses was observed in 56.8 % of HBoV-positive patients. Fever, cough and respiratory distress were the most common clinical features of HBoV infection.

Results: The study included 3300 participants, with 1644 from Hubei and 1656 from outside Hubei. The rates of anxiety and depression among subjects from Hubei were 59.6% and 52.3%, while the corresponding rates for those outside Hubei were 44.4% and 46.6%. The scores of PSS, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 in Hubei were significantly higher than those in other areas (t = 3.823, 5.860, 2.211;P < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that among the participants from Hubei, the higher the educational background, the history of psychosis, the worse their physical health, the COVID-19 infected, isolated, and their families infected with the COVID-19, their mental health was relatively poor. In the participants outside Hubei, the more unstable their marriage status, the worse their physical health, isolated, and their families infected with the COVID-19, the worse their mental health level. Conclusions: The stress, anxiety, and depression of the public in Hubei are more prominent and the factors that affect their mental health are more complex.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are crucial mediators and regulators of host immunity and the role of human cell surface TLRs in SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory pathogenesis has been demonstrated recently. However, the functional significance of the human intracellular TLRs including TLR3, 7, 8, and 9 is yet unclear. Hitherto, the involvement of these intracellular TLRs in inducing pro-inflammatory responses in COVID-19 has been reported but the identity of the interacting viral RNA molecule(s) and the corresponding TLRs have not been explored. This study hopes to rationalize the comparative binding of the major SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs to the intracellular TLRs, considering the solvent-based force-fields operational in the cytosolic aqueous microenvironment that predominantly drives these interactions. Our in silico study on the binding of all mRNAs with the intracellular TLRs depicts that the mRNA of NSP10, S2, and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are possible virus-associated molecular patterns that bind to TLR3, TLR9, and TLR7, respectively, and trigger downstream cascade reactions. Intriguingly, binding of the viral mRNAs resulted in variable degrees of conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain of the TLRs ratifying the activation of the downstream inflammatory signaling cascade. Taken together, the current study is the maiden report to describe the role of TLR3, 7, and 9 in COVID-19 immunobiology and these could serve as useful targets for the conception of a therapeutic strategy against the pandemic.","output":"In silico analyses on the comparative sensing of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA by the intracellular TLRs of humans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is currently spreading all over the world, and causing enormous damage to health, economies, and daily lives.

Although the barriers to wider adoption of DP have been multifactorial, limited evidence of reliability has been a significant contributor. A meta-analysis to demonstrate the combined accuracy and reliability of DP is still lacking in the literature. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to review the published literature on the diagnostic use of DP and to synthesise a statistically pooled evidence on safety and reliability of DP for routine diagnosis (primary and secondary) in the context of validation process. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted through PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar for studies published between 2013 and August 2019. The search protocol identified all studies comparing DP with light microscopy (LM) reporting for diagnostic purposes, predominantly including H&E-stained slides. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool evidence from the studies. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were deemed eligible to be included in the review which examined a total of 10 410 histology samples (average sample size 176). For overall concordance (clinical concordance), the agreement percentage was 98.3% (95% CI 97.4 to 98.9) across 24 studies. A total of 546 major discordances were reported across 25 studies. Over half (57%) of these were related to assessment of nuclear atypia, grading of dysplasia and malignancy. These were followed by challenging diagnoses (26%) and identification of small objects (16%). CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis indicate equivalent performance of DP in comparison with LM for routine diagnosis.

These very legitimate questions are directly the consequence of the recent recognition of the fundamental role of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) in COVID-19 infection. Indeed, SARS COV2 utilizes ACE2 as a membrane receptor to enter target cells. Consequently, the putative impact of drugs modulating the renin-angiotensin system on the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection emerged. As a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase), ACE2 inactivates angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters its effects. Due to a different structure compared with ACE1, ACE2 is insensitive to ACEIs. In vitro, both ARBs and ACEi appear able to upregulate ACE2 tissue expression and activity but these results were not confirmed in Humans. The exact impact of both ARBs and ACEis on COVID-19 infection is definitively known and preliminary results are even in favor of a protective role confers by these drugs. Due to the crucial role of ACE2, some groups support the hypothesis that a modulation of ACE2 expression could represent a valuable therapeutic target could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection. So, studies are currently ongoing to test the impact of elevated ACE2 membrane expression, administration of ARB and infusion of soluble ACE2.

We demonstrated that plasmids encoding Cas9 and single-guide RNA (sgRNA), which are typically hard to transfect due to their large size (>9 kb), can be successfully transfected into HEK 293T cells via MVL5-based lipoplexes. In contrast, DOTAP-based lipoplexes resulted in very low transfection rates. MVL5-based lipoplexes presented the ability to escape from lysosomes, which may explain the superior transfection efficiency. Regarding gene editing, MVL5-based lipoplexes achieved promising GFP knockout levels, reaching rates of knockout superior to 35% for charge ratios (+/?) of 10. Despite the knockout efficiency being comparable to that of Lipofectamine 3000(?) commercial reagent, the non-specific gene knockout is more pronounced in MVL5-based formulations, probably resulting from the considerable cytotoxicity of these formulations.

Second, we have looked at viral translation efficiency by using the tRNA adaptation index. We find that integration of both interaction energy with ACE2 and translational efficiency explains animal infectivity. Humans are the top species in which SARS-CoV-2 is both efficiently translated as well as optimally interacting with ACE2.

The presence of a cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) might be considered a contraindication for neurostimulators due to the possible interaction between the two devices. The purpose of this study is to report the feasibility and safety of concomitant use of neurostimulators and CIED, and to review surgical and clinical precautions needed to avoid possible interference between the two systems. METHODS A retrospective institutional review board approved chart review of six patients having both a neurostimulator(s) and a CIED was performed. Diagnosis included Parkinson's disease (two) and intractable pain (four). All implantable cardiac devices were set on bipolar sensing mode and bipolar stimulation was chosen for the neurostimulators. In general, both systems were implanted at sites seven inches apart. Electrocardiogram monitoring was observed throughout implantation. Patients were followed up for a mean period of 31.7 months (ranging from 14 to 67 months). An extensive chart review was done and cases from previous reports were compiled. RESULTS In all six patients, no acute events occurred during surgery with no interaction or interference noted during implantation of the second device. Subsequent follow-up visits continued to exhibit a lack of interference between the two systems, including normal electrocardiogram studies. Both systems were noted to function at optimal levels.

Concentrations of NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), PM10, O3 (ozone) and Ox (total oxidant) were selected from five measurement sites in Graz and were set as target variables for random forest regression models to predict their expected values during the city's lockdown period. The true vs. expected difference is presented here as an indicator of true pollution during the lockdown. The machine learning models showed a high level of generalization for predicting the concentrations. Therefore, the approach was suitable for analyzing reductions in pollution concentrations. Results on the validation set showed very good performance for Ox and NO2 when compared to PM10 and O3. The analysis indicated that the citys average concentration reductions for the lockdown period were: -36.9 to -41.6%, and -6.6 to -14.2% for NO2 and PM10, respectively. However, an increase of 11.6 to 33.8% for O3 was estimated. The reduction in pollutant concentration, especially NO2 can be explained by significant drops in traffic-flows during the lockdown period (-51.6 to -43.9%). The results presented give a real-world example of what pollutant concentration reductions can be achieved by reducing traffic-flows and other economic activities.","output":"Understanding the True Effects of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Air Pollution by Means of Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated the level of willingness for COVID-19 vaccination in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Data were collected between 24 August 2020 and 8 September 2020 through an online survey. A total of 4131 responses were included; mean age of respondents was 35 years (standard deviation: 11.5); 68.4% were females; 71% had elementary or secondary school education. One fourth (24.1%) were convinced that COVID-19 did not exist. Overall, 2310 (55.9%) indicated they were willing to be vaccinated. In a multivariable regression model, belonging to the middle and high-income category (OR = 1.85, CI: 1.46C2.35 and OR = 2.91, CI: 2.15C3.93, respectively), being tested for COVID-19 (OR = 4.71, CI: 3.62C6.12; p < 0.001), COVID-19 community vaccine acceptance (OR = 14.45, CI: 2.91C71.65; p = 0.001) and acknowledging the existence of COVID-19 (OR = 6.04, CI: 4.42C8.23; p < 0.001) were associated with an increased willingness to be vaccinated. Being a healthcare worker was associated with a decreased willingness for vaccination (OR = 0.46, CI: 0.36C0.58; p < 0.001). In conclusion, the current willingness for COVID-19 vaccination among citizens of the DRC is too low to dramatically decrease community transmission.

Recommendations and guidelines on the topic are published in an increasing rate. The concept aims at using an evidence-based approach to rationalize transfusion practices by optimizing the patients red blood cell mass in the pre-, intra- and postoperative periods. However, elegant as a concept, the implementation of a PBM program on an institutional level or even in a single surgical discipline like cardiac surgery, can be easier said than done.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Postmortem specimens of lower airway secretions from patients who died of asthma (fatal asthma [n=10]), asthmatic patients who died of other causes (n=4) and nonasthma controls (n=6) underwent PCR for nine common respiratory viruses. The prevalence of each virus was compared among the three groups. RESULTS PCR was positive for at least one virus in 19 of 20 cases, and multiple viruses were detected in 14 of 20 cases. The prevalence of each virus was similar in the three groups studied. CONCLUSIONS In fatal asthma, lower airway secretions do not show a specific pattern of viral nucleic acid.

Few reports of alexias and agraphias in the Spanish language are currently available. AIMS To analyse the clinical manifestations of alexias and agraphias in Spanish, and the effect of demographic variables. METHODS & PROCEDURES Spanish versions of the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) and Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) were used for language assessment. Lesion localization was obtained by using computed axial tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The final sample included 200 patients: 195 (97.5%) right-handed and five (2.5%) left-handed; 119 men and 81 women with a mean age of 57.37 years (SD = 15.56), education of 13.52 years (SD = 4.08), and mean time post-onset of 6.58 months (SD = 12.94). Using the WAB, four quotients were calculated: aphasia quotient (AQ), reading-writing quotient (RWQ), language quotient (LQ) and cortical quotient (CQ). OUTCOMES & RESULTS The types of aphasia were: global = 11 patients (5.5%), Broca = 31 (15.5%), Wernicke = 30 (15.0%), conduction = 22 (11.0%), transcortical sensory = 17 (8.5%), transcortical motor = 3 (1.5%), amnesic or anomic = 54 (27.0%) and mixed non-fluent = 32 (16.0%). The degree of oral and written language impairment differed across the various aphasia types. Most severe reading and writing difficulties were found in global, mixed non-fluent and transcortical motor aphasia; fewer difficulties were observed in amnesic, Broca and conduction aphasia. The severity of the written language impairments paralleled the severity of the oral language disturbances. Age negatively, while schooling positively, correlated with the scores in reading and writing tests. No effect of sex and time since onset was found. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS In Spanish-speaking aphasia patients, difficulties in reading and writing are similar to oral language difficulties. This similarity of performance is mostly based on severity rather than the participants' patterns of errors.

Qatar has a comprehensive surveillance system which includes influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and identification of the influenza and non-influenza viruses causing the infections. Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the viruses causing acute respiratory illness in Qatar during 2013C2016. Methodology: Respiratory samples were collected from selected patients using WHO standard case definitions with ILI at the sentinel primary health care centre sites of the National Influenza Centre and patients with SARI admitted to sentinel hospitals. Nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs were collected from eligible patients (standardized case definitions) for the period 2013C2016. Samples were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction at the National Influenza Centre, which tests for 22 types and subtypes of virus. Findings: In the study period, 43 106 patients were included and tested, 29 626 (68.7%) of whom tested positive for infection. Out of these, 8 829 (29.8%) were influenza positive, 6 655 (75.4%) of whom were influenza A and 2 174 (24.6%) were influenza B. Sub-typing of influenza A showed 3 721 (55.9%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Other respiratory viruses isolated included rhinovirus 4 626 (15.6%), respiratory syncytial virus 3 259 (11.0%), coronaviruses 1 824 (6.2%), adenovirus 1 689 (5.7%), parainfluenza virus 1 645 (5.6%), human metapneumovirus 1 357 (4.6%) Mycoplasma pneumoniae 1 053 (3.6%), bocavirus 874 (3.0%) and parechovirus 178 (0.6%). Seasonal variation was observed for influenza with the peak season being from October to March with an unexpected surge of cases seen in October to December 2016. Conclusions: Influenza viruses A and B are responsible for the majority of the ILI and SARI cases reported in Qatar; however many other viruses also contribute to the burden of respiratory illness in the country.

Many institutions have experienced changes in rostering practices and redeployment of trainees to non-surgical services. Examinations, study days, courses, and conferences have been cancelled. These changes have the potential to significantly impact the education and training of surgical trainees. AIM: To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on training, educational, and operative experiences of Irish surgical trainees. METHODS: Surgical trainees were surveyed anonymously regarding changes in working and educational practices since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March 2020. The survey was circulated in May 2020 to both core and higher RCSI surgical trainees, when restrictions were at level five. Questions included previous and current access to operative sessions as well as operative cases, previous and current educational activities, access to senior-led training, and access to simulation-/practical-based training methods. A repeat survey was carried out in October 2020 when restrictions were at level two. RESULTS: Overall, primary and secondary survey response rates were 29% (n = 98/340) and 19.1% (n = 65/340), respectively. At the time of circulation of the second survey, the number of operative sessions attended and cases performed had significantly improved to numbers experienced pre-pandemic (p < 0.0001). Exposure to formal teaching and education sessions returned to pre-COVID levels (p < 0.0001). Initially, 23% of trainees had an examination cancelled; 53% of these trainees have subsequently sat these examinations. Of note 27.7% had courses cancelled, and 97% of these had not been rescheduled. CONCLUSION: Surgical training and education have been significantly impacted in light of COVID-19. This is likely to continue to fluctuate in line with subsequent waves.

Social isolation obligation, restricted working shifts, and curfews posed unprecedented challenges for the population. Social isolation, boredom, and financial problems have been shown to stress peoples' mental health in previous comparable pandemics and even in regular situations. Individuals with a mental illness may particularly be at risk due to an already instable mental health status. While research mainly focused on the pandemic's impact on somatic health care and risk group patients, psychological obstacles caused by legal restrictions and their impact on already mentally affected individuals have been discussed, but so far only scarcely been investigated in a large sample. For this study, 12,028 people completed an online-survey during that time in Germany, when the COVID-19 outbreak gained momentum with a surge in cases and death rates as well as a lockdown of the public life. Generalized anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-2), distress (distress thermometer) and COVID-19-specific items, especially COVID-19-related fear, were assessed in healthy individuals, patients suffering from mental illnesses, and in patients with chronic somatic diseases, known to be at risk for an unfavorable course of COVID-19. Results show that the COVID-19-pandemic significantly worsens psychometric scores throughout the population - individuals with already heightened levels, like people with mental illnesses now reach concerning levels. Surprisingly, even though generalized anxiety, depressive symptoms, and perceived distress are elevated in individuals with mental illness, these individuals seem to be less affected by explicit COVID-19-related fear, than the general population or individuals with chronic somatic diseases. This study thus objectively quantifies the psychological impact of COVID-19 in a large sample and provides evidence for not only the public, but also critically affected individuals with a mental illness.","output":"Severely increased generalized anxiety, but not COVID-19-related fear in individuals with mental illnesses: A population based cross-sectional study in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES This study examined (a) the impact of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on engagement in activity participation in persons with acquired brain injury (ABI); and (b) whether changes in activity participation during the pandemic were associated participants' health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

The expression levels of ROS, NO and BH4 in HUVECs after treatment were detected by respective ELISA kits. The expression of p-eNOS, eNOS, NOX4, bcl2, bax, cleaved-caspase3, caspase3, p-PI3K, p-AKT, PI3K and AKT in HUVECs was detected by Western blot analysis. The apoptosis of HUVECs after treatment was analyzed by TUNEL assay. Results The viability of HUVECs was not obviously changed when treated with different concentrations and times of EGCG. The expression of ROS, NOX4 and eNOS (monomer) was increased, while the expression of NO, p-eNOS, eNOS, BH4 and eNOS (dimer) was decreased in HUVECs of HG group. EGCG could gradually reverse the effect of high glucose on HG-treated HUVECs from 10 M to 50 M. The apoptosis of HUVECs was also increased in HG group and EGCG decreased the apoptosis of HUVECs. PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was suppressed in HG-treated HUVECs while activated by EGCG treatment. When the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was inhibited by LY294002 (AKT inhibitor), the protective effect of EGCG on HG-treated HUVECs was weakened.

While Gold Standard assessments are commonly used in research centers, these methods are time consuming, require extensive training, and are not practical in most clinical settings or in community-based research projects. Many of these methods require an informant (e.g., spouse, adult child) to provide ratings of the patients cognitive and functional abilities. A patient-reported outcome that captures the presence of cognitive impairment and corresponds to Gold Standard assessments could improve case ascertainment, clinical care, and recruitment into clinical research. We tested the patient version of the Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS) as a patient-reported outcome to detect MCI and ADRD. METHODS: The patient QDRS was validated in a sample of 261 consecutive patient-caregiver dyads compared with the informant version of the QDRS, the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), neuropsychological tests, and Gold Standard measures of function, behavior, and mood. Psychometric properties including item variability, floor and ceiling effects, construct, concurrent, and known-groups validity, and internal consistency were determined. RESULTS: The patient QDRS strongly correlated with Gold Standard measures of cognition, function, mood, behavior, and global staging methods (p-values < .001) and had strong psychometric properties with excellent data quality and internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.923, 95%CI:0.91C0.94). The patient QDRS had excellent agreement with the informant QDRS, the CDR and its sum of boxes (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients: 9.781C0.876).

DISCUSSION: The patient QDRS validly and reliably differentiates individuals with and without cognitive impairment and can be completed by patients through all stages of dementia. The patient QDRS is highly correlated with Gold Standard measures of cognitive, function, behavior, and global staging. The patient QDRS provides a rapid method to screen patients for MCI and ADRD in clinical practice, determine study eligibility, improve case ascertainment in community studies.","output":"Using a patient-reported outcome to improve detection of cognitive impairment and dementia: The patient version of the Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is believed that weather conditions such as temperature and humidity have effects on COVID-19 transmission.

Recent research suggests minimum unit pricing (MUP) for alcohol would be an effective policy, but high levels of income inequality raise concerns about equity impacts. This paper quantifies the equity impact of MUP on household health and finances in rich and poor drinkers in South Africa. METHODS: We draw from extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) methods and an epidemiological policy appraisal model of MUP for South Africa to simulate the equity impact of a ZAR 10 MUP over a 20-year time horizon. We estimate the impact across wealth quintiles on: (i) alcohol consumption and expenditures; (ii) mortality; (iii) government healthcare cost savings; (iv) reductions in cases of catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) and household savings linked to reduced health-related workplace absence. RESULTS: We estimate MUP would reduce consumption more among the poorest than the richest drinkers. Expenditure would increase by ZAR 353 000 million (1 US$=13.2 ZAR), the poorest contributing 13% and the richest 28% of the increase, although this remains regressive compared with mean income. Of the 22 600 deaths averted, 56% accrue to the bottom two quintiles; government healthcare cost savings would be substantial (ZAR 3.9 billion). Cases of CHE averted would be 564 700, 46% among the poorest two quintiles. Indirect cost savings amount to ZAR 51.1 billion.

Risk factors for bleeding complications in veno-venous (V-V) ECLS applied for respiratory support have been poorly investigated. We aim to develop and internally validate a prediction model to calculate the risk for bleeding complications in adult patients receiving V-V ECLS support. METHODS: Data from adult patients reported to the extracorporeal life support organization (ELSO) registry between the years 2010 and 2020 were analyzed. The primary outcome was bleeding complications recorded during V-V ECLS. Multivariable logistic regression with backward stepwise elimination was used to develop the predictive model. The performance of the model was tested by discriminative ability and calibration with receiver operating characteristic curves and visual inspection of the calibration plot. RESULTS: In total, 18 658 adult patients were included, of which 3 933 (21.1%) developed bleeding complications.

Median follow-up after vaccination was 79 [57C96]days. No major adverse event was reported and there was no difference in the in adverse events incidence between ACHD patients and the control group. One patient was diagnosed with acute pericarditis. There were two unrelated deaths during follow-up. Three (1.5%)vaccinated patients tested positive for COVID-19. Antispike IgG titre, available in 159 (76%)patients, was 1334 [600C3401]BAU/ml, not significantly different from the control group (p = 0.2). One patient with Fontan failure was seronegative. Advanced physiological stage was related to lower antibody response, independently from previous viral exposure (p < 0.0001). Fourteen percent refused COVID-19 vaccination at our institution. However, 50% of vaccinated patients declared to have been influenced by the discussion with the ACHD cardiologist and 66% of those vaccinated in situ reported that undergoing COVID-19 vaccination at the ACHD centre made they feel safer. Conclusion COVID-19 vaccines appear safe in ACHD with satisfactory immunogenicity. However, most vulnerable patients showed lower antibody response. ACHD team may have a key role in vaccine acceptance.

However, their synergistic mechanism of action remains unclear. Herein, an in vitro fermentation model was constructed to examine the synergistic effects of Bifidobacterium lactis BL-99 and fructooligosaccharide (FOS) on the regulation of intestinal microbiota from a population with constipation. The utilization of FOS was promoted by BL-99, and the increase rate being 22.33%. Relative to the BL-99 and the FOS groups, the BL-99_FOS group showed a highly significant increase in acetic acid content (P < 0.01) and a marked decrease in CO2 and H2S contents (P < 0.01) in the fermentation broth. In addition, the BL-99_FOS combination significantly changed the structure of the intestinal microbiota, enhanced the relative abundances of beneficial bacteria that relieved constipation, including Bifidobacterium, Fecalibacterium, Lactobacillus, Subdoligranulum, and Blautia, and decreased those of the harmful bacteria, including Bilophila and Escherichia-Shigella. These findings suggested that BL-99 and FOS synergistically regulated the composition and structure of the intestinal microbiota from the population with constipation and increased acetic acid and decreased CO2 and H2S levels, thereby providing a theoretical basis for the application of synbiotics.","output":"In vitro Study of Bifidobacterium lactis BL-99 With Fructooligosaccharide Synbiotics Effected on the Intestinal Microbiota"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tourism activities are considered, among others, the backbone of the local economies However, tourism activities lead to adverse environmental impacts, especially in coastal zones Coastal areas are considered and recognized as of strategic importance due to the fact that several activities take place, from leisure to business At the same time, coastal areas are under pressure from tourist activities, and the waste generated is a very serious issue Therefore, there are limited studies related to the environmental dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic in the coastal environment This paper provides answers to the hypothesis that the pandemic lockdown scenario would improve environmental performance due to reduced usage and, therefore, waste, taking into account specific key performance indicators (KPIs) as these KPIs are used to evaluate the performance of an area The results showed that the study area improved, as did the selected KPIs, i e , clean coast index (CCI), waste accumulation rate (WAR), and waste accumulation index (WAI) Additionally, according to the final results, the concentration of micro-, meso- and macroplastics on the beach reduced, and the main issues remained the solutions on cigarette butts, straws, and other plastic containers Furthermore, the final results are considered very useful to local authorities, stakeholders, consultants, policymakers, and any other competent authorities, to reschedule their waste management strategies, to improve waste infrastructures and their level of services (LOS), as well as, to suggest frequent awareness-raising activities to their visitors on how to protect the coastal environment, taking into account a pandemic scenario, as well as, the policy alternative impacts on EU coastal zones 2000C2050","output":"Measuring the Level of Environmental Performance on Coastal Environment before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study from Cyprus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has advanced in two decades from a seminal idea to a practically applicable inference tool for simulator-based statistical models, which are becoming increasingly popular in many research domains.

METHODS: Long-term care pharmacy data from 1,944 U.S. NHs were used to evaluate trends in prescribing of antibiotics and drugs that were investigated for COVID-19 treatment, including hydroxychloroquine, famotidine, and dexamethasone. To account for seasonal variability in antibiotic prescribing and decreased NH occupancy during the pandemic, monthly prevalence of residents with a prescription dispensed per 1,000 residents serviced was calculated from January - October and compared as relative percent change from 2019 to 2020. RESULTS: In April 2020, prescribing was significantly higher in NHs for drugs investigated for COVID-19 treatment than 2019; including hydroxychloroquine (+563%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.87, 7.48) and azithromycin (+150%, 95% CI 2.37, 2.63). Ceftriaxone prescribing also increased (+43%, 95% CI 1.34, 1.54). Prescribing of dexamethasone was 36% lower in April (95% CI 0.55, 0.73) and 303% higher in July (95% CI 3.66, 4.45). Although azithromycin and ceftriaxone prescribing increased, total antibiotic prescribing among residents was lower from May (-5%, 95% CI 0.94, 0.97) through October (-4%, 95% CI 0.94, 0.97) in 2020 compared to 2019. CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, large numbers of residents were prescribed drugs investigated for COVID-19 treatment, and an increase in prescribing of antibiotics commonly used for respiratory infections was observed. Prescribing of these drugs may increase the risk of adverse events, without providing clear benefits.

From this expertise, we were keen to recognize the numerous venous-, arterial-, microvascular-, and macrovascular thrombotic events and immunologic disorders are caused by severe, acute-respiratory-syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. With this offering, we explore the evolutionary connections that place platelets at the center of hemostasis, immunity, and adaptive phylogeny. Coevolutionary changes have also occurred in vertebrate viruses and their vertebrate hosts that reflect their respective evolutionary interactions. As mammals adapted from aquatic to terrestrial life and the heavy blood loss associated with placentalization-based live birth, platelets evolved phylogenetically from thrombocytes toward higher megakaryocyte-blebbing-based production rates and the lack of nuclei. With no nuclei and robust RNA synthesis, this adaptation may have influenced viral replication to become less efficient after virus particles are engulfed. Human platelets express numerous receptors that bind viral particles, which developed from archetypal origins to initiate aggregation and exocytic-release of thrombo-, immuno-, angiogenic-, growth-, and repair-stimulatory granule contents. Whether by direct, evolutionary, selective pressure, or not, these responses may help to contain virus spread, attract immune cells for eradication, and stimulate angiogenesis, growth, and wound repair after viral damage. Because mammalian and marsupial platelets became smaller and more plate-like their biophysical properties improved in function, which facilitated distribution near vessel walls in fluid-shear fields. This adaptation increased the probability that platelets could then interact with and engulf shedding virus particles. Platelets also generate circulating microvesicles that increase membrane surface-area encounters and mark viral targets. In order to match virus-production rates, billions of platelets are generated and turned over per day to continually provide active defenses and adaptation to suppress the spectrum of evolving threats like SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Of vascular defense, hemostasis, cancer, and platelet biology: an evolutionary perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pressure on the US health care system has been increasing due to a combination of aging populations, rising health care expenditures, and most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses to this pressure are hindered in part by reliance on a limited supply of highly trained health care professionals, creating a need for scalable technological solutions. Digital symptom checkers are artificial intelligenceCsupported software tools that use a conversational chatbot format to support rapid diagnosis and consistent triage. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new attention to these tools due to the need to avoid face-to-face contact and preserve urgent care capacity. However, evidence-based deployment of these chatbots requires an understanding of user demographics and associated triage recommendations generated by a large general population. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluate the user demographics and levels of triage acuity provided by a symptom checker chatbot deployed in partnership with a large integrated health system in the United States. METHODS: This population-based descriptive study included all web-based symptom assessments completed on the website and patient portal of the Sutter Health system (24 hospitals in Northern California) from April 24, 2019, to February 1, 2020. User demographics were compared to relevant US Census population data. RESULTS: A total of 26,646 symptom assessments were completed during the study period. Most assessments (17,816/26,646, 66.9%) were completed by female users. The mean user age was 34.3 years (SD 14.4 years), compared to a median age of 37.3 years of the general population. The most common initial symptom was abdominal pain (2060/26,646, 7.7%). A substantial number of assessments (12,357/26,646, 46.4%) were completed outside of typical physician office hours. Most users were advised to seek medical care on the same day (7299/26,646, 27.4%) or within 2-3 days (6301/26,646, 23.6%). Over a quarter of the assessments indicated a high degree of urgency (7723/26,646, 29.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Users of the symptom checker chatbot were broadly representative of our patient population, although they skewed toward younger and female users. The triage recommendations were comparable to those of nurse-staffed telephone triage lines. Although the emergence of COVID-19 has increased the interest in remote medical assessment tools, it is important to take an evidence-based approach to their deployment.","output":"Use Characteristics and Triage Acuity of a Digital Symptom Checker in a Large Integrated Health System: Population-Based Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction et but de ltude La photobiomodulation est recommande pour prvenir la mucite orale au cours du cancer de la tte et du cou trait par irradiation et a montr des rsultats encourageants sur la radiodermite au cours du cancer du sein.

Despite intensive research into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, the evolutionary history of its agent SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear, which is vital to control the pandemic and prevent another round of outbreak. Coronaviruses are highly recombinogenic, which are not well handled with alignment-based method. In addition, deletions have been found in the genomes of several SARS-CoV-2, which cannot be resolved with current phylogenetic methods. Therefore, the k-mer natural vector is proposed to explore hosts and transmission traits for SARS-CoV-2 using strict phylogenetic reconstruction. SARS-CoV-2 clustering with bat-origin coronaviruses strongly suggests bats to be the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2. By building bat-to-human transmission route, pangolin is identified as an intermediate host, and civet is predicted as a possible candidate. We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes cross-species recombination between bat and pangolin coronaviruses.

Background: The current concept of caries management is based on a biological approach. When it comes to children with early childhood caries, managing their behavior along with effective and comprehensive caries management is necessary for which an algorithm-based approach is discussed. Silver diamine fluoride acts as a tertiary preventive procedure that reduces the negative consequences of established disease (cavity) and restores, thus improving the childs quality of life. It is a magic bullet that comprises antibacterial actions of silver and remineralizing effects of highly concentrated fluoride. Review results: Previous systematic reviews have reported the success of SDF in arresting caries in primary teeth and root caries in adults. Caries removal is not a prerequisite;therefore, SDF application is suitable when other modalities of caries management are unavailable or impractical. Apart from staining the arrested lesion black, no significant complication of SDF use among children was reported. Conclusion: Even though the black staining was unappealing, a significant number of parents chose SDF over advanced pharmacological behavior management techniques and it is really the magic alternative in children as it supports the contemporary biological approach for caries management. Clinical significance: In such times of the COVID-19 pandemic, SDF allows the interruption of aerosol-generating procedures and serves as interim treatment procedure to arrest dentin caries to prevent development of pulpitis which further requires intervention using aerotor.

Recent findings: The annual incidence of KD in Europe is about 10C15 per 100,000 children under 5 years old and seems to be relatively stable over time and space. Demographic characteristics are in line with those in other countries of the world, with a higher incidence in children from Asia and possibly North African origin. All studies performed across Europe found a coherent seasonal distribution of KD onset peaking from winter to early spring. This seasonal distribution was consistent over the years and suggests a climate-related environmental trigger. The occurrence of peaks during pandemics, microbiological findings and a possible link with southerly winds support the hypothesis of an airborne infectious agent. Neither other airborne agents such as pollutants or pollens nor urbanization and industrialization seem to have major effect on the etiology. Conclusion: Discrepancies in KD incidence rates across studies were due more to methodological differences, variation in definitions and awareness of the disease than a real increase in incidence. Genetic predisposition is undeniable in KD, but environmental factors seem to play a pivotal role.

Planned RT starts were implemented in 90%, 100%, 92%, 90%, and 75% of priority level 1-5 patients. Although 17% had a deferred start, the median time to start of adjuvant RT and overall treatment times were maintained. Concurrent chemotherapy was administered in 89% of those eligible. Systemic therapy was administered to 84.5% of planned patients. However, 33% and 57% of curative and palliative patients had modifications in cycle duration or deferrals. The patients inability to come was the most common reason for RT or ST deviation. Factors independently associated with a change from pre-COVID practice was priority-level allocation for RT and age and palliative intent for systemic therapy. CONCLUSION: Despite significant access limitations, a planned priority-based system of delivery of treatment could be implemented.","output":"Prioritizing Delivery of Cancer Treatment During a COVID-19 Lockdown: The Experience of a Clinical Oncology Service in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nasopharyngeal swabs have historically been considered the preferred specimen type for detection of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

In COVID\\\\19 patients, Interleukin (IL)\\\\6 levels are significantly elevated. Blocking IL\\\\6 preliminary resulted in the improvement of this hyperinflammatory state. It is unknown which patients could require higher doses of tocilizumab to get out of the cytokine storm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty\\\\four patients affected by COVID\\\\19 pneumonia were included. All the patients underwent tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously and were tested for serum IL\\\\6 24\\\\48 hours before and 12\\\\48 hours after tocilizumab infusion. Comparisons between survivors and non\\\\survivors were performed. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were discharged, while six patients died, with no clinical or laboratory differences between the two groups at baseline. IL\\\\6 was not different at baseline (p=0.41), while 24\\\\48h post\\\\tocilizumab IL\\\\6 serum levels were significantly higher in non\\\\survivors than in survivors [2398.5 (430.5\\\\9372) pg/mL vs 290.5 (58.5\\\\1305.5) pg/mL, p=0.022)].

Early results of the MonarchE trial investigating the addition of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib to standard adjuvant endocrine therapy indicated a lower recurrence rate in the combination group in a high-risk population of patients with early stage hormone receptor (HR)-positive/HER2-negative BC. In contrast, the PALLAS study evaluating adjuvant palbociclib could not confirm these results. Subtle differences in the respective trial populations, a higher discontinuation rate in PALLAS, or substance-specific differences may be responsible. In HER2-positive early stage BC, long-term results of the ADAPT-TP trial support the notion that chemotherapy-free treatment may be possible in a subset of patients with favourable response to HER2-directed therapy without compromising long-term outcome. The phase III IMpassion031 trial evaluated the addition of atezolizumab to neoadjuvant anthracycline/taxane-containing chemotherapy in triple-negative BC (TNBC). A significant improvement in terms of pathologic complete remission rate was observed but data concerning long-term outcome must be awaited. Final overall survival (OS) analysis of IMpassion130 confirmed the clinically relevant OS improvement observed with the addition of atezolizumab to first-line nab-paclitaxel in metastatic PD-L1 positive TNBC. In contrast, no benefit was observed with the addition of atezolizumab to solvent-based paclitaxel in a similar population. This contradiction is commonly explained by the need for corticosteroid co-medication with conventional paclitaxel, but the exact reason remains poorly understood. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have been successfully established in HER2-positive breast cancer; in TNBC, the phase III ASCENT trial compared the ADC sacituzumab govitecan with chemotherapy by physician's choice in pretreated metastatic patients. A significant improvement in terms of progression-free survival and OS was observed rendering this drug a potential novel standard in this patient population.","output":"ESMO 2020: highlights in breast cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current global outbreak of COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 is an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.

Using multivariate regressions, we explored the effects of three sets of factors on Chinese citizens compliance to pandemic mitigation rules: negative emotions during the pandemic, peer modeling of compliance, and the prevalence of formal social control in the forms of police presence and performance. Our regression analyses suggest that all three mechanisms influence Chinese citizens level of compliance with counter-pandemic rules.

Some of them are too localized to indicate a general trend of the pandemic while some others have established transient correlations only. Hence, in this study, taking Bangladesh as a case, a 4P model has been proposed based on four probabilities (4P) which have been found to be true for all affected countries. Efficiency scores have been estimated from survey analysis not only for governing authorities on managing the situation (P(G)) but also for the compliance of the citizens ((P(P)). Since immune responses to a specific pathogen can vary from person to person, the probability of a person getting infected ((P(I)) after being exposed has also been estimated. And the vital one is the probability of test positivity ((P(T)) which is a strong indicator of how effectively the infected people are diagnosed and isolated from the rest of the group that affects the rate of growth. All the four parameters have been fitted in a non-linear exponential model that partly updates itself periodically with everyday facts.

In pursuit of this goal and building on recently available level I evidence of benefit from endovascular therapy (ET) in large vessel occlusion stroke, STAIR IX consensus recommendations were developed that outline priorities for future research in ET. METHODS Three key directions for advancing the field were identified: (1) development of systems of care for ET in large vessel occlusion stroke, (2) development of therapeutic approaches adjunctive to ET, and (3) exploring clinical benefit of ET in patient population insufficiently studied in recent trials. Methodological issues such as optimal trial design and outcome measures have also been addressed. RESULTS Development of systems of care strategies should be geared both toward ensuring broad access to ET for eligible patients and toward shortening time to reperfusion to the minimum possible. Adjunctive therapy development includes neuroprotective approaches, adjuvant microcirculatory/collateral enhancing strategies, and periprocedural management. Future research priorities seeking to expand the eligible patient population are to determine benefit of ET in patients presenting beyond conventional time windows, in patients with large baseline ischemic core lesions, and in other important subgroups.

Data are needed on the serial use of homologous boosters (same as the primary vaccine) and heterologous boosters (different from the primary vaccine) in fully vaccinated recipients. METHODS: In this phase 1C2, open-label clinical trial conducted at 10 sites in the United States, adults who had completed a Covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier and had no reported history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection received a booster injection with one of three vaccines: mRNA-1273 (Moderna) at a dose of 100 g, Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & JohnsonCJanssen) at a dose of 510(10) virus particles, or BNT162b2 (PfizerCBioNTech) at a dose of 30 g. The primary end points were safety, reactogenicity, and humoral immunogenicity on trial days 15 and 29. RESULTS: Of the 458 participants who were enrolled in the trial, 154 received mRNA-1273, 150 received Ad26.COV2.S, and 153 received BNT162b2 as booster vaccines; 1 participant did not receive the assigned vaccine. Reactogenicity was similar to that reported for the primary series. More than half the recipients reported having injection-site pain, malaise, headache, or myalgia. For all combinations, antibody neutralizing titers against a SARS-CoV-2 D614G pseudovirus increased by a factor of 4 to 73, and binding titers increased by a factor of 5 to 55. Homologous boosters increased neutralizing antibody titers by a factor of 4 to 20, whereas heterologous boosters increased titers by a factor of 6 to 73. Spike-specific T-cell responses increased in all but the homologous Ad26.COV2.S-boosted subgroup. CD8+ T-cell levels were more durable in the Ad26.COV2.S-primed recipients, and heterologous boosting with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine substantially increased spike-specific CD8+ T cells in the mRNA vaccine recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Homologous and heterologous booster vaccines had an acceptable safety profile and were immunogenic in adults who had completed a primary Covid-19 vaccine regimen at least 12 weeks earlier.

Achieving this goal requires adequate healthcare and healthcare financing systems that ensure financial access to adequate care. In Africa, accessibility and coverage of essential health services are very low. Many African countries have therefore initiated reforms of their health systems to achieve universal health coverage and are advanced in this goal. The aim of this paper is to examine the effects of UHC on equitable access to care in Africa. Methods: A systematic review guided by the Cochrane Handbook was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria (PRISMA). Studies were eligible for inclusion if 1- they clearly mention studying the effect of UHC on equitable access to care, and 2- they mention facilitating factors and barriers to access to care for vulnerable populations. To be included, studies had to be in English or French. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, our systematic review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on April 24, 2018 (registration number CRD42018092793). Results: In all 271 citations reviewed, 12 studies were eligible for inclusion. Although universal health coverage seems to increase the use of health services, shortages in human resources and medical supplies, socio-cultural barriers, physical inaccessibility, lack of education and information, decision-making power, and gender-based autonomy, prenatal visits, previous experiences, and fear of cesarean delivery were still found to deter access to, and use of, health services. Discussion: Barriers to greater effectiveness of the UHC correspond to various non-financial barriers. There are no specific recommendations for these kinds of barriers. Generally, it is important for each country to research and identify contextual uncertainties in each of the communities of the territory. Afterwards, it will be necessary to put in place adapted strategies to correct these uncertainties, and thus to work toward a more efficient system of UHC, resulting in positive impacts on health outcomes.","output":"Universal Health Coverage and Facilitation of Equitable Access to Care in Africa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this paper is to summarize the results of a consensus process and a European webinar of the two societies, European Association of Societies of Aesthetic Surgery (EASAPS) and the European Society of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Societies (ESPRAS) on what is considered safe practice based on the scientific knowledge we have today.

The mode of action of COVID-19 consists of three phases, i.e. viral replication, immune hyperactivity and pulmonary destruction. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme is an essential receptor that causes COVID-19. After infecting any individual, COVID-19 develops in specific pattern with the following stages: replication stage and adaptive immunity stage. After adaptive immunity stage, the clinical symptoms of patient include cough, fever, runny nose, shortness of breath and many more. To cope with this COVID-19, food and nutrition played an important role. The purpose of this review article is to emphasize the significance of food and immunity to reduce COVID-19 attack among susceptibles. Design/methodology/approach: In the present era, corona virus, a member of crown-shaped type, created a pandemic situation around the globe owing to its capability to move from human to animals and vice versa. This virus can transfer its 35% infection to the individuals. Contemporarily, this outbreak was observed in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and affected a huge number of communities by spreading like common flu. However, after investigation, it was revealed that COVID-19 is different from common flu regarding respiratory illness created by this novel coronavirus along with its taxonomy. Findings: Over and above to all the aforementioned food safety concerns, it is suggested to use sufficient supply of green leafy vegetables along with fiber-rich foods such as legumes, beans, whole grains and vegetables. It is further good for health to get all these varieties whole and organic. The individuals should use probiotics (lactobacillus) on daily basis as a source of diary probiotic that can further bind to the virus directly and then can inhibit the viral attachment with body cells;also the probiotics are claimed to enhance the immune system of the body. Research limitations/implications: In the case of fruits and vegetables purchased, it must be thoroughly washed with water and then disinfected;after pat drying, these fruits and vegetables can be moved to the refrigerator and stored along with other foods. During the outbreak of COVID-19, the partially cooked or ready-to-eat foods should be avoided, especially eggs, meat, meat products, milk and milk-related products. On the other side, nuts should not be consumed;if required, then it must be properly roasted at home before consumption. Practical implications: The baked product right after coming out of oven is completely safe;however, these are contaminated during handling such as crumb in case of bread and with knives;so in the breakout of any viral attack, the individuals should avoid slicing of the bread. Moreover, it is recommended to place the baked products in personal bags instead of bulk quantity. Before the consumption, the baked products should be toasted, microwaved or heated with the help of pan (traditional) to reduce the amount of viral load. Social implications: Dietary supplements are taken by most of the people on daily basis or sporadically especially when they are suffering from inflammation or cold. They have options while selecting these types of supplements such as probiotics, Echinacea, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins D and E, calcium glucosamine, garlic and iron.

Remdesivir (REM) was granted its first conditional marketing authorisation in the EU in June 2020. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and local health authorities all across the EU have since strongly recommended the implementation of pharmacovigilance activities aimed at further evaluating the safety of this new drug. The objective of this study was to evaluate adverse drug reactions (ADRs) attributed to either REM or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental, a Portuguese hospital centre based in Lisbon. We present the preliminary results reporting plausible adverse effects of either HCQ or REM. METHODS: An observational cohort study was carried out between 16 March and 15 August 2020. Participants were divided into two cohorts: those prescribed an HCQ regimen, and those prescribed REM. Suspected ADRs were identified using an active monitoring model and reported to the Portuguese Pharmacovigilance System through its online notification tool. The ADR cumulative incidence was compared between the two cohorts. RESULTS: The study included 149 patients, of whom 101 were treated with HCQ and the remaining 48 with REM. The baseline characteristics were similar between the two cohorts. A total of 102 ADRs were identified during the study period, with a greater incidence in the HCQ cohort compared with the REM cohort (47.5% vs 12.5%; p<0.001). Causality was assessed in 81 ADRs, all of which were considered possible. CONCLUSIONS: Real-world data are crucial to further establish the safety profile for REM.

Unfortunately, these groups are also experiencing lower vaccination rates. To understand how strategic vaccine site placement may benefit high vulnerability populations, we extracted vaccine site locations for 26 U.S. states and linked these data to county-level adult vaccination rates and the CDC 2018 Social Vulnerability Index rankings. We fit quasi-Poisson regression models to compare vaccine site density between the highest and lowest SVI domain quartiles, and assessed whether greater vaccine site density mediated or modified the relationship between social vulnerability and vaccination rates. We found that high vulnerability counties by socioeconomic status had more vaccine sites per 10,000 residents, yet this higher vaccine site density did not reduce socioeconomic disparities in vaccination rates. Persistent vaccination inequities may reflect other structural barriers to access. Our results suggest that targeted vaccine site placement in high vulnerability counties may be necessary but insufficient for the goal of widespread, equitable vaccination.","output":"Association of Social Vulnerability, COVID-19 vaccine site density, and vaccination rates in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eagle Filters Oy respirator products have passed the tests required for Covid-19 certification, and the Finnish company says it can now start delivering to customers.","output":"Eagle Filters' respirators now Covid-19 certified"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kidney transplant (KT) recipients are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 because of their immunosuppressed state.

Therefore, LATG requires further study. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 663 patients who underwent LADG or LATG for gastric cancer in a single institution from April 2004 to April 2014 were included. The clinicopathologic characteristics and risk factors related to major complications (Clavien-Dindo grade  IIIa) were analyzed between the LADG (n = 569) and LATG groups (n = 94). RESULTS The incidence of major postoperative complications was significantly higher for LATG (LADG vs. LATG: 8.1 vs. 18.1 %, P = 0.002). Although postoperative bleeding was not different between the groups (3.2 vs. 3.2 %, P = 0.991), the incidence of bowel leakage was significantly higher for LATG (2.6 vs. 6.8 %, P = 0.028). Leakage from the anastomosis site was more frequent following LATG (5.3 %) compared with LADG (0.5 %) (P < 0.001). Leakage from the duodenal stump tended to be more frequent, though not significant, for LADG (2.0 vs. 1.1 %, P = 0.602). Advanced gastric cancer, LATG, and longer operation time were significant factors that affected the incidence of postoperative complications in a univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, there were no independent risk factors, but LATG was nearly a significant, independent risk factor (odds ratio 1.89; 95 % CI 0.965-3.71, P = 0.063). CONCLUSION More major complications were observed for LATG, particularly with esophagojejunostomy. These results show that LATG is more invasive than LADG in terms of the postoperative morbidity.

It is a stage ahead of the acute follicular tonsillitis. There are different etiologies for membrane formation over the tonsils. The commonest cause in the present scenario is still Corynebacterium diphtheriae. A one year prospective study was conducted on patients presenting with membranous tonsillitis in a tertiary referral centre in North-East India. Proper history was taken, clinical examination and all the necessary investigations were done. The patients were managed conservatively, while a few patients required tracheostomy.

Swiftly developed novel vaccines aid in the prevention of the spread, and it seems that a specific cure will not be at hand soon. The prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune/autoinflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) is more severe when compared to the otherwise healthy population, and vaccination is essential. Evidence for both the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccination in AIIRD under immunosuppression is accumulating, but the effect of Interleukin-1 on vaccination in general and in AIIRD patients is rarely addressed in the current literature. In light of the current literature, it seems that the level of agreement on the timing of COVID-19 vaccination is moderate in patients using IL-1 blockers, and expert opinions may vary. Generally, it may be recommended that patients under IL-1 blockade can be vaccinated without interrupting the anti-cytokine therapy, especially in patients with ongoing high disease activity to avoid disease relapses. However, in selected cases, after balancing for disease activity and risk of relapses, vaccination may be given seven days after the drug levels have returned to baseline, especially for IL-1 blocking agents with long half-lives such as canakinumab and rilonacept. This may help to ensure an ideal vaccine response in the face of the possibility that AIIRD patients may develop a more pronounced and severe COVID-19 disease course.","output":"Interleukin-1 Inhibitors and Vaccination Including COVID-19 in Inflammatory Rheumatic Diseases: A Nonsystematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"International organizations are increasingly expressing deep concern about the danger posed by the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus pandemic, which could lead to the loss of the human potential accumulated in every region of the world.

RECENT FINDINGS: In cardio-oncology, molecular and multimodality imaging studies confirm that sex differences do exist, affecting the therapeutic cardioprotective strategies and, therefore, the long-term outcomes. Interestingly, compelling evidences suggest that sex-specific characteristics in drug toxicity might predict differences in the therapeutic response, most likely due to the tangled interplay between cancer and HF, which probably share common underlying mechanisms. Cardiovascular diseases show many sex-related differences in prevalence, etiology, phenotype expression, and outcomes. Complex molecular mechanisms underlie this diverse pathological manifestations, from sex-determined differential gene expression to sex hormone interaction with their receptors in the heart. Non-ischemic DCM is an umbrella definition that incorporates several etiologies, including chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathies. The role of sex as a risk factor for cardiotoxicity is poorly explored.

This preregistered study examined the associations of sleep quality, duration, and efficiency with next-day physical symptoms, affect, and stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic in North America, in addition to evaluating individual differences in COVID-19 threat as a moderator. METHOD: From mid-March to early August 2020, 1025 adults from Canada and the United States aged 18-91 reported COVID-19 threat at baseline and subsequently completed twice-daily diaries for one week about their sleep, negative affect, stressors, and physical symptoms. RESULTS: Within-persons, nights with better-than-usual sleep quality predicted lower next-day negative affect, physical symptoms, and stressor occurrence. Better-than-usual sleep efficiency and longer-than-usual sleep duration also predicted lower next-day physical symptoms. COVID-19 threat ratings moderated several of these associations, such that individuals with higher COVID-19 threat showed weaker within-person associations of sleep duration and efficiency with next-day well-being, compared to individuals with lower-to-moderate levels of COVID-19 threat. For the reversed direction of association, stressor occurrence predicted shorter-than-usual sleep that night, but no other links between daily well-being and subsequent sleep were observed. DISCUSSION: Sleep quality, efficiency, and duration were important predictors of daily health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the protective associations between sleep and next-day well-being were attenuated among people with higher COVID-19 threat.

These impacts have been known to come in the form of transit-induced gentrification (TIG), a socioeconomic by-product of TOD defined as a phenomenon that occurs when the provision of transit service, particularly light rail transit (LRT), up-scales nearby neighbourhood(s) and displaces existing residents. Consequently, TIG or even the perception of TIG can impact health outcomes (eg, anxiety) and social determinants of health (SDOH) (eg, crime). METHODS/ANALYSIS: In 2022, the purple line (PL), a 16.2 mile LRT line, is opening in Prince Georges County, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, DC, comprised of over 80% African American and Hispanic residents. By taking advantage of this natural experiment, we are proposing the GENTS (Gauging Effects of Neighborhood Trends and Sickness: Examining the Perceptions of Transit-Induced Gentrification in Prince Georges County) Study in order to evaluate perceived TIG and associated health outcome and SDOH changes, at two points in time, among Prince Georges County adults in a prospective case-comparison design during the pre-PL LRT period.

Using demographic and epidemiological data between 31 July and 23 November 2020 from Toronto, Canada, we developed a compartmental transmission model with age, household and setting structure to study the impact of schools reopening in September 2020. The model simulates transmission in the home, community and schools, accounting for differences in infectiousness between adults and children, and accounting for work-from-home and virtual learning. While we found a slight increase in infections among adults (2.2%) and children (4.5%) within the first eight weeks of school reopening, transmission in schools was not the key driver of the virus resurgence in autumn 2020. Rather, it was community spread that determined the outbreak trajectory, primarily due to increases in contact rates among adults in the community after school reopening. Analyses of cross-infection among households, communities and schools revealed that home transmission is crucial for epidemic progression and safely operating schools, while the degree of in-person attendance has a larger impact than other control measures in schools. This study suggests that safe school reopening requires the strict maintenance of public health measures in the community.","output":"School and community reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic: a mathematical modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are generated under biological stress such as cancer, inflammatory tissue damage, and viral infection. In recent years, with occurrence of global infectious diseases, new discovery on MDSCs functions has been significantly expanded during viral infection and COVID-19. For a successful viral infection, pathogens viruses develop immune evasion strategies to avoid immune recognition. Numerous viruses induce the differentiation and expansion of MDSCs in order to suppress host immune responses including natural killer cells, antigen presenting cells, and T-cells. Moreover, MDSCs play an important role in regulation of immunopathogenesis by balancing viral infection and tissue damage. In this review article, we describe the overview of immunomodulation and genetic regulation of MDSCs during viral infection in the animal model and human studies. In addition, we include up-to-date review of role of MDSCs in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Finally, we discuss potential therapeutics targeting MDSCs.","output":"New Discovery of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Tale on Viral Infection and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social networking sites in the most modernized world are flooded with large data volumes. Extracting the sentiment polarity of important aspects is necessary;as it helps to determine peoples opinions through what they write. The Coronavirus pandemic has invaded the world and been given a mention in the social media on a large scale. In a very short period of time, tweets indicate unpredicted increase of coronavirus. They reflect peoples opinions and thoughts with regard to coronavirus and its impact on society. The research community has been interested in discovering the hidden relationships from short texts such as Twitter and Weiboa;due to their shortness and sparsity. In this paper, a hierarchical twitter sentiment model (HTSM) is proposed to show peoples opinions in short texts. The proposed HTSM has two main features as follows: constructing a hierarchical tree of important aspects from short texts without a predefined hierarchy depth and width, as well as analyzing the extracted opinions to discover the sentiment polarity on those important aspects by applying a valence aware dictionary for sentiment reasoner (VADER) sentiment analysis. The tweets for each extracted important aspect can be categorized as follows: strongly positive, positive, neutral, strongly negative, or negative. The quality of the proposed model is validated by applying it to a popular product and a widespread topic. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods used in analyzing peoples opinions in short text effectively.","output":"COVID19 Outbreak: A Hierarchical Framework for User Sentiment Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is reeling under severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, and it will be frightening if compounded by other co-existing infections. The co-occurrence of the Dengue virus (DENV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has been into existence, but recently the co-infection of DENV and SARS-CoV-2 has been reported. Thus, the possibility of DENV, CHIKV, and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection could be predicted in the future with enhanced vulnerability. It is essential to elucidate the host interactors and the connected pathways to understand the biological insights. The in silico approach using Cytoscape was exploited to elucidate the common human proteins interacting with DENV, CHIKV, and SARS-CoV-2 during their probable co-infection. In total, 17 interacting host proteins were identified showing association with envelope, structural, non-structural, and accessory proteins. Investigating the functional and biological behaviour using PANTHER, UniProtKB, and KEGG databases uncovered their association with several cellular pathways including, signaling pathways, RNA processing and transport, cell cycle, ubiquitination, and protein trafficking. Withal, exploring the DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database, total seven druggable host proteins were predicted. Among all integrin beta-1, histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) and microtubule affinity-regulating kinase-3 were targeted by FDA approved molecules/ drugs. Furthermore, HDAC2 was predicted to be the most significant target, and some approved drugs are available against it.

Infection management and antibiotic decision-making are multifactorial, complex processes influenced by context and involving many actors. Social constructs including race, ethnicity, gender identity and cultural and religious practices as well as migration status and geography influence health. Infection and ABR are also affected by these external drivers in individuals and populations leading to stratified health outcomes. These drivers compromise the capacity and resources of healthcare services already over-burdened with drug-resistant infections. In this review we consider the current evidence and call for a need to broaden the study of culture and power dynamics in healthcare through investigation of relative power, hierarchies and sociocultural constructs including structures, race, caste, social class and gender identity as predictors of health-providing and health-seeking behaviours. This approach will facilitate a more sustainable means of addressing the threat of ABR and identify vulnerable groups ensuring greater inclusivity in decision-making. At an individual level, investigating how social constructs and gender hierarchies impact clinical team interactions, communication and decision-making in infection management and the role of the patient and carers will support better engagement to optimize behaviours.

More robust immune activation in women has been proposed to contribute to decreased disease severity, although systemic inflammation has been associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19 infection. Whether systemic inflammation contributes to sex differences in COVID-19 infection is not known. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined sex differences in inflammatory markers among 453 men (mean age 61) and 328 women (mean age 62) hospitalized with COVID-19 infection at the Massachusetts General Hospital from March 8 to April 27, 2020. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the association of sex with initial and peak inflammatory markers. Exploratory analyses examined the association of sex and inflammatory markers with 28-day clinical outcomes using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Initial and peak CRP were higher in men compared with women after adjustment for baseline differences (initial CRP: ? 0.29, SE 0.07, p = 0.0001; peak CRP: ? 0.31, SE 0.07, p<0.0001) with similar findings for IL-6, PCT, and ferritin (p<0.05 for all). Men had greater than 1.5-greater odds of dying compared with women (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.04-2.80, p = 0.03). Sex modified the association of peak CRP with both death and ICU admission, with stronger associations observed in men compared with women (death: OR 9.19, 95% CI 4.29-19.7, p <0.0001 in men vs OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.52-5.18, p = 0.009 in women, Pinteraction = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of 781 men and women hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, men exhibited more robust inflammatory activation as evidenced by higher initial and peak inflammatory markers, as well as worse clinical outcomes.

In this study, we examined the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the patients aged 60 and over who had been infected with COVID-19. METHODS: The data of the patients admitted to the hospital within 1 month from May 8, 2020 onwards and hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia were obtained from the hospital medical records, and the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory parameters of the patients during the admission to the emergency department were examined. Patients were divided into 2 groups regarding the criteria of having in-hospital mortality (mortality group) and being discharged with full recovery (survivor group). The factors, which could have an impact on the mortality, were investigated using a univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: This retrospective study included 113 patients aged 60 years and older, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The mean age of the patients was 70.7  7.9, and 64.6% (n = 73) of them were male. The mortality rate was 19.4% (n = 22). Among the comorbid illnesses, only renal failure was significant in the mortality group (p = 0.04).

Abstract In December 2019, in Wuhan in the province of Hubei in China, there was a report on a group of 27 patients with a pneumonia of unknown origin, linked to exposure in a market with shellfish, fish, and live animals. In January 2020, a new strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated in these patients. The disease caused by this virus has been given the name of COVID-19. During the initial stages of the pandemic, and given the scarcity of studies published about this, it was believed that this coronavirus only caused respiratory symptoms. However, as the number of patients increased, it was observed that cardiovascular disease had a fundamental role in the development and prognosis of the infection. The most important risk factors associated with mortality are age and the presence of comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular ones. The increase in the levels of troponin, natriuretic peptides, and D-dimer are of prognostic values in patients with an infection due to SARS-CoV-2. Patients with COVID-19 have an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, myocarditis, heart failure, shock, arrhythmias, and sudden death, in relation to the systematic response to the virus and to the treatments needed in the acute phase.

Methods: At this facility, 82 (60%) residents were infected. Our team rapidly deployed technology to support staff at the facility. Virtual daily rounds created a systematic approach for patient care. The goals of virtual daily rounds include (1) efficiently facilitating HIPAA-compliant communication between nursing and all licensed independent providers, (2) rapid identification of clinical decline, (3) facilitation of care escalation, (4) facilitating bidirectional transfers, and (5) rapid and efficient identification of patients appropriate for telemedicine pulmonary consultation. Results: The outbreak remained active 6 weeks; 82 of 136 (60%) residents were infected, and 36 (44%) COVID-19 positive residents were seen by telemedicine consultation. Fifty-seven (70%) residents remained in-facility for treatment. Twenty-one residents died (15%); 10 in facility, 11 in hospital. Of those seen in telemedicine consultation, 24 (69%) remained on the treat-in-place protocol with goal-concordant care. These hospitalization and mortality rates are significantly lower than similar outbreaks reported. Discussion and Conclusion: We have since instituted this system at seven other facilities. A model of virtual daily rounding holds promise for decreasing mortality/hospitalization in this vulnerable population through systematically identifying patients most appropriate for telemedicine and cultivating close collaboration between hospitals and nursing homes.","output":"Virtual Daily Rounding for COVID-19 Facility Outbreaks: A Standardized Telehealth-Centered Approach May Reduce Hospital Transfers and Mortality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although various perinatal outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pregnancies have been reported, the fetal and neonatal consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remain unclear.

To evaluate molecular affinities between antiviral drug candidates and SARS-CoV-2 associated target proteins such as spike protein (S) and main protease (Mpro ), a molecular interaction simulation was performed using MD software and subsequently the applicability score was calculated by machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the STITCH algorithm was used to predict the pharmacology network involving multiple pathways of active drug candidate(s). Pharmacophores feature of active drug(s) molecules was also determined to predict structure activity relationship. The molecular interaction analysis showed that cordycepin has strong binding affinities with S protein (-180) and Mpro proteins (-205) which were relatively highest among other drug candidates used. Interestingly, compounds with low IC50 showed high binding energy. Furthermore, machine learning algorithm also revealed high applicability scores (0.42-0.47) of cordycepin. It is worth mentioning that the pharmacology network depicted the involvement of cordycepin in different pathways associated with bacterial and viral diseases including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, influenza A, viral myocarditis and herpes simplex infection. The embedded pharmacophore features with cordycepin also suggested strong structure-activity relationship (SAR). Cordycepin's anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity indicated 65% (E-gene) and 42% (N-gene) viral replication inhibition after 48h of treatment. Since cordycepin has both pre-clinical and clinical evidence on antiviral activity, in addition the present findings further validate and suggest repurposing potential of cordycepin against COVID-19.","output":"Repurposing potential of FDA approved and investigational drugs for COVID-19 targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike and main protease and validation by machine learning algorithm."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper gives a brief overview of the four shared tasks that are to be organized at the PAN 2020 lab on digital text forensics and stylometry, hosted at CLEF conference.

The condition is commonly manifested as clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and cardiovascular disease. Although there is a high probability of COVID-19 patients developing cardiovascular problems, such as hypertension, there is no established causative association between both conditions. In general, this type of comorbidity is extremely common in the elderly, which increases their risk of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The International Society of Hypertension issued the most recent guidelines for the treatment and management of hypertension in 2020, of which the most employed are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). Therefore, this research aims to investigate the treatment of ACE-i/ARB in hypertensive individuals with COVID-19. The reason is that there have been some concerns expressed about the usage of these medications due to their influence on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the entrance site for SARS-CoV-2, particularly in the lungs. Subsequently, the results showed that discontinuing ACE-i/ARB is not advised, especially during the pandemic. This is based on data comparing mortality rates between participants on ACE-i/ARB and those not on ACE-i/ARB using cases and guidelines for managing hypertension during the pandemic.","output":"The treatment of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with hypertension: A narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myocardial fibrosis detected by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has been reported in patients with desmin\\\\related myopathy, although its characteristics remain unclear.

The chemokines responsible for recruiting lymphocytes to infected organs are yet to be identified. Among the lymphocyte chemokines detected, high levels of interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) are found in the plasma and cerebral spinal fluid of patients with brainstem encephalitis as compared with the levels of a monokine induced by gamma interferon (Mig). Using a murine model to investigate the induction of IP-10 by EV71 infection, we observed that EV71 infection significantly enhanced IP-10 protein expression in the serum and brain, with kinetics similar to viral titres in the blood and brain. Brain neurons of infected mice expressed IP-10. Using wild-type mice and IP-10 gene knockout mice to investigate the role of IP-10 in EV71 infection, we found that IP-10 deficiency significantly reduced levels of Mig in serum, and levels of gamma interferon and the number of CD8 T cells in the mouse brain. Absence of IP-10 significantly increased the mortality of infected mice by 45%, with slow virus clearance in several vital tissues.

Modern hand-held, ultra-portable ultrasound devices have been developed by multiple companies and are contributing to make bedside ultrasound evaluation a practice available to all physicians. The significance of making point-of-care ultrasound a common practice that all physicians can eventually use in the evaluation of their patients is changing the way medicine is practiced, allowing physicians to quickly obtain valuable information to complement the traditional physical exam. Despite the proven benefits of using bedside ultrasound imaging as a part of the patient evaluation and for procedure guidance, adoption of this technology is still not widespread among anesthesiology clinicians, nor is there uniform teaching of ultrasound skills to anesthesia residents and faculty. Among obstacles that have been identified as precluding achievement of the goal of widespread utilization of POCUS among anesthesia professionals and trainees is the availability of equipment for all physicians when it is needed and lack of instructor supervision for trainees who desire to use ultrasound but do not always have an instructor knowledgeable in POCUS with them when an US exam is warranted. We analyze the characteristics, advantages and limitations of available ultra-portable, hand-held ultrasound devices, with a focus on the Butterfly IQ pocket-probe, which is available at our institution, and how some of its features, like the capacity to emulate multiple transducers and its cloud-sharing and teleguidance technology, may contribute to increase the availability and utilization of POCUS by anesthesia clinicians.","output":"Hand-held point of care ultrasound probes C the new generation of POCUS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reticulon family of integral membrane proteins are conserved across all eukaryotes and typically localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are involved in generating highly-curved tubules.

We suggested it acts as a feedback element, only folding/binding once a sufficient degree of curvature has been achieved, and stabilizes curvature without disrupting the bilayer.

Here we used biophysical methods to characterize a minimal library of putative APH peptides from across the 21 A. thaliana isoforms. We found that reticulons with the closest evolutionary relationship to RTNLB13 contain curvature-sensing APHs in the same location with sequence conservation.

Ozone mixing ratios in suburbs are usually higher than in the center of cities and may reduce photosynthetic productivity at a relatively higher degree.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Major trauma patients highly rely on immediate access to specialized services, including ICUs, shortages caused by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may influence their outcome. METHODS: A multi-center observational cohort study, based on the Dutch National Trauma Registry was performed. Characteristics, resource usage, and outcome of major trauma patients (injury severity score 16) treated at all trauma-receiving hospitals during the first COVID-19 peak (March 23 through May 10) were compared with those treated from the same period in 2018 and 2019 (reference period). RESULTS: During the peak period, 520 major trauma patients were admitted, versus 570 on average in the pre-COVID-19 years. Significantly fewer patients were admitted to ICU facilities during the peak than during the reference period (49.6% vs 55.8%; P=0.016). Patients with less severe traumatic brain injuries in particular were less often admitted to the ICU during the peak (40.5% vs 52.5%; P=0.005). Moreover, this subgroup showed an increased mortality compared to the reference period (13.5% vs 7.7%; P=0.044). These results were confirmed using multivariable logistic regression analyses.

Genetic validation of drugs can foreshadow trial results, and help prioritize investigations. We assessed whether common drugs, suggested as possible treatments for COVID-19 (tocilizumab, anakinra and statins) with established genetic proxies, are effective in COVID-19. We also included dexamethasone as a positive control exposure because the RECOVERY trial suggested benefit in severe COVID-19. Methods: We assessed, using Mendelian randomization, whether genetic proxies of tocilizumab, anakinra, statins and dexamethasone use affected risk of very severe (cases=536, non-cases=329391) or hospitalized (cases=3199, non-cases=897488) COVID-19 using a recent genome-wide association study. Results: Using rs2228145 (IL6R) to proxy effects of tocilizumab use, no association with very severe COVID-19 was found, but possibly an inverse association with hospitalized COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR) 0.83 per standardized effect of higher soluble interleukin-6r, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.02). Using rs12916 (HMGCR) to proxy effects of statins use, an inverse association with very severe COVID-19 was found (OR 0.30 per standardized effect, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.89). Using rs6743376 and rs1542176 to proxy effects of anakinra use, no associations with COVID-19 were found. Dexamethasone, instrumented by cortisol, was possibly inversely associated with very severe COVID-19 (OR 0.20 per standardized effect 95% CI 0.04 to 1.04). Conclusion: Our study provides some genetic validation for the use of both tocilizumab and statins in COVID-19, but not anakinra, whilst being consistent with the findings from the RECOVERY trial about dexamethasone.

However, data focusing on practical considerations experienced by health care professionals (HCPs) providing care to allergic patients is scarce. METHODS: Under the framework of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), a panel of experts in the field of immunotherapy developed a 42\\\\question online survey, to evaluate real\\\\life consequences of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in allergy practice. RESULTS: The respondents in the survey were 618. About 80% of HCPs indicated being significantly affected in their allergy practice. A face\\\\to\\\\face visit reduction was reported by 93% of HCPs and about a quarter completely interrupted diagnostic challenges. Patients with severe uncontrolled asthma (59%) and anaphylaxis (47%) were prioritized for in\\\\person care. About 81% maintained an unaltered prescription of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in asthmatics. About 90% did not modify intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) in patients with allergic rhinitis. Nearly half of respondents kept biological prescriptions unmodified for asthma. About 50% of respondents kept their allergen immunotherapy (AIT) prescription patterns unchanged for respiratory allergies; 60% for insect venom allergies. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) for food allergies was initiated by 27%. About 20% kept carrying out up\\\\dosing without modifications and 14% changed to more prolonged intervals.

However, the percentage of outpatient urological cases that could be managed completely by telemedicine outside of the COVID-19 pandemic remains to be determined. We conducted a prospective, multisite study involving all urologists working in the region of Quebec City. METHODS During the first four weeks of the regional confinement, 18 pediatric and adult urologists were asked to determine, after each telemedicine appointment, if it translated into a complete (CCM), incomplete (ICM), or suboptimal case management (SCM, adequate only in the context of the pandemic). RESULTS A total of 1679 appointments representing all urological areas were registered. Overall, 67.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 65.3; 69.8), 27.1% (25.0; 29.3), and 4.3% (3.5; 5.4) were reported as CCM, SCM, and ICM, respectively. The CCM ratio varied according to the reason for consultation, with cancer suspicion (52.9% [42.9; 62.8]) and pediatric reasons (38.0% [30.0; 46.6]) showing the lowest CCM percentages. CCM percentages also varied significantly based on the setting where it was performed, ranging from 61.1% (private clinic) to 86.8% (endourology and general hospital). CONCLUSIONS We show that two-thirds of all urological outpatient cases could be completely managed by telemedicine outside of the pandemic. After the pandemic, it will be important to incorporate telemedicine as an alternative for a patient's first or followup visit, especially those with geographical, pathological, and socioeconomic considerations.","output":"A prospective, multisite study analyzing the percentage of urological cases that can be completely managed by telemedicine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The foundation of an ophthalmologists microsurgical career begins in the wet lab.

We compare two distinct types of monetary-fiscal adjustments: In the monetary regime, the government eventually raises taxes to finance transfers while in the fiscal regime, inflation rises, effectively imposing inflation taxes on public debt holders. We show analytically in a simple model how the fiscal regime generates larger and more persistent inflation than the monetary regime. In a quantitative application, we use a two-sector, two-agent New Keynesian model, situate the model economy in a Covid-19 recession, and quantify the effects of the transfer components of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. We find that the transfer multipliers are significantly larger under the fiscal regimewhich results in a milder contraction than under the monetary regime, primarily because inflationary pressures of this regime counteract the deflationary forces during the recession.

Recently, it has been hypothesized that ABO blood groups can be related to susceptibility to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Considering that the first studies reported A group as a risk factor and O group as a protection, some authors have been suggested that the anti-A antibodies, and not the blood group, could be responsible for the findings. Objectives: Based on these findings, this study analysed the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the presence (O and B blood groups type) or absence (A and AB blood groups type) of anti-A antibodies, considering the production of specific immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM and IgG) and neutralizing antibodies. Material and Methods: Retrospective study with 430 COVID-19 individuals (268 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors-CCPD and 162 COVID-19 inpatients-CIP) from two Brazilian reference hospitals, confirmed by RT-PCR, and 2,212 healthy volunteer blood donors (VBD) as control group, that were evaluated and divided into two groups: with anti-A (O/B blood groups) and without anti-A group (A/AB blood groups). Immunoglobulins and neutralizing antibody titres were measured for CCPD and CID. Multivariate logistic regression and non-parametric tests were performed. Results: Although O blood group was the most frequent ABO group among VBD, A blood group was more frequent among COVID-19 individuals (CCPD 47.8%, CIP 43.2%, VBD 35.5%, p < 0.001). There was no statistical difference in blood groups distribution between CCPD and CIP (p=0.268). In our cohort, for each increased age year there was 6% more chance for COVID-19 (OR: 1.06;CI 95%: 1.05-1.06, p < 0.001), males showed 27% more chance for the disease (OR: 1.27;CI 95%: 1.02-1.59, p = 0.035) and O/B blood groups showed 38% less infection prevalence (OR: 0.62;CI 95%: 0.5-0.7, p < 0.001). Considering the fact that higher anti-A is usually described in O blood group, data from O versus B blood groups individuals were analysed and the former showed 34% less chance for COVID-19 (OR: 0.66;CI 95%: 0.46-0.95, p = 0.026). No difference regarding ABO group was found when COVID-19 inpatients of all blood types were analysed. Immunoglobulins A, M and G (IgA, IgM, and IgG) and neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were lower in COVID-19 individuals O/B blood groups (IgM p = 0.03, IgG p = 0.02, IgA p = 0.03). Discution: In our retrospective cohort, the COVID-19 individuals O/B blood groups (which produces anti-A) had 38% less chance to have a diagnosis of COVID-19 (p < 0.001) and the same groups showed lower titers of neutralizing antibodies, IgM, IgG and IgA. Groups O/B showed a protective factor against the SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it was not associated to COVID-19 inpatients (versus COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors) suggesting that blood type is not associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection severity.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our patients undergoing robotic cardiac reoperation (redo group) from July 2013 to April 2017 at our institution and compared with our patients undergoing standard robotic surgery (nonredo group). In the reoperative cases, a thoracoscope was inserted through a 5-mm port placed away from the previous scar. Another 5-mm port was inserted under direct vision to make space for one or two robotic arms, and further precise dissection was performed robotically. RESULTS A total of 486 patients underwent robotic-assisted cardiac surgery. There were 36 patients who had one or more previous cardiac surgeries (42 surgeries). Although the mean operative and cardiopulmonary bypass time were longer in the redo group (median = 351 minutes vs. 289 minutes and 219 minutes vs. 178 minutes, P < 0.05, respectively), cardiac arrest time was similar between two groups. The redo group had a higher incidence of postoperative prolonged ventilation (16.7% vs. 6.9%, P = 0.046) and pneumonia (11.1% vs. 0.2%, P < 0.001).

Aim of this analysis was to describe patients with RMD according to their COVID-19 severity and to identify risk factors for hospitalisation. METHODS: Patients with RMD with PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reported to the German COVID-19 registry from 30 March to 1 November 2020 were evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate ORs for hospitalisation due to COVID-19. RESULTS: Data from 468 patients with RMD with SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported. Most frequent diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis, RA (48%). 29% of the patients were hospitalised, 5.5% needed ventilation. 19 patients died.

The lockdown affected both the demand side and the supply side of the economy, as production of goods and services dramatically dropped due to firms' shutdowns, broken supply chains, or bankruptcies, and aggregate demand diminished due to lower consumer confidence and investment cutbacks, accompanied by a dramatic fall in international tourism demand, in particular due to travel restrictions. We look on these sup-ply and demand changes through the lens of a macroeconomic model of a small open econ-omy, comprising an industrial and a tourism sector. For this purpose, we modify Schubert's (2013) model by introducing a multiple shock which reflects (i) reduced sectoral productivi-ties due to, e.g., broken supply chains, (ii) a drop in employment due to firms' lockdowns, and (iii) a sharp decline in international tourism demand. We find that the multiple shock leads to an immediate drop in GDP and a boost of the short-run unemployment rate, followed by a gradual transition back to steady state. The adverse effects on the tourism sector are the more severe the slower international tourism demand reverts to pre-crisis levels, but they do not strongly spill over to the industrial sector. Furthermore, even if international tourism demand recovers quickly, the effects on the industrial sector barely change. The length of the industrial sector's recovery basically depends on the speed of restoring its sectoral productivity rather than on international tourism demand. The reason for this result can be found in the absorbing effect of the relative price of tourism services in terms of the industrial good.","output":"COVID-19: economic consequences for a small tourism dependent economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Before surgical procedures, especially if the patient will be unconscious, we ask for written consent, but in most other situations verbal consent is enough.

A 10-item questionnaire was designed with items related to the clinical outcomes, challenges and provider satisfaction when using tele-psychiatry. It had mostly yes/no dichotomous responses along with the scope for making additional comments for each question. An online link of the questionnaire was sent via email to doctors of all grades working across the Black Country Healthcare NHS foundation Trust, in the West Midlands.

Just over 50% had used both telephone and video consultations, whereas 47.1% responders had used telephone only. More than half (55.8%) reported that the tele-psychiatry affected clinical outcomes;and it was considered positive in around half (52.9%). Most (73.5%) of the responders found that limitations or challenges of using technology impacted on delivery of care remotely. However 64.7% psychiatrists were satisfied with the process overall;and 79.4% reported that they would like to use tele-psychiatry in the future as well.Survey captured many observations from the psychiatrists. Positive comments from the psychiatrists included expedited delivery of care, reduced non-attendance rates, as well as successful multidisciplinary meetings. Challenges in specific sub-specialties such as Child and Adolescent Psychiatry or Older Adult psychiatry were reported where complete assessments were not achieved successfully.

Because an early ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery is avoided due to low body weight and fragility of the patients, the neurosurgical treatment focuses on temporary solutions for CSF diversion as a minimally invasive approach. Neuroendoscopic lavage (NEL) was additionally introduced for early elimination of intraventricular blood components to reduce possible subsequent complications such as shunt dependency, infection, and multiloculated hydrocephalus. The authors report their first experience regarding neurodevelopmental outcome after NEL in this patient cohort. METHODS In a single-center retrospective cohort study with 45 patients undergoing NEL, the authors measured neurocognitive development at 2 years with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd Edition, Mental Developmental Index (BSID II MDI) and graded the ability to walk with the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). They further recorded medication with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and quantified ventricular and brain volumes by using 3D MRI data sets. RESULTS Forty-four patients were alive at 2 years of age. Eight of 27 patients (30%) assessed revealed a fairly normal neurocognitive development (BSID II MDI  70), 28 of 36 patients (78%) were able to walk independently or with minimal aid (GMFCS 0-2), and 73% did not require AED treatment. Based on MR volume measurements, greater brain volume was positively correlated with BSID II MDI (rs = 0.52, 95% CI 0.08-0.79) and negatively with GMFCS (rs = -0.69, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.42). Based on Bayesian logistic regression, AED treatment, the presence of comorbidities, and also cerebellar pathology could be identified as relevant risk factors for both neurodevelopmental outcomes, increasing the odds more than 2-fold-but with limited precision in estimation. CONCLUSIONS Neuromotor outcome assessment after NEL is comparable to previously published drainage, irrigation, and fibrinolytic therapy (DRIFT) study results. A majority of NEL-treated patients showed independent mobility. Further validation of outcome measurements is warranted in an extended setup, as intended by the prospective international multicenter registry for treatment of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (TROPHY).","output":"Neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years after neuroendoscopic lavage in neonates with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mice immunized with a combination of an adenovirus vector (Ad5-YFV) and live-attenuated (LMA)-based vaccines were evaluated for protective efficacy against pneumonic plague. While the Ad5-YFV vaccine harbors a fusion cassette of three genes encoding YscF, F1, and LcrV, LMA represents a mutant of parental Yersinia pestis CO92 deleted for genes encoding Lpp, MsbB, and Ail. Ad5-YFV and LMA were either administered simultaneously (1-dose regimen) or 21 days apart in various order and route of administration combinations (2-dose regimen). The 2-dose regimen induced robust immune responses to provide full protection to animals against parental CO92 and its isogenic F1 (CAF-)-deletion mutant challenges during both short- and long-term studies. Mice intranasally (i.n.) immunized with Ad5-YFV first followed by LMA (i.n. or intramuscularly [i.m.]) had higher T- and B-cell proliferative responses and LcrV antibody titers than those in mice vaccinated with LMA (i.n. or i.m.) first ahead of Ad5-YFV (i.n.) during the long-term study. Specifically, the needle- and adjuvant-free vaccine combination (i.n.) is ideal for use in plague endemic regions. Conversely, with a 1-dose regimen, mice vaccinated with Ad5-YFV i.n. and LMA by the i.m. route provided complete protection to animals against CO92 and its CAF- mutant challenges, and elicited Th1/Th2, as well as Th17 responses, thus suitable for emergency vaccination during a plague outbreak or bioterrorist attack. This is a first study in which a viral vector-based and live-attenuated vaccines were effectively used in combination representing adjuvant- and/or needle- free immunization, with each vaccine triggering a distinct cellular immune response. Importance Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, is a Tier-1 select agent and a re-emerging human pathogen. A 2017 outbreak in Madagascar with >75% of cases being pneumonic and 8.6% causalities emphasized the importance of the disease. The World Health Organization has indicated an urgent need to develop new generation subunit and live-attenuated plague vaccines. We have developed a subunit vaccine including three components (YscF, F1, and LcrV) using an adenovirus platform (Ad5-YFV). In addition, we have deleted virulence genes of Y. pestis (e.g., lpp, msbB, and ail) to develop a live-attenuated vaccine (LMA). Both of these vaccines generated robust humoral and cellular immunity and were highly efficacious in several animal models. We hypothesized the use of a heterologous prime-boost strategy or administrating both vaccines simultaneously could provide an adjuvant- and/or a needle- free vaccine(s) which have attributes of both vaccines for use in endemic regions and during an emergency situation.","output":"Combinatorial viral vector-based and live-attenuated vaccines without an adjuvant to generate broader immune responses to effectively combat pneumonic plague"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is facing a global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

To find such a broadly protective immunization strategy, it is useful to know how easily the virus can escape via mutation from specific antibody responses. This information is encoded in the fitness landscape of the viral proteins (i.e., knowledge of the viral fitness as a function of sequence). Here we present a computational method to infer the intrinsic mutational fitness landscape of influenzalike evolving antigens from yearly sequence data. We test inference performance with computer-generated sequence data that are based on stochastic simulations mimicking basic features of immune-driven viral evolution. Although the numerically simulated model does create a phylogeny based on the allowed mutations, the inference scheme does not use this information. This provides a contrast to other methods that rely on reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. Our method just needs a sufficient number of samples over multiple years. With our method, we are able to infer single as well as pairwise mutational fitness effects from the simulated sequence time series for short antigenic proteins. Our fitness inference approach may have potential future use for the design of immunization protocols by identifying intrinsically vulnerable immune target combinations on antigens that evolve under immune-driven selection. In the future, this approach may be applied to influenza and other novel viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, which evolves and, like influenza, might continue to escape the natural and vaccine-mediated immune pressures.","output":"Inferring the intrinsic mutational fitness landscape of influenzalike evolving antigens from temporally ordered sequence data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Agriculture is a significant contributor to anthropogenic global warming, and reducing agricultural emissionslargely methane and nitrous oxidecould play a significant role in climate change mitigation.

These dynamics mean that conventional reporting of aggregated CO(2)-equivalent emission rates is highly ambiguous and does not straightforwardly reflect historical or anticipated contributions to global temperature change. As a result, the roles and responsibilities of different sectors emitting different gases are similarly obscured by the common means of communicating emission reduction scenarios using CO(2)-equivalence. We argue for a shift in how we report agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and think about their mitigation to better reflect the distinct roles of different greenhouse gases. Policy-makers, stakeholders, and society at large should also be reminded that the role of agriculture in climate mitigation is a much broader topic than climate science alone can inform, including considerations of economic and technical feasibility, preferences for food supply and land-use, and notions of fairness and justice.

Information collected from such an outbreak is crucial for policy makers to understand and manage the epidemic.

However, studies can be limited by small sample sizes and sparse clinical follow-up data. We utilized a large sample of prostate specimens to identify a predictive model of biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy and we validated this model in two external data sets. METHODS We analyzed prostate specimens from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy at Hartford Hospital between 2008 and 2011. RNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostates was hybridized to a custom Affymetrix microarray. Regularized (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [Lasso]) Cox regression was performed with cross-validation to identify a model that incorporated gene expression and clinical factors to predict biochemical recurrence, defined as postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) > 0.2 ng/ml or receipt of triggered salvage treatment. Model performance was assessed using time-dependent receiver operating curve (ROC) curves and survival plots. RESULTS A total of 606 prostate specimens with gene expression and both pre- and postoperative PSA data were available for analysis. We identified a model that included Gleason grade and stage as well as five genes (CNRIP1, endoplasmic reticulum protein 44 [ERP44], metaxin-2 [MTX2], Ras homolog family member U [RHOU], and OXR1). Using the Lasso method, we determined that the five gene model independently predicted biochemical recurrence better than a model that included Gleason grade and tumor stage alone. The time-dependent ROCAUC for the five gene signature including Gleason grade and tumor stage was 0.868 compared to an AUC of 0.767 when Gleason grade and tumor stage were included alone. Low and high-risk groups displayed significant differences in their recurrence-free survival curves. The predictive model was subsequently validated on two independent data sets identified through the Gene Expression Omnibus. The model included genes (RHOU, MTX2, and ERP44) that have previously been implicated in prostate cancer biology.

Dihydrocelastrol (DHCE) is synthesized by hydrogenated celastrol, a treterpene isolated from Chinese medicinal plant Tripterygium regelii. In this study, we first reported the anti-tumor activity of DHCE on MM cells. We found that DHCE could inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis through caspase-dependent way in vitro. In addition, DHCE could inactivate the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and downregulate the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in MM. It also retained its activity against MM cell lines in the presence of IL-6. Furthermore, treatment of MM cells with DHCE resulted in an accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Notably, DHCE reduced the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 in MM cell lines. Additionally, its efficacy toward the MM cell lines could be enhanced in combination with the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat (LBH589), which implied the possibility of the combination treatment of DHCE and LBH589 as a potential therapeutic strategy in MM.

SETTING: We conducted a survey in Wuhan, China, to characterize the status of coinfected PLWH, their time to clinical improvement, and clinical prognoses. METHODS: Using a Wuhan shipping service for antiretroviral medications, the Wuhan LGBT Center screened 2900 PLWH shipping addresses and cross-referenced 36 of them to quarantine sites or hospitals, suggesting possible COVID-19 cases. Through telephone calls and WeChat (social media) messaging, we conducted a survey after obtaining online informed consent. RESULTS: We had 12 HIV-infected respondents (10 men and 2 women) who also reported COVID-19. The median age was 36 years (interquartile range: 33.0-56.3), mean age 42.4 years, and range 25-66 years of age. Nine of 10 persons on antiretroviral therapy (ART) presented with only mild COVID-19 symptoms. The 10th person on ART was a 56-year-old man who died at home early in the outbreak when health care services were overwhelmed. Two additional cases who had been in intensive care with acute COVID-19 were both men, aged 25 and 37 years; both were ART-naive until this hospitalization. Excluding the deceased man, 6 of 11 coinfected persons reported feeling depressed even after clinical improvements. CONCLUSION: Twelve coinfected persons were identified in Wuhan; 9 of 10 were on long-term ART and had favorable outcomes. Two men identified as having started ART only recently were found to have severe symptoms.

METHODS: We developed a simulation study to estimate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence using rapid, low-sensitivity, low-cost tests and slower, high-sensitivity, higher cost tests across a range of disease prevalence and sampling strategies. RESULTS: Occupancy modeling overcame the low sensitivity of rapid tests to generate prevalence estimates comparable to more accurate, slower tests. Moreover, minimal repeated sampling was required to offset low test sensitivity at low disease prevalence (0.1%), when rapid testing is most critical for informing disease management.

METHODS: Two cohorts were investigated. First, a nationwide cohort of all IBD patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was prospectively followed to investigate the disease courses of both diseases. Second, within a population-based cohort of 2.6 million Danish citizens, we identified all individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 to determine the occurrence of COVID-19 among patients with and without IBD and other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). RESULTS: Between January 28, 2020 and June 2, 2020, a total of 76 IBD patients with COVID-19 were identified in the national cohort and prospectively followed for 35 days (interquartile range (IQR): 25-51). A large proportion (n=19;25%) required a COVID-19-related hospitalization for seven days (IQR: 2-8.5) which was associated with being 65 years or older (odds ratio (OR)=23.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.32-89.63), p<0.01) and presence of any non-IMID comorbidity (OR=8.12 (95% CI 2.55-25.87), p<0.01), but not use of immunomodulators (p=0.52) or biologic therapies (p=0.14). In the population-based study, 8,476 of 231,601 (3.7%) residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; however, the occurrence was significantly lower among patients with IBD (62 of the 2,486 patients=2.5%, p<0.01) and other IMIDs (531 of 16,492 patients=3.2%, p<0.01) as compared to patients without IMIDs.

Its effect on providing in-hospital lactation support has not been well described. RESEARCH AIM To describe the experiences of healthcare workers as they provided in-hospital lactation support during the pandemic. METHODS A prospective, cross-sectional, online survey evaluated healthcare providers working with postpartum women and newborns affected by COVID-19 at an academic center during March-June 2020. Providers were queried regarding the influence of COVID-19 and COVID-19-specific policies on providing lactation support. Questions assessed guidance received, perceived stress, difficulty providing care, and solicited qualitative responses. The constant comparative method was used to analyze qualitative data. RESULTS Of 108 providers, 70 (65%) completed the survey. Of 57 providing direct lactation support to women affected by COVID-19, most (n = 39, 67%) reported increased stress. Participants reported lower stress scores when receiving guidance through shift meetings or email compared to those not receiving this guidance [stress score with shift meeting guidance (M [SD]): 3.10 (0.88); score without guidance: 3.83 (0.66); n = 39, p = .009; score with email guidance: 3.79 (0.58); score without guidance: 4.50 (0.58); n = 18, p = .045). Qualitative responses (n = 67; 96%) identified three themes: visitor restrictions allowed less distraction during lactation support; physical separation disrupted maternal/infant bonding; workflow challenges resulted from policy changes and supply access. CONCLUSIONS Most participating staff providing lactation support to women affected by COVID-19 reported increased stress. Ensuring written or verbal guidance may reduce staff's experiences of stress. Efforts to optimize lactation support during COVID-19 should consider reducing distractions, physical separation, and logistic challenges.","output":"Providing Breastfeeding Support During COVID-19: A Survey of Staff Experiences."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thermoelectrics that enable direct heat-electricity conversion possess unique advantages for green and renewable energy revolution and have received rapidly growing attention in the past decade.

This qualitative study explores the facilitators of and barriers to social distancing for young people during the COVID-19 pandemic, with recognition that young people represent a unique demographic group, with differing psychosocial needs and experiences to other age cohorts. METHODS: Qualitative data was collected as part of a larger Qualtrics survey between July 28th 2020 and August 24th 2020. Eligible participants were young people living on the Island of Ireland, aged 16-25 years. The survey design was underpinned by the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation model of behaviour change (COM-B). Semi-inductive thematic analysis was used to analyse comments collected via three free-text survey items. The COM-B model provided a thematic framework to organise subthemes extracted. RESULTS: A total of N = 477 young people completed the survey, of which N = 347 provided comments for at least one of three free-text survey items. The majority of respondents lived in Northern Ireland (96%), the average age was 21 years, and most respondents were female (73%) and were students (81%). Key barriers identified included lack of environmental support for social distancing (lack of physical Opportunity to social distance), observing other people not social distancing (lack of social Opportunities supporting social distancing), and missing physical interaction from others (relating to the dissuading influence of automatic Motivational factors i.e. the influence of loneliness). Key facilitators included presence of clear and consistent environmental cues and availability of space to support social distancing (increasing physical Opportunity to social distance), increasing awareness and perceived consequences of risk of transmission (enhancing reflective Motivational factors i.e. perceived benefits (versus costs) of social distancing), and increasing opportunities to observe others adhering to guidelines (increasing social Opportunities supporting social distancing). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the actions and endorsement of peers and the physical design of environments have a key role in influencing social distancing behaviour among young people living in NI. The COM-B factors identified in this study can inform the development of tailored interventions using models such as the Behaviour Change Wheel. The findings of this study suggest that intervention functions based on peer modelling and physical environmental restructuring and enablement should be priortitised, however it is imperative that interventions are co-designed with young people to foster collaboration and empowerment.

To mitigate patient trafficking and reduce the virus exposure in health centers, several GPs, physicians and people in the video were consulted during the pandemic at the start. Video and smartphone consultations will allow well-insulated and high-risk medical practitioners to maintain their patient care security. Video appointments include diabetes, obesity, hypertension, stroke, mental health, chemotherapy and chronic pain. Many urgent diseases, including an emergency triage for the eye, may also be used for online consultations and triages. The COVID-19 pandemic shows that healthcare option for healthy healthcare and the potential to increase to a minimum, such as video consultations, have grown quickly.

Our paper focuses on video consulting privacy. This essay further presents the advantages and inconveniences of video consultation and its implementation. This paper suggests the most recent video encryption method known as high efficiency video coding selective encryption (HEVC SE).

The contribution is made with RC5, a low complexity computer, to encrypt subsets of bin-strings binarized in the HEVC sense using the context adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC) method through the bypass binary arithmetic coding. This sequence of binstrings consists of a non-zero differential transforming cosine (DCT) coefficient bit, MVD sign bits, remainder absolute DCT suffixes and absolute MVD suffixes. This paper also examines the efficiency assessment of the use of the RC5 with its modes of operations in the HEVC CABAC SE proposed. This study chooses the best operating mode for RC5 to be used for the healthcare video consultation application.

Methods This is a retrospective population-based cohort study. National ambient air quality monitoring network data were analysed to investigation variations in NO2 concentrations. Asthma hospital admissions data were collected from the HSE Hospital In-patient Enquiry (HIPE) for Cork, Dublin, and Meath. Results During the period of transport restrictions, there were reductions in the annual mean NO2 for Cork, Dublin and Meath (i.e. 12g/m3 to 11g/m3 (p = 1); 25g/m3 to 17g/m3 (p < 0.001); and 23g/m3 to 21g/m3 (p = 1)).

Barriers in access to early diagnosis and treatment of both acute and chronic infection and their complications have led to an increasing disease burden outside of Latin America. Our goal was to identify those barriers and to perform an additional analysis of them based on the Inter American Society of Cardiology (SIAC) and the World Heart Federation (WHF) Chagas Roadmap, at a country level in Argentina, Colombia, Spain, and the United States, which serve as representatives of endemic and nonendemic countries. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This is a nonsystematic review of articles published in indexed journals from 1955 to 2021 and of gray literature (local health organizations guidelines, local policies, blogs, and media). We classified barriers to access care as (i) existing difficulties limiting healthcare access; (ii) lack of awareness about CD and its complications; (iii) poor transmission control (vectorial and nonvectorial); (iv) scarce availability of antitrypanosomal drugs; and (v) cultural beliefs and stigma. Region-specific barriers may limit the implementation of roadmaps and require the application of tailored strategies to improve access to appropriate care. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple barriers negatively impact the prognosis of CD. Identification of these roadblocks both nationally and globally is important to guide development of appropriate policies and public health programs to reduce the global burden of this disease.","output":"Roadblocks in Chagas disease care in endemic and nonendemic countries: Argentina, Colombia, Spain, and the United States.

Participants with chronic axial low back pain were implanted with percutaneous PNS leads targeting the lumbar medial branch nerves for up to 60 days, after which the leads were removed. Participants were followed long-term for 12 months after the 2-month PNS treatment. Data collection is complete for visits through end of treatment with PNS (Primary Endpoint) and 6 months after lead removal (8 months after start of treatment), with some participant follow-up visits thereafter in progress. Clinically and statistically significant reductions in pain intensity, disability, and pain interference were reported by a majority of participants. Seventy-three percent of participants were successes for the Primary Endpoint, reporting clinically significant (30%) reductions in back pain intensity after the 2-month percutaneous PNS treatment (n=54/74). While prospective follow up is ongoing, among those who had already completed the long-term follow up visits (n=51), reductions in pain intensity, disability, and pain interference were sustained in a majority of participants through 14 months after the start of treatment. Given the minimally invasive, non-destructive nature of percutaneous PNS and the significant benefits experienced by participants who were recalcitrant to non-surgical treatments, percutaneous PNS may provide a promising first-line neurostimulation treatment option for patients with chronic axial back pain.","output":"Treatment of Chronic Axial Back Pain with 60-day Percutaneous Medial Branch PNS: Primary Endpoint Results from a Prospective, Multicenter Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To study the progression of a pandemic, the cumulative case numbers Zn, assigned to discrete time steps tn, are transferred into a continuously differentiable function Z(t) by means of a best least squares fit. In this setting, a reproduction- like number is introduced which is easily applicable to many different situations due to its handy analytical form. It can be understood as a cross between a volatile in- stantaneous reproduction number and the more robust effective reproduction number commonly used. Starting from it, a further quantity, termed acceleration parameter, is introduced, which facilitates a more differentiated characterization of the infection dynamics. In particular, it allows to determine precisely when the limit to exponential growth is reached and exceeded. In this context, the frequently encountered equaliza- tion of dangerous and exponential growth of the infection numbers is shown to be rather misleading. Hence it is extensively studied how different kinds of growth can be correctly described. In many situations exponential growth is just a timeless tran- sient between sub- and super-exponential growth, and, quite generally, it proves to be much more complex than commonly assumed. It turned out useful to incorporate the incidence as a further epidemiological indicator, and for comparison purposes the effective reproduction number is also included. A close relationship is found between the two. In addition, the incidence is used for calculating the trace that the progres- sion of the pandemic leaves behind on a plain spanned by itself and the acceleration parameter. This plane can be divided into a dangerous area, where the pandemic is uncontrollable, and a safer area that must be the target of mitigation efforts. At present, many countries and the world as a whole are mired in the dangerous area.

Exploiting firm-level longitudinal data, we analyse loan demand and credit rationing probabilities, accounting for sample selection, unobserved heterogeneity and state dependence. Empirical results show that small and informationally opaque businesses, with deteriorated public support and credit history, face greater difficulties in obtaining bank loans. Furthermore, we provide evidence of a significant degree of state dependence in access to credit. In particular, firms that have already experienced credit restrictions are more likely to face further constraints, while enterprises that applied for bank financing in the past seem to have easier access to credit. Focusing on the subset of firms actually needing additional bank financing, we also find that past credit restrictions significantly reduce their current demand, providing evidence of a significant discouragement effect.

We studied the incidence and features of CVR by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and associations with outcome and biomarkers of brain injury. METHODS A post-hoc analysis of 120 comatose OHCA patients continuously monitored with NIRS and randomised to low- or high-normal oxygen, carbon dioxide and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) targets for 48 h. The tissue oximetry index (TOx) generated by the moving correlation coefficient between cerebral tissue oxygenation measured by NIRS and MAP was used as a dynamic index of CVR with TOx > 0 indicating impaired reactivity and TOx > 0.3 used to delineate the lower and upper MAP bounds for disrupted CVR. TOx was analysed in the 0-12, 12-24, 24-48 h time-periods and integrated over 0-48 h. The primary outcome was the association between TOx and six-month functional outcome dichotomised by the cerebral performance category (CPC1-2 good vs. 3-5 poor). Secondary outcomes included associations with MAP bounds for CVR and biomarkers of brain injury. RESULTS In 108 patients with sufficient data to calculate TOx, 76 patients (70%) had impaired CVR and among these, chronic hypertension was more common (58% vs. 31%, p = 0.002). Integrated TOx for 0-48 h was higher in patients with poor outcome than in patients with good outcome (0.89 95% CI [- 1.17 to 2.94] vs. - 2.71 95% CI [- 4.16 to - 1.26], p = 0.05). Patients with poor outcomes had a decreased upper MAP bound of CVR over time (p = 0.001), including the high-normal oxygen (p = 0.002), carbon dioxide (p = 0.012) and MAP (p = 0.001) groups. The MAP range of maintained CVR was narrower in all time intervals and intervention groups (p < 0.05). NfL concentrations were higher in patients with impaired CVR compared to those with intact CVR (43 IQR [15-650] vs 20 IQR [13-199] pg/ml, p = 0.042). CONCLUSION Impaired CVR over 48 h was more common in patients with chronic hypertension and associated with poor outcome. Decreased upper MAP bound and a narrower MAP range for maintained CVR were associated with poor outcome and more severe brain injury assessed with NfL.

Developing and delivering a vaccine may be the most likely way to end the pandemic. If it were possible to shorten this development time by weeks or months, this may have a significant effect on reducing deaths. Phase II and phase III trials could take less long to conduct if they used human challenge methods-that is, deliberately infecting participants with COVID-19 following inoculation. This article analyses arguments for and against such methods and provides suggested broad guidelines for regulators, researchers and ethics committees when considering these matters. It concludes that it may be possible to maintain current ethical standards yet still permit human challenge trials in a context where delay is critical.

These features are widely used in the aerospace industry for producing lightweight with efficient structures. These structures are usually expensive to manufacture using conventional subtractive manufacturing processes. Therefore, this work involves checking the feasibility of design optimization for additive manufacturing(AM) of Isogrid and Non-Isogrid structure-based structural components subjected to impact loads. Izod impact test, as per ASTM D256, on seven specimens, were performed to check the energy that the material is capable of withstanding for the samples made using various AM parameters(layer height=0.2mm, feed rate 1800mm/min, bed temperature=70?C, Nozzle temperature= 210 ?C). Analysing the results of Izod impact test, the projectile velocity of impact for a trivial plate such as of 5mm thickness was used. The results from a trivial case impact test were used to predict the velocity of impact on the identical volume samples. The identical volume samples such as plate, plate stiffened by Isogrid without H-ribs, plate stiffened by Isogrid with H-ribs were used. Also, these results were correlated with simulations, and it was found that Isogrid stiffened plate with H-ribs was more stable.","output":"Isogrid lattice structure for armouring applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the telemedicine experience of an Italian ALS tertiary Center during COVID-19 pandemic.

Existing methods only consider the features of the microblog itself, without combining the semantics of emotion categories for modeling. Emotion classification of microblogs is a process of reading the content of microblogs and combining the semantics of emotion categories to understand whether it contains a certain emotion. Inspired by this, we propose an emotion classification model based on the emotion category description for COVID-19 Chinese microblogs. Firstly, we expand all emotion categories into formalized category descriptions. Secondly, based on the idea of question answering, we construct a question for each microblog in the form of What is the emotion expressed in the text X? and regard all category descriptions as candidate answers. Finally, we construct a question-and-answer pair and use it as the input of the BERT model to complete emotion classification. By integrating rich contextual and category semantics, the model can better understand the emotion of microblogs. Experiments on the COVID-19 Chinese microblog dataset show that our approach outperforms many existing emotion classification methods, including the BERT baseline. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Emotion Classification of COVID-19 Chinese Microblogs Based on the Emotion Category Description"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals still have to meet external regulations while delivering compassionate patient care.

The purpose of this reflections article is to share what has worked at my institution. INNOVATIONS: We found that calling family members to engage them in stroke education was a great option. They seemed engaged, took notes, and asked questions. Nurses document details from these phone encounters in the patient's medical record. Many people placed the call on speaker so other family members could listen to the education session. While family members were at home, telehealth nursing has its own set of challenges. Although telehealth is not a perfect solution, it was one we found most reasonable and found it to work well through this unprecedented time.

Prior studies have largely focused on individual-level solutions. To identify systems-based interventions, the Society of Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) formed the Research Equity Task Force in 2018 with members from multiple academies (the Academy of Academic Chairs in Emergency Medicine (AACEM), the Academy of Academic Administrators in Emergency Medicine (AAAEM), the Academy for Women in Academic Emergency Medicine (AWAEM), and the Academy for Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency Medicine (ADIEM), and sought recommendations from EM departmental leaders. METHODS The taskforce conducted interviews containing both open-ended narrative and closed-ended questions in multiple phases. Phase 1 included a convenience sample of chairs of EM departments across the U.S., and phase 2 included vice-chairs and other faculty who lead promotion and advancement. The taskforce identified common themes from the interviews and then developed three-tiered sets of recommendations (minimal, target, and aspirational) based on participant responses. In phase 3, iterative feedback was collected and implemented on these recommendations from study participants and chairs participating in a national AACEM webinar. RESULTS In findings from 53 interviews of chairs, vice-chairs, and faculty leaders from across the U.S., we noted heterogeneity in the faculty development and promotion processes across institutions. Four main themes were identified from the interviews: the need for a directed, structured promotion process, provision of structured mentorship, clarity on requirements for promotion within tracks, and transparency in salary structure. Recommendations were developed to address gaps in structured mentorship and equitable promotion and compensation. CONCLUSIONS These recommendations for AEM departments have the potential to increase structured mentorship programs, improve equity in promotion and advancement, and reduce disparities in the AEM workforce.

Based on the established relationship between altered membrane dipole potential and transmembrane protein conformation and function, we investigate here polyphenols' ability to induce changes in cell membrane dipole potential. Ultimately, we are interested in finding a tool to prevent polyphenol PAINS-type behavior and produce compounds less prone to untargeted and promiscuous interactions with the cell membrane.

Inflammation is a critical mediator in retinal degeneration (RD) diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and RD progression may be prevented through anti-inflammatory activity in RPE cells. The flavonoid polyphenol luteolin (LU) has anti-inflammatory and antidiabetes activities, but its effects regarding retinal protection remain unknown. Here, we examined the ability of luteolin to alleviate markers of inflammation related to RD in cytokine-primed APPE-19 cells. We found that luteolin decreased the levels of interleukin- (IL-) 6, IL-8, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and attenuated adherence of the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 to IL-1-stimulated ARPE-19 cells. Luteolin also increased anti-inflammatory protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels. Interestingly, luteolin induced protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation, thus inhibiting nuclear factor- (NF-) B transfer from cytoplasm into the nucleus and suppressing mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, cotreatment with MAPK inhibitors and luteolin decreased inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels, and further suppressed THP-1 adhesion. Overall, these results provide evidence that luteolin protects ARPE-19 cells from IL-1-stimulated increases of IL-6, IL-8, sICAM-1, and MCP-1 production by blocking the activation of MAPK and NF-B signaling pathways, thus ameliorating the inflammatory response.","output":"Luteolin Attenuates IL-1-Induced THP-1 Adhesion to ARPE-19 Cells via Suppression of NF-B and MAPK Pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immune cells are important for the healthy function of every organ.

Several studies have addressed the various characteristics of ICUAW, but the recovery is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: The present review investigated the recovery and the long-term functional outcome of subjects with ICUAW, whether the types of ICUAW have different outcomes and whether there is any supporting evidence. METHODS: Literature search was performed from MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PeDro, Web of Science and Scopus. Inclusion criteria were: i) sample size including five or more subjects; ii) subjects who suffered from ICUAW and/or CIP, CIM and CIP/CIM; iii) ICUAW ascertained by EMG. Follow-ups longer than one year were defined as long-term. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. In total, 788 subjects with ICUAW were enrolled: 159 (20.1%) died and 588 (74.6%) were followed. Of all the included patients, 613 (77.7%) had CIP, 82 (10.4%) CIM and 56 (7.1%) CIP/CIM. Overall, 70.3% of the subjects with ICUAW fully recovered. Seven (24.1%) studies had a follow-up longer than 1 year (range 2C8) with 173 (21.9%) subjects enrolled globally and 108 followed. Of these subjects, 88.8% gained full recovery. Most of the studies did not use proper functional scales and only 4 and 3 studies employed the Barthel scale and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scale. Differentiation between the types of ICUAW was performed in 7 studies, but only 3 studies reported that subjects with CIM had a better prognosis and earlier recovery than subjects with CIP/CIM.

DESIGN: Multi-institutional survey regarding inpatient resuscitation practices during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. SETTING: Internet-based survey. SUBJECTS: U.S. PICU representatives (one per institution) involved in resuscitation system planning and oversight. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 130 institutions surveyed, 78 (60%) responded. Forty-eight centers (62%) had admitted coronavirus disease 2019 patients; 26 (33%) reported code team activation for patients with suspected/confirmed coronavirus disease 2019. Sixty-seven respondents (86%) implemented changes to inpatient emergency response systems. The most common changes were as follows: limited number of personnel entering patient rooms (75; 96%), limited resident involvement (71; 91%), and new or refined team roles (74; 95%). New or adapted technology is being used for coronavirus disease 2019 resuscitations in 58 centers (74%). Most institutions (57; 73%) are using enhanced personal protective equipment for all coronavirus disease 2019 resuscitation events; 18 (23%) have personal protective equipment policies dependent on the performance of aerosol generating procedures. Due to coronavirus disease 2019, most respondents are intubating earlier during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (56; 72%), utilizing video laryngoscopy (67; 86%), pausing chest compressions during laryngoscopy (56; 72%), and leaving patients connected to the ventilator during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (56; 72%).

Based on the unique affinity between dermatan sulfate and autoantigens, we identified 348 proteins from human lung A549 cells, of which 198 are known targets of autoantibodies. Comparison with current COVID data identified 291 proteins that are altered at protein or transcript level in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 191 being known autoantigens. These known and putative autoantigens are significantly associated with viral replication and trafficking processes, including gene expression, ribonucleoprotein biogenesis, mRNA metabolism, translation, vesicle and vesicle-mediated transport, and apoptosis. They are also associated with cytoskeleton, platelet degranulation, IL-12 signaling, and smooth muscle contraction. Host proteins that interact with and that are perturbed by viral proteins are a major source of autoantigens. Orf3 induces the largest number of protein alterations, Orf9 affects the mitochondrial ribosome, and they and E, M, N, and Nsp proteins affect protein localization to membrane, immune responses, and apoptosis.

The stochastic part of the framework is based on Bayesian inference. The model is informed by the actual COVID-19 data and the current epidemiological findings about the disease. The framework combines many available data sources (number of positive cases, number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care, etc.) to make outputs as accurate as possible and incorporates the times of non-pharmaceutical governmental interventions which were adopted worldwide to slow-down the pandemic. The model estimates the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, the number of infected individuals and the number of patients in different disease progression states in time. It can be used for estimating current infection fatality rate, proportion of individuals not detected and short term forecasting of important indicators for monitoring the state of the healthcare system. With the prediction of the number of patients in hospitals and intensive care units, policy makers could make data driven decisions to potentially avoid overloading the capacities of the healthcare system. The model is applied to Slovene COVID-19 data showing the effectiveness of the adopted interventions for controlling the epidemic by reducing the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. It is estimated that the proportion of infected people in Slovenia was among the lowest in Europe (0.350%, 90% CI [0.245-0.573]%), that infection fatality rate in Slovenia until the end of first wave was 1.56% (90% CI [0.94-2.21]%) and the proportion of unidentified cases was 88% (90% CI [83-93]%). The proposed framework can be extended to more countries/regions, thus allowing for comparison between them.

Understanding brain function in individuals with high levels of reactive aggression as they process anger- and aggression-eliciting stimuli is critical for refining interventions. Three neurobiological models of reactive aggressionCthe limbic hyperactivity, prefrontal hypoactivity, and dysregulated limbic-prefrontal connectivity modelsChave been proposed. However, these models are based on neuroimaging studies involving mainly healthy individuals, leaving it unclear which model best describes brain function in aggression-prone individuals. Methods We conducted a systematic literature search (PubMed and Psycinfo) and Multilevel Kernel Density meta-analysis (MKDA) of nine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of brain responses to tasks putatively eliciting anger and aggression in aggression-prone individuals alone, and relative to healthy controls. Results Aggression-prone individuals exhibited greater activity during reactive aggression relative to baseline in the superior temporal gyrus and in regions comprising the cognitive control and default mode networks (right posterior cingulate cortex, precentral gyrus, precuneus, right inferior frontal gyrus). Compared to healthy controls, aggression-prone individuals exhibited increased activity in limbic regions (left hippocampus, left amygdala, left parahippocampal gyrus) and temporal regions (superior, middle, inferior temporal gyrus), and reduced activity in occipital regions (left occipital cortex, left calcarine cortex). Conclusions These findings lend support to the limbic hyperactivity model and further indicate altered temporal and occipital activity in anger- and aggression-eliciting situations that involve face and speech processing.","output":"Brain responses in aggression-prone individuals: A systematic review and meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of anger- and aggression-eliciting tasks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All pandemics are local;so learning about the impacts of pandemics on public health and related societal issues at granular levels is of great interest COVID-19 is affecting everyone in the globe and mask wearing is one of the few precautions against it To quantify people's perception of mask effectiveness and to prevent the spread of COVID-19 for small areas, we use Understanding America Study's (UAS) survey data on COVID-19 as our primary data source Our data analysis shows that direct survey-weighted estimates for small areas could be highly unreliable In this paper we develop a synthetic estimation method to estimate proportions of mask effectiveness for small areas using a logistic model that combines information from multiple data sources We select our working model using an extensive data analysis facilitated by a new variable selection criterion for survey data and benchmarking ratios We propose a Jackknife method to estimate variance of our proposed estimator From our data analysis it is evident that our proposed synthetic method outperforms direct survey-weighted estimator with respect to commonly used evaluation measures","output":"Estimation of mask effectiveness perception for small domains using multiple data sources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The S1 protein of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a major structural protein that induces the production of the virus-neutralization antibodies.

While the quality of antibody testing, the availability of vaccines, and the likelihood of even attaining COVID-19 immunity continue to be researched, we address the issues involved in providing tamper-proof and privacy-preserving certification for test results and vaccinations. Methods: We developed a prototype mobile phone app and requisite decentralized server architecture that facilitates instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personally identifiable information is only stored at the user's discretion, and the app allows the end-user selectively to present only the specific test result with no other personal information revealed. The architecture, designed for scalability, relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called 'Verifiable Credentials', (b) Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized personal data platform 'Solid', and (c) a Consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Results: Our mobile phone app and decentralized server architecture enable the mixture of verifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and digital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive digital keys and/or data. Benchmark performance tests show it to scale linearly in the worst case, as significant processing is done locally on each app. For the test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. healthcare staff, pharmacy) and Verifier (e.g. employer), it is 'just another app' which takes only minutes to use.

However, existing therapeutics against PD-L1, including small molecule inhibitors, have certain drawbacks such as high cost and drug resistance that challenge the currently available anti-PD-L1 therapy. Therefore, this study presents the screening of 32,552 compounds from the Natural Product Atlas database against PD-L1, including three steps of structure-based virtual screening followed by binding free energy to refine the ideal conformation of potent PD-L1 inhibitors. Subsequently, five natural compounds, i.e., Neoenactin B1, Actinofuranone I, Cosmosporin, Ganocapenoid A, and 3-[3-hydroxy-4-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)phenyl]-5-(4-hydroxybenzyl)-4-methyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-one, were collected based on the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profiling and binding free energy (>?60 kcal/mol) for further computational investigation in comparison to co-crystallized ligand, i.e., JQT inhibitor. Based on interaction mapping, explicit 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation, and end-point binding free energy calculations, the selected natural compounds were marked for substantial stability with PD-L1 via intermolecular interactions (hydrogen and hydrophobic) with essential residues in comparison to the JQT inhibitor. Collectively, the calculated results advocate the selected natural compounds as the putative potent inhibitors of PD-L1 and, therefore, can be considered for further development of PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer immunotherapy.","output":"Computational Investigations on the Natural Small Molecule as an Inhibitor of Programmed Death Ligand 1 for Cancer Immunotherapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic.

This analysis seeks to understand how mobility reductions reduce the spread of the coronavirus (SAR-CoV-2), using readily available data sources. METHODS: Mobility data from Google is correlated with estimates of the effective reproduction rate, R(t), which is a measure of viral infectiousness (Google, 2020). The Google mobility data provides estimates of reductions in mobility, for six types of trips and activities. R(t) for US states are downloaded from an on-line platform that derives daily estimates based on data from the Covid Tracking Project (Wissel et al., 2020; Systrom et al., 2020). Fixed effects models are estimated relating mean R(t) and 80% upper level credible interval estimates to changes in mobility and a time-trend value and with both 7-day and 14-day lags. RESULTS: All mobility variables are correlated with median R(t) and the upper level credible interval of R(t). Staying at home is effective at reducing R(t,). Time spent at parks has a small positive effect, while other activities all have larger positive effects. The time trend is negative suggesting increases in self-protective behavior. Predictions suggest that returning to baseline levels of activity for retail, transit, and workplaces, will increase R(t) above 1.0, but not for other activities. Mobility reductions of about 20C40% are needed to achieve an R(t) below 1.0 (for the upper level 80% credible interval) and even larger reductions to achieve an R(t) below 0.7. CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers need to be cautious with encouraging return to normal mobility behavior, especially returns to workplaces, transit, and retail locations.

However, organisations eventually need to plan for the return of employees to office spaces by ensuring their bio-safety. While symptomatic employees can be screened out from buildings, asymptomatic employees can be handled mainly through social distancing. Using rules of thumb and being conservative (aggressive) in social distancing can lead to poor office space/energy utilisation (compromised bio-safety). Thus, there is a need for informed decision making about occupancy to ensure bio-safety. To this end, we consider the problem of maximising the office space utilisation while ensuring occupant bio-safety and comfort. Specifically, we algorithmically identify the maximum allowable occupancy and corresponding occupant placement in open-plan office space while bounding their likelihood of infection from the office. As a secondary objective, when the required occupancy is less than the maximum allowable, we consider the problem of minimising HVAC energy through the joint control of multiple actuators that serve the space. In addition to the temperature and humidity dynamics, we account for the spatial and temporal evolution of infection transmission in the office space. To the best of our knowledge, there is little prior work on joint bio-safety and comfort optimization. The optimization problem is computationally hard due to the underlying non-linear system dynamics. We present two greedy heuristics to solve the problems of maximising space utilisation and minimising the HVAC energy when feasible. We evaluate our approach using simulations for varying community infection rates, occupant exposure duration, and virus emission rate. Our approach performs better than standard regular placements that ensure a minimum separation between neighbours. For the range of parameters considered, our approach improves space utilization by at least 10% for the same new infection rate. Further, when the required occupancy is less than the maximum allowable, HVAC energy can reduce by up to 15% even while ensuring bio-safety. ? 2020 ACM.","output":"Keep it open, Keep it safe: Maximizing Space Utilization in Intelligent Bio-safe Buildings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an enveloped RNA virus that is diversely found in humans and wildlife A total of six species have been identified to cause disease in humans They are known to infect the neurological, respiratory, enteric, and hepatic systems The past few decades have seen endemic outbreaks in the form of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) Yet again, we see the emergence of another outbreak due to a new strain called the SARS-CoV-2 virus The most recent outbreak initially presented as pneumonia of unknown etiology in a cluster of patients in Wuhan, China The epicenter of infection was linked to seafood and exotic animal wholesale markets in the city SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has resulted in a rapid pandemic of COVID-19 As the number of cases continues to rise, it is clear that these viruses pose a threat to public health This review will introduce a general overview of coronavirus and describe the clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of COVID-19 patients It will also provide a means to raise awareness among primary and secondary healthcare providers during the current pandemic Furthermore, our review focuses on the most up-to-date clinical information for the effective management, prevention, and counseling of patients worldwide","output":"Coronavirus (COVID-19): A Review of Clinical Features, Diagnosis, and Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the international community goes digital due to the state of affairs, it may be deemed that gamification is on the rise.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to reveal how China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses social media to improve three aspects of health communication between the government and the public: adoption, operation, and interaction. METHODS: To analyze the 134 CDC government Weibo accounts at the provincial- and prefecture-level administration regions in mainland China, we collected their account data and extracted 1215 Weibo tweets. We also supplemented the data to reveal the overall performance of the CDC's government Weibo use during the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS: The registration rate of the CDC's government Weibo accounts increased year by year, and the local authorities registered Weibo accounts before the central government authorities. In total, 29.8% (n=134) of the 450 CDC facilities have registered an account. Among the 134 CDC facilities that have registered Weibo accounts, the registration rate in the eastern region (n=68, 50.7%) was higher than those in the central region (n=30, 22.4%) and the western region (n=36, 26.9%). Nearly 90.0% of these Weibo accounts had official certification, but there were dropouts in the specific operating process. One-third of the accounts have not been updated for more than 1 year, and the number of Weibo followers was polarized, with a maximum and minimum difference of 1 million.

The therapy of this condition in patients with COVID-19 infection requires an individualized approach to achieve a precise balance between the risk of severe bleeding and of thromboembolic events. CONCLUSION: Causal relationship between COVID-19 infection and these autoimmune events still requires further studies. We should all have in mind the risk of development of hematologic autoimmune disorders in infected patients.","output":"Hematologic autoimmune manifestation secondary to coronavirus disease 19 infection C a single-center experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic in the United States is widespread, with more than 200,000 deaths reported as of September 23, 2020. While ecological studies show higher burdens of COVID-19 mortality in areas with higher rates of poverty, little is known about social determinants of COVID-19 mortality at the individual level. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimated the proportions of COVID-19 deaths by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbid conditions using their reported univariate proportions among COVID-19 deaths and correlations among these variables in the general population from the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We used these proportions to randomly sample individuals from NHANES. We analyzed the distributions of COVID-19 deaths by race/ethnicity, income, education level, and veteran status. We analyzed the association of these characteristics with mortality by logistic regression. Summary demographics of deaths include mean age 71.6 years, 45.9% female, and 45.1% non-Hispanic white. We found that disproportionate deaths occurred among individuals with nonwhite race/ethnicity (54.8% of deaths, 95% CI 49.0%-59.6%, p < 0.001), individuals with income below the median (67.5%, 95% CI 63.4%-71.5%, p < 0.001), individuals with less than a high school level of education (25.6%, 95% CI 23.4% -27.9%, p < 0.001), and veterans (19.5%, 95% CI 15.8%-23.4%, p < 0.001). Except for veteran status, these characteristics are significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality in multiple logistic regression. Limitations include the lack of institutionalized people in the sample (e.g., nursing home residents and incarcerated persons), the need to use comorbidity data collected from outside the US, and the assumption of the same correlations among variables for the noninstitutionalized population and COVID-19 decedents. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial inequalities in COVID-19 mortality are likely, with disproportionate burdens falling on those who are of racial/ethnic minorities, are poor, have less education, and are veterans. Healthcare systems must ensure adequate access to these groups. Public health measures should specifically reach these groups, and data on social determinants should be systematically collected from people with COVID-19.","output":"Social determinants of mortality from COVID-19: A simulation study using NHANES"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The negative impacts of COVID-19 have rippled through every facet of society. Understanding the multidimensional impacts of this pandemic is crucial to identify the most critical needs and to inform targeted interventions. This population survey study aimed to investigate the acute phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of perceived threats and concerns, occupational and financial impacts, social impacts and stress between 3 April and 15 May 2020. METHODS: 6040 participants are included in this report. A multivariate linear regression model was used to identify factors associated with stress changes (as measured by the Cohens Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)) relative to pre-outbreak retrospective estimates. RESULTS: On average, PSS scores increased from low stress levels before the outbreak to moderate stress levels during the outbreak (p<0.001). The independent factors associated with stress worsening were: having a mental disorder, female sex, having underage children, heavier alcohol consumption, working with the general public, shorter sleep duration, younger age, less time elapsed since the start of the outbreak, lower stress before the outbreak, worse symptoms that could be linked to COVID-19, lower coping skills, worse obsessiveCcompulsive symptoms related to germs and contamination, personalities loading on extraversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism, left wing political views, worse family relationships and spending less time exercising and doing artistic activities. CONCLUSION: Cross-sectional analyses showed a significant increase from low to moderate stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. Identified modifiable factors associated with increased stress may be informative for intervention development.

Antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii were detected in ostriches from South and North America, Africa and Asia. Except for one study from Spain, there is a lack of information about T. gondii seroprevalence in ostriches from Europe. For this reason, the aim of the study was to detect antibodies to T. gondii in farm-reared ostriches from the Czech Republic. Serum samples of 409 ostriches (Struthio camelus), collected at 9 farms were tested by Latex agglutination test. Antibodies to T. gondii were detected in 149 (36%) birds with a statistical difference for individual farms (8%-71%, p = 0.0121), and regions (8%-65%, p = 0.002). Seropositivity did not statistically differ (p > 0.05) in size of farms (50% and 35% on small and large farms, respectively), sex of birds (38% and 35% in males and females, respectively), season and year of collection. Tissue samples (brain, heart, and pectoral muscle) of 105 birds were also tested by PCR to detect T. gondii DNA. The parasite T. gondii was detected in the brain and heart of one seronegative ostrich (1%) from a small farm. Based on our results, we can assume that ostriches may present high risk of toxoplasmosis for humans through consumption of raw or undercooked ostrich meat and even seronegative individuals could harbor T. gondii in their tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first serological detection of T. gondii in ostriches in the Czech Republic, and the first PCR detection in Europe.","output":"Serological and molecular detection of Toxoplasma gondii in farm-reared ostriches (Struthio camelus) in the Czech Republic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are increasingly used to track symptoms and to assess disease activity, quality of life, and treatment effectiveness.

At m3, pts prioritized up to 5 measures. Measures were rank-ordered, summed, and weighted based on pts rating to produce a summary score for each PRO measure. RESULTS: Among pts who completed initial selection of PRO assessments at baseline (N = 253), 140 pts confirmed or changed PRO selections across m1-3 within the specified monthly time window (28 days  7). PROs ranked as most important for tracking were PROMIS Fatigue, Physical Function, Pain Intensity, Pain Interference, Duration of Morning Joint Stiffness, and Sleep Disturbance.

Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic in March 2020 and has changed our lives in many ways. This infection induces a hypercoagulable state leading to arterial and venous thrombosis, but the exact pathophysiology of thrombosis is unknown. However, various theories have been postulated including excessive cytokine release, endothelial activation, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). We present a patient diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with COVID-19 infection. A 66-year-old man presented to a hospital for evaluation of persistent headaches. He tested positive for COVID-19, and MRI of the brain and CT venogram revealed CVST. He was started on heparin drip in the hospital and transitioned to oral anticoagulants at the time of discharge. His headaches improved with treatment. Even though headache is the most frequent and initial symptom of cerebral venous thrombosis, it is rarely the only symptom. A high index of suspicion is therefore required to diagnose CVST especially if the patient presents with a simple complaint like a headache. Common complaints can delay the diagnosis leading to disease progression. Considering the high mortality rates in patients diagnosed with CVST, we suggest the importance of knowing the association between COVID-19 infection and CVST, especially in susceptible patients.","output":"Case Report: Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis and COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The constant progress in novel nanomaterials synthesis has contributed to the rapid development of nonenzymatic glucose sensors.

In this study, we prepared solutions based on commonly reported polymers for nanostructures immobilization and investigated their influence on copper sulfides distribution on the electrode. Characterization of suspensions properties and behavior of particles during droplet drying revealed that nonionic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was favorable for electrodes modification with copper sulfides in comparison with Nafion and chitosan. It ensured homogeneity of the suspension as well as the uniform coverage of the electrode surface with particles, what resulted in increased active surface area and, therefore, higher signal from glucose addition. On the other hand, when cationic chitosan was used as a binder, suspensions were agglomerated and, within dry deposits, a coffee-ring effect was observed.

However, the global pandemic and immune evasion of Omicron variant poses a huge challenge to China. Currently, about 87.69% of the Chinese population has been vaccinated, most with inactivated vaccines. Although seroepidemiological data on the vaccinated are lacking, published data suggested that even a homologous booster of an inactivated vaccine displayed very limited neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant and that neutralizing activity was significantly lower than that of a heterologous booster or mRNA vaccine alone. A great concern is whether the neutralizing antibodies induced by inactivated vaccines can provide sufficient protection against the Omicron variant since local transmission of the Omicron variant is now occurring in China. The era of extraordinary NPIs by governments and countries to control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is going to change.

Elevation and air quality are believed to be significant factors in the development of the pandemic, but the influence of additional environmental factors remains unclear. METHODS: We explored the relationship between the cumulative number of infections and mortality cases with climate (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, water vapor pressure, wind), environmental data (elevation, normalized difference vegetation index or NDVI, particulate matter at 2.5 m or PM2.5 and NO2 concentration), and population density in Peru. We use confirmed cases of infection from 1,287 districts and mortality in 479 districts, we used Spearman's correlations to assess the bivariate correlation between environmental and climatic factors with cumulative infection cases, cumulative mortality and case-fatality rate. We explored district cases within the ecozones of coast, sierra, high montane forest and lowland rainforest. RESULTS: Multiple linear regression models indicate elevation, mean solar radiation, air quality, population density and green vegetation cover, as a socioeconomic proxy, are influential factors in the distribution of infection and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in Peru. Case-fatality rate was weakly associated with elevation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results also strongly suggest that exposure to poor air quality is a significant factor in the mortality of individuals below the age of 30.

Oncology nurse burnout is likely to be an increasingly significant issue for cancer services as the true cost of the pandemic is revealed. Delays in diagnosis and treatment of cancers are reported widely, inevitably leading to poor prognosis and more aggressive treatments for patients. Gaining a better understanding of oncology nurse burnout, its prevalence and causes as well as strategies to reduce or prevent it will help to improve patient care and support staff wellbeing during and after the pandemic. Methodology: A search of the literature related to oncology nurse burnout, covering North America and Europe over 5 years (August 2014-January 2020), resulted in 31 articles for review. None of the studies were carried out in the UK, suggesting a need for robust investigations into oncology nurse burnout in the British health service. Summary: The prevalence of burnout among oncology nurses before the COVID-19 outbreak appeared to be high and is likely to have increased as a result of the pandemic. However, the studies investigating oncology nurse burnout are small and cross-sectional, with low-quality methods. The literature suggests the major causes of burnout arise in the workplace, particularly aspects of the environment that prevent nurses from working according to their values.

However, for any given BMI, individuals vary substantially in fat distribution. The clinical implications of this variability are not fully understood.

Using previously quantified visceral (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous (ASAT), and gluteofemoral (GFAT) adipose tissue volume in up to 9,041 to train convolutional neural networks, we quantified these depots in the remainder of the participants. We derived new metrics for each adipose depot - fully independent of BMI - by quantifying deviation from values predicted by BMI (e.g. VAT adjusted for BMI, VATadjBMI) and determined associations with cardiometabolic diseases. Results Machine learning models based on two-dimensional projection images enabled near-perfect estimation of VAT, ASAT, and GFAT, with r2 in a holdout testing dataset >0.97 for each. Using the newly derived measures of local adiposity - residualized based on BMI - we note marked heterogeneity in associations with cardiometabolic diseases.

The purpose of this study was to compare how treatment with convalescent plasma (CP) monotherapy, remdesivir (RDV) monotherapy, and combination therapy (CP + RDV) in patients with COVID-19 affected clinical outcomes. Methods: This retrospective observational study was conducted between May-August 2020 at a 150-bed academic community hospital in San Joaquin County, California. Patients with COVID-19 infection who were hospitalized during the study period received CP, RDV, or a combination of both. Clinical outcomes including mortality, discharge disposition, hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, and total ventilation days were compared between each treatment group and stratified by ABO blood group. An exploratory analysis identified risk factors for mortality. Adverse effects were also evaluated. Results: A total of 213 patients with COVID-19 were admitted and 106 patients received one of the three prespecified treatments during the study period. 53 received CP alone, 11 received RDV alone, and 42 received combination therapy. RDV monotherapy showed an increased chance of survival compared to combination therapy or CP monotherapy (p = 0.052) (Figure 1). There were 15, 3, and 6 deaths in the CP, RDV, and CP + RDV groups, respectively. The median number of ventilation days was the longest in the CP + RDV group (8, IQR 4.5-14, p = 0.091). The median ICU length of stay was also longest in the CP + RDV group (8, IQR 4.5-15.5, p = 0.220). The median hospital length of stay was longest in the CP group (11, IQR 7-15.5, p = 0.175). Age (p = 0.036), initial SOFA score (p = 0.013), and intubation (p = 0.005) were statistically significant predictors of mortality. Patients with type O blood had less ventilation days, ICU LOS, and total LOS but the difference was not statistically significant. Thirteen treatment-related adverse events occurred. Conclusion: No significant differences in clinical outcomes including mortality, length of stay, or total ventilator days were observed between hospitalized patients with COVID 19 treated with RDV, CP, or CP + RDV.

Murine betacoronavirus (-CoV) in group A uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein to bind to its receptor, whereas the -CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV in group B and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV in group C and several -CoVs use the downstream C domain in their S proteins to recognize their receptor proteins. To identify the receptor-binding domain in the spike of human -CoV HKU1 in group A, we generated and mapped a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the ectodomain of HKU1 spike protein. They did not cross-react with S proteins of any other CoV tested. Most of the HKU1 spike MAbs recognized epitopes in the C domain between amino acids 535 and 673, indicating that this region is immunodominant. Two of the MAbs blocked HKU1 virus infection of primary human tracheal-bronchial epithelial (HTBE) cells. Preincubation of HTBE cells with a truncated HKU1 S protein that includes the C domain blocked infection with HKU1 virus, but preincubation of cells with truncated S protein containing only the NTD did not block infection. These data suggest that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of HKU1 spike protein is located in the C domain, where the spike proteins of -CoVs and -CoVs in groups B and C bind to their specific receptor proteins. Thus, two -CoVs in group A, HKU1 and murine CoV, have evolved to use different regions of their spike glycoproteins to recognize their respective receptor proteins. IMPORTANCE Mouse hepatitis virus, a -CoV in group A, uses the galectin-like NTD in its spike protein to bind its receptor protein, while HCoV-OC43, another -CoV in group A, uses the NTD to bind to its sialic-acid containing receptor. In marked contrast, the NTD of the spike glycoprotein of human respiratory -CoV HKU1, which is also in group A, does not bind sugar. In this study, we showed that for the spike protein of HKU1, the purified C domain, downstream of the NTD, could block HKU1 virus infection of human respiratory epithelial cells, and that several monoclonal antibodies that mapped to the C domain neutralized virus infectivity. Thus, the receptor-binding domain of HKU1 spike glycoprotein is located in the C domain.

Evidence suggests that individuals previously exposed to traumatic events, and particularly to continuous traumatic stress (CTS), might be more vulnerable to distress when facing additional stressors. This study aimed to investigate these suppositions in the context of the ongoing shelling of Israel from the Israel-Gaza border, which continues even amidst the COVID-19 crisis. METHOD: An online survey was conducted among Israel's general population. The sample included 976 participants. Seven-hundred-and-ninety-three participants had been exposed to traumatic events, with 255 participants reporting CTS. Trauma exposure, COVID-19-related stressors, and psychological distress related to COVID-19 (anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms) were assessed. RESULTS: Most participants reported experiencing at least one psychiatric symptom related to COVID-19. Being younger, female, not in a relationship, having a below-average income, being diagnosed with the disease, living alone during the outbreak, having a close other in a high-risk group, and negatively self-rating one's health status were associated with elevated distress. Individuals who had been exposed to trauma, and to CTS in particular, had elevated anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms compared to individuals without such a history or to survivors of non-ongoing traumatic events. CTS moderated the relations between PTSD symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and peritraumatic stress symptoms, with significantly stronger relations found among individuals exposed to CTS.

During mass PCR testing, a total of 430 cases infected with Omicron were recorded between January 8 and February 7, 2022, with no new infections detected for the following 16 days. Most patients had been vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccines. The disease profile associated with BA.1 infection, especially after vaccination with inactivated vaccines, is unclear. Whether BA.1 breakthrough infection after receiving inactivated vaccine could create a strong enough humoral immunity barrier against Omicron is not yet investigated. MethodsWe collected the clinical information and vaccination history of the 430 COVID-19 patients infected with Omicron BA.1. Re-positive cases and inflammation markers were monitored during the patients convalescence phase. Ordered multiclass logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors for COVID-19 disease severity. Authentic virus neutralization assays against SARS-CoV-2 wildtype, Beta and Omicron BA.1 were conducted to examine the plasma neutralizing titers induced after post-vaccination Omicron BA.1 infection, and were compared to a group of uninfected healthy individuals who were selected to have a matched vaccination profile. FindingsAmong the 430 patients, 316 (73.5%) were adults with a median age of 47 years, and 114 (26.5%) were under-age with a median age of 10 years. Female and male patients account for 55.6% and 44.4%, respectively. Most of the patients presented with mild (47.7%) to moderate diseases (50.2%), with only 2 severe cases (0.5%) and 7 (1.6%) asymptomatic infections. No death was recorded. 341 (79.3%) of the 430 patients received inactivated vaccines (54.3% BBIBP-CorV vs. 45.5% CoronaVac), 49 (11.4%) received adenovirus-vectored vaccines (Ad5-nCoV), 2 (0.5%) received recombinant protein subunit vaccines (ZF2001), and 38 (8.8%) received no vaccination. No vaccination is associated with a substantially higher ICU admission rate among Omicron BA.1 infected patients (2.0% for vaccinated patients vs. 23.7% for unvaccinated patients, P<0.001). Compared with adults, child patients presented with less severe illness (82.5% mild cases for children vs. 35.1% for adults, P<0.001), no ICU admission, fewer comorbidities (3.5% vs. 53.2%, P<0.001), and less chance of turning re-positive on nucleic acid tests (12.3% vs. 22.5%, P=0.019). For adult patients, compared with no prior vaccination, receiving 3 doses of inactivated vaccine was associated with significantly lower risk of severe disease (OR 0.227 [0.065-0.787], P=0.020), less ICU admission (OR 0.023 [0.002-0.214], P=0.001), lower re-positive rate on PCR (OR 0.240 [0.098-0.587], P=0.002), and shorter duration of hospitalization and recovery (OR 0.233 [0.091-0.596], P=0.002). At the beginning of the convalescence phase, patients who had received 3 doses of inactivated vaccine had substantially lower systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and C-reactive protein than unvaccinated patients, while CD4+/CD8+ ratio, activated Treg cells and Th1/Th2 ratio were higher compared to their 2-dose counterparts, suggesting that receipt of 3 doses of inactivated vaccine could step up inflammation resolution after infection. Plasma neutralization titers against Omicron, Beta, and wildtype significantly increased after breakthrough infection with Omicron. Moderate symptoms were associated with higher plasma neutralization titers than mild symptoms. However, vaccination profiles prior to infection, whether 2 doses versus 3 doses or types of vaccines, had no significant effect on post-infection neutralization titer. Among recipients of 3 doses of CoronaVac, infection with Omicron BA.1 largely increased neutralization titers against Omicron BA.1 (8.7x), Beta (4.5x), and wildtype (2.2x), compared with uninfected healthy individuals who have a matched vaccination profile. InterpretationReceipt of 3-dose inactivated vaccines can substantially reduce the disease severity of Omicron BA.1 infection, with most vaccinated patients presenting with mild to moderate illness. Child patients present with less severe disease than adult patients after infection. Omicron BA.1 convalescents who had received inactivated vaccines showed significantly increased plasma neutralizing antibody titers against Omicron BA.1, Beta, and wildtype SARS-CoV-2 compared with vaccinated healthy individuals.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPrevious studies (many of which have not been peer-reviewed) have reported inconsistent findings regarding the effect of inactivated vaccines against the Omicron variant. On Mar 6, 2022, we searched PubMed with the query \\"(SARS-CoV-2) AND ((Neutralisation) OR (Neutralisation)) AND ((Omicron) OR (BA.1)) AND (inactivated vaccine)\\", without date or language restrictions. This search identified 18 articles, of which 13 were directly relevant. Notably, the participants in many of these studies have received only one or two doses of inactivated vaccine with heterologous booster vaccination; other studies have a limited number of participants receiving inactivated vaccines. Added value of this studyTo date, this is the first study to report on the protective effect of inactivated vaccines against the severe disease caused by the Omicron variant. We examine and compare the disease profile of adults and children. Furthermore, we estimate the effect of post-vaccination omicron infection on plasma neutralization titers against Omicron and other SARS-COV-2 variants. Specifically, the disease profile of Omicron convalescents who had received two-dose primary series of inactivated vaccines with or without a booster dose prior to infection is compared with unvaccinated patients. We also analyzed the effect of infection on neutralizing activity by comparing vaccinated convalescents with vaccinated healthy individuals with matched vaccination profiles. Implications of all the available evidenceCompared with adults, child patients infected with Omicron tend to present with less severe disease and are less likely to turn re-positive on nucleic acid tests. Receipt of two-dose primary series or three doses of inactivated vaccine is a protective factor against severe disease, ICU admission, re-positive PCR and longer hospitalization. The protection afforded by a booster dose is stronger than two-dose primary series alone. Besides vaccination, infection with Omicron is also a key factor for elevated neutralizing antibody titers, enabling cross-neutralization against Omicron, wildtype (WT) and the Beta variant.","output":"Disease profile and plasma neutralizing activity of post-vaccination Omicron BA.1 infection in Tianjin, China: a retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current gold standard for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, on the background of clinical suspicion. However, RT-PCR has its limitations; this includes issues of low sensitivity, sampling errors and appropriate timing of specimen collection. As pulmonary involvement is the most common manifestation of severe COVID-19, early and appropriate lung imaging is important to aid diagnosis. However, gross discrepancies can occur between the clinical and imaging findings in patients with COVID-19, which can mislead clinicians in their decision making. Although chest X-ray (CXR) has a low sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated lung disease, especially in the earlier stages, a positive CXR increases the pre-test probability of COVID-19. CXR scoring systems have shown to be useful, such as the COVID-19 opacification rating score which helps to predict the need of tracheal intubation. Furthermore, artificial intelligence-based algorithms have also shown promise in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia on CXR from other lung diseases. Although costlier than CXR, unenhanced computed tomographic (CT) chest scans have a higher sensitivity, but lesser specificity compared to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. A semi-quantitative CT scoring system has been shown to predict short-term mortality. The routine use of CT pulmonary angiography as a first-line imaging modality in patients with suspected COVID-19 is not justifiable due to the risk of contrast nephropathy. Scoring systems similar to those pioneered in CXR and CT can be used to effectively plan and manage hospital resources such as ventilators. Lung ultrasound is useful in the assessment of critically ill COVID-19 patients in the hands of an experienced operator. Moreover, it is a convenient tool to monitor disease progression, as it is cheap, non-invasive, easily accessible and easy to sterilise. Newer lung imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for safe imaging among children, adolescents and pregnant women are rapidly evolving. Imaging modalities are also essential for evaluating the extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19: these include cranial imaging with CT or MRI; cardiac imaging with ultrasonography (US), CT and MRI; and abdominal imaging with US or CT. This review critically analyses the utility of each imaging modality to empower clinicians to use them appropriately in the management of patients with COVID-19 infection.","output":"Discrepancies in the clinical and radiological profiles of COVID-19: A case-based discussion and review of literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Physical activity is an important health behavior, due to its association with many physical and mental health conditions. During distressing events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a concern that physical activity levels may be negatively impacted. However, recent studies have shown inconsistent results. Additionally, there is a lack of studies in Australia on this topic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate changes in physical activity reported through the 10,000 Steps program and changes in engagement with the program during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data between January 1, 2018, and June 30, 2020, from registered members of the 10,000 Steps program, which included 3,548,825 days with step data, were used. The number of daily steps were logged manually by the members or synced automatically from their activity trackers connected to the program. Measures on program usage were the number of new registered members per day, the number of newly registered organizations per day, the number of steps logged per day, and the number of step entries per day. Key dates used for comparison were as follows: the first case with symptoms in Wuhan, China; the first case reported in Australia; the implementation of a 14-day ban for noncitizens arriving in Australia from China; the start of the lockdown in Australia; and the relaxing of restrictions by the Australian Government. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to test for significant differences in number of steps between subgroups, between engagement measures in 2019 versus 2020, and before and after an event. RESULTS: A decrease in steps was observed after the first case in Australia was reported (1.5%; P=.02) and after the start of the lockdown (3.4%; P<.001). At the time that the relaxing of restrictions started, the steps had already recovered from the lockdown. Additionally, the trends were consistent across genders and age groups. New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, and Victoria had the greatest step reductions, with decreases of 7.0% (P<.001), 6.2% (P=.02), and 4.7% (P<.001), respectively. During the lockdown, the use of the program increased steeply. On the peak day, there were more than 9000 step entries per day, with nearly 100 million steps logged per day; in addition, more than 450 new users and more than 15 new organizations registered per day, although the numbers decreased quickly when restrictions were relaxed. On average per day, there were about 55 new registered users (P<.001), 2 new organizations (P<.001), 25.6 million steps (P<.001), and 2672 log entries (P<.001) more in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has had negative effects on steps among Australians across age groups and genders. However, the effect was relatively small, with steps recovering quickly after the lockdown. There was a large increase in program usage during the pandemic, which might help minimize the health impact of the lockdown and confirms the important role of physical activity programs during times of distress and lockdowns.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Physical Activity Among 10,000 Steps Members and Engagement With the Program in Australia: Prospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: This review was aimed at exploring the potentiality of drugging the endocannabinoid system as a therapeutic option for Alzheimers disease (AD). Recent discoveries have demonstrated how the modulation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and receptor 2 (CB2) can exert neuroprotective effects without the recreational and pharmacological properties of Cannabis sativa. Thus, this review explores the potential of cannabinoids in AD, also highlighting their limitations in perspective to point out the need for further research on cannabinoids in AD therapy. ABSTRACT: Alzheimers disease (AD) is a detrimental brain disorder characterized by a gradual cognitive decline and neuronal deterioration. To date, the treatments available are effective only in the early stage of the disease. The AD etiology has not been completely revealed, and investigating new pathological mechanisms is essential for developing effective and safe drugs. The recreational and pharmacological properties of marijuana are known for centuries, but only recently the scientific community started to investigate the potential use of cannabinoids in AD therapysometimes with contradictory outcomes. Since the endocannabinoid system (ECS) is highly expressed in the hippocampus and cortex, cannabis use/abuse has often been associated with memory and learning dysfunction in vulnerable individuals. However, the latest findings in AD rodent models have shown promising effects of cannabinoids in reducing amyloid plaque deposition and stimulating hippocampal neurogenesis. Beneficial effects on several dementia-related symptoms have also been reported in clinical trials after cannabinoid treatments. Accordingly, future studies should address identifying the correct therapeutic dosage and timing of treatment from the perspective of using cannabinoids in AD therapy. The present paper aims to summarize the potential and limitations of cannabinoids as therapeutics for AD, focusing on recent pre-clinical and clinical evidence.","output":"Potential and Limits of Cannabinoids in Alzheimers Disease Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We derive mixing properties for a broad class of Poisson count time series satisfying a certain contraction condition.

Care- and help-seeking behaviour is strongly associated with health status, but, also gender, with women's health strongly correlating to that of the whole family and directly linked to the wellbeing of all members in our communities, and the resilience and sustainability of health systems. Health and social care delivery has been lacking a gender-centred approach, with a two-prong effect, on professionals/workforce (hierarchies and leadership imbalance) and on users/recipients/care seekers (lack of gender-sensitive care provision). The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health threat and societal challenge that has already exacerbated pre-existing structural gender inequalities. It is, therefore, imperative to rebuild a better, gender-equal society for the future. This crisis has highlighted the roles of women in the health workforce, incl. as informal carers for vulnerable adults and children. The increase in gender-based violence has also come to the spotlight, due to lockdown measures, implemented to combat COVID-19, resulting in serious physical and mental harm, as well as socioeconomic damages. Furthermore, sexual and reproductive health rights have been particularly affected due to pre-existing barriers across Member-States placing additional strain on individuals and systems. All these compounding factors also result in further limiting access to leadership positions for women. This roundtable aims to capture the perspective of our interdisciplinary panelists from leading European and global institutions to comprehensively map the needs, priorities, and key action areas of public health, in order to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls across the globe. OBJECTIVES: 1. Assess the roles of women in the health workforce, to highlight gender inequalities, and to discuss regional differences across the European Region; 2. Present and discuss the new Gender Equality Index 2021 (to be released end of Oct 2021), which will focus on health in relation to gender equality, covering mental health, sexual and reproductive health and pandemics of communicable diseases, and in particular of COVID-19; 3. Combine the perspective of academia, multilateral bodies, practitioners and NGOs, for concerted action to combat the increase in sexual and domestic violence, and to. 4. Bridge disparities and overcome barriers to gender-sensitive health and social care services for all women, incl., migrant and refugee populations. The roundtable brings together for the first time EUPHA, WHO, UN Women, and of the European Institute for Gender Equality, in a joint effort for European and global public health, to support our workforce and safeguard the future.

Emergency health control measures required the implementation of compulsory mass quarantine (CMQ) or so-called periods of ?lockdown.? Yet, CMQ is an instrument with iatrogenic consequences, associated with a rise in societal levels of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. With a view to informing future crisis management, the study investigated sociodemographic factors associated with mental wellbeing during the March?April 2020 lockdown in the United Arab Emirates. Respondents (n?=?1585) completed self-report measures of depression (PHQ8) and generalized anxiety (GAD7). Rates of symptomatology were notably higher than those observed in similar UAE-based studies before the pandemic. Younger age, urban-dwelling, female-gender, and a history of mental health problems were significant factors linked to elevated levels of depression and anxiety. Findings emphasize (1) the crucial need for psychological intervention after disasters and (2) the importance of strengthening the nexus at the intersection of public health and disaster risk reduction (DRR). Implications are that future pandemic containment would benefit from adopting new Health?DRR paradigms and ensuring these are effectively translated into disaster policy.","output":"Containing COVID-19 risk in the UAE: Mass quarantine, mental health, and implications for crisis management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted obstetric anesthesiologists to reconsider the ways in which basic anesthesia care is provided on the Labor and Delivery Unit.

As a result, numerous pandemic-related analyses have been completed. However, few of these studies focus on the impact of pre-existing societal and economic factors that may have played a role in the spread of COVID-19. This study evaluated the impact of social and economic freedoms, gross domestic product, and population density in nations around the world on COVID-19 cases, deaths, testing and vaccination rates. Methods To explore the effects of social and economic freedoms, gross domestic product, and other parameters on the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple datasets, including the Economic Freedom Index and the Human Freedom Index were used, along with COVID-19 data, to examine both direct and indirect relationships. The K-Means clustering algorithm was used for many analyses. Results High economic and social freedoms were associated with increased numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths throughout 2020. Countries within the highest category of economic freedoms reported their first COVID-19 case 44 days before and their first virus death 91 days before low-economic-freedom nations, on average. Countries with the highest overall freedoms exhibited average COVID-19-stringency scores of 4.4, 12.85, and 4.49 points less than countries in the lowest freedom categories for the Spring, Summer, and Fall of 2020, respectively, representing less strict pandemic responses. Despite these relationships, countries with higher overall freedoms had a lower average fatality rate of 2.03% compared with countries in the lower freedom categories of up to 2.98%. Freedoms were also shown to correlate with other pandemic-influencing factors, including GDP, political systems, and population density. Conclusion High economic and social freedoms were associated with increased numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths throughout 2020. Future analyses should address whether the enjoyment of freedoms can be balanced with the preservation of safety to improve responses to future pandemics.","output":"Examining the Effects of Social and Economic Freedoms on the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] There is an urgent need to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) so that vaccines and treatments can be devised.

Experiencing such a feeling as an employee has been called organizational dehumanization. Scholars have recently suggested that organizational dehumanization may play a key role in the development of emotional labor. However, how organizational dehumanization and two main emotional labor strategies (i.e., surface and deep acting) are causally related remains unclear in this literature. In the present research, we argue that employees who experience organizational dehumanization and whose self is thus threatened then engage in surface acting to \\"conserve\\" their self or in deep acting to \\"give up\\" their self in service of the role. Overall, the combined results of three studies offer strong evidence that organizational dehumanization leads employees to perform more surface acting, but not more deep acting. Unexpectedly, our findings also indicate that deep acting reduces the perception of being dehumanized by the organization. In showing this, the present research sheds light on the potential dark side of deep acting, by suggesting that this strategy can change employees' perspectives in a way that may encourage them to stay in an organization that treats them as a means to an end.

This review aims to summarize rates of COVID-19 hesitancy and its determinants in high-income countries or regions. A scoping review was conducted in Medline(?), Embase(?), CINAHL(?), and Scopus(?) and was reported in accordance with the PRISMA-SCr checklist. The search was current as of March 2021. Studies which evaluated COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its determinants in high-income countries (US$12,536 or more GNI per capita in 2019) were included. Studies conducted in low, lower-middle, and upper-middle income countries or regions were excluded. Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy were grouped into four themes (vaccine specific, individual, group, or contextual related factors). Of 2237 articles retrieved, 97 articles were included in this review. Most studies were conducted in U.S. (n = 39) and Italy (n = 9). The rates of vaccine hesitancy across high-income countries or regions ranged from 7C77.9%. 46 studies (47.4%) had rates of 30% and more. Younger age, females, not being of white ethnicity and lower education were common contextual factors associated with increased vaccine hesitancy. Lack of recent history of influenza vaccination, lower self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, lesser fear of COVID-19, believing that COVID-19 is not severe and not having chronic medical conditions were most frequently studied individual/group factors associated with increased vaccine hesitancy. Common vaccine-specific factors associated with increased vaccine hesitancy included beliefs that vaccine are not safe/effective and increased concerns about rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines. Given the heterogeneity in vaccine hesitancy definitions used across studies, there is a need for standardization in its assessment.

Recent studies conducted in the work environment have focused on the effectiveness of these interventions. However, the role of employees acceptability of web-based interventions and programs has not yet enjoyed a similar level of attention. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to conduct the first comprehensive study on employees level of acceptability of web-based mental health interventions based on direct and indirect measures, outline the utility of different types of web-based interventions for work-related mental health issues, and build a research base in the field. METHODS: The search was conducted between October 2018 and July 2019 and allowed for any study design. The studies used either qualitative or quantitative data sources. The web-based interventions were generally aimed at supporting employees with their mental health issues. The study characteristics were outlined in a table as well as graded based on their quality using a traffic light schema. The level of acceptability was individually rated using commonly applied methods, including percentile quartiles ranging from low to very high. RESULTS: A total of 1303 studies were identified through multiple database searches and additional resources, from which 28 (2%) were rated as eligible for the synthesis. The results of employees acceptability levels were mixed, and the studies were very heterogeneous in design, intervention characteristics, and population. Approximately 79% (22/28) of the studies outlined acceptability measures from high to very high, and 54% (15/28) of the studies reported acceptability levels from low to moderate (overlap when studies reported both quantitative and qualitative results). Qualitative studies also provided insights into barriers and preferences, including simple and tailored application tools as well as the preference for nonstigmatized language. However, there were multiple flaws in the methodology of the studies, such as the blinding of participants and personnel. CONCLUSIONS: The results outline the need for further research with more homogeneous acceptability studies to draw a final conclusion. However, the underlying results show that there is a tendency toward general acceptability of web-based interventions in the workplace, with findings of general applicability to the use of web-based mental health interventions.","output":"Acceptability of Web-Based Mental Health Interventions in the Workplace: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Poly(A) tail length is emerging as an important marker of mRNA fate, where deviations from the canonical length can signal degradation or nuclear retention of transcripts.

This inhibits gene expression but does not affect mRNA stability. Unexpectedly, PABPC-induced hyperadenylation can occur independently of mRNA 3'-end processing yet requires the canonical mRNA poly(A) polymerase II.

METHODS: One thousand five hundred four students participated in this study. A total of 42.12% of students are enrolled in Chinese colleges, and 57.78% of students are enrolled in American colleges, aged 17C23 years ([Formula: see text] = 19.90  1.50). Binary logistic regression and independent t-test were used in this study to find the predictor variables and association among mental health, substance use problems, and student population. RESULTS: The two student groups had a statistical difference in General Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, alcohol, medicines, drinks, drugs and cigarettes (p < 0.01).

Assessing disaster response capacity is a challenging task in India due to diverse geo-climatic conditions and exposure to different disasters. This paper addresses the absence of a methodological framework to measure multiple aspects of the disaster response capacity of districts in India through indicators. 26 indicators were identified under four factors namely; resources, communication and coordination, budget, and community engagement; anchored on a theoretical framework evolved through literature survey and key informant interviews. Each factor was modelled as a linear function of indicators based on data-sets maintained by district authorities. A Composite Index was constructed as a weighted aggregation of four factors using weightings elicited through Questionnaire Surveys among 151 expert respondents. Weightings were derived through an extension of Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (TOPSIS) to balance the variability in perceptions of respondents. As disasters demand quick response, assessment of response capacity with a fewer number of indicators is desirable. Therefore, a reduced set of critical indicators sensitive to the Indian context were derived through model reduction applying probabilistic and statistical methods[Formula: see text] norm-based sensitivity analysis and coefficient of variation method. Critical indicators are: number of rescue and health service personnel, NGOs, Self-Help-Groups; efficacy of existing SOPs; literacy; and budget options.

However, CPIs have different adverse event (AE) profiles to other systemic therapies, and prompt AE management is essential to assure optimal outcomes. In order to understand what and when adverse events are experienced, reported and managed during CPI treatment, a mixed methods study was conducted, including a case note review of patients who were receiving immunotherapy and semi-structured interviews with patients to understand their experience, management and reporting of AEs after receiving immune CPI treatment. METHODS: This mixed methods study was conducted at a large cancer hospital in the United Kingdom. A case note review identified how and where patients reported AEs. Data relating to patients with lung, bladder, prostate and head & neck cancers who received CPI treatment between 01/04/2015 and 31/07/2018 were extracted from e-prescribing databases and clinical data were included for analysis at a single time point (31 July 2018). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients receiving CPI treatment, exploring experience of AEs and reasons for delays in AE reporting and management. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were included in the case note review, with 78 AEs being experienced by 36 patients (58%), including one patient experiencing 10 AEs. Serious AEs were experienced by 12 patients (19%) and ten AEs (17%) required oral steroids as treatment. The majority of AEs were reported to clinicians prior to further dosing, although milder AEs were often not addressed until subsequent clinic appointments. Interviews with 13 patients yielded major themes: variability, causality, decision making and impact. CONCLUSION: Most CPI-associated AEs are manageable if reported and treated promptly. Both the case note review and interviews found that reporting of non-serious AEs is often left until routine clinic visits, despite impacting patient experience, leaving the opportunity for AEs to be left unreported and implying a potential benefit for real time monitoring. Our study highlights a need to provide patients with reminders around AEs and their timely reporting even when apparently innocuous; patients must understand that AEs can occur at any cycle and even following treatment completion.","output":"Immunotherapy and associated immune-related adverse events at a large UK centre: a mixed methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferons represent a protein family with pleiotropic functions including immunomodulatory, cytostatic, and cytotoxic activities.

We determined the neutralizing antibody (nAb) titres in sera from convalescent individuals previously infected by these 4 major local variants and from vaccine recipients to the original Wuhan strain and 9 variants, including two recent circulating delta (Indian) isolates. The results show high inter-individual heterogeneity in nAbs, especially according to the variant tested. Unexpectedly, the major variations among nAbs are based on the genotype responsible for the infection. Patients previously infected with the beta and B.1.160 variants had the lowest nAb titres.

METHODS We report the reorganization of the major hospital in Lombardy during COVID-19 pandemic, including the rearrangement of its ICU beds to face COVID-19 pandemic and fulfill its role as extended hub for time-dependent diseases while preserving transplant activity. To highlight the impact of the emergently planned hub-and-spoke system, all patients admitted to a COVID-19-free ICU hub for trauma, neurosurgical emergencies and stroke during the two-month period were retrospectively collected and compared to 2019 cohort.

In a randomized placebo-controlled ferret study, we tested whether prior receipt of 2008C09 TIV may have directly influenced A(H1N1)pdm09 illness. Thirty-two ferrets (16/group) received 0.5 mL intra-muscular injections of the Canadian-manufactured, commercially-available, non-adjuvanted, split 2008C09 Fluviral or PBS placebo on days 0 and 28. On day 49 all animals were challenged (Ch0) with A(H1N1)pdm09. Four ferrets per group were randomly selected for sacrifice at day 5 post-challenge (Ch+5) and the rest followed until Ch+14. Sera were tested for antibody to vaccine antigens and A(H1N1)pdm09 by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), microneutralization (MN), nucleoprotein-based ELISA and HA1-based microarray assays. Clinical characteristics and nasal virus titers were recorded pre-challenge then post-challenge until sacrifice when lung virus titers, cytokines and inflammatory scores were determined. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups of influenza-na?ve animals. Antibody rise to vaccine antigens was evident by ELISA and HA1-based microarray but not by HI or MN assays; virus challenge raised antibody to A(H1N1)pdm09 by all assays in both groups. Beginning at Ch+2, vaccinated animals experienced greater loss of appetite and weight than placebo animals, reaching the greatest between-group difference in weight loss relative to baseline at Ch+5 (7.4% vs. 5.2%; p = 0.01).

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 40 patients were evaluated; 20 had ACL reconstruction by the CASB technique using hamstrings and 20 underwent DB repair surgery. The average age was 31.3 years, and the group included 22 men and 18 women with 19 right and 21 left knees. The KT-1000 test was used to assess the amount of APT in the knee and rotational deviations were measured by the Rolimeter. In the DB patients, measurements were performed before surgery (on joints with ACL injury), then after reconstruction of the anteromedial (AM) or the posterolateral (PL) bundle and subsequently after repair of both ACL bundles. The CASB patients were assessed before and after graft insertion. RESULTS The average APT value was 18.5 mm for the pre-operative knees and it fell to 8.9 mm after AM bundle reconstruction. However, when the PL bundle was inserted in the first place, the average APT value was 13.1 mm only. The average values recorded after the DB and CASB reconstructions were 6.1 mm and 9.1 mm, respectively. The average IR range of motion in the pre-operative joints was 18.6 degrees. After AM bundle reconstruction it was 13.9 degrees and after PL bundle repair it was 15.3 degrees. In DB reconstruction the average IR value achieved 10.4 degrees, and in CASB repair surgery it was 13.7 degrees. The average ER range of motion in the pre-operative joints was 17.8 degrees. After AM bundle reconstruction it was 14.5 degrees and after PL bundle repair it was 14.9 degrees. In DB reconstruction the average ER value achieved 11.4 degrees, and in CASB repair surgery it was 14.5 degrees. DISCUSSION Rotational stability of the knee after ACL reconstruction is one of the most important factors in restoring physiological kinematics of the joint after ACL injury. Since there are not many studies comparing knee rotational stability after CASB with that after DB reconstructions, the results presented here may contribute to selecting the optimal method of ACL reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS The results show that, in ACL reconstruction, the DB technique provides better stability to the knee, in both APT and rotation, than the CASB method. The latter has the same effect on knee stability as the presence of the AM bundle alone. When the PL bundle is added, knee stability, in both APT and internal/external rotation, is increased in comparison with central single-bundle ACL repair.

Although multiple ACE-like proteins exist in non-mammalian organisms, to date only one other ACE homologue, ACE2, has been identified in mammals. RESULTS: Here we report the identification and characterisation of the gene encoding a third homologue of ACE, termed ACE3, in several mammalian genomes. The ACE3 gene is located on the same chromosome downstream of the ACE gene. Multiple sequence alignment and molecular modelling have been employed to characterise the predicted ACE3 protein. In mouse, rat, cow and dog, the predicted protein has mutations in some of the critical residues involved in catalysis, including the catalytic Glu in the HEXXH zinc binding motif which is Gln, and ESTs or reverse-transcription PCR indicate that the gene is expressed. In humans, the predicted ACE3 protein has an intact HEXXH motif, but there are other deletions and insertions in the gene and no ESTs have been identified. CONCLUSION: In the genomes of several mammalian species there is a gene that encodes a novel, single domain ACE-like protein, ACE3. In mouse, rat, cow and dog ACE3, the catalytic Glu is replaced by Gln in the putative zinc binding motif, indicating that in these species ACE3 would lack catalytic activity as a zinc metalloprotease. In humans, no evidence was found that the ACE3 gene is expressed and the presence of deletions and insertions in the sequence indicate that ACE3 is a pseudogene.","output":"Identification and characterisation of the angiotensin converting enzyme-3 (ACE3) gene: a novel mammalian homologue of ACE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has been used to alleviate hypoxemia and dyspnea, but there is no consensus on the application of NIV in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Acute lung inflammatory edema is a major pathological finding in autopsies explaining O2 diffusion failure and hypoxemia. Only dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in severe cases, further supporting a role for inflammation in disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells employing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, which is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells. ACE2 is one of the components of the cellular machinery that inactivates the potent inflammatory agent bradykinin, and SARS-CoV-2 infection could interfere with the catalytic activity of ACE2, leading to the accumulation of bradykinin. Methods: In this case control study, we tested two pharmacological inhibitors of the kinin-kallikrein system that are currently approved for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, icatibant, and inhibitor of C1 esterase/kallikrein, in a group of 30 patients with severe COVID-19. Results: Neither icatibant nor inhibitor of C1 esterase/kallikrein resulted in changes in time to clinical improvement. However, both compounds were safe and promoted the significant improvement of lung computed tomography scores and increased blood eosinophils, which are indicators of disease recovery. Conclusions: In this small cohort, we found evidence for safety and a beneficial role of pharmacological inhibition of the kinin-kallikrein system in two markers that indicate improved disease recovery.","output":"Safety and Outcomes Associated with the Pharmacological Inhibition of the Kinin-Kallikrein System in Severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Long regarded as \\"America's Past Time\\", over 8.6 million children partake in organized and recreational baseball. Although improved equipment has reduced contemporary injury rates, nearly half of pediatric baseball injuries requiring hospitalization are due to craniofacial trauma. Sideline personnel at the youth levels, often without advanced medical training, frequently act as first-responders in instances of acute craniofacial injury. METHODS An IRB-approved survey was distributed nationally to target field personnel working at youth, high school, collegiate, and professional baseball levels. Survey items included: comfort in assessing subtypes of acute craniofacial trauma (loss of consciousness (LOC), skull injury, orbital injury, nasal injury, and dental injury) via Likert scale, years of medical training, presence of an emergency action plan (EAP), and access to higher level care from emergency medical services (EMS) or a nearby hospital. RESULTS When comparing the amateur and professional cohorts, the respondents from professional teams were significantly more confident in assessing LOC (P = 0.001), skull injury (P < 0.001), orbital injury (P < 0.001), nasal injury (P < 0.001), and dental injury (P < 0.001). The professional teams had significantly more years of first aid training (P < 0.0001) and were significantly more likely to have an EAP (P < 0.0001). Professional teams also had a significantly higher average of reported craniofacial incidents (P = 0.0279). CONCLUSION The authors identified a significant disparity in comfort level between amateur and professional baseball field personnel for identifying and managing acute craniofacial trauma.

Here, we summarize our efforts to optimize culture conditions for improved growth and functional differentiation of mouse and human colon organoids. METHODS: Mouse and human colon organoids were grown in four different media. Media-dependent long-term growth was measured by quantifying surviving organoids via imaging and a cell viability readout over five passages. The impact of diverse media on differentiation was assessed by quantifying the number of epithelial cell types using markers for enterocytes, stem cells, Goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells by qPCR and histology upon removal of growth factors. RESULTS: In contrast to Wnt3a-conditioned media, media supplemented with recombinant Wnt3a alone did not support long-term survival of human or mouse colon organoids. Mechanistically, this observation can be attributed to the fact that recombinant Wnt3a did not support stem cell survival or proliferation as demonstrated by decreased LGR5 and Ki67 expression. When monitoring expression of markers for epithelial cell types, the highest level of organoid differentiation was observed after combined removal of Wnt3a, Noggin, and R-spondin from Wnta3a-conditioned media cultures. CONCLUSION: Our study defined Wnt3a-containing conditioned media as optimal for growth and survival of human and mouse organoids. Furthermore, we established that the combined removal of Wnt3a, Noggin, and R-spondin results in optimal differentiation. This study provides a step forward in optimizing conditions for intestinal organoid growth to improve standardization and reproducibility of this model platform.","output":"Optimized Culture Conditions for Improved Growth and Functional Differentiation of Mouse and Human Colon Organoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global ongoing pandemic.

The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of using a survey-based work system assessment (WSA) tool to facilitate the dissemination of a program for optimizing blood culture (BC) use. METHODS: Informed by findings from an onsite, interview-based WSA at 2 hospitals, a 50-item WSA survey was devised and administrated to 15 hospitals participating in a QI collaborative. WSA survey data were summarized, shared, and discussed with individual hospitals to inform the adaptation and implementation of the BC program. Physician champions leading the local QI team assessed the use of the WSA survey by completing an 8-item survey. RESULTS: A total of 347 clinicians completed the WSA survey, and physician champions at 12 hospitals evaluated the use of the WSA survey. Both the WSA survey data and the evaluation of the WSA survey showed that the survey-based WSA tool could help participating hospitals understand their current BC ordering practices and identify potential barriers to implementing the program from the perspectives of different clinicians.

We aimed to identify the prevalence, etiologies, and mortality rates associated with TME in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter, observational cohort study among patients with reverse transcriptaseCpolymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized at four New York City hospitals in the same health network between March 1, 2020, and May 20, 2020. TME was diagnosed in patients with altered mental status off sedation or after an adequate sedation washout. Patients with structural brain disease, seizures, or primary neurological diagnoses were excluded. The coprimary outcomes were the prevalence of TME stratified by etiology and in-hospital mortality (excluding comfort care only patients) assessed by using a multivariable time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for age, race, sex, intubation, intensive care unit requirement, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, hospital location, and date of admission. RESULTS: Among 4491 patients with COVID-19, 559 (12%) were diagnosed with TME, of whom 435 of 559 (78%) developed encephalopathy immediately prior to hospital admission. The most common etiologies were septic encephalopathy (n = 247 of 559 [62%]), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) (n = 331 of 559 [59%]), and uremia (n = 156 of 559 [28%]). Multiple etiologies were present in 435 (78%) patients. Compared with those without TME (n = 3932), patients with TME were older (76 vs. 62 years), had dementia (27% vs. 3%) or psychiatric history (20% vs. 10%), were more often intubated (37% vs. 20%), had a longer hospital length of stay (7.9 vs. 6.0 days), and were less often discharged home (25% vs. 66% [all P < 0.001]). Excluding comfort care patients (n = 267 of 4491 [6%]) and after adjustment for confounders, TME remained associated with increased risk of in-hospital death (n = 128 of 425 [30%] patients with TME died, compared with n = 600 of 3799 [16%] patients without TME; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02C1.52, P = 0.031), and TME due to hypoxemia conferred the highest risk (n = 97 of 233 [42%] patients with HIE died, compared with n = 631 of 3991 [16%] patients without HIE; aHR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21C2.00, P = 0.001).

METHODS In our prospective, multicenter trial, 109 complex internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms in 107 subjects were treated with the PED. Patients were followed per a standardized protocol at 180 d and 1, 3, and 5 yr. Aneurysm occlusion, in-stent stenosis, modified Rankin Scale scores, and complications were recorded. RESULTS The primary endpoint of complete aneurysm occlusion at 180 d (73.6%) was previously reported. Aneurysm occlusion for those patients with angiographic follow-up progressively increased over time to 86.8% (79/91), 93.4% (71/76), and 95.2% (60/63) at 1, 3, and 5 yr, respectively.

Objectives To explore the elderlys healthcare experiences during the lockdown and the problems that may have arisen regarding accessibility to the healthcare system and emerging adaptations to medical care. Methods We coded the data using Atlas.ti 8 software and then triangled the analysis among researchers from different backgrounds. Finally, concept maps were developed and themes arising from these were described. Results Thirty-nine participants were interviewed from the metropolitan area in Buenos Aires from April to July of 2020. The main emerging themes were: 1) access to regularly scheduled consults, 2) access to chronic medication, 3) emergency consultations, and 4) the role of information and communication technologies. Accessibility to the healthcare system was compromised due to reduced outpatient consultations, affecting health checkups, diagnosis, and treatment. However, participants tried to keep their immunizations up to date. Information and communication technologies were used to fill digital prescriptions and online medical consultations. While this was a solution to many, others did not have access to these technologies or had trouble using them. Conclusions The global pandemic caused a reduction in outpatient medical consultations. Emerging needs originated new ways of carrying out medical consultations, mainly through information and communication technologies, which was a solution for many but led to the exclusion of others because of the preexisting technology gap.","output":"A qualitative study on the elderly and accessibility to health services during the COVID-19 lockdown in Buenos Aires, Argentina - Part 2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bats are hosts to a large variety of viruses, including many capable of cross species transmissions to other mammals or humans.

Near or complete genomes of a novel parvovirus, astrovirus, nodavirus, CRESS-DNA viruses and densoviruses and more partial genomes of a novel alphacoronavirus, and bunyavirus were characterized. Lower numbers of reads with >90% amino acid identity to previously described calicivirus, circovirus, adenoviruses, hepatovirus, bocaparvoviruses, and polyomavirus in other bat species were also found likely reflecting their wide distribution among different bats. Unexpectedly a few sequence reads of canine parvovirus 2 and the recently described mouse kidney parvovirus were also detected and their presence confirmed by PCR possibly originating from guano contamination by carnivores and rodents.

We sought primary evidence on goals-of-care discussions in EDs with adult patients nearing end-of-life, published in English after 1989. Data sources included Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science and reference lists of included articles. One thousand nine hundred and twenty abstracts were screened, five articles selected. There was no consensus on the meaning of goals-of-care, which is often confused with advanced care planning and treatment limitation. Emergency clinicians can identify most patients needing discussions following training. There was no evidence for how to involve stakeholders, nor how to adapt conversations to meet cultural and linguistically diverse needs. Expert panels have suggested requirements and content for conversations with little supporting evidence. There was no evidence for how emergency conversations differ to those in other settings, nor for harms or benefits for holding goals-of-care conversations in EDs. Increased ED goals-of-care conversations increased hospice referral and reduced in-patient admissions.

They were referred to the intended centers for COVID-19 diagnosis and management of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in southern Iran. Two nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal throat swab samples were collected from each patient and tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using real-time reverse-transcriptase- polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR).

RESULTS: More overinvolved parenting was reported by PA students under the age of 25 years compared to those over the age of 25. Lower SES predicted higher perceived stress. After controlling for SES, grit (perseverance) partially mediated the relationship between overinvolved parenting and perceived stress. Neither parenting style nor grit was associated with GPA.

One of the critical steps in comparing transcription profiles is accurate normalisation. In most of the studies published on real-time PCR in horses, normalisation occurred against only one reference gene, usually GAPDH or ACTB, without validation of its expression stability. This might result in unreliable conclusions, because it has been demonstrated that the expression levels of so called \\"housekeeping genes\\" may vary considerably in different tissues, cell types or disease stages, particularly in clinical samples associated with malignant disease. The goal of this study was to establish a reliable set of reference genes for studies concerning normal equine skin and equine sarcoids, which are the most common skin tumour in horses. RESULTS: In the present study the gene transcription levels of 6 commonly used reference genes (ACTB, B2M, HPRT1, UBB, TUBA1 and RPL32) were determined in normal equine skin and in equine sarcoids. After applying the geNorm applet to this set of genes, TUBA1, ACTB and UBB were found to be most stable in normal skin and B2M, ACTB and UBB in equine sarcoids. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, TUBA1, ACTB and UBB, respectively B2M, ACTB and UBB can be proposed as reference gene panels for accurate normalisation of quantitative data for normal equine skin, respectively equine sarcoids. When normal skin and equine sarcoids are compared, the use of the geometric mean of UBB, ACTB and B2M can be recommended as a reliable and accurate normalisation factor.","output":"Selection of a set of reliable reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR in normal equine skin and in equine sarcoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectifs : Le but cette tude tait de mener une revue de la littrature actuelle valuant les diffrents lments disponibles en termes d'pidmiologie, de physiopathologie et de prsentation clinique de latteinte cardio-vasculaire du COVID-19.

We synthesise Lyapunov functions for linear, non-linear (polynomial), and for parametric models. For non-linear models, the algorithm also determines a region of validity for the Lyapunov function. We exploit an inductive framework to synthesise Lyapunov functions, starting from parametric templates. The inductive framework comprises two elements: a learner proposes a Lyapunov function, and a verifier checks its validity - its lack is expressed via a counterexample (a point over the state space), for further use by the learner. Whilst the verifier uses the SMT solver Z3, thus ensuring the overall soundness of the procedure, we examine two alternatives for the learner: a numerical approach based on the optimisation tool Gurobi, and a sound approach based again on Z3. The overall technique is evaluated over a broad set of benchmarks, which shows that this methodology not only scales to 10-dimensional models within reasonable computational time, but also offers a novel soundness proof for the generated Lyapunov functions and their domains of validity.","output":"Automated and Sound Synthesis of Lyapunov Functions with SMT Solvers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We replicate a recent study by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team (Flaxman et al, 2020) that estimates both the effective reproductive number, Rt, of the current COVID-19 epidemic in 11 European countries, and the impact of different nonpharmaceutical interventions that have been implemented to try to contain the epidemic. We improve on their estimation by using data from the number of patients in intensive care, which provides two advantages over the number of deaths: first, it can be used to construct a signal with less bias: as the healthcare system of a country reaches saturation, the mortality rate would be expected to increase, which would bias the estimates of Rt and of the impact of measures implemented to contain the epidemic; and second, it is a signal with less lag, as the time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission is shorter than the time from onset to death. The intensive care signal we use is not just the number of people in ICU, as this would also be biased if the healthcare system has reached saturation. Instead, we estimate the daily demand of intensive care, as the sum of two components: the part that is satisfied (new ICU admissions) and the part that is not (which results in excess mortality). Thanks to the advantages of this ICU signal in terms of timeliness and bias, we find that most of the countries in the study have already reached Rt<1 with 95% confidence (Italy, Spain, Austria, Denmark, France, Norway and Switzerland, but not Belgium or Sweden), whereas the original methodology of Flaxman et al (2020), even with updated data, would only find Rt<1 with 95% confidence for Italy and Switzerland.","output":"Using ICU data to improve the real-time estimation of the effective reproductive number of the COVID-19 epidemic in 9 European countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health workers are exposed to numerous infectious diseases from which the patients they attend are suffering and that have been recognised as occupational infectious diseases.

The participants were from two countries, India and Nigeria. The inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 60 years, having completed at least 10 years of formal education, and have internet access. For data collection, Semi-structured proforma (demographic and personal characteristics) and Brief RCOPE was used to see the extent to which individuals engage in positive and negative forms of religious coping. RESULTS: A total of 647 individuals (360 from Nigeria and 287 from India) participated in the survey. A total of 188 (65.5%) participants in India reported no change in their religious activities since they heard about COVID-19, while, 160 (44.4%) in Nigeria reported a decrease in religious activities.

Therapeutic benefits of using RDS for both disease control and prevention, in the effort to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have been shown. However, the biochemically active constituents of RDS and their mechanisms of action are still unclear. The goal of the present study is to clarify the material foundation and action mechanism of RDS. METHODS: To conduct an analysis of RDS, an integrative analytical platform was constructed, including target prediction, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and cluster analysis; further, the hub genes involved in the disease-related pathways were identified, and the their corresponding compounds were used for in vitro validation of molecular docking predictions. The presence of these validated compounds was also measured in samples of the RDS formula to quantify the abundance of the biochemically active constituents. In our network pharmacological study, a total of 26 bioinformatic programs and databases were used, and six networks, covering the entire Zang-fu viscera, were constructed to comprehensively analyze the intricate connections among the compounds-targets-disease pathways-meridians of RDS. RESULTS: For all 1071 known chemical constituents of the nine ingredients in RDS, identified from established TCM databases, 157 passed drug-likeness screening and led to 339 predicted targets in the constituent-target network. Forty-two hub genes with core regulatory effects were extracted from the PPI network, and 134 compounds and 29 crucial disease pathways were implicated in the target-constituent-disease network. Twelve disease pathways attributed to the Lung-Large Intestine meridians, with six and five attributed to the Kidney-Urinary Bladder and Stomach-Spleen meridians, respectively. One-hundred and eighteen candidate constituents showed a high binding affinity with SARS-coronavirus-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), as indicated by molecular docking using computational pattern recognition. The in vitro activity of 22 chemical constituents of RDS was validated using the 3CLpro inhibition assay. Finally, using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in data-independent analysis mode, the presence of seven out of these 22 constituents was confirmed and validated in an aqueous decoction of RDS, using reference standards in both non-targeted and targeted approaches. CONCLUSION: RDS acts primarily in the Lung-Large Intestine, Kidney-Urinary Bladder and Stomach-Spleen meridians, with other Zang-fu viscera strategically covered by all nine ingredients. In the context of TCM meridian theory, the multiple components and targets of RDS contribute to RDS's dual effects of health-strengthening and pathogen-eliminating.

Here, we expanded the study through small RNA transcriptome sequencing analysis of the host response to both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and influenza virus infections across four founder mouse strains of the Collaborative Cross, a recombinant inbred mouse resource for mapping complex traits. We observed differential expression of over 200 small RNAs of diverse classes during infection. A majority of identified microRNAs (miRNAs) showed divergent changes in expression across mouse strains with respect to SARS-CoV and influenza virus infections and responded differently to a highly pathogenic reconstructed 1918 virus compared to a minimally pathogenic seasonal influenza virus isolate. Novel insights into miRNA expression changes, including the association with pathogenic outcomes and large differences between in vivo and in vitro experimental systems, were further elucidated by a survey of selected miRNAs across diverse virus infections. The small RNAs identified also included many non-miRNA small RNAs, such as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), in addition to nonannotated small RNAs. An integrative sequencing analysis of both small RNAs and long transcripts from the same samples showed that the results revealing differential expression of miRNAs during infection were largely due to transcriptional regulation and that the predicted miRNA-mRNA network could modulate global host responses to virus infection in a combinatorial fashion. These findings represent the first integrated sequencing analysis of the response of host small RNAs to virus infection and show that small RNAs are an integrated component of complex networks involved in regulating the host response to infection.","output":"Integrative Deep Sequencing of the Mouse Lung Transcriptome Reveals Differential Expression of Diverse Classes of Small RNAs in Response to Respiratory Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Nurses are experiencing tremendous stress during the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, especially intensive care nurses.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To quantify the severity of nurses' post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and stress and explore the influencing factors of their psychological health when caring for patients with COVID-19. DESIGN A cross-sectional survey. METHODS The PTSD Checklist-Civilian and the Perceived Stress Scale were administered from 11 to 18 March 2020, to 90 nurses selected from another city to go and help an intensive care unit (ICU) in Wuhan, China. These nurses were selected because of their high levels of clinical performance and resilience status. RESULTS Nurses' average PTSD score was 24.62  6.68, and five (5.6%) of the nurses reported a clinically significant level of PTSD symptoms (>38 points). Nurses' perceived stress averaged 19.33  7, and 20 nurses (22.22%) scored positively >25 points. Nurses' stress and PTSD symptoms were positively correlated (P < .01). Major stress sources included working in an isolated environment, concerns about personal protective equipment shortage and usage, physical and emotional exhaustion, intensive workload, fear of being infected, and insufficient work experiences with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that even relatively highly resilient nurses experienced some degree of mental distress, including PTSD symptoms and perceived stress. Our findings highlight the importance of helping nurses cultivate resilience and reduce stress. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Recommendations for practice include providing adequate training and orientation before assigning nurses to ICU to help, offering disaster-emergency-preparedness training to keep nurses prepared, providing caring and authentic nursing leadership, offering ongoing psychological support to frontline nurses.","output":"Mental distress and influencing factors in nurses caring for patients with COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has already swept millions of lives and created the deep black cloud made up of negative emotions.

Methods: Fifteen mongrel dogs, of both sexes, weighing 9.45  2.62 kg, under general anesthesia, were submitted to 34 square shaped skin lesions, with 400 mm2 of area, on both right and left thoracodorsal surfaces. After defrosting, Rana catesbeiana skins preserved in a ClNa and glycerol solution at --4oC were used as biological occlusive dressing on 17 lesion located in the right thoracodorsal region (Test Group). The 17 lesions on the left thoracodorsal side were treated with gauze moistened in a 0.9% ClNa solution (Control Group). The frequency of healed (HW) and non-healed wounds (NHW), and the incidence of frog skin destruction, were analyzed. Five sequences of frog skin samples were histologically examined till tissue destruction started to appear. Inflammatory histological findings were evaluated by percentage of intensity of Polymorphonuclear cells (PPMNC), Mononuclear cells (PMC), and lymphoreticular infiltration (PLI). Two tailed Student's t test and chi square test (chi2) were used as indicated. Results: 1) There was no significant difference in HW and NHW between Groups; 2) There was a 31.00% incidence of frog skin destruction limited to the surface in contact with dog wounds. An increased tendency of destruction was perceived during the studied period; 3) Histological changes of frog skin, characterized by tissue infiltration mainly from mononuclear cells, and by destruction of Malpighi and subjacent layers, were observed at the surface, limited to the wound contact area; 4) PPMNC values attained were not statistically different between groups. In the Test Group PM prevailed and PLI was exclusively seen. Conclusion: Frog skin is ineffective in treatment of canine cutaneous wounds and rejection was suggested as a causative factor.","output":"Pele de Rana Catesbeiana como curativo biolgico oclusivo no tratamento de feridas cutaneas produzidas em c?es: Altera??es macroscpicas e microscpicas resultantes da intera??o desses tecidos.

Human mobility and travel patterns influence the spread of infection between cities and countries. We find that the infection severity in downstream cities during outbreaks is related to transmission rate, recovery rate, travel rate, travel duration and the average number of person-to-person contacts per day. The peak value of the infected population in downstream cities is slightly higher than that in source cities. However, as the number of cities increases, the severity increase percentage during outbreaks between end and source cities is constant. The surveillance of important nodes connecting cities, such as airports and train stations, can help delay the occurrence time of infection outbreaks. The city-entry surveillance of hub cities is not only useful to these cities, but also to cities that are strongly connected (i.e., have a high travel rate) to them. The city-exit surveillance of hub cities contributes to other downstream cities, but only slightly to itself. Surveillance conducted in hub cities is highly efficient in controlling infection transmission. Only strengthening the individual immunity of frequent travellers is not efficient for infection control. However, reducing the number of person-to-person contacts per day effectively limits the spread of infection.","output":"Increased infection severity in downstream cities in infectious disease transmission and tourists surveillance analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disruption of the trade and investment activities of multinational enterprises as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic has reinvigorated the debate on the configuration of global value chains (GVCs) as well as the risks and challenges associated with offshoring.

We propose a spatial and dynamic vaccine allocation solution to assist in the allocation of limited vaccines to people who need them most. METHODS: We developed a weighted kernel density estimation (WKDE) model to predict daily COVID-19 symptom onset risk in 291 Tertiary Planning Units in Hong Kong from 18 January 2020 to 22 December 2020. Data of 5,409 COVID-19 onset cases were used. We then obtained spatial distributions of accumulated onset risk under three epidemic scenarios, and computed the vaccine demands to form the vaccine allocation plan. We also compared the vaccine demand under different real-time effective reproductive number (R(t)) levels. RESULTS: The estimated vaccine usages in three epidemiologic scenarios are 30.86% - 45.78% of the Hong Kong population, which is within the total vaccine availability limit. In the sporadic cases or clusters of onset cases scenario, when 6.26% of the total population with travel history to high-risk areas can be vaccinated, the COVID-19 transmission between higher- and lower-risk areas can be reduced. Furthermore, if the current R(t) is increased to double, the vaccine usages needed will be increased by more than 7%. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed solution can be used to dynamically allocate limited vaccines in different epidemic scenarios, thereby enabling more effective protection. The increased vaccine usages associated with increased R(t) indicates the necessity to maintain appropriate control measures even with vaccines available.","output":"A spatial and dynamic solution for allocation of COVID-19 vaccines when supply is limited"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reported study pursues the bidimensional objective, namely, (1) to grasp the essence of the psychological experience of a transatlantic journey and (2) to observe the potential of arts-based research for the enhancement of the well-being of sailors. The sample consisted of three males and one female C Latvian citizens, aged 36C68 years, with higher education and different sailing experience. In the context of a case study grounded on arts-based research methods, the freehand drawings of self-portraits or something important during the day were obtained using individual diaries containing daily reports on the sailing experience. After the journey, individual drawings prompted interviews organized for each participant. The results were triangulated with data from the logbook. In their drawings, participants focused more on the environment rather than on self-representation, that is, telling the story about here and now in terms of specific time (journey), place (boat), and their relationship with nature, as well as dealing with problems during the trip. The psychological experience of transoceanic sailing matched the three general dimensions (dynamics, context, and content of experience) of the conceptual framework constructed for this study. The three dimensions of experience were equivalently represented in research data; however, only dynamics and context were fully delineated in all theoretical subcategories. As to the potential of arts-based research for the enhancement of sailors well-being, the findings show both direct and indirect evidence concerning their psychological and existential well-being.

The spread of the Coronavirus diseases was considerably attributed to the travel and tourism industry, and with the attempt to curb the spread of the virus, the industry experienced calamitous effects and suffered staggering financial losses. The same accounts for wildlife tourism (Southern Africas largest product) C bringing the hunting and ecotourism sector of South Africa to a complete standstill. The pandemic accompanied concerning and devastating effects, not only from a financial point of view, but also in terms of the conservation of these sectors within the industry.

From the results, the estimated financial impact of COVID-19 on the private wildlife industry is R6.694 billion (ZAR). The study made the following three contributions: Firstly, it determined the economic impact of COVID-19 on the private wildlife industry. Secondly, it provides the industry with a tangible document that can be used in securing funding and assistance from government and other non-profit organisations.

CGTases produce a mixture of cyclodextrins from starch consisting of 6 (), 7 () and 8 () glucose units. In an effort to identify the structural factors contributing to the evolutionary diversification of product specificity amongst this group of enzymes, we selected nine CGTases from both mesophilic, thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms for comparative product analysis. These enzymes displayed considerable variation regarding thermostability, initial rates, percentage of substrate conversion and ratio of -, - and -cyclodextrins formed from starch. Sequence comparison of these CGTases revealed that specific incorporation and/or substitution of amino acids at the substrate binding sites, during the evolutionary progression of these enzymes, resulted in diversification of cyclodextrin product specificity.

Longitudinal follow-up studies to a later age are needed in order to increase understanding of the changes in neurodevelopmental trajectories in targeting timely intervention. The aims of this study were to investigate cognitive and motor outcomes, attention-deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) behaviour, school performance, and overall outcomes in a national cohort of ELBW children at preadolescence, and minor neuromotor impairments in a subpopulation of these children and to compare the results with those of full-term controls. The additional aim was to report the overall outcome in all ELBW infants born at 22 to 26 gestational weeks. Methods: This longitudinal prospective national cohort study included all surviving ELBW (birth weight <1000 g) children born in Finland in 1996 to 1997. No children were excluded from the study. Perinatal, neonatal, and follow-up data up to the age of 5 years of these children were registered in the national birth register. According to birth register, the study population included all infants born at the age under 27 gestational weeks. At 11 years of age general cognitive ability was tested with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, ADHD behavior evaluated with a report from each child's own teacher (ADHD Rating Scale IV), and school performance with a parental questionnaire. An ELBW subpopulation consisting of a cohort representative children from the two university hospitals from two regions (n = 63) and the age-matched full-term born controls born in Helsinki university hospital (n = 30) underwent Movement Assessment Battery for Children and Touwen neurological examination comprising developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and minor neurological dysfunction (MND), respectively. Results: Of 206 ELBW survivors 122 (73% of eligible) children and 30 (100%) full-term control children participated in assessments. ELBW children had lower full-scale intellectual quotient than controls (t-test, 90 vs 112, P < .001), elevated teacher- reported inattention scores (median = 4.0 vs 1.0, P = .021, r = .20) and needed more educational support (47% vs 17%, OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.6-12.4, P = .02).

METHODS: We collected detailed information on transmission events and symptom status based on laboratory-confirmed patient data and contact tracing data from four provinces and one municipality in China. We estimated the variation in risk of transmission over time, and the severity of secondary infections, by symptomatic status of the infector. RESULTS: There were 393 symptomatic index cases with 3136 close contacts and 185 asymptomatic index cases with 1078 close contacts included into the study. The secondary attack rate among close contacts of symptomatic and asymptomatic index cases were 4.1% (128/3136) and 1.1% (12/1078), respectively, corresponding to a higher transmission risk from symptomatic cases than from asymptomatic cases (OR: 3.79, 95% CI: 2.06, 6.95). Approximately 25% (32/128) and 50% (6/12) of the infected close contacts were asymptomatic from symptomatic and asymptomatic index cases, respectively, while more than one third (38%) of the infections in the close contacts of symptomatic cases were attributable to exposure to the index cases before symptom onset. Infected contacts of asymptomatic index cases were more likely to be asymptomatic and less likely to be severe.

But in a pandemic, where the primary responsibility of risk management is not centralised within institutional actors but defused across society, trust can become a double-edged sword. Under these conditions, public trust based on a perception of government competence, care and openness may in fact lead people to underestimate risks and thus reduce their belief in the need to take individual action to control the risks. In this paper, we examine the interaction between trust in government, risk perceptions and public compliance in Singapore in the period between January and April 2020. Using social media tracking and online focus group discussions, we present a preliminary assessment of public responses to government risk communication and risk management measures. We highlight the unique deployment of risk communication in Singapore based on the narrative of defensive pessimism to heighten rather than lower levels perceived risk. But the persistence of low public risk perceptions and concomitant low levels of compliance with government risk management measures bring to light the paradox of trust. This calls for further reflection on another dimension of trust which focuses on the role of the public; and further investigation into other social and cultural factors that may have stronger influence over individual belief in the need to take personal actions to control the risks.","output":"The paradox of trust: perceived risk and public compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The challenges wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic on health systems have tested primary care clinicians, who are on the front lines of care delivery.

Association studies included in this review were designed as caseCcontrol/case studies, analyzing the bacteriome, mycobiome, and virome from saliva, oral rinses, oral mucosal swabs, or oral mucosal tissue samples (deep and superficial) and comparing the results in healthy individuals to those with OSCC and/or with premalignant lesions. Changes in relative abundances of specific bacteria (e.g., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus sp.) and fungi (especially Candida sp.) were associated with OSCC. Viruses can also play a role; while the results of studies investigating the role of human papillomavirus in OSCC development are controversial, EpsteinCBarr virus was positively correlated with OSCC. The oral microbiota has been linked to tumorigenesis through a variety of mechanisms, including the stimulation of cell proliferation, tumor invasiveness, angiogenesis, inhibition of cell apoptosis, induction of chronic inflammation, or production of oncometabolites. We also advocate for the necessity of performing a complex analysis of the microbiome in further studies and of standardizing the sampling procedures by establishing guidelines to support future meta-analyses.","output":"The Role of the Oral Microbiota in the Etiopathogenesis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enveloped viruses enter cells by viral glycoprotein-mediated binding to host cells and subsequent fusion of virus and host cell membranes. For the coronaviruses, viral spike (S) proteins execute these cell entry functions. The S proteins are set apart from other viral and cellular membrane fusion proteins by their extensively palmitoylated membrane-associated tails. Palmitate adducts are generally required for protein-mediated fusions, but their precise roles in the process are unclear. To obtain additional insights into the S-mediated membrane fusion process, we focused on these acylated carboxyl-terminal intravirion tails. Substituting alanines for the cysteines that are subject to palmitoylation had effects on both S incorporation into virions and S-mediated membrane fusions. In specifically dissecting the effects of endodomain mutations on the fusion process, we used antiviral heptad repeat peptides that bind only to folding intermediates in the S-mediated fusion process and found that mutants lacking three palmitoylated cysteines remained in transitional folding states nearly 10 times longer than native S proteins. This slower refolding was also reflected in the paucity of postfusion six-helix bundle configurations among the mutant S proteins. Viruses with fewer palmitoylated S protein cysteines entered cells slowly and had reduced specific infectivities. These findings indicate that lipid adducts anchoring S proteins into virus membranes are necessary for the rapid, productive S protein refolding events that culminate in membrane fusions. These studies reveal a previously unappreciated role for covalently attached lipids on the endodomains of viral proteins eliciting membrane fusion reactions.","output":"Role of Spike Protein Endodomains in Regulating Coronavirus Entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the extreme release of inflammatory mediators into the blood in response to infection (e.g., bacterial infection, COVID-19), resulting in the dysfunction of multiple organs.

All 23 patients were evaluated and admitted at San Giuseppe Moscati Hospital in Aversa, Italy. Multi-modality imaging findings were evaluated and compared. Literature research was conducted through a methodical search on PubMed. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were included in the study. Chest transthoracic ultrasound (US), chest X-ray (CXR), and computed tomography (CT) were performed respectively in 11, 16 and 21 patients. Chest US findings were consistent with diffuse B lines (91%), subpleural consolidations (45%), and thickened pleural line (18%). CXR showed prevalent manifestations of consolidations (50%) and hazy increased opacities (37%). Typical CT features are bilateral and multilobar ground-glass opacities (GGO). Indeed GGO were present in 100% of our patients. Consolidations were visible in 76% of our study population. Notably both GGO and consolidations had a peripheral distribution in all our patients. Other CT imaging features included crazy-paving pattern, fibrous stripes, subpleural lines, architectural distortion, air bronchogram sign, vascular thickening and nodules. Our literature review identified thirty original studies supporting our imaging chest findings.

While countries worldwide have been pursuing different school reopening strategies, most EU countries are planning to keep schools open during the whole winter season 2020/21. Open schools in winter in highly epidemic areas pose a controversial issue: ventilation of classrooms (an essential mitigation factor for airborne transmission) is expected to sensibly decrease due to outdoor temperatures getting colder and regulators going to allow less restrictive policies on windows closure. Fundamental questions to be addressed are therefore: to which extent can we contain airborne risk in schools with natural ventilation ? what would be the optimal ventilation cycle during the cold season considering the fact that most schools are not provided with mechanical ventilation systems? And, finally, what are the safety ranges to keep the infection risk below the threshold values for new infections within a classroom? To try answering these questions a risk model for airborne transmission of covid-19 in classrooms has been develped based on previous models for tubercolosis and influenza. The separate cases of infectious student and infectious teacher are investigated. The study explored the influence of 3500 different air ventilation cycles on the cumulative airborne risk function throughout a school day.

Our second aim was to evaluate the impact of viral infections on delaying the patients' chemotherapy or radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2014 to July 2017. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed in patients younger than 21 years with acute respiratory infections. Patients were treated in the Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department of Dr. Beh?et Uz Children's Hospital with real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Data were analyzed to determine the frequency and seasonality of infections. The  or the Fisher exact tests were used. RESULTS A total of 219 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirates and blood were analyzed. The mean patient age was 76.859.3 months, with 46.3% female and 53.7% male children in a total of 108 patients. Of this total, 55% (60/108 cases) had multiple acute respiratory infections. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (48.1%) was the most prevalent disease. The 3 most prevalent viruses were human rhinovirus (HRV) (33.1%), parainfluenza (PI) (18.7%), and coronavirus (CoV) (14.8%). In terms of the seasonal distribution of viruses, PI was most common in winter 2014, HRV in spring 2014, HRV in fall 2014, PI in winter 2015 and summer 2015, CoV in spring 2015, HRV in fall 2015, both influenza and HRV in winter 2016, both human metapneumovirus and bocavirus in spring 2016, HRV in summer 2016, both HRV and PI in fall 2016, both respiratory syncytial virus and influenza in winter 2017, HRV in spring 2017, and both HRV and adenovirus in summer 2017. The mean duration of neutropenia for patients with viral respiratory infection was 17.113.8 (range: 2 to 90) days. The mean duration of symptoms of viral respiratory infection was 6.84.2 (range: 2 to 31) days. A delay in chemotherapy treatment owing to viral respiratory infection was detected in 73 (33.3%) patients. The mean duration of delay in chemotherapy treatment was 9.65.4 (range: 3 to 31) days.

Multinomial and ordinal logistic regression models were used to identify the predictors of coping strategies and anxiety. RESULTS Totally, 500 people completed the questionnaires (response rate: 73%). Of them, 53.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 48.9%- 57.8%) suffered moderate to severe levels of anxiety. More than half of the respondents (52.0%; 95% CI: 47.5%-56.4%) utilized emotional-based or avoidant coping strategies. People with no academic education (odds ratio [OR]: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.41- 3.31) and without physical exercise (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.22-3.33) preferred emotional-based coping instead of problem-based coping strategy. Female gender (OR: 1.60, 95%, CI: 1.13-2.28), underlying medical conditions (OR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.65-3.87), and emotional-based coping (OR: 4.06, 95% CI: 2.76-5.99) were associated with higher severity levels of anxiety. CONCLUSION The severity of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic was significant among participants. Further attention is needed to enhance the mental health of the vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also identified some factors related to the severity level of anxiety related to COVID-19 that could help formulate better psychological interventions.","output":"Anxiety Severity Levels and Coping Strategies during the COVID-19 Pandemic among People Aged 15 Years and Above in Gonabad, Iran."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As life expectancy increases, the worldwide population aged 60 years and older increases year by year. Consequently, more older people receive medical attention, especially those who undergo surgery. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a global impact on elderly patients, especially those undergoing surgery. This study aims to describe the characteristics and analyze the survival rate of elderly patients who receive anesthesia services, especially those with comorbidities and COVID-19. Methods A prospective cohort study at 14 central hospitals in Indonesia analyzed 1621 elderly patients (67.1  6.2 years old). The variables that were recorded included patient characteristics, comorbidities, the COVID-19 status, and the survival rate, including 30-day mortality. Results The 30-day mortality was 4.4%. The most comorbidity was hypertension (30.0). Patients with a Charlson's Comorbidity Index Score of 3-4 had a higher death rate (15.3%). The highest mortality rates were in the patients who had dementia, rheumatologic disease, liver disease, previous myocardial infarction, and diabetes with chronic complications as comorbidities. The percent of patients with COVID-19 who died was 26.6%.

Although automated fact-checking methods have gained significant attention recently, they require pre-existing ground-truth evidence, which, in the scientific context, is sparse and scattered across a constantly-evolving scientific literature. Existing methods do not exploit this literature, which can effectively contextualize and combat science-related fallacies. Furthermore, these methods rarely require human intervention, which is essential for the convoluted and critical domain of scientific misinformation. SciClops involves three main steps to process scientific claims found in online news articles and social media postings: extraction, clustering, and contextualization. First, the extraction of scientific claims takes place using a domain-specific, fine-tuned transformer model. Second, similar claims extracted from heterogeneous sources are clustered together with related scientific literature using a method that exploits their content and the connections among them. Third, check-worthy claims, broadcasted by popular yet unreliable sources, are highlighted together with an enhanced fact-checking context that includes related verified claims, news articles, and scientific papers. Extensive experiments show that SciClops tackles sufficiently these three steps, and effectively assists non-expert fact-checkers in the verification of complex scientific claims, outperforming commercial fact-checking systems.","output":"SciClops: Detecting and Contextualizing Scientific Claims for Assisting Manual Fact-Checking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has adversely affected global health since its emergence in 2019. The lack of effective treatments prompted worldwide efforts to immediately develop therapeutic strategies against COVID-19. The main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial role in viral replication, and therefore it serves as an attractive target for COVID-19-specific drug development. Due to the richness and diversity of insect protease inhibitors, we docked SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) onto 25 publicly accessible insect-derived protease inhibitors using the ClusPro server, and the regions with high inhibitory potentials against M(pro) were used to design peptides. Interactions of these inhibitory peptides with M(pro) were further assessed by two directed docking programs, AutoDock and Haddock. AutoDock analysis predicted the highest binding energy (?9.39 kcal/mol) and the lowest inhibition constant (130 nM) for the peptide 1KJ0-7 derived from SGCI (Schistocerca gregaria chymotrypsin inhibitor). On the other hand, Haddock analysis resulted in the discovery of a different peptide designated 2ERW-9 from infestin, a serine protease inhibitor of Triatoma infestans, with the best docking score (?131), binding energy (?11.7 kcal/mol), and dissociation constant (2.6E-09 M) for M(pro). Furthermore, using molecular dynamic simulations, 1KJ0-7 and 2ERW-9 were demonstrated to form stable complexes with M(pro). The peptides also showed suitable drug-likeness properties compared to commercially available drugs based on Lipinski's rule.

Compounded by the inherent vulnerabilities of women in crises, substantial complications are directly associated with increased risks of poor SRHR outcomes for displaced populations. The migration of Venezuelans, displaced due to current economic circumstances, is one of the largest in Latin Americas history. This study aims to provide an overview of the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues affecting migrant Venezuelan women in the state of Roraima, Brazil. METHODS: Face-to-face interviews were conducted from 24 to 30 November 2019. Data collection covered various issues involving access to and use of SRH services by 405 migrant Venezuelan women aged 18C49 years. The Minimum Initial Service Package readiness assessment tools, available from the Inter-Agency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crises, were used in the data collection. RESULTS: Most commonly, the women reported unmet family planning needs. Of these, a significant proportion reported being unable to obtain contraceptive methods, particularly long-acting reversible contraceptives, either due to the womans inability to access them or their unavailability at healthcare centres. Although a significant proportion of women were largely satisfied with the attention received at the maternity hospital, both before and during childbirth, 24.0% of pregnant or postpartum women failed to receive any prenatal or postnatal care. CONCLUSION: Meeting the essential SRHR needs of migrant Venezuelan women in Roraima, Brazil is a challenge that has yet to be fully addressed. Given the size of this migrant population, the Brazilian healthcare system has failed to adapt sufficiently to meet their needs; however, problems with healthcare provision are similar for migrants and Brazilian citizens. Efforts need to be encouraged not only in governmental health sectors, but also with academic, non-governmental and international organisations, including a coordinated approach to ensure a comprehensive SRHR response. Given the current high risks associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, meeting the SRHR needs of migrant populations has become more critical than ever.","output":"Maternal health among Venezuelan women migrants at the border of Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main contribution of the present study to the energy literature is to explore the relationship between economic growth and pollution emission amidst globalization.

This is especially paradoxical given the epidemiological links between poor air quality and increased COVID-19 severity in adults and that children are generally more vulnerable than adults to the adverse consequences of air pollution. OBJECTIVES: To identify gaps in knowledge about the factors that protect children from severe SARS-Cov-2 infection even in the face of air pollution, and to develop a transdisciplinary research strategy to address these gaps. METHODS: An international group of researchers interested in childrens environmental health was invited to identify knowledge gaps and to develop research questions to close these gaps. DISCUSSION: Key research questions identified include: what are the effects of SAR-Cov-2 infection during pregnancy on the developing fetus and child; what is the impact of age at infection and genetic susceptibility on disease severity; why do some children with COVID-19 infection develop toxic shock and Kawasaki-like symptoms; what are the impacts of toxic environmental exposures including poor air quality, chemical and metal exposures on innate immunity, especially in the respiratory epithelium; what is the possible role of a dirty environment in conveying protection C an example of the hygiene hypothesis; and what are the long term health effects of SARS-Cov-2 infection in early life. CONCLUSION: A concerted research effort by a multidisciplinary team of scientists is needed to understand the links between environmental exposures, especially air pollution and COVID-19. We call for specific research funding to encourage basic and clinical research to understand if/why exposure to environmental factors is associated with more severe disease, why children appear to be protected, and how innate immune responses may be involved.

For each assay, sensitivity and specificity was calculated relative to consensus results (majority of immunoassays positive = overall positive) and neutralising activity. Quantitative correlation was performed between serological and neutralising titres. Results Seroprevalence ranged from 3.4-7.3 % in primary care patients and 3-5.9 % in paediatric patients according to different immunoassays. Neutralising activity was detectable in 2.8 % and 1.3 % respectively. Relative assay performance changed depending on comparison to immunoassay consensus versus neutralising activity and qualititative versus quantitative agreement. Cross-reactivity with endemic seasonal coronaviruses was confirmed by neutralising assay in false positives for one immunoassay. Presence of false positives for another assay was found specifically in paediatric but not adult samples. Conclusions Five serological assays show variable accuracy when applied to the general population, impacting seroprevalence estimates.

Demands on therapist time limit adoption of behavioral programs like Constraint-Induced Movement (CI) therapy, however. Self-managed motor practice could free therapist time for behavioral intervention, but there remains insufficient evidence of efficacy for a self-management approach. METHODS: This completed, parallel, five-site, pragmatic, single-blind trial established the comparative effectiveness of using in-home gaming self-management as a vehicle to redirect valuable therapist time towards behavioral intervention. Community-dwelling adults with post-stroke (>6 months) mild/moderate upper extremity hemiparesis were randomized to receive one of 4 different interventions over a 3-week period: 5 h of behaviorally-focused intervention plus gaming self-management (Self-Gaming), the same with additional behaviorally-focused telerehabilitation (Tele-Gaming), 5 h of Traditional motor-focused rehabilitation, or 35 h of CI therapy. Primary outcomes assessed everyday arm use (Motor Activity Log Quality of Movement, MAL) and motor speed/function (Wolf Motor Function Test, WMFT) immediately before treatment, immediately after treatment, and 6 months later. Intent-to-treat analyses were implemented with linear mixed-effects models on data gathered from March 15, 2016 to November 21, 2019. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02631850. RESULTS: Of 193 enrolled participants, 167 began treatment and were analyzed, 150 (90%) completed treatment, and 115 (69%) completed follow-up. Tele-Gaming and Self-Gaming produced clinically meaningful MAL gains that were 10 points (95% CI 08 to 13) and 08 points (95% CI 05 to 10) larger than Traditional care, respectively. Self-Gaming was less effective than CI therapy (-04 points, 95% CI -06 to -02), whereas Tele-Gaming was not (-02 points, 95% CI -04 to 01). Six-month retention of MAL gains across all groups was 57%. All had similar clinically-meaningful WMFT gains; six-month retention of WMFT gains was 92%. INTERPRETATION: Self-managed motor-gaming with behavioral telehealth visits has outcomes similar to in-clinic CI therapy.

Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the tourist behavioral intentions after the first outbreak of COVID-19 with evidence from the Greek market. Design/methodology/approach: A primary survey with questionnaires distributed via online channels (email and social media) has been undertaken to focus on the travelers preferences when it comes to the main parts that compose the holiday travel (destination, transport mode, accommodation type). Additionally, there were questions regard to their perceptions on the international norms of health protection against the virus. Findings: The results of the survey illustrate some prima facie evidence of tourist behavioral intentions of Greeks, upon a statistical analysis, which indicates preference in domestic tourism and personalized services, issues related with travel costs and health safety awareness, toward tourism recovery process and customers reengagement and trust to the tourism businesses and destinations. Originality/value: As Greece is a popular destination that includes a plethora of tourism cities, this paper illustrates the intentions of Greeks toward tourism activity upon pandemic crisis, when it comes to their travel preferences, as well as their perceptions on health and safety protocols applied in destinations and tourism businesses. ? 2021, International Tourism Studies Association.","output":"Measuring tourist behavioral intentions after the first outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

As the mobility is decreased, a percolation phase transition is found separating a free-propagation phase in which the outburst spreads without finding spatial barriers and a localized phase in which the outburst dies off. Interestingly, the number of infected agents is subject to maximal fluctuations at the transition point, building upon the unpredictability of the evolution of an epidemic outburst. Our model also lends itself to testing vaccination schedules. Indeed, it has been suggested that if a vaccine is available but scarce it is convenient to carefully select the vaccination program to maximize the chances of halting the outburst. We discuss and evaluate several schemes, with special interest on how the percolation transition point can be shifted, allowing for higher mobility without epidemiological impact.","output":"Effects of confinement and vaccination on an epidemic outburst: a statistical mechanics approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The combination of COVID-19 vaccination with immunotherapy by checkpoint inhibitors in cancer patients could intensify immunological stimulation with potential reciprocal benefits.

Global public measures have been enacted to try to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. The trauma and orthopaedic (T&O) community has overcome challenges in order to continue to deliver acute trauma care to patients and plan for challenges ahead. This review explores the lessons learnt, the priorities and the controversies that the T&O community has faced during the crisis. Historically, the experience of major incidents in T&O has focused on mass casualty events. The current pandemic requires a different approach to resource management in order to create a long-term, system-sustaining model of care alongside a move towards resource balancing and facilitation. Significant limitations in theatre access, anaesthetists and bed capacity have necessitated adaptation. Strategic changes to trauma networks and risk mitigation allowed for ongoing surgical treatment of trauma. Outpatient care was reformed with the uptake of technology. The return to elective surgery requires careful planning, restructuring of elective pathways and risk management. Despite the hope that mass vaccination will lift the pressure on bed capacity and on bleak economic forecasts, the orthopaedic community must readjust its focus to meet the challenge of huge backlogs in elective caseloads before looking to the future with a robust strategy of integrated resilient pathways.

Kavalactones are the active constituents of kava products and are associated with sedative and anxiolytic effects. Kavalactones have been evaluated in vitro for their potential to alter the activity of various CYP450 enzymes but have undergone little systematic investigation as to their potential influence on esterases. This study investigated the inhibition effects of kava and its kavalactones on carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) in an in vitro system and established associated kinetic parameters. Kava and its kavalactones were found to produce reversible inhibition of CES1 to varying degrees. Kavain, dihydrokavain, and desmethoxyyangonin displayed competitive type inhibition, while methysticin, dihydromethysticin, and yangonin displayed a mixed competitive-noncompetitive type inhibition. The inhibition constants (Ki) values for each of the kavalactones were as follows: methysticin (35.2a?M), dihydromethysticin (68.2a?M), kavain (81.6a?M), dihydrokavain (105.3a?M), yangonin (24.9a?M), and desmethoxyyangonin (25.2a?M). With consideration to the in vitro Ki for each evaluated kavalactone as well as available clinical kavalactone concentrations in blood circulation, co-administration of CES1 substrate medications and kava products at the recommended daily dose is generally free of drug interaction concerns. However, uncertainty around kavalactone exposure in humans has been noted and a clinically relevant CES1 inhibition by kavain, dihydrokavain, and dihydromethysticin is indeed possible if the kavalactone consumption is higher than 1000a?mg in the context of over-the-counter usage.

The authors hypothesized that weight-based administration might improve the pharmacokinetics of prophylactic enoxaparin when compared to fixed-dose administration. METHODS: The FIxed or Variable Enoxaparin (FIVE) trial was a randomized, double-blind trial that compared the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes of patients assigned randomly to postoperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis using enoxaparin 40 mg twice daily or enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg twice daily. Patients were randomized after surgery and received the first enoxaparin dose at 8 hours after surgery. Primary hypotheses were (1) weight-based administration is noninferior to a fixed dose for avoiding underanticoagulation (anti-factor Xa <0.2 IU/ml) and (2) weight-based administration is superior to fixed-dose administration for avoiding overanticoagulation (anti-factor Xa >0.4 IU/ml). Secondary endpoints were 90-day venous thromboembolism and bleeding. RESULTS: In total, 295 patients were randomized, with 151 assigned to fixed-dose and 144 to weight-based administration of enoxaparin. For avoidance of under anticoagulation, weight-based administration had a greater effectiveness (79.9 percent versus 76.6 percent); the 3.3 percent (95 percent CI, -7.5 to 12.5 percent) greater effectiveness achieved statistically significant noninferiority relative to the a priori specified -12 percent noninferiority margin (p = 0.004). For avoidance of overanticoagulation, weight-based enoxaparin administration was superior to fixed-dose administration (90.6 percent versus 82.2 percent); the 8.4 percent (95 percent CI, 0.1 to 16.6 percent) greater effectiveness showed significant safety superiority (p = 0.046).

In this study, we aim to assess the impact of the duration of the lockdown on glycaemic control and diabetes-related complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using Cochrane library. A simulation model was created using glycemic data from previous disasters (taken as similar in impact to current lockdown) taking baseline HBA1c and diabetes-related complications data from India-specific database. A multivariate regression analysis was conducted to analyse the relationship between the duration of lockdown and glycaemic targets & diabetes-related complications. RESULTS: The predictive model was extremely robust (R2 = 0.99) and predicted outcomes for period of lockdown up to 90 days. The predicted increment in HBA1c from baseline at the end of 30 days and 45 days lockdown was projected as 2.26% & 3.68% respectively. Similarly, the annual predicted percentage increase in complication rates at the end of 30-day lockdown was 2.8% for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 2.9% for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 1.5% for retinal photocoagulation, 9.3% for microalbuminuria, 14.2% for proteinuria, 2.9% for peripheral neuropathy, 10.5% for lower extremity amputation, 0.9% for myocardial infarction, 0.5% for stroke and 0.5% for infections.

These alternate clean hospital sites were independent hospitals running active staff and patient testing programmes for COVID-19 and which did not admit or treat patients suffering with COVID-19. METHODS: A prospective survey was undertaken to include patients at least 30 days after a planned surgery or procedure conducted at a clean alternate hospital site during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted using structured interviews undertaken by trained assessors. A 20% sample group of patients were randomly selected to participate in this study. Qualitative data related to confidence, safety and perceptions of safety were collected. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients (60%) reported that they had prior worries or concerns about undergoing an elective procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 47 patients (30%) had delayed their surgery at least once because of these concerns. A total of 150 patients (95%) felt that the precautions in place to protect their safety in the setting of an alternate clean hospital site were well thought out and proportionate. Patients reported high levels of confidence in the measures undertaken. Separation of patient pathways using the independent sector and patient testing were identified by patients as having the greatest impact on their perception of safety. CONCLUSIONS: Patient confidence will be key to ensuring uptake of planned and elective procedures and surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: We explored for the first time the features of diverse circulating and tumor\\\\infiltrating pDC subsets in melanoma patients using multi\\\\parametric flow cytometry, and assessed their clinical relevance. Based on CD80, PDL1, CD2, LAG3 and Axl markers, we provided an integrated overview of the frequency, basal activation status and functional features of pDC subsets in melanoma patients together with their relationship to clinical outcome.

Assays to detect virus-specific antibodies are important to understand the prevalence of infection and the course of the immune response. METHODS: Quantitative measurements of plasma or serum antibodies to the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were analyzed using luciferase immunoprecipitation system assays in 100 cross-sectional or longitudinal samples from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A subset of samples was tested both with and without heat inactivation. RESULTS: At >14 days after symptom onset, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, whereas antibodies to spike protein were detected with 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Neither antibody levels nor the rate of seropositivity were significantly reduced by heat inactivation of samples. Analysis of daily samples from 6 patients with COVID-19 showed anti-nucleocapsid and spike protein antibodies appearing between days 8 and 14 after initial symptoms. Immunocompromised patients generally had a delayed antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, compared with immunocompetent patients. CONCLUSIONS: Antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive than spike protein antibody for detecting early infection. Analyzing heat-inactivated samples with a luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay is a safe and sensitive method for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","output":"Sensitivity in Detection of Antibodies to Nucleocapsid and Spike Proteins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 caused by SARS-CoV-2 originated from China and spread across every corner of the world.

An understanding of the patterns of transmission and the effects on public health in relation to control measures that were taken will help health officials prepare for any future outbreaks. METHODS We analyzed SARS case, quarantine, and hotline records in relation to control measures. The two phases of the outbreak were compared. RESULTS Toronto Public Health investigated 2132 potential cases of SARS, identified 23,103 contacts of SARS patients as requiring quarantine, and logged 316,615 calls on its SARS hotline. In Toronto, 225 residents met the case definition of SARS, and all but 3 travel-related cases were linked to the index patient, from Hong Kong. SARS spread to 11 (58 percent) of Toronto's acute care hospitals. Unrecognized SARS among in-patients with underlying illness caused a resurgence, or a second phase, of the outbreak, which was finally controlled through active surveillance of hospitalized patients. In response to the control measures of Toronto Public Health, the number of persons who were exposed to SARS in nonhospital and nonhousehold settings dropped from 20 (13 percent) before the control measures were instituted (phase 1) to 0 afterward (phase 2). The number of patients who were exposed while in a hospital ward rose from 25 (17 percent) in phase 1 to 68 (88 percent) in phase 2, and the number exposed while in the intensive care unit dropped from 13 (9 percent) in phase 1 to 0 in phase 2. Community spread (the length of the chains of transmission outside of hospital settings) was significantly reduced in phase 2 of the outbreak (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The transmission of SARS in Toronto was limited primarily to hospitals and to households that had had contact with patients. For every case of SARS, health authorities should expect to quarantine up to 100 contacts of the patients and to investigate 8 possible cases.

Virus detection by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) is sensitive but costly, and antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are cheap but with reduced sensitivity; both detect current infection but not exposure. RDT-IgM/IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 detect exposure but have poor sensitivity for current infection. We investigated if the integration of symptomatic, demographical and diet-related comorbidities data with antibody RDTs improves their potential to assess infection rates in addition to exposure, thereby broadening their utility for surveillance. DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from community surveillance for SARS-CoV-2. Health workers collected nasopharyngeal swabs for RT-PCR and RDT antigen assessments and venous blood for RDT-IgM/IgG from symptomatic and asymptomatic persons. Data on age, gender, contact history, symptoms (ie, fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache, dyspnoea and diarrhoea), diet-related comorbidities (ie, diabetes and hypertension) and chest radiology were collected. SETTING: High-risk communities in Jakarta, Indonesia, in May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 343 community members data were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: RDT-IgM/IgG sensitivity, specificity and predictive values and area under receiver operating characteristic curve for RT-PCR positivity using RDT results alone and in combination with other predictors, including symptom components derived from principal component analysis. RESULTS: There were 24 PCR-confirmed infections. RDT-IgM/IgG-positive tests were associated with infection (OR 10.8, 95% CI 4.43 to 26.4, p<0.001) with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.708% and 50% sensitivity, 91.5% specificity, 30.8% positive predictive value (PPV) and 96.1% negative predictive value (NPV).

These conditions are characterized by the augmented release of inflammatory cytokines that have been suggested as potential triggers for the acute respiratory distress syndrome, which may favor severe and even fatal outcomes. For these reasons, this review aims to evaluate what influenza and COVID-19 may represent for patients with IBD. METHODS: The search was performed in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed to build the review. RESULTS: The conventional therapies used by IBD patients may also interfere in the outcomes of influenza and COVID-19. Immune-suppressors agents are associated with a higher risk of infections due to the inhibition of intracellular signals necessary to the host act against pathogens. On the other hand, drugs related to the suppression of the production of cytokines in IBD could bring benefits to reduce mucosal inflammation, and for preventing pneumonia. Moreover, coronaviruses can bind to the target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor that is expressed in epithelial cells of the lung and largely the colon and the terminal ileum suggesting that human intestinal tract could be an alternative route for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Age-specific distributions of known SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related deaths are available for most countries. However, relatively little attention has been given to the age distributions of hospitalizations and serious healthcare interventions administered to COVID-19 patients. We examined these distributions in Ontario, Canada, in order to quantify the age-related impacts of COVID-19, and to identify potential risks should the healthcare system become overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients in the future. Methods: We analysed known SARS-CoV-2 infection records from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) and the Toronto Public Health Coronavirus Rapid Entry System (CORES) between 23 January 2020 and 17 June 2020 (N = 30,546), and estimated the age distributions of hospitalizations, ICU admissions, intubations, and ventilations. We quantified the probability of hospitalization given known SARS-CoV-2 infection, and of survival given COVID-19-related hospitalization. Results: The distribution of COVID-19-related hospitalizations peaks with a wide plateau covering ages 54-90, whereas deaths are sharply concentrated in very old ages, with a maximum at age 90. The estimated probability of hospitalization given known SARS-CoV-2 infection reaches a maximum of 32.0% at age 75 (95% CI 27.5%-36.7%). The probability of survival given COVID-19-related hospitalization is uncertain for children (due to small sample size), and near 100% for adults younger than 40. After age 40, survival of hospitalized COVID-19 patients declines substantially; for example, a hospitalized 50-year-old patient has a 90.4% chance of surviving COVID-19 (95% CI 81.9%-95.7%). Interpretation: Concerted efforts to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have kept prevalence of the virus low in the population of Ontario. The healthcare system has not been overstretched, yet the probability of survival given hospitalization for COVID-19 has been lower than is generally recognized for patients over 40. If prevalence of the virus were to increase and healthcare capacities were to be exceeded, survival of individuals in the broad age range requiring acute care would be expected to decrease, potentially expanding the distribution of COVID-19-related deaths toward younger ages.","output":"Age-dependence of healthcare interventions for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has ravaged many urban and high-density areas in the USA.

Proper and faster diagnosis of pneumonia at an early stage is imperative for optimal patient care. Currently, chest X-ray is considered as the best imaging modality for diagnosing pneumonia. However, the interpretation of chest X-ray images is challenging. To this end, we aimed to use an automated convolutional neural network-based transfer-learning approach to detect pneumonia in paediatric chest radiographs. METHODS: Herein, an automated convolutional neural network-based transfer-learning approach using four different pre-trained models (i.e. VGG19, DenseNet121, Xception, and ResNet50) was applied to detect pneumonia in children (1-5 years) chest X-ray images. The performance of different proposed models for testing data set was evaluated using five performances metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity/recall, Precision, area under curve, and F1 score. RESULTS: All proposed models provide accuracy greater than 83.0% for binary classification. The pre-trained DenseNet121 model provides the highest classification performance of automated pneumonia classification with 86.8% accuracy, followed by Xception model with an accuracy of 86.0%. The sensitivity of the proposed models was greater than 91.0%. The Xception and DenseNet121 models achieve the highest classification performance with F1-score greater than 89.0%. The plotted area under curve of receiver operating characteristics of VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 models are 0.78, 0.81, 0.81, and 0.86, respectively.

The majority of older adults in the U.S. also have suboptimal diet quality. An older adult's household role may influence their diet quality and the household's food security status, especially in mixed-generation households, but this hypothesis has yet to be tested. To explore the relationships between an older adult's household role, the household's food security status, and the older adult's diet quality in mixed-generation households. A cross-sectional analysis of a nationally-representative sample of U.S. households with at least 1 older adult (age 60+ years) from the 2011-2016 NHANES was conducted (n = 8,136). Households were categorized as: older adult as head of household and child caregiver (ie, child(ren) present, but no adults 18-59 years;HHC);head of household, but not a caregiver (HHNC);and neither head of household nor caregiver (ie, reference person &lt; 60 years;NHNC). The U.S. Household Food Security Survey and Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) from a single dietary recall were used to assess food security status and diet quality, respectively. Weighted chi-square and ANOVA tests were used to compare food security status and HEI-2015 scores across household categories, respectively. HHNC households were significantly more likely to be fully food secure (84% FFS;P &lt; 0.001) than HHC households (67% FFS) and NHNC households (68% FFS). Older adults as HHNC had significantly higher HEI-2015 scores (mean: 53.7, P &lt; 0.001) than HHC older adults (50.2) and NHNC older adults (51.5). Findings suggest that caregiving demands may have a negative influence on food security and diet quality of older adults in mixed generation households. While such relationships have potential bearing on nutrition programming and policy, further research is needed to understand the underlying household dynamics, including more advanced analyses to account for potential covariates (eg, the number and age of children and roles of other household members).

This has accelerated in the COVID-19 era. FPHCs provide low-income individuals in rural areas with essential primary care services, including sexually transmitted infection prevention, testing, and treatment. The purpose of this analysis is to use spatiotemporal methods to examine the impact of FPHC closures in Iowa on the reported number of gonorrhea and chlamydia cases at the county level. METHODS: This analysis investigates the association between FPHC closures and changes in the number of gonorrhea and chlamydia cases between 2016 and 2018. Iowa implemented defunding policies for family planning clinics, resulting in four FPHC closures in June 2017. 2016 pre-closure STI incidence rates were compared to 2018 post-closure rates. Gonorrhea and chlamydia rates in the four Iowa counties with clinic closures were compared to the 95 Iowa counties without closures. T tests were used to compare changes in reported gonorrhea and chlamydia rates in the two settings. Linear regression modeling was used to determine the relationship between clinic closures and changes in gonorrhea and chlamydia cases. RESULTS: The gonorrhea burden in Iowa increased from 83 cases per 100,000 people in 2016 to 153.8 cases per 100,000 people in 2018. The four counties with clinic closures experienced a significantly larger increase (absolute 217 cases per 100,000 population) in their gonorrhea rate compared to counties without FPHC closures (absolute 121 cases per 100,000 population). There was also a significant relationship between clinic closures and increasing gonorrhea rates (p = 0.0015). Over the three-year period, there was no change in chlamydia rates (p = 0.1182). However, there was a trend towards counties with more FPHC closures having a higher number of chlamydia cases (p = 0.057). CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that many STI diagnoses are made and reported by FPHCs, our data suggest that clinic closures may have contributed to an increase in gonorrhea and chlamydia cases. This is consistent with delayed diagnoses and missed opportunities for providing essential STI services to vulnerable and under-served rural residents. Legislative action is urgently needed to curtail this trend. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures","output":"1535.

METHODS: Participants (N = 270) with advanced cancer in a tertiary cancer hospital completed anonymous questionnaire surveys. Measures included the Chinese version of a Likert-type Templer-Death Anxiety Scale, Rosenbergs Self-esteem Scale, Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire, the Social Support Rating Scale, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Data were analyzed in SPSS using descriptive statistics, Students t test, Pearson correlation test, and linear regression. RESULTS: Respondents returned 252 (93.33%) of the 270 questionnaires. The total CL-TDAS score was 39.56  10.20. The top three items were I fear dying a painful death (3.59  1.41), I often think about how shortly life really is (3.11  1.33), and 1 am not particularly afraid of getting cancer (3.09  1.35). Associated factors of death anxiety (R(2) = .333, F = 15.756, p < .001) were the medical coping mode (resignation, confronce), self-esteem, the participants adult children, the patient-primary caregivers relationship, resilience, and the level of activity of daily living. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate high levels of death anxiety in advanced cancer patients. Generally, patients with adult children, high self-esteem and resilience had low death anxiety. Conversely, patients with low levels of activity of daily living and high coping mode (resignation, confrontation) reported high death anxiety.

We used United States Renal Data System data to examine rates of antibiotic administration within dialysis facilities and rates of hospital admission for catheter-associated bloodstream infection from March 2018 through November 2020, and rates of hospitalization for sepsis, to address overall changes in hospitalization during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Using logistic regression, we estimated year-over-year adjusted odds ratios of these events in 3-month intervals. During the first 6 months of the pandemic, rates of antibiotic administration were between 20% and 21% lower, and rates of hospitalization for catheter-associated bloodstream infection were between 17% and 24% lower than during corresponding periods in 2019, without significant changes in rates of hospitalization for sepsis. However, rates of catheter-associated events also decreased between 2018 and 2019, driven by reductions in facilities operated by a large dialysis provider. These data suggest that significant reductions in catheter-associated infections occurred during the pandemic, superimposed on nonpandemic-related reductions in some facilities before the pandemic. Even after the pandemic, it may be prudent to continue some COVID-19 mitigation measures to prevent catheter-associated bloodstream infections.","output":"Catheter-Associated Bloodstream Infections among Patients on Hemodialysis: Progress before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine trends in employment, earnings and incomes over the last two decades in the United States, and how the safety net has responded to changing fortunes, including the shutdown of the economy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic The US safety net is a patchwork of different programmes providing in-kind as well as cash benefits, and it had many holes prior to the pandemic In addition, few of the programmes are designed explicitly as automatic stabilisers We show that the safety net response to employment losses in the COVID-19 pandemic largely consists only of increased support from unemployment insurance and food assistance programmes, an inadequate response compared with the magnitude of the downturn We discuss options to reform social assistance in the United States to provide more robust income floors in times of economic downturns ? 2020 The Authors Fiscal Studies published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Institute for Fiscal Studies","output":"COVID-19 and the US Safety Net*"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of anakinra in patients who were admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring high oxygen therapy.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted, with self-reported data of students from 14 Cuban universities of medical sciences (n=200), through an online survey. The EEP-10-C was used as an instrument to identify stress. Its validity was determined through a confirmatory factor analysis and its internal consistency and reliability was measured by the Cronbach's alpha. A cluster analysis was performed to establish as the cut-off point the centre of the cluster with the highest values of stress perceived by the scale. RESULTS: The average age of the sample was 23.30 1.91 years, with observed scores of the EEP-10-C between 0 and 29 points (13.255.404). When applying the cut-off point &#8805;25, only two students had high rates of perceived stress. The confirmatory factor analysis supported the validity of the instrument (&#945;=0.755). The cut-off point &#8805;20 was proposed as a reference of high stress perceived for the study population, when applying this one, 14% of students presented high rates of stress. CONCLUSIONS: In Cuba, students of the medical sciences have participated in research and healthcare support, despite which they have presented low levels of stress.

We examined the impact of the pandemic on psychosocial functioning of adolescent and emerging adult survivors and their parents. We hypothesized that COVID-19 disruptions and survivor social connectedness would be associated with survivor-reported posttraumatic stress and family outcomes, including family functioning, parenting, and parent mental health. PROCEDURE: Fifty-five families (44 survivors, 48 parents) were recruited via phone and email to participate in the study. Survivors were ages 13-25 (M = 19.62, SD = 3.47) and at least 5 years post diagnosis. Parents completed the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey (CEFIS), and survivors completed the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) COVID-19 child self-report form, which assessed pandemic impacts on their psychosocial functioning. RESULTS: Parents reported a mean of 7.52 (SD = 2.83) disruptions to their families' lives. The pandemic negatively affected survivors' life satisfaction (Mdiff = 0.46, t(44) = 3.96, p < .001), with 92% reporting reduced social connectedness (n = 39). Total disruptions due to COVID-19 and survivor social connectedness predicted survivor-reported posttraumatic stress, above and beyond survivors' pre-pandemic psychosocial risk. Most parents reported positive changes in their parenting (n = 31, 67.4%) and family cohesion (n = 30, 66.7%). However, they also reported worsened mood (n = 28, 62.3%) and increased anxiety (n = 31, 71.1%).

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) in people not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa. Participants 18 to less than 65 years of age were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of vaccine containing 51010 viral particles or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride solution) 21 to 35 days apart. Serum samples obtained from 25 participants after the second dose were tested by pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays against the original D614G virus and the B.1.351 variant. The primary end points were safety and efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic coronavirus 2019 illness (Covid-19) more than 14 days after the second dose. RESULTS: Between June 24 and November 9, 2020, we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults (median age, 30 years); 1010 and 1011 participants received at least one dose of placebo or vaccine, respectively. Both the pseudovirus and the live-virus neutralization assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351 variant in serum samples obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from placebo recipients. In the primary end-point analysis, mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 23 of 717 placebo recipients (3.2%) and in 19 of 750 vaccine recipients (2.5%), for an efficacy of 21.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], -49.9 to 59.8).

In this work, we address this gap by creating a life-long learning application that delivers authentic information to users in Hindi, the most widely used local language in India. It does this by matching sources of verified and authentic information such as the WHO reports against daily news by using machine learning and natural language processing. It delivers the narrated content in Hindi by using state-of-the-art text to speech engines. Finally, the approach allows user input for continuous improvement of news feed relevance on a daily basis.

METHODS A retrospective study was carried out on 199 patients (311 eyelids) operated on between January of 2004 and January of 2014. The various causes of eyelid retraction in this population included cosmetic blepharoplasty (56.8 percent), involutional ectropion (23.1 percent), tumor resection (9.5 percent), facial nerve paralysis (8.5 percent), and trauma and related surgery (2 percent). The study was restricted exclusively to cases of moderate and severe lower eyelid retraction addressed by means of midface lifting. The mean follow-up time was 16.8 months. All of the patients were subjected to midface lifting with strengthening of the lateral canthus. A spacer graft was also used in 37.7 percent of the cases. RESULTS One hundred ninety-five patients (97.9 percent) displayed objective improvement of the eyelid retraction and a marked degree of improvement both in aesthetic terms and as regards the functional disorders reported.

Out of 61 patients who initiated the outpatient CR, 29 patients dropped out, leaving us with 32 subjects. The logistic regression analysis results showed that high conscientiousness was associated with non-participation in CR. The primary reason for this was a lack of motivation. Conversely, low conscientiousness and high openness were predictors of dropout.

However, the Polish case demonstrates that in the system with weak checks and balances, postal ballot could be used to consolidate illiberalism not democracy.Research limitations/implicationsThe paper demonstrates that further research on defining consolidated and unconsolidated democracy is needed. In particular there is a need to factor in the research on political culture into the definitions of democratic consolidation.Practical implicationsEU membership for Poland and some other Central European states C such as Hungary C failed to prompt the process of democratic consolidation. In fact the opposite happened as the impact of EU conditionality lost relevance. It is important that any change of electoral law in Poland and other rule of law violators in the region is viewed with great care and scrutiny.Originality/valueThe papers conceptual approach rests on the definition of consolidated democracy as put forward by Przeworski (1991) and developed by Linz and Stepan (1996). According to these definitions, Poland is not yet a consolidated democracy and as argued in the paper, it has actually experienced an expansion of illiberalism in recent years. The paper also posits that the concept of consolidated democracy should be augmented to include the existence of civic political culture as a necessary condition for the maintenance of a healthy democracy.","output":"Postal ballot in unconsolidated democracy: Poland's case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound, negative impact on the lives and wellbeing of much of the population, and it can raise additional challenges for individuals with eating disorders (EDs). During early stages of the UK lockdown, individuals reported disruptions to many aspects of their lives, including reduced feelings of control and serious concerns over the impact of the pandemic on ED symptoms and/or recovery. This study applied a mixed methods online survey to collect responses from 58 individuals (age 16C65yrs) with lived experience of EDs. Data was collected across two time points (April 2020 and June 2020) to explore the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on this population. The results suggest that higher perceptions of general, external control may be associated with ED recovery. Quantitative results show that individuals who reported recovering from their ED since the first time point, also reported significant increases in perceived control (compared to individuals who had relapsed or whose ED status was unchanged). Thematic analysis generated two themes: ED behaviours as an auxiliary control mechanism, and loss of auxiliary control after lockdown. Individuals who experienced less perceived control reported a tendency to rely upon eating disorder behaviours as an auxiliary coping mechanism, i.e., diminished external control was directed inwards and replaced with controlling their own behaviour. The preliminary results suggest that perceived control may be a significant factor in ED recovery. Individuals with EDs may be at significant risk of detrimental impacts on their recovery and wellbeing because of the pandemic reducing peoples' sense of control. These preliminary findings highlight the need for further research in this area, including investigation around potential interventions based upon strengthening perceptions of control to promote ED recovery.","output":"It is the only constant in what feels like a completely upside down and scary world: Living with an eating disorder during COVID-19 and the importance of perceived control for recovery and relapse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to light, plants efficiently induce photosynthesis. Light activation of thiol enzymes by the thioredoxin (Trx) systems and cyclic electron transport by the PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION 5 (PGR5)-dependent pathway contribute substantially to regulation of photosynthesis. Arabidopsis thaliana mutants lacking f-type Trxs (trx f1f2) show delayed activation of carbon assimilation due to impaired photoreduction of Calvin-Benson cycle enzymes. To further study regulatory mechanisms that contribute to efficiency during the induction of photosynthesis, we analyzed the contributions of PSI donor- and acceptor-side regulation in the trx f1f2 mutant background. The cytochrome b6f complex is involved in PSI donor-side regulation, whereas PGR5-dependent PSI cyclic electron transport is required for both donor and acceptor functions. Introduction of the pgr1 mutation, which is conditionally defective in cytochrome b6f complex activity, into the trx f1f2 mutant background did not further affect the induction of photosynthesis, but the combined deficiency of Trx f and PGR5 severely impaired photosynthesis and suppressed plant growth under long-day conditions. In the pgr5 trx f1f2 mutant, the acceptor-side of PSI was almost completely reduced, and quantum yields of PSII and PSI hardly increased during the induction of photosynthesis. We also compared the photoreduction of thiol enzymes between the trx f1f2 and pgr5 trxf1f2 mutants. The pgr5 mutation did not result in further impaired photoreduction of Calvin-Benson cycle enzymes or ATP synthase in the trx f1f2 mutant background. These results indicated that acceptor-side limitations in the pgr5 trx f1f2 mutant suppress photosynthesis initiation, suggesting that PGR5 is required for efficient photosynthesis induction.","output":"Cyclic electron transport around photosystem I contributes to photosynthetic induction with Thioredoxin f"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although recent epidemiological data suggest that pneumococci may contribute to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 disease, cases of coinfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during hospitalization have been reported infrequently. This apparent contradiction may be explained by interactions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and pneumococci in the upper airway, resulting in the escape of SARS-CoV-2 from protective host immune responses. METHODS: Here, we investigated the relationship of these 2 respiratory pathogens in 2 distinct cohorts of health care workers with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection identified by systematic screening and patients with moderate to severe disease who presented to the hospital. We assessed the effect of coinfection on host antibody, cellular, and inflammatory responses to the virus. RESULTS: In both cohorts, pneumococcal colonization was associated with diminished antiviral immune responses, which primarily affected mucosal IgA levels among individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection and cellular memory responses in infected patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that S. pneumoniae impair host immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and raise the question of whether pneumococcal carriage also enables immune escape of other respiratory viruses and facilitates reinfection.

The prevalence of hypercoagulable state in these patients is unknown, but appears to be higher compared to those with other critically ill patients. Elevated D-dimer, large blood vessels clots, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation have been reported in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 either on admission or during hospitalization and may be predictors of poor outcomes. METHODS We performed a comprehensive literature review using the search terms of COVID-19; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, coagulopathy, thrombosis and anticoagulation in PubMed, Ovid, google scholar, Medline and EMBASE databases from December 2019 to May 30, 2020. RESULTS A total of 64 relevant studies were reviewed; of which, 4 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included for analysis. The majority of the studies were retrospective involving 525 critically ill COVID-19 patients. The most commonly studied anticoagulant administered was low molecular weight heparins. Anticoagulation dosing varied throughout the studies and may be classified as standard venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, intermediate dosing, or full dose anticoagulation. The most studied objective was improvement in coagulopathy. Significant reduction in D-dimer, improvement in coagulopathy markers such as Interlukin-6, fibrinogen degradation product level, as well as lymphocyte count were reported. CONCLUSION Despite the limited quality of studies analyzed, prophylaxis and higher intensity dosed anticoagulation is associated with improved pulmonary oxygenation, decreased coagulopathy markers and decreased mortality in COVID-19 patients.","output":"The Impact of Anticoagulation on COVID-19 (SARS CoV-2) Patient Outcomes: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the COVID-19 pandemic to the global protests in response to anti-Black racism, police brutality, and the gruesome police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, among countless others, the times we live in call us to, perhaps more than we have done in recent decades, reflect on our collective humanity And we believe that a critical part of this process of reflection requires us to engage in honest dialogues about the equity and access issues that threaten our shared humanity, as a community of scholars and professionals, across differences The Underrepresented Racial, Ethnic, and Ability Groups (UREAG), a standing committee of the Comparative and International and Education Society (CIES), brings together diverse scholars and professionals from all over the world through its various programmatic platforms during the CIES annual conference to engage in intentional and frank conversations about systemic and institutional equity and access issues that affect minoritized populations","output":"Bridging Divides: Fostering Safe Spaces for Dialogue at vCIES and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is facing the challenge of the COVID-19 disease, which is now stated as a pandemic. Inside the host cell, spike envelope protein (spike) of SARS-CoV-2 interact with the Angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. It can be inhibited by bioactive compounds such as flavonoids which have anti-viral and broad pharmacological effect. This study aimed to determine the spike protein inhibitory activity by quercetin against the ACE2 receptor using the molecular docking method. This study focused on the inhibitory of the penetration activity of s proteins in ACE2 by utilizing natural material compounds that have the potential to be used as anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development agents. The flavonoid compound quercetin was extracted by the maceration method. The quantitative analysis was carried out using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer to prove the presence of quercetin content. Molecular docking simulations were carried out to look for the binding affinity between the spike protein and quercetin. Docking was carried out using the Autodock, PyRx, and visualization using Discovery Studio. Indicators that prove that quercetin forms binding affinity and protein complexes with spikes are the Vina Score and RMSD. It is also supported by ADME analysis and conformity to Lipinski's rules of five. That matter becomes a success indicator of the spike activity inhibition by quercetin, which makes it possible to be used as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development agent. The novelty from this study is molecular docking method that used to show that quercetin in red onion had inhibitory activity on the penetration process of protein spike in SARS-CoV-2. Results obtained from this study can be used as a recommendation for advanced research in invitro and invivo studies as a drug which has potential to inhibit protein spike of SARSCoV-2.
