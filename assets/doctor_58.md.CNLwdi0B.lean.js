Understanding local determinants of treatment-seeking behaviors can help tailor RHD prevention programs. OBJECTIVE: We sought to elicit perceptions of pharyngitis and related healthcare use in a range of communities in Uganda. METHODS: We conducted six focus group discussions (FGD) in three districts that were representative of the countrys socioeconomic and cultural heterogenetity. Participants were recruited from six villages (two per district), and FGDs were audio recorded, transcribed and translated into English. Deductive and inductive analysis of the transcripts was done via open axial and sequential coding, which informed development of clusters, themes and subthemes. We extracted quotations from the transcripts to illustrate these themes. RESULTS: We identified nine key themes in three major domains: knowledge and perception of pharyngits, treatment practices, and barriers to uptake of formal public-sector healthcare services. Community awareness and understanding of the consequences of pharyngitis were low. Stated barriers to care were usually systemic in nature and included low overall confidence in the healthcare system and substantial costs associated with transportation and medications. CONCLUSION: The FGDs identified several approaches to shape community perceptions of pharyngitis and improve utilization of interventions to prevent RHD.

Because of the non-specific nature of the signs and symptoms, the diagnosis of pneumonia rests disproportionately on the presence of an infiltrate on chest radiograph. The frequent lack of a microbiologic diagnosis and the non-specificity of signs, symptoms, and radiographic infiltrates leads to frequent consideration of pneumonia in the differential diagnosis of many other pulmonary diseases. The etiologic spectrum of all types of pneumonia always includes the common community-acquired pathogens, with the spectrum broadening in response to either increasing immunocompromise or greater exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. While new or previously unrecognized pathogens can play a role in management decisions, the major issue in pneumonia is the appearance of antibiotic resistant strains of known common bacterial pathogens.

End-point selection of the most potential B-cell epitope was based on highly essential physicochemical attributes. NetCTL-I and NetMHC-II algorithms were used to predict probable MHC-I and II T-cell epitopes for globally frequent HLA-A*O2:01, HLA-B*35:01, HLA-B*51:01 and HLA-DRB1*15:02 molecules.

One of its objectives is to improve surveillance systems, early detection and notification of wildlife diseases. Members share information on disease occurrence by reporting through the OIE World Animal Health Information System (OIE-WAHIS-formerly known as 'WAHIS'). To evaluate the capacity of a surveillance system to detect disease events, it is important to quantify the gap between all known events and those officially notified to the OIE. This study used capture-recapture analysis to estimate the sensitivity of the OIE-WAHIS system for a OIE-listed wildlife disease by comparing information from publicly available sources to identify undetected events. This article presents a case study of the occurrence of tularemia in lagomorphs among selected North American and European countries during the period 2014-2019. First, an analysis using three data sources (OIE-WAHIS, ProMED, WHO-EIOS [Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources]) was conducted. Subsequent analysis then explored the model integrating information from a fourth source (scientific literature collected in PubMed). Two models were built to evaluate both the sensitivity of the OIE-WAHIS using media reports (ProMED and WHO-EIOS), which is likely to represent current closer to real-time events, and published scientific data, which is more useful for retrospective analysis. Using the three-source approach, the predicted number of tularemia events was 93 (95% CI: 75-114), with an OIE-WAHIS sensitivity of 90%. In the four-source approach, the number of predicted events increased to 120 (95% CI: 99-143), dropping the sensitivity of the OIE-WAHIS to 70%. The results indicate a good sensitivity of the OIE-WAHIS system using the three-source approach, but lower sensitivity when including information from the scientific literature. Further analysis should be undertaken to identify diseases and regions for which international reporting presents a low sensitivity. This will enable evaluation and prioritization of underreported OIE-listed wildlife diseases and identify areas of focus as part of the Wildlife Health Framework.

However, it remains unknown whether this association represents an independent risk for poor outcome. We aimed to estimate the attributable effect of CMV reactivation on mortality in immunocompetent ARDS patients. METHODS: We prospectively studied immunocompetent ARDS patients who tested seropositive for CMV and remained mechanically ventilated beyond day 4 in two tertiary intensive care units in the Netherlands from 2011 to 2013. CMV loads were determined in plasma weekly. Competing risks Cox regression was used with CMV reactivation status as a time-dependent exposure variable. Subsequently, in sensitivity analyses we adjusted for the evolution of disease severity until onset of reactivation using marginal structural modeling. RESULTS: Of 399 ARDS patients, 271 (68 %) were CMV seropositive and reactivation occurred in 74 (27 %) of them. After adjustment for confounding and competing risks, CMV reactivation was associated with overall increased ICU mortality (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 2.74, 95 % CI 1.51C4.97), which resulted from the joint action of trends toward an increased mortality rate (direct effect; cause specific hazard ratio (HR) 1.58, 95 % CI 0.86C2.90) and a reduced successful weaning rate (indirect effect; cause specific HR 0.83, 95 % CI 0.58C1.18).

There is growing recognition of the need for public health departments to prioritize a communitywide mental health response strategy to facilitate access to behavioral health services and reduce potential psychological impacts. Due to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) extensive experience providing trauma-informed behavioral healthcare to its Veterans, and the fact that VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) are located throughout the United States, the VA is well situated to be a key partner in local communities response plans. In this study we examined the role the VA can play in a communitys behavioral health response using case studies from three disasters. METHODS: This study investigated experiences of VA employees in critical emergency response positions (N = 17) in communities where disasters occurred between 2017 and 2019. All respondents were interviewed MarchCJuly 2019. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews exploring participants experiences and knowledge about VA activities provided to communities following the regional disasters. Data were analyzed using thematic and grounded theory coding methods. RESULTS: Respondents underscored VAs primary mission after a disaster was to maintain continuity of care to Veterans. The majority also described the VA supporting community recovery. Specifically, three recent events provided key examples of VAs involvement in disaster behavioral health response. Each event showed VAs integration into local response structures was facilitated by pre-existing emergency management and clinical relationships as well as prioritization from VA leadership to engage in humanitarian missions. The behavioral health interventions were provided by behavioral health teams integrated into disaster assistance centers and non-VA hospitals, VA mobile units deployed into the community, and VA telehealth services. CONCLUSIONS: Recent disasters have revealed that coordinated efforts between multidisciplinary agencies can strengthen communities capacity to respond to mental health needs, thereby fostering resilience. Building relationships with local VAMCs can help expedite how VA can be incorporated into emergency management strategies. In considering the strengths community partners can bring to bear, a coordinated disaster mental health response would benefit from involving VA as a partner during planning.

Lack of specialized treatments for the disease demands preventive measures based on statistical/mathematical models. The analysis of epidemiological curve fitting, on number of daily infections across affected countries, provides useful insights on the characteristics of the epidemic. A variety of phenomenological models are available to capture the dynamics of disease spread and growth. The number of daily new infections and cumulative number of infections in COVID-19 over four selected countries, namely, Sri Lanka, Italy, the United States, and Hebei province of China, from the first day of appearance of cases to 2nd July 2020 were used in the study. Gompertz, logistic, Weibull, and exponential growth curves were fitted on the cumulative number of infections across countries. AIC, BIC, RMSE, and R 2 were used to determine the best fitting curve for each country. Results revealed that the most appropriate growth curves for Sri Lanka, Italy, the United States, and China (Hebei) are the logistic, Gompertz, Weibull, and Gompertz curves, respectively. Country-wise, overall growth rate, final epidemic size, and short-term forecasts were evaluated using the selected model. Daily log incidences in each country were regressed before and after the identified peak time of the respective outbreak of epidemic. Hence, doubling time/halving time together with daily growth rates and predictions was estimated. Findings and relevant interpretations demonstrate that the outbreak seems to be extinct in Hebei, China, whereas further transmissions are possible in the United States.

One of the principal factors that control the outcome of infection is the localized tissue response and subsequent immune response directed against the invading toxic agent. It is the role of the immune system to contain and control the spread of virus infection in the central nervous system (CNS), and paradoxically, this response may also be pathologic. Chemokines are potent proinflammatory molecules whose expression within virally infected tissues is often associated with protection and/or pathology which correlates with migration and accumulation of immune cells. Indeed, studies with a neurotropic murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), have provided important insight into the functional roles of chemokines and chemokine receptors in participating in various aspects of host defense as well as disease development within the CNS.

The SLC11A1 (or NRAMP1) gene has been studied extensively for genetic association with TB, but with inconsistent findings. In addition, no study has yet looked into the effect of sex and age on the relationship between SLC11A1 polymorphisms and TB. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted. In total, 278 pulmonary TB patients and 282 sex- and age-matched controls without TB were recruited. All subjects were ethnic Chinese. On the basis of linkage disequilibrium pattern, three genetic markers from SLC11A1 and one from the nearby IL8RB locus were selected and examined for association with TB susceptibility. These markers were genotyped using single strand conformation polymorphism analysis or fragment analysis of amplified products. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in allele (P = 0.0165, OR = 1.51) and genotype (P = 0.0163, OR = 1.59) frequencies of the linked markers SLC6a/b (classically called D543N and 3'UTR) of the SLC11A1 locus were found between patients and controls. With stratification by sex, positive associations were identified in the female group for both allele (P = 0.0049, OR = 2.54) and genotype (P = 0.0075, OR = 2.74) frequencies. With stratification by age, positive associations were demonstrated in the young age group (age 65 years) for both allele (P = 0.0047, OR = 2.52) and genotype (P = 0.0031, OR = 2.92) frequencies.

Since comprehensive diagnostics are a prerequisite for each surgery, we built upon the knowledge gained in telesurgery and developed a telediagnostic system that allows for an extensive perioperative and emergency examination. It is based on a robotic platform consisting of a remote lead robotic arm at the physician's site and a follower robot at the patient's site.

METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 2068 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between January 29 and April 1, 2020 at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. We defined cardiac injury as an increase in high sensitivity cardiac troponin-I (hs-cTnI) above the 99th of the upper reference limit. We explored the dynamics of elevation in hs-cTnI and the relationship with inflammation (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-2 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-, C-reactive protein) and coagulation (d-dimer, fibrinogen, international normalized ratio) markers in non-critically ill versus critically ill patients longitudinally and further correlated these markers to survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS: Median age was 63 years (first to third quartile 51C70 years), 51.4% of whom were women. When compared to non-critically ill patients (N = 1592, 77.0%), critically ill (defined as requiring mechanical ventilation, in shock or multiorgan failure) patients (N = 476, 23.0%), had more frequent cardiac injury on admission (30.3% vs. 2.3%, p < 0.001), with increased mortality during hospitalization (38.4% vs. 0%, p < 0.001). Among critically ill patients, non-survivors (N = 183) had a continuous increase in hs-cTnI levels during hospitalization, while survivors (N = 293) showed a decrease in hs-cTnI level between day 4 and 7 after admission. Specifically, cardiac injury is an independent marker of mortality among critically ill patients at admission, day 4C7 and 8C14. Consistent positive correlations between hs-cTnI and interleukin (IL)-6 on admission (r = 0.59), day 4C7 (r = 0.66) and day 8C14 (r = 0.61; all p < 0.001) and d-dimer (at the same timepoints r = 0.54; 0.65; 0.61, all p < 0.001) were observed. A similar behavior was observed between hs-cTnI and most of other biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac injury commonly occurs in critically ill COVID-19 patients, with increased levels of hs-cTnI beyond day 3 since admission portending a poor prognosis. A consistent positive correlation of hs-cTnI with IL-6 and d-dimer at several timepoints along hospitalization could suggest nonspecific cytokine-mediated cardiotoxicity.","output":"Longitudinal correlation of biomarkers of cardiac injury, inflammation, and coagulation to outcome in hospitalized COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emerging information and communication technologies (ICT) related to Industry 4.0 play a critical role to enhance supply chain performance. Employing the smart technologies has led to so-called smart supply chains. Understanding how Industry 4.0 and related ICT affect smart supply chains and how smart supply chains evolve with the support of the advanced technologies are vital to practical and academic communities. Existing review works on smart supply chains with ICT mainly rely on the academic literature alone. This paper presents an integrated approach to explore the effects of Industry 4.0 and related ICT on smart supply chains, by combining introduction of the current national strategies in North America, the research status analysis on ICT assisted supply chains from the major North American national research councils, and a systematic literature review of the subject. Besides, we introduce a smart supply chain hierarchical framework with multi-level intelligence.

In the post-lockdown period, the mean number of contacts increased by 5 to 17% as compared to the lockdown period.

METHODS: A survey was distributed to urologists and to radiologists comparing double-J stent (DJS), percutaneous nephrostomy (PN) and primary ureteroscopy (URS) for three clinical scenarios (1-febrile hydronephrosis; 2-obstruction and persistent pain; 3-obstruction and anuria) before and after reading literature The survey included perception on radiation dose, cost and quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: Response rate was 40% (366/915). 93% of radiologists believe that DJS offers a better QOL compared to 70.6% of urologists (p = 0.006). 28.4% of urologists consider PN to be more expensive compared to 8.9% of radiologists (p = 0.006). 75% of radiologists believe that radiation exposure is higher with DJS as opposed to 33.9% of urologists. There was not a difference in the decompression preference in the first scenario. After reading the literature, 28.6% of radiologists changed their opinion compared to 5.2% of urologists (p < 0.001). The change favored DJS. In the second scenario, responders preferred equally DJS and they did not change their opinion. In the third scenario, 41% of radiologists chose PN as opposed to 12.6% of urologists (p < 0.001). After reading the literature, 17.9% of radiologists changed their opinion compared to 17.9% of urologists (p < 0.001), in favor of DJS.

In 2015, it was the 10th leading cause of death in the US. The number of suicides increased by 30% in the US from 1999 to 2016, and a greater uptick in suicides is predicted to occur as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, for which the primary public-health strategy is physical distancing and during which alcohol sales have soared. Thus, current strategies for identifying at-risk individuals and preventing suicides, such as relying on self-reported suicidal ideation, are insufficient, especially under conditions of physical distancing, which exacerbate isolation, loneliness, economic stress, and possibly alcohol consumption. New strategies are urgent now and into the future. To that aim, here, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (an instrumental variables technique using public genome-wide association study data as data sources) was performed to determine whether alcohol-associated changes in DNA methylation mediate risk for suicidal behavior. The results suggest that higher alcohol-associated DNA methylation levels at cg18120259 confer a weak causal effect. Replication and triangulation of the results, both experimentally and with designs other than Mendelian randomization, are needed. If the findings replicate, the information might be utilized to raise awareness about the biological links between alcohol and suicide and possibly explored as a biomarker of risk, perhaps especially for early detection of those who may not self-report suicidal intent.

Proctological patients and surgeons are experiencing a previously unseen change in care with unknown repercussion. Here we discuss the proctological experience of 4 Italian hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Following remote brainstorming, the authors summarised their experience in managing proctological patients during the COVID-19 pandemics and put forward some practical observations to further investigate. RESULTS: The 4 hospitals shifted from a high-volume proctological activity to almost \\"zero\\" visits and surgery. Every patient accessing the hospital must respect a specific COVID-19 protocol. Proctological patients can be stratified based on presentation and management considerations into (1) neoplastic patients, the only allowed to be surgically treated, (2) the ones requiring urgent care, operated only in highly selected cases and (3) the stable, already known patients, managed remotely. Changes in the clinical management of the proctological disease are presented together with some considerations to be explored. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of scientific evidence, these practical considerations may be valuable to proctological surgeons starting to face the COVID-19 pandemics. Beside the more clinical considerations, this crisis produced unexpected consequences such as an improvement of the therapeutic alliance and a shift towards telemedicine that may be worth exploring also in the post-COVID-19 era.","output":"From high volume to \\"zero\\" proctology: Italian experience in the COVID era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"En los ltimos a?os llegan a mi consulta ni?as y ni?os entre los dos y los nueve a?os de edad diagnosticados tempranamente con TEA Dicho diagnstico es realizado, por otros profesionales, que desde la observacin fenomenolgica ubican en el ni?o alguna de las caractersticas presente en el cuadro clnico de autismo A partir de tres vi?etas clnicas con padres (de modalidades psquicas e historias diferentes), reflexionar qu les sucedi en el desencuentro con su beb y de qu manera la enunciacin de determinado tipo de diagnstico imposibilit que ese desencuentro inicial se transforme en un encuentro conjunto madre-hijo y padre-hijo Cuando ocurre la posibilidad de este encuentro entre los padres y su hijo, el mismo se constituye en el punto de partida de un desarrollo ms pleno de la subjetividad del ni?o(AU) Ces dernires annes, ils sont arrivs a mon cabinet des filles et fils entre les deux et les neuf ans qui portent le diagnostic TSA Ce diagnostic a t fait par des professionels qui, du point de vue de l&#039;observation phenomenologique, ont trouve dans l&#039;enfant quelque charactristiques du cadre autiste A partir de trois vignettes cliniques (les parents ont de modalits psichiques et d&#039;histoires differnts) je reflchirai sur la divergence entre eux et leur bb et comment l&#039;nunciation de ce diagnostic empche la transformation de cette divergence initial dans une rencontre conjoint mer -fils et per-fils Quand cette rencontre entre les parents et leur fils est possible, elle se transforme en partie constituante d&#039;une dveloppement plus pleine de la subjectivit del&#039;enfant(AU) In recent years I came across consultations of children between two and nine years old who had been previously diagnosed with ASD at an early age Such diagnose was made by other professionals who, from a phenomenological analysis, place the patient under some features of the clinical picture of autism Taking into account three clinical vignettes with parents of diverse psychic modalities and stories, I will reflect over the past events that lead to a missed encounter with their babies and in which way the annunciation of a determined diagnose precludes the possibility of that missed encounter to transform into a joint meeting parent-child When an encounter parent-child occurs, it represents the starting point of a fulfilled development of the child&#039;s subjectivity(AU) Nos ltimos anos, meninos e meninas com idades entre dois e nove anos diagnosticados com TEA chegam cedo ao meu consultrio Esse diagnstico  feito por outros profissionais que, a partir da observao fenomenolgica, localizam na crian?a algumas das caractersticas presentes no quadro clnico do autismo A partir de trs vinhetas clnicas com pais (de modalidades psquicas e histrias diferentes), refletirei sobre o que aconteceu com eles no desencontro com seu beb e como a enunciao de um certo tipo de diagnstico torna impossvel que esse desencontro inicial se torne um encontro conjunto m?e-filho e pai e filho Quando a possibilidade desse encontro entre os pais e o filho ocorre, torna-se o ponto de partida para um desenvolvimento pleno da subjetividade da crian?a(AU)","output":"El diagnstico de trastorno del espectro autista (TEA) a temprana edad del ni?o y sus consecuencias en el encuentro-desencuentro entre los padres y su hijo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The vibration frequency is one of the key factors that contains vital information about the subjects/machines and offers major analytical support. The contactless measurement of vibration frequency is the crucial requirement of many industrial, scientific, and biomedical applications like predictive maintenance, non-destructive testing, and reverse engineering, chest vibration, etc. The paper presents a self-mixed optical feedback interferometry (SM-OFI) sensor to measure the vibration frequency of the micro-harmonic vibrating surface. The method employs a Dynamic Time Warping algorithm (DTW) to compute the Euclidian distance between the locally generated reference signal and the SM interferometric signal obtained from a vibrating target. The method is tested experimentally on a customized SM-OFI emitting a wavelength of 650 nm under weak feedback conditions. The proposed method was able to measure the unknown frequency with 98% accuracy in all sets of experiments. The method also exhibits an R-squared value of 0.99 with a relative error of less than unity. The comprehensive analysis of the experimental results concludes that the proposed method provides an accurate and precise vibration frequency measurement scheme for the low bandwidth range. This low bandwidth range measurement promises a non-contact measurement in industries and biomedical applications during the COVID-19 scenario.","output":"Measurement of micro-harmonic vibration frequency from the modulated self-mixed interferometric signal using dynamic time warping method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Collaterals at angiography before endovascular therapy were analyzed to ascertain the effect on a novel end point of successful revascularization without symptomatic hemorrhage in the Solitaire FR With the Intention for Thrombectomy (SWIFT) study. METHODS Collateral grade (American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology/Society of Interventional Radiology) on baseline angiography was independently assessed, blind to other data, with statistical analyses delineating the relationship with clinical, laboratory, and imaging parameters. RESULTS Angiographic data on collaterals were available in 119 of 144 subjects (mean age, 6712 years; 52% woman; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 18 [range, 8-28]). Worse collaterals were noted in subjects with elevated baseline blood glucose (P=0.013) and those with elevated baseline systolic blood pressure (P=0.039). Multivariate predictors of partial or worse collaterals included absence of prior hypertension (odds ratio, 4.049, P=0.012), smoking history (odds ratio, 3.822; P=0.013), and higher blood glucose (odds ratio, 1.017; P=0.022). Collaterals were strongly related to Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) at baseline (0-1: median 8 [3-10]; 2-9 [5-10]; 3-9 [7-10]; 4-9 [8-10]; P<0.001) and 24 hours (0-1: median 1 [0-5]; 2-6 [0-10]; 3-8 [0-10]; 4-8 [4-8]; P<0.001). Better collaterals were linked with Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b/3 reperfusion (P=0.019), better median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at day 7/discharge (P<0.001), and better day 90 modified Rankin Scale (P<0.001).

If pathogen transmission within the human population is self-sustaining, or rapidly evolves to be self sustaining, novel human pathogens can emerge. Although many factors influence the likelihood of spillover and emergence, the rate of contact between humans and wildlife is critical. Thus, for those pathogens inhabiting wildlife reservoirs with pronounced seasonal fluctuations in population density, it is broadly recognized that spillover risk also varies with season. What remains unknown, however, is the extent to which seasonal fluctuations in reservoir populations influence the evolutionary dynamics of pathogens in ways that affect the likelihood of emergence. Here, we use mathematical models and stochastic simulations to show that seasonal fluctuations in reservoir population densities lead to seasonal increases in genetic variation within pathogen populations and thus influence the waiting time for mutations capable of sustained human-to-human transmission. These seasonal increases in genetic variation also lead to elevated risk of emergence at predictable times of year.","output":"Reservoir population dynamics and pathogen epidemiology drive pathogen genetic diversity, spillover, and emergence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An on-site detection strategy is reported based on dual-color SiO2@quantum dot (QD)-integrated lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) strip to realize the quantitative and simultaneous detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) in serum.

In this context, reliable and interpretable forecasts of disease incidents are a vital tool for policymakers to manage healthcare resources. Several experts have called for the necessity to account for human mobility to explain the spread of COVID-19. Existing approaches are often applying standard models of the respective research field. This habit, however, often comes along with certain restrictions. For instance, most statistical or epidemiological models cannot directly incorporate unstructured data sources, including relational data that may encode human mobility. In contrast, machine learning approaches may yield better predictions by exploiting these data structures, yet lack intuitive interpretability as they are often categorized as black-box models. We propose a trade-off between both research directions and present a multimodal learning approach that combines the advantages of statistical regression and machine learning models for predicting local COVID-19 cases in Germany.

In this article, we describe the study protocol and baseline characteristics of the cohort. METHODS IBSEN III is an ongoing, population-based observational inception cohort study with prospective follow-up. Adult and pediatric patients with suspected IBD in the South-Eastern Health Region of Norway (catchment area of 2.95 million inhabitants in 2017), during the 3-year period from 2017 to 2019, were eligible for inclusion. Comprehensive clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, demographic, and patient-reported data were collected at the time of diagnosis and throughout standardized follow-up. For a portion of the patients, extensive biological material was biobanked. RESULTS The study included 2168 patients, of whom 1779 were diagnosed with IBD (Crohn's disease: 626, ulcerative colitis: 1082, IBD unclassified: 71). In 124 patients, there were subtle findings indicative of, but not diagnostic for, IBD. The remaining 265 patients were classified as symptomatic non-IBD controls. CONCLUSION We have included patients in a comprehensive population-based IBD cohort from a catchment population of 2.95 million, and a unique biobank with materials from newly diagnosed and treatment-na?ve IBD patients and symptomatic non-IBD controls.

The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. It is important to ensure early detection of the virus to curb disease progression to severe COVID-19. This study aims to establish a clinical-nomogram model to predict the progression to severe COVID-19 in a timely and efficient manner. METHODS: This retrospective study included 202 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and Shiyan Taihe Hospital from January 17 to April 30, 2020. The patients were randomly assigned to the training dataset (n = 163, with 43 progressing to severe COVID-19) or the validation dataset (n = 39, with 10 progressing to severe COVID-19) at a ratio of 8:2. The optimal subset algorithm was applied to filter for the clinical factors most relevant to the disease progression. Based on these factors, the logistic regression model was fit to distinguish severe (including severe and critical cases) from non-severe (including mild and moderate cases) COVID-19. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated using the R software package to evaluate prediction performance. A clinical nomogram was established and performance assessed using the discrimination curve. RESULTS: Risk factors, including demographic data, symptoms, laboratory and image findings, were recorded for the 202 patients. Eight of the 53 variables that were entered into the selection process were selected via the best subset algorithm to establish the predictive model; they included gender, age, BMI, CRP, D-dimer, TP, ALB, and involved-lobe. AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.91, 0.84 and 0.86 for the training dataset, and 0.87, 0.66, and 0.80 for the validation dataset. CONCLUSION: We established an efficient and reliable clinical nomogram model which showed that gender, age, and initial indexes including BMI, CRP, D-dimer, involved-lobe, TP, and ALB could predict the risk of progression to severe COVID-19.","output":"Establishment of a Clinical Nomogram Model to Predict the Progression of COVID-19 to Severe Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":":To establish and verify a risk prediction nomogram for ipsilateral axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer stage T1 mass &#8804; 2 cm. :The clinicopathological data of 907 patients with T1 breast cancer who underwent surgical treatment from January 2010 to June 2015 were collectedincluding 573 cases from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine modeling group and 334 cases from Zhejiang University Lishui Hospital verification group.

Thus, as more clinical microbiology laboratories advance towards the use of DNA sequence-based diagnostics, it is imperative that their predictive functions extend beyond the well-known resistance mutations, in order to also encompass as many of the lower-frequency mutations as possible. However, in most cases, the fundamental experimental proof that links these uncommon mutations with phenotypic resistance is lacking. One such example is the g878a polymorphism within the rrs 16s rRNA gene. We, and others, have identified this mutation within a small number of drug-resistant isolates, although a consensus regarding exactly which aminoglycoside antibiotic(s) it confers resistance toward has not previously been reached. Here we have employed oligo-mediated recombineering to introduce the g878a polymorphism into the rrs gene of M. bovis BCG - a close relative of M. tuberculosis - and demonstrate that it confers low-level resistance to streptomycin alone. It does not confer cross-resistance towards amikacin, capreomycin, nor kanamycin. We also demonstrate that the rrsg878a mutation exerts a substantial fitness defect in vitro, that may at least in part explain why clinical isolates bearing this mutation appear to be quite rare. Overall, this study provides clarity to the phenotype attributable to the rrsg878a mutation and is relevant to the future implementation of genomics-based diagnostics, as well as the clinical management of patients where this particular polymorphism is encountered.","output":"Experimental confirmation that an uncommon rrs gene mutation (g878a) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis confers resistance to streptomycin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 greatly challenges human beings in the health sector and leaves behind a large amount of medical waste that poses many potential threats to the environment. In this paper, we compiled relevant data released by official agencies and the media, and conducted data supplementation based on previous studies to calculate the net value of medical waste production in Hubei Province during COVID-19 with the help of a neural network model. Then, we reviewed the data related to the environmental impact of medical waste per unit and designed four scenarios to estimate the environmental impact of new medical waste generated during the epidemic.

In the four scenario assumptions, if the medical waste brought by COVID-19 is completely incinerated, it will have a large impact on the air quality. If it is disposed by distillation sterilization, it will produce a large amount of wastewater and waste residue. Based on the results of the study, three policy recommendations are proposed in this paper: strict control of medical wastewater discharge, reduction and transformation of the emitted acidic gases, and attention to the emission of metallic nickel in exhaust gas and chloride in soil.

This caused prolonged stay on board or at home for seafarers, who should be recognized as 'key' workers regarding their essential role in maintaining the flow of vital goods. OBJECTIVE: Using a general inductive approach, this qualitative study aims to describe how the COVID-19 pandemic reflects on seafarers' well-being. The study focused on obtaining personal experiences from seafarers on board, and seafarers at home, relating to the current world pandemic. METHODS: A convenience sample consisting of 752 seafarers from the international seafarers' population participated in an online study in spring 2020. The questionnaire used included questions relating to basic sociodemographic and work characteristics, and one open question which addressed seafarers' personal experiences. The data obtained was analysed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: The emerged themes included mental, physical, social and economic well-being. Most of the answers of seafarers located on board related to threatened mental, physical and social well-being, while seafarers at home reported mostly on threats to their economic well-being. CONCLUSION: Seafarers' well-being is seriously threatened by preventive measures relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results are discussed in relation to earlier findings in the area of occupational stress in seafaring. Overall, the data obtained portrays existing underlying occupational structures in the seafaring sector, which are rendered more visible due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The diagnostic device includes semiconductor sensors capable of measuring the concentrations of gas components in exhaled air, with the high sensitivity of 1 ppm. The neural network uses signals from these sensors to perform classification and identify cancer patients. Prior to the diagnostic procedure of the non-invasive method, we clarified the extent and stage of the tumor according to current international standards and recommendations for the diagnosis of malignancies. The statistical dataset for neural network training and method validation included samples from 121 patients with the most common tumor localizations (lungs, oropharyngeal region and larynx). The largest number of cases (21 patients) were lung cancer, while the number of patients with oropharyngeal or laryngeal cancer varied from 1 to 9, depending on tumor localization (oropharyngeal, tongue, oral cavity, larynx and mucosa of the lower jaw).

This included patients hospitalised with pneumonia and investigated for suspected PE with computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). Cases were defined as patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from 1 March 2020 to 17 May 2020; controls were patients with CAP from 5 July 2019 to 31 January 2020. The primary outcome was to determine the risk of developing PE in both groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio for PE. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-four patients were included; 72 cases (47% male; mean age 59 (15) years), and 72 controls (56% male; mean age 58 (20) years). PE was diagnosed in 23.6% of the cases versus 6.9% of the controls.

We identified latent class trajectories of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), ADL, and Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) performance using Latent Growth Class Analysis (LGCA) on data collected every 2 years over 5 waves. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the likelihood of membership to each trajectory class by negative aging perceptions (APQ). Finally, we tested possible behavioral, psychological, and social mechanisms. RESULTS LCGA identified three trajectory classes in cognitive and two in each physical function measure. People with the highest tertile of negative APQ were more likely to be in the declining MMSE class and the increasing IADL, ADL, and TUG classes. These associations for cognitive function were partially mediated by psychosocial pathways and for physical function were fully mediated by both psychosocial and health behavior pathways. CONCLUSIONS Negative aging perceptions were associated with cognitive and physical function declines. Poor self-rated health, depressive symptoms, loneliness, and low exercise seem to explain the relationships; however, the possibility of reverse causation remains.","output":"Negative aging perceptions and cognitive and functional decline: Are you as old as you feel?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fournier's gangrene and emphysematous pyelonephritis are rare necrotizing infections of the genitourinary system. Many cases of this rapidly progressive infection occur from abscesses and urinary tract infections; however, Fournier's gangrene secondary to emphysematous pyelonephritis is seldom discussed in the literature. Emphysematous pyelonephritis is defined as a gas-forming, necrotizing infection of the renal parenchyma or its surrounding tissue. Emphysematous pyelonephritis has been observed in high-risk individuals, including those with poor glycemic control and urinary tract obstruction. We present a 61-year-old male with emphysematous pyelonephritis arising from a perinephric hematoma with tracking of the infection to the scrotum, resulting in Fournier's gangrene. The perinephric hematoma most likely developed from increased intrarenal hydrostatic pressure during nephroureteral stent placement. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and surgical debridement of the retroperitoneum, groin, and scrotum were performed ultimately requiring left orchiectomy. We conclude that an existing hematoma can precipitate emphysematous pyelonephritis with tracking from the retroperitoneum to scrotum, causing Fournier's gangrene.

In the aquaculture industry, outbreaks of betanodavirus infection and spread in larval and juvenile fish result in devastating damage and heavy economic loss. Although an urgent need exists to develop drugs that inhibit betanodavirus infection, there have been no reports about anti-betanodavirus drugs. Recently, it was reported that betanodaviruses were detected in the endosomes of infected cells, suggesting that betanodaviruses enter fish cells by endocytosis. This finding prompted us to examine whether blocking this endosomal pathway could provide a target for antiviral drug development. In this study, we examined the inhibitory effect of several lysosomotropic agents against betanodavirus infection in fish E-11 cells. The presence of 1 mM NH(4)Cl or 1 M chloroquine in the medium inhibited the entry of betanodaviruses into cells and inhibited viral infection. The lysosomotropic agents bafilomycin A1 and monensin also inhibited virus-induced cytopathology and virus production. Our data demonstrate that inhibitors of endosomal acidification are candidates as antiviral agents against betanodavirus.","output":"Inhibition of betanodavirus infection by inhibitors of endosomal acidification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui penerapan social distancing pada masyarakat Kampung Bebon Jaya, Distrik Bonggo, Kabupaten Sarmi terhadap peraturan jaga jarak sosial yang telah ditetapkan oleh pemerintah selama masa COVID-19 maka artikel ini juga memaparkan pelaksanaan social distancing di Kampung Bebon Jaya, Distrik Bonggo Kabupaten Sarmi, Provinsi Papua.

METHODS: The data of daily HFMD incidence in Ningbo from January 2014 to November 2017 were set as the training set, and the data of December 2017 were set as the test set. ARIMA and LSTM models combined and uncombined with exogenous meteorological variables were adopted to fit the daily incidence of HFMD by using the data of the training set. The forecasting performances of the four fitted models were verified by using the data of the test set. Root mean square error (RMSE) was selected as the main measure to evaluate the performance of the models. RESULTS: The RMSE for multivariate LSTM, univariate LSTM, ARIMA and ARIMAX (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model with Exogenous Input Variables) was 10.78, 11.20, 12.43 and 14.73, respectively. The LSTM model with exogenous meteorological variables has the best performance among the four models and meteorological variables can increase the prediction accuracy of LSTM model. For the ARIMA model, exogenous meteorological variables did not increase the prediction accuracy but became the interference factor of the model. CONCLUSIONS: Multivariate LSTM is the best among the four models to fit the daily incidence of HFMD in Ningbo. It can provide a scientific method to build the HFMD early warning system and the methodology can also be applied to other communicable diseases.","output":"Comparison of ARIMA and LSTM in Forecasting the Incidence of HFMD Combined and Uncombined with Exogenous Meteorological Variables in Ningbo, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Hospital patients who use drugs may require prolonged parenteral antimicrobial therapy administered through a vascular access device (VAD). Clinicians' concerns that patients may inject drugs into these devices are well documented. However, the perspectives of patients on VAD injecting are not well described, hindering the development of informed clinical guidance. This study was conducted to elicit inpatient perspectives on the practice of injecting drugs into VADs and to propose strategies to reduce associated harms. METHODS Researchers conducted a focused ethnography and completed semi-structured interviews with 25 inpatients at a large tertiary hospital in Western Canada that experiences a high rate of drug-related presentations annually. RESULTS A few participants reported injecting into their VAD at least once, and nearly all had heard of the practice. The primary reason for injecting into a VAD was easier venous access since many participants had experienced significant vein damage from injection drug use. Several participants recognized the risks associated with injecting into VADs, and either refrained from the practice or took steps to maintain their devices while using them to inject drugs. Others were uncertain how the devices functioned and were unaware of potential harms. CONCLUSIONS VADs are important for facilitating completion of parenteral antimicrobial therapy and for other medically necessary care. Prematurely discharging patients who inject into their VAD from hospital, or discontinuing or modifying therapy, results in inequitable access to health care for a structurally vulnerable patient population. Our findings demonstrate a need for healthcare provider education and non-stigmatizing clinical interventions to reduce potential harms associated with VAD injecting. Those interventions could include providing access to specialized pain and withdrawal management, opioid agonist treatment, and harm reduction services, including safer drug use education to reduce or prevent complications from injecting drugs into VADs.","output":"\\"I have such a hard time hitting myself, I thought it'd be easier\\": perspectives of hospitalized patients on injecting drugs into vascular access devices."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To address the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an unprecedented global effort to advance potent neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 as therapeutics.

Interestingly, a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19, also develop ARDS. In the absence of effective treatments, ARDS results in almost 40% mortality. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that resveratrol (RES), a stilbenoid, with potent anti-inflammatory properties can attenuate SEB-induced ARDS. In the current study, we investigated the role of RES-induced alterations in the gut and lung microbiota in the regulation of ARDS. Our studies revealed that SEB administration induced inflammatory cytokines, ARDS, and 100% mortality in C3H/HeJ mice. Additionally, SEB caused a significant increase in pathogenic Proteobacteria phylum and Propionibacterium acnes species in the lungs. In contrast, RES treatment attenuated SEB-mediated ARDS and mortality in mice, and significantly increased probiotic Actinobacteria phylum, Tenericutes phylum, and Lactobacillus reuteri species in both the colon and lungs. Colonic Microbiota Transplantation (CMT) from SEB-injected mice that were treated with RES as well as the transfer of L. reuteri into recipient mice inhibited the production of SEB-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-?3 and IL-17 but increased that of anti-inflammatory IL-10. Additionally, such CMT and L. reuteri recipient mice exposed to SEB, showed a decrease in lung-infiltrating mononuclear cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, NKT cells, Th1 cells, and Th17 cells, but an increase in the population of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th3 cells, and increase in the survival of mice from SEB-mediated ARDS. Together, the current study demonstrates that ARDS induced by SEB triggers dysbiosis in the lungs and gut and that attenuation of ARDS by RES may be mediated, at least in part, by alterations in microbiota in the lungs and the gut, especially through the induction of beneficial bacteria such as L. reuteri.","output":"Resveratrol-mediated attenuation of superantigen-driven acute respiratory distress syndrome is mediated by microbiota in the lungs and gut"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O processo de constituio das arquitecturas dos governos eletr?nicos no mundo, come?am como instrumentos de gest?o que focam fundamentalmente o lado tcnico (TICs) e social (possibilidades estruturais do uso das TIC).

The unprecedented disruption in transportation and stay-at-home orders caused a global disruption in the supply and distribution of drugs that impacted both prescription and illicit drug users. In this study, the trend in consuming 10 major illegal drugs and 19 prescription drugs of potential abuse was determined during the early four months of the COVID-19 pandemic in two communities in western Kentucky and northern Tennessee using wastewater-based epidemiology. The hydrocodone consumption rate increased by 72% (up to 430 mg/d/1000 people) in both communities that aligned with convenient opioid access through teleprescription-approved refills. However, a limited supply and a consequent increase in the cost of drugs significantly curtailed the consumption of illicit stimulants (methamphetamine, 16%;cocaine, 42%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between April 6 and May 30, 2020, via an online survey in 31 provinces of Iran, on HCWs selected based on convenience sampling method. For data collection, a socio-demographic information form and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was utilized. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, and multivariate regression analysis were also applied to test the research hypotheses. RESULTS: In total, 7626 HCWs participated in the present study. Accordingly, 73.2 and 26.8% of the workers were female and male, respectively. As well, 57.8% of the respondents were nurses and 14.4% of the cases were clinicians. Moreover, 44.8% of the participants had thus far worked in isolation wards and 40.3% of these individuals reported working for 4C8 hours with COVID-19 patients. The prevalence rate of OB was 18.3%. Besides, 34.2, 48.7, and 56.1% of the respondents had severe levels of emotional exhaustion (EE), higher depersonalization (DP), and decreased sense of personal accomplishment (PA), respectively. Besides, the HCWs at the age range of 20 to 30, having female gender, no children, and a bachelors degree, and working in isolation wards showed the higher levels of OB with reference to the Chi-square test results (p < 0.001). Accordingly, the statistical test outcomes demonstrated that a history of physical illnesses (p = 0.001) and psychiatric disorders (p = 0.044) could be the best predictor of OB throughout the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We examined: 1) the impact of COVID-19 on cancer-related health care, and 2) patients' most prominent COVIDrelated concerns. Methods: From Sept-Dec 2020, 502 cancer patients completed an online survey about disruptions in cancer-related health care (types and causes of disruptions and length of health care delays). COVID-related concerns (e.g., accessing basic and medical needs, financial concerns, psychosocial impact) were assessed via 25 items rated not at all to extremely concerning, or not applicable. Group differences were examined with Pearson ChiSquare. Sample: 75% women, 82% White, age range 20-88 years (M = 60, SD = 12.1);61% in remission, 16% experiencing cancer relapse, 13% experiencing cancer for the first time;current stage: 40% metastatic, 25% localized, 35% no stage/don't know;time since diagnosis range 0-36 years (M = 8.8, SD = 7.0);primary cancer diagnoses: 29% breast, 27% blood cancers, 6% prostate, 5% lung, 5% colorectal, and 28% other;47% currently in treatment. 49% were tested for COVID-19, 3% tested positive. Results: 40% (n = 200) reported a disruption in cancer-related health care: of these, 34% reported disruption in imaging services, 30% lab service, 26% routine screening, 25% supportive services, 12% treatment session (including 46% chemotherapy, 13% radiation, 13% hormone therapy, 4% surgery), and 14% other disruption, with 10% reporting delay in cancer diagnosis. Nearly half with care delays reported a delay of 2-3 months (18%) or 3+ months (30%), with 3+ months delays occurring most often for routine screenings (40%) and supportive services (37%). Primary causes for disruptions included clinicians recommending the delay (46%) and patient fear of contracting COVID-19 via in person care (31%). The top 3 areas of COVID-19- related concerns (somewhat to extremely concerned) were: 1) others not following safety recommendations e.g., wearing masks (85%), 2) getting COVID-19 due to a weakened immune system (76%), and 3) worrying about loved ones' health (73%). Those in remission less frequently experienced delay in care (35%) than those with first time cancer (50%) or relapse (51%, 2 = 10.5, p &lt; .05), and those in current treatment more frequently experienced delay in care (44%) than those not in treatment (36%, 2 = 3.5, p &lt; .10). Conclusions: Findings highlight the substantial impact of COVID-19 on cancer care, across various forms of care needs and health services. Patients experiencing cancer for the first time, a cancer relapse, or those undergoing treatment reported high levels of delays, with many delays in excess of 3 months.

Operations were performed using conventional laparoscopic (STORZ) equipment. No conversions to the open or conventional retroperitoneal approach were necessary. There were no perioperative or postoperative complications. Operating time ranged from 60 min to 80 min. All patients left the hospital 2 days after surgery. The single access retroperitoneoscopic technique has been successfully applied to adrenalectomy as an available alternative to multiport laparoendoscopic adrenalectomy and single port access surgery. Exposure, visualization and dissection are the same as in retroperitoneal endoscopic adrenalectomy. The SARA surgery offers patient benefits such as faster convalescence, decreased postoperative scarring, better cosmetic effect and financial benefit.","output":"Single access retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy: initial experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among medical trainees during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of the prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students, residents, and fellows at a medical university hospital in New York using self-reported PHQ-9 and GAD-7 screening tools administered via an anonymized survey. The study was conducted in April 2020. RESULTS: The authors received 438 responses (33.4% response rate). Nearly half (44.5%) were medical students and female (56.6%). The prevalence of positive screen for depression (45.3%) and anxiety (48.1%) was high. Many reported moderate to severe depression (17.2%) and anxiety (20.3%). Over half (57.3%) experienced significant mood changes and inability to concentrate, and 14.6% had reconsidered their choice of profession since the start of the pandemic. Those who had reconsidered their profession had higher PHQ-9 [8.1 (6.4) vs 4.4 (4.3), p < 0.0001] and GAD-7 scores [8.3 (6.1) vs 4.7 (4.6), p < 0.0001], indicating adverse mental health partly contributed to their reconsideration of choice of profession. Women were more likely to screen positive for anxiety (OR: 1.68) and medical students more likely to screen positive for anxiety (OR: 2.55) and depression (OR: 2.74).

This study investigated the mental state and attitudes of older Chinese adults during this epidemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online surveys on a convenience sample of China's general population at two different time points. Online surveys were disseminated through popular Chinese social media applications. Adults 18 or older living in China during the initial (N = 1148) and second stages (N=470) were included in the survey. The Worries, Strategies, and Confidence Questionnaire (WSQ) was created to assess worries and awareness of the disease. RESULTS: Combined responses (N=1618), 76.1% were female and about 7.0% were 60 years or above. In the first wave, older adults were found less likely to worry about being infected by COVID-19 (p < 0.05) and reported less attention paid to protective measures (p = 0.004) than young adults. However, as the disease evolved, older participants in the second wave were more worried than young adults (p = 0.027) and older adults in the first wave (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: During the epidemic of COVID-19, watchfulness of the epidemic among older Chinese adults fluctuated over time. Initially they were slow to respond proactively, but their worries gradually increased.

Whether these emerging viruses are associated with increased disease severity is unclear. OBJECTIVES To report the clinical and virological findings of a moderately severe hospital outbreak of A/Victoria/361/2011-like viruses that occurred in November 2011 in Hong Kong. STUDY DESIGN Clinical and virological hospital outbreak investigation. RESULTS The outbreak occurred in an adult psychiatric ward in November 2011, a time well before the usual local seasonal influenza winter peak. Altogether, 7 patients and 1 healthcare-worker were affected (mean age, 47 [range, 34-61] years). The attack rates among patients and healthcare-workers were 33% (7/21) and 7% (1/15), respectively. Pneumonia developed in 38% (3/8) of cases; none had underlying immunocompromised conditions. High nasopharyngeal viral loads were detected. All cases responded to antiviral treatment. Multiple amino acid mutations with reference to earlier A(H3N2) vaccine strains were mapped to key antigenic sites on hemagglutinin; however, no critical mutations on receptor binding sites were detected. Viral sequence variations jeopardized the performance of molecular diagnostic assays. CONCLUSIONS Severe disease and pneumonia occurred in a substantial proportion of non-immunocompromised adults in a hospital outbreak attributed to the emerging antigenically drifted A/Victoria/361/2011-like H3N2 viruses. Close monitoring of the transmission of this drift variant is required.

The precise impact of COVID-19 scare and lockdown on emergency access for acute myocardial infarction (MI) is still subject to debate. METHODS: Data on all patients undergoing invasive coronary angiography at 9 hospitals in the greater area of Rome, Italy, between February 19, 2020 and March 29, 2020, 9, 2020, were retrospectively collected. Incidence of ST-elevation MI (STEMI), and non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI), as well as corresponding percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), was compared distinguishing two different 20-day time periods (before vs on or after March 10, 2020). RESULTS: During the study period, 1,068 patients underwent coronary angiography, 142 (13%) with STEMI and 169 (16%) with NSTEMI. The average daily number of STEMI decreased from 4.3 before the lockdown to 2.9 after the lockdown (p=0.021). Similarly, the average daily number of NSTEMI changed from 5.0 to 3.5 (p=0.028). The average daily number of primary PCI changed from 4.2 to 2.9 (p=0.030), while the average daily number of PCI for NSTEMI changed from 3.5 to 2.5 (p=0.087). For STEMI patients, the time from symptom onset to hospital arrival (onset-to-door time less than three hours) showed a significant increase after the lockdown (p=0.018), whereas door-to-balloon time did not change significantly from before to after the lockdown (p=0.609). CONCLUSIONS: The present study, originally reporting on the trends in STEMI and NSTEMI in the Rome area, highlights that significant decreases in the incidence of both acute coronary syndromes occurred between February 19, 2020 and March 29, 2020, together with increases in time from symptom onset to hospital arrival, luckily without changes in door-to-balloon time.","output":"Reduction in emergency access for acute myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 pandemic: a survey from the greater area of Rome, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is over-expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), rendering tumour cells resistant to apoptosis. Selective COX-2 inhibition is effective in CRC prevention, although having adverse cardiovascular effects, thus focus has shifted to downstream pathways. METHODS: Microarray experiments identified genes regulated by COX-2 in HCA7 CRC cells. In vitro and in vivo regulation of DRAK2 (DAP kinase-related apoptosis-inducing kinase 2 or STK17, an apoptosis-inducing kinase) by COX-2 was validated by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Inhibition of COX-2 induced apoptosis and enhanced DRAK2 expression in HCA7 cells (4.4-fold increase at 4 h by qRT-PCR, P=0.001), an effect prevented by co-administration of PGE(2). DRAK2 levels were suppressed in a panel of human colorectal tumours (n=10) compared to normal mucosa, and showed inverse correlation with COX-2 expression (R=?0.68, R(2)=0.46, P=0.03). Administration of the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib to patients with CRC (n=5) induced DRAK2 expression in tumours (2.5-fold increase, P=0.01). In vitro silencing of DRAK2 by RNAi enhanced CRC cell survival following COX-2 inhibitor treatment. CONCLUSION: DRAK2 is a serineCthreonine kinase implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and is negatively regulated by COX-2 in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a novel mechanism for the effect of COX-2 on cancer cell survival.","output":"Regulation of the apoptosis-inducing kinase DRAK2 by cyclooxygenase-2 in colorectal cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, with its related social distancing and shelter-in-place measures, has dramatically affected ways in which people communicate with each other, forcing people to find new ways to collaborate, study, celebrate special occasions, and meet with family and friends. One of the most popular solutions that have emerged is the use of video conferencing applications to replace face-to-face meetings with virtual meetings. This resulted in unprecedented growth in the number of video conferencing users. In this study, we explored privacy issues that may be at risk by attending virtual meetings. We extracted private information from collage images of meeting participants that are publicly posted on the Web. We used image processing, text recognition tools, as well as social network analysis to explore our web crawling curated dataset of over 15,700 collage images, and over 142,000 face images of meeting participants. We demonstrate that video conference users are facing prevalent security and privacy threats. Our results indicate that it is relatively easy to collect thousands of publicly available images of video conference meetings and extract personal information about the participants, including their face images, age, gender, usernames, and sometimes even full names. This type of extracted data can vastly and easily jeopardize people's security and privacy both in the online and real-world, affecting not only adults but also more vulnerable segments of society, such as young children and older adults.

Here we compared the epidemiological characteristics of laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases with COVID-19 in Wuhan. METHODS: Demographics, case severity and outcomes of 29,886 confirmed cases and 21,960 clinically diagnosed cases reported between December 2019 and February 24, 2020, were compared. The risk factors were estimated, and the effective reproduction number (Rt) of SARS-CoV-2 was also calculated. RESULTS: The age and occupation distribution of confirmed cases and clinically diagnosed cases were consistent, and their sex ratio were 1.0 and 0.9, respectively. The epidemic curve of clinical diagnosis cases was similar to that of confirmed cases, and the city centers had more cumulative cases and higher incidence density than suburbs in both of two groups. The proportion of severe and critical cases (21.5 % vs. 14.0 %, P < 0.0001) and case fatality rates (5.2 % vs. 1.2 %, P < 0.0001) of confirmed cases were all higher than those of clinically diagnosed cases. Risk factors for death we observed in both of two groups were older age, male, severe or critical cases. Rt showed the same trend in two groups, it dropped below 1.0 on February 6 among confirmed cases, and February 8 among clinically diagnosed cases.

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel CoV originating from -CoVs. Major distinctions in the gene sequences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 include the spike gene, open reading frame (ORF) 3b and ORF 8. SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated when the virus interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on host cells. Through this mechanism, the virus infects the alveolar, esophageal epithelial, ileum, colon and other cells on which ACE2 is highly expressed, causing damage to target organs. To date, host innate immunity may be the only identified direct factor associated with viral replication. However, increased ACE2 expression may upregulate the viral load indirectly by increasing the baseline level of infectious virus particles. The peak viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to occur ~10 days following fever onset, causing patients in the acute stage to be the primary infection source. However, patients in the recovery stage or with occult infections can also be contagious. The host immune response in patients with COVID-19 remains to be elucidated. By studying other SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, it is hypothesized that patients with COVID-19 may lack sufficient antiviral T-cell responses, which consequently present with innate immune response disorders. This may to a certain degree explain why this type of CoV triggers severe inflammatory responses and immune damage and its associated complications.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 for physicians: Molecular characteristics and host immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: : Previous studies have demonstrated that forced air warming (FAW) can be used safely in operating rooms with laminar airflow (LAF) ventilation systems.

Here, we evaluate the effects of FAW on the airflow and sanitation quality in surgical fields with nLAF ventilation systems. METHODS: : The airflow speed and direction were measured using a three-dimensional ultrasonic anemometer. Sanitation quality was evaluated by measuring the amount of dust particles after the activation of air conditioning. RESULTS: : FAW caused no meaningful airflow (> 10 cm/sec) and did not diminish the sanitation quality in the surgical field separated by the anesthesia screen. Above the head area, the upward FAW airflow was not counteracted by nLAF, which caused an upward airflow at the edges of the operating table, originating from outside of the operating table and the floor.

However, new studies have provided evidence contradicting these results. METHOD: A search was performed of the Pubmed, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Virtual Health Library databases for randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating 28-day mortality in ARDS patients treated with NMBA within 48 h. An English language restriction was applied. Relevant data were extracted and pooled into risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD), and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effect model. Sensitivity and meta-regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: From 2675 studies, we included five RCTs in the analysis, for a total of 1461 patients with a mean PaO(2)/FIO(2) of 104  35 mmHg. The cisatracurium group had the same risk of death at 28 days (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78C1.03; I(2) = 50%, p = 0.12) and 90 days (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62C1.06; I(2) = 56%, p = 0.06) as the control group (no cisatracurium). The secondary outcomes of mechanical ventilation duration and ventilator-free days were not different between the two groups. Cisatracurium had a significantly lower risk of barotrauma than the control group with no difference in intensive care unit (ICU)Cinduced weakness. The PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio was higher in the cisatracurium group but not until 48 h. Meta-regression analysis of the baseline PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) revealed no heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis excluding the trial using high PEEP and light sedation strategy yielded an improvement in all mortality outcomes. CONCLUSION: NMBA improves oxygenation only after 48 h in moderate, severe ARDS patients and has a lower barotrauma risk without affecting ICU weakness. However, NMBA does not reduce ventilator-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation or, most importantly, the mortality risk regardless of the severity of ARDS.","output":"Neuromuscular blockade in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION This systematic review aims at reporting the incidence, predictive factors, and the oncological outcomes of incidental prostate cancer (IPCa) in men who underwent endoscopic enucleation of prostate (EEP). METHODS A literature search was performed using the following Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and keywords: \\"Prostatic Neoplasms\\", \\"Prostate Cancer\\", \\"Transurethral Resection of Prostate\\", \\"Prostate resection\\", \\"Prostate enucleation\\". Meta-analysis was performed if there were two or more studies reporting the same outcome under the same definition. In case of insufficient data, results were presented in a narrative manner. RESULTS Sixty-one studies were included in qualitative synthesis and 55 were included in meta-analysis. The pooled IPCa rate was 0.08 (95% CI 0.073-0.088). Increasing age, higher preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, higher preoperative PSA density (PSAD), smaller prostate volume, higher postoperative PSA velocity and lower enucleated prostate weight, were reported to have significant correlation with IPCa. In BPH patients, the mean pre-operative and post-operative PSA levels were 5.58  1.48 ng/dL and 1.06  0.27 ng/dL, respectively. In patients with IPCa, the mean pre-operative and post-operative PSA levels were 7.72  2.90 ng/dL and 2.77  1.66 ng/dL, respectively. The mean percentage PSA reduction was 82.0%  1.8% for BPH patients and 68.2%  12.1% for IPCa patients. IPCa was most commonly managed by active surveillance (68.7%). CONCLUSIONS The pooled incidence of IPCa after EEP was 8%. An absolute post-operative PSA level of < 2.0 and a percentage PSA reduction of > 70% should be expected in BPH patients after EEP.","output":"Incidence, predictive factors and oncological outcomes of incidental prostate cancer after endoscopic enucleation of the prostate: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose:: This paper aims to review the latest management developments across the globe and pinpoint practical implications from cutting-edge research and case studies.

The study was conducted in four different types of HtR areas (hilly, coastal, lowlands, and river islands) by utilizing a sequential explanatory mixed-method design. Overall, we collected information from 20 health facilities and 2,989 households by interviewing 2,768 recently delivered women (RDW) with a structured questionnaire and qualitative interviews (n = 55) of facility managers, local stakeholders, RDWs, and health care providers (HCP). The quantitative data were analyzed principally for descriptive statistics and the qualitative data was analyzed by utilizing the thematic approach. Antenatal care, under-5 care, and family planning services were available in almost all the facilities. However, Normal vaginal deliveries were performed in 55.6% of the union-level facilities. Only 40% of sub-district level facilities had provision for C-sections. Blood transfusion services were available in only 20.1% of facilities, whereas laboratory services were obtainable in 51.7% of facilities. Overall, the bottlenecks were identified in cases of availability of drugs, human resources, transportation, lack of knowledge regarding different essential services and health components, out of pocket expenditure etc. There have been several remedial approaches suggested from both the demand and supply side that included incentives for care providers for staying in these areas, a coordinated transport/referral system, and health education campaigns.

Therefore, in this study, we utilised shotgun proteomics to identify MGO-modified proteins, and label-free quantitation to measure changes in protein abundance following exposure to MGO. We identified numerous mitotic proteins that were modified by MGO, including those involved in the separation and cohesion of sister chromatids. Furthermore, the protein abundance of Securin, an inhibitor of sister chromatid separation, was increased following treatment with MGO. Cytological examination of chromosome spreads showed MGO prevented sister chromatid separation, which was associated with the formation of complex nuclear anomalies.

The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with staffing (i.e., employment), capacity allocation, over-staffing, and under-staffing. We propose two-stage stochastic programming (SP) and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approaches to model and solve this problem considering two types of decision-makers, namely an everything in advance decision-maker (EA) and a flexible adjustment decision-maker (FA). In the EA models, we determine the staffing and capacity allocation decisions in the first stage before observing the demand. In the FA models, we decide the staffing decisions in the first stage. Then, we determine the capacity allocation decisions based on demand realizations in the second stage. We derive equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulations of the proposed nonlinear DRO model for the EA decision-maker that can be implemented and efficiently solved using off-the-shelf optimization software.

Hypothalamic circuits are exposed to the entry of the virus via the olfactory bulb and interact centrally with crucial respiratory nuclei. Hypothalamic microRNAs are considered as potential biomarkers and modulators for various diseases and future therapeutic targets. The present study aims to investigate the microRNAs that regulate the expression of hypothalamic angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), essential elements for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Methods: To determine potential hypothalamic miRNAs that can directly bind to ACE2 and TMPRSS2, multiple target bioinformatics prediction algorithms were used, including miRBase, Target scan, and miRWalk2.029. Results: Our in silico analysis has revealed that, although there are over 5000 hypothalamic miRNAs, around 31 miRNAs and 29 miRNAs have shown binding sites and strong binding capacity against ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively.

A study revealed that the majority of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection presented with either no or a single symptom. Meanwhile, multiple other studies reported of more severe disease in SARS-CoV-2 infected children with brain tumor and/or cancer as a whole. CASE REPORT: The patient was a 15-year-old male who was referred to our hospital with complaints of vomiting, headache, and signs of worsening right hemiparesis. Initial MRI suggested of a high-grade astrocytoma and hydrocephalus, but a subtotal tumor resection and external ventricular drainage gave light to a histopathological examination conclusive of germinoma. After adhering to radiotherapy and recovering well, the patient fell into unconsciousness 9 months later and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient deteriorated on the third day of admission with respiratory failure, shock, arrythmias, fever, and increased d-dimer. After multiple attempts stabilization with ventilatory, defibrillator, and medical support, the patient deceased at the 6th day of admission. DISCUSSION: Cancer patients with COVID-19 have been reported to have relatively higher mortality rate when compared to the non-infected patients. Moreover, malignancies were also reported to increase the risk of developing more severe disease in children. Although rare, patients may develop a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), which is a state of hyperinflammatory and severe illness temporally associated with COVID-19 infection. No observations have been evident in indicating the influence of COVID-19 on the neurological state of the patient, but we believe that it may be reasonable to not yet exclude the possibility of it of exacerbating the CNS malignancy our patient suffered from. CONCLUSION: Children with intracranial brain tumor infected by SARS-CoV-2 may fall into a worse condition with poor prognosis, exacerbated by severe acute respiratory distress and the need for breathing support in intensive care unit.

This observation suggests that genetic alterations leading to a decreased level of IGFBP-5 may also contribute to breast cancer. In the current review, we focus on Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein A (PAPP-A), a protease involved in the degradation of IGFBP-5.

Thus a fast, accurate and automatic health diagnosis system based on feces is urgently necessary for improving the examination speed and reducing the infection risk. The rarity of the pathological images would deteriorate the accuracy performance of the trained models. In order to alleviate this problem, we employ augmentation and over-sampling to expand the samples of the classes that have few samples in the training batch. In order to achieve an impressive recognition performance and leverage the latent correlation between the traits and colors of feces pathological samples, a multi-task network is developed to recognize colors and traits of the macroscopic feces images. The parameter number of a single multi-task network is generally much smaller than the total parameter number of multiple single-task networks, so the storage cost is reduced. The loss function of the multi-task network is the weighted sum of the losses of the two tasks. In this paper, the weights of the tasks are determined according to their difficulty levels that are measured by the fitted linear functions.

After occluding the most destroyed lobe with valves, significant target lobe volume reduction leads to improvements in lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life. In some patients, the effects are not consistent leading to long-term therapy failure. We hypothesized that surgical lung volume reduction (LVRS) would re-establish ELVR short-term clinical improvements following ELVR long-term failure. METHODS In this retrospective single-center analysis, we included all patients who underwent consolidating lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) by lobectomy after long-term failure of valve therapy between 2010 and 2015. Changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), residual volume (RV), 6-min walking distance (6MWD), and dyspnea score (mMRC) 90 days after ELVR and LVRS were analyzed, and the outcomes of both procedures were compared. RESULTS A total of 20 patients underwent LVRS after ELVR failure. In the majority (90%), a lower lobectomy was performed. The 30-day mortality of the cohort was 0% and 90-day mortality 5% (1/20). The remaining 19 patients showed a significant increase in FEV1 (+27.5  19.4%) and reduction in RV (-21.0  17.4%) and TLC (-11.1  11.1%). This resulted in significant improvements in exercise tolerance (6MWD: +56  60 m) and relief of dyspnea (mMRC: -1.8  1.4 pts.).

Radiological variables were used to construct nomogram and clinical utility of the nomogram was cross-validated. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, status of the hilum, Long Axis Diameter, Short axis diameter, colour virtual touch imaging grade (VTI) and shear wave velocity were significant in predicting metastasis in the cervical lymph nodes. In multivariable analysis, it was found that predominance of red over yellow area on colour VTI was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis.

As well as optimize the analysis of these cases and establish if there are characteristics that allow establishing the possibility of carrying an additional infection to that of SARS-CoV-2 and the implications for the management and prognosis of the patient.","output":"Coinfection of other respiratory pathogens and HIV in COVID-19 patients: Is there a pattern?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of COVID-19 infections on a global level has highlighted the need for accurate, transparent and timely information regarding collective mobility patterns to inform de-escalation strategies as well as to provide forecasting capacity for re-escalation policies aiming at addressing further waves of the virus.

Studies show that employees with more pliable work schedules have a better work-life balance, are more engaged and are less stressed.3 Employee well-being For many people, the pandemic has thrown their stress and anxiety into overdrive, so it's not surprising to learn that 69% of employees are experiencing burnout.4 That explains why so many people are looking for employers who focus on employee well-being and that healthy work-life balance mentioned earlier. In addition to remote work and flexible work schedules, other factors that may improve well-being include: * Fostering a sense of belonging among employees. * Supporting employees' personal needs. * Giving employees more control over how they do their jobs. * Allowing employees to participate in workplace improvements.5 Upskilling A high employment rate, soaring job openings and more remote work opportunities are a few factors making it difficult for organizations to retain and recruit employees.","output":"The Road Ahead"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Unified Protocol for Children (UP-C) is a transdiagnostic Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy group intervention for children and caregivers targeting the treatment of childrens emotional disorders (EDs).

Children and parents also completed self-report measures assessing the childrens anxiety and depression and its interference and severity. The results of the present study support the feasibility and acceptability of the UP-C in Portugal; low dropout rates, high adherence rates, and high levels of child and parent satisfaction and motivation were observed. Moreover, significant reductions over time in childrens levels of anxiety and/or depression and of its interference and severity were found and were maintained after 3 months of follow-up.

Despite substantial workforce planning efforts, the effectiveness of this planning has been criticised. Education, training, and workforce plans have typically considered each health-care profession in isolation and have not adequately responded to changing health and care needs. The results are persistent vacancies, poor morale, and low retention. Areas of particular concern highlighted in this Health Policy paper include primary care, mental health, nursing, clinical and non-clinical support, and social care. Responses to workforce shortfalls have included a high reliance on foreign and temporary staff, small-scale changes in skill mix, and enhanced recruitment drives. Impending challenges for the UK health and care workforce include growing multimorbidity, an increasing shortfall in the supply of unpaid carers, and the relative decline of the attractiveness of the National Health Service (NHS) as an employer internationally. We argue that to secure a sustainable and fit-for-purpose health and care workforce, integrated workforce approaches need to be developed alongside reforms to education and training that reflect changes in roles and skill mix, as well as the trend towards multidisciplinary working. Enhancing career development opportunities, promoting staff wellbeing, and tackling discrimination in the NHS are all needed to improve recruitment, retention, and morale of staff. An urgent priority is to offer sufficient aftercare and support to staff who have been exposed to high-risk situations and traumatic experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to growing calls to recognise and reward health and care staff, growth in pay must at least keep pace with projected rises in average earnings, which in turn will require linking future NHS funding allocations to rises in pay. Through illustrative projections, we show that, to sustain annual growth in the workforce at approximately 24%, increases in NHS expenditure of 4% annually in real terms will be required. Above all, a radical long-term strategic vision is needed to ensure that the future NHS workforce is fit for purpose.","output":"Securing a sustainable and fit-for-purpose UK health and care workforce"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Cardiac output may be compromised in preterm infants with sepsis. Whether low cardiac output is associated with low tissue oxygen supply in these patients is unclear. The aim of the current study was to assess the association between cardiac output, assessed by echocardiography, and tissue oxygenation, measured with multisite near-infrared spectroscopy, in a cohort of preterm infants with clinical sepsis. DESIGN Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING Level III neonatal ICU. PATIENTS Twenty-four preterm infants (gestational age < 32 wk) with clinical sepsis. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Clinical and echocardiographic assessment of hemodynamics was performed within 48 hours of sepsis workup and repeated at least 24 hours later. We measured cerebral, renal, and intestinal tissue oxygen saturation using near-infrared spectroscopy during an hour of stable measurements directly preceding or following echocardiography and calculated fractional tissue oxygen extraction in each tissue. We determined Spearman correlation coefficients between fractional tissue oxygen extraction and right ventricular output corrected for patent foramen ovale flow, left ventricular output corrected for ductus arteriosus flow, and superior vena cava flow. Right ventricular output corrected for patent foramen ovale and left ventricular output corrected for ductus arteriosus flow both correlated significantly with intestinal fractional tissue oxygen extraction (, -0.700; p = 0.036 and , -0.604; p = 0.029, respectively). In contrast, no significant correlations were found between cardiac output measurements and cerebral and renal fractional tissue oxygen extraction, respectively. Changes in cardiac output measurements were not associated with observed changes in fractional tissue oxygen extraction values. CONCLUSIONS Right ventricular output corrected for patent foramen ovale and left ventricular output corrected for ductus arteriosus flow, indicators of systemic blood flow in preterm infants with shunts, were negatively associated with intestinal fractional tissue oxygen extraction, but not with renal and cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction. These findings suggest that during low output states due to clinical sepsis intestinal perfusion is most at risk.","output":"Multisite Tissue Oxygenation Monitoring Indicates Organ-Specific Flow Distribution and Oxygen Delivery Related to Low Cardiac Output in Preterm Infants With Clinical Sepsis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many countries are facing significant challenges in relation to providing adequate care for their elderly citizens. The roots of these issues are manifold, but include changing demographics, changing behaviours, and a shortage of resources. As has been witnessed in the health sector and many others in society, technology has much to offer in terms of supporting peoples needs. This paper explores the potential for ambient intelligence to address this challenge by creating a system that is able to passively monitor the home environment, detecting abnormal situations which may indicate that the inhabitant needs help. There are many ways that this might be achieved, but in this paper, we will describe our investigation into an approach involving unobtrusively listening to sound patterns within the home, which classifies these as either normal daily activities, or abnormal situations. The experimental system we built was composed of an innovative combination of acoustic sensing, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), which we argue in the paper that it provides a cost-effective approach to alerting care providers when an elderly person in their charge needs help. The majority of the innovation in our work concerns the AI in which we employ Machine Learning to classify the sound profiles, analyse the data for abnormal events, and to make decisions for raising alerts with carers. A Neural Network classifier was used to train and identify the sound profiles associated with normal daily routines within a given persons home, signalling departures from the daily routines that were then used as templates to measure deviations from normality, which were used to make weighted decisions regarding calling for assistance. A practical experimental system was then designed and deployed to evaluate the methods advocated by this research. The methodology involved gathering pre-design and post-design data from both a professionally run residential home and a domestic home. The pre-design data gathered the views on the system design from 11 members of the residential home, using survey questionnaires and focus groups. These data were used to inform the design of the experimental system, which was then deployed in a domestic home setting to gather post-design experimental data. The experimental results revealed that the system was able to detect 84% of abnormal events, and advocated several refinements which would improve the performance of the system. Thus, the research concludes that the system represents an important advancement to the state-of-the-art and, when taken together with the refinements, represents a line of research which has the potential to deliver significant improvements to care provision for the elderly.","output":"Smart-Object-Based Reasoning System for Indoor Acoustic Profiling of Elderly Inhabitants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past fifty years, nonviolent civil resistance has overtaken armed struggle as the most common form of mobilization used by revolutionary movements Yet even as civil resistance reached a new peak of popularity during the 2010s, its effectiveness had begun to declineeven before the covid-19 pandemic brought mass demonstrations to a temporary halt in early 2020 This essay argues that the decreased success of nonviolent civil resistance was due not only to savvier state responses, but also to changes in the structure and capabilities of civil-resistance movements themselves Perhaps counterintuitively, the coronavirus pandemic may have helped to address some of these underlying problems by driving movements to turn their focus back to relationship-building, grassroots organizing, strategy, and planning [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Democracy is the property of Johns Hopkins University Press and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"The Future of Nonviolent Resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surfactant liquid-membrane type sensors are usually made of a PVC, ionophore and a plasticizer.

Impact network analysis (INA) is a new framework for evaluating the likely success of regional interventions before, during, and after projects, for project implementers, policy makers, and funders. INA integrates across three key system components in a multilayer network analysis: (a) the quality of a management technology and the quality of research supporting it, (b) the socioeconomic networks through which managers learn about management technologies and decide whether to use them, and (c) the linked biophysical network for target species success or failure in the management landscape that results from managers decisions. The specific objectives of this paper are (1) to introduce the INA framework and INA R package, (2) to illustrate identification of key nodes for smart surveillance, for networks where the likelihood of invasive species entry into the biophysical network at a given node may be based on information available to the corresponding node in the socioeconomic network, (3) to illustrate application of the INA framework for evaluating the likely degree of success of a project in intervention ecology, before, during and after an intervention, and (4) to illustrate the use of INA for evaluating adaptation strategies under global change scenarios with pulse and press stressors, introducing adaptation functions for sustainability and resilience. Examples of use of the INA package show one of the key outcomes of analyses: identifying when systems may be non-responsive to the system components that are readily changed through management decisions, to explore what additional adaptations may be necessary for intervention success. The broader goal for the development of impact network analysis and the INA package is to provide a common framework that integrates across intervention ecology, to enhance opportunities for lessons learned across systems and scientific disciplines, to support the development of a community of practice, and to create a general platform for analysis of sustainability, resilience, and economic viability in intervention ecology applications.","output":"Impact network analysis and the INA R package: Decision support for regional management interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased fruit and vegetable (FV) intake is associated with decreased risk of nutrition-related chronic diseases.

As a part of the formative phase of an implementation research study, we conducted a needs assessment to define short- and long-term needs and opportunities for hypertension services within the public health system. METHODS: We conducted a multi-method, multi-level assessment of needs related to hypertension within Guatemalas public system using the World Health Organizations health system building blocks framework. We conducted semi-structured interviews with stakeholders at national (n = 17), departmental (n = 7), district (n = 25), and community (n = 30) levels and focus groups with patients (3) and frontline auxiliary nurses (3). We visited and captured data about infrastructure, accessibility, human resources, reporting, medications and supplies at 124 health posts and 53 health centers in five departments of Guatemala. We conducted a thematic analysis of transcribed interviews and focus group discussions supported by matrix analysis. We summarized quantitative data observed during visits to health posts and centers. RESULTS: Major challenges for hypertension service delivery included: gaps in infrastructure, insufficient staffing and high turnover, limited training, inconsistent supply of medications, lack of reporting, low prioritization of hypertension, and a low level of funding in the public health system overall. Key opportunities included: prior experience caring for patients with chronic conditions, eagerness from providers to learn, and interest from patients to be involved in managing their health. The 5 departments differ in population served per health facility, accessibility, and staffing. All but 7 health posts had basic infrastructure in place. Enalapril was available in 74% of health posts whereas hydrochlorothiazide was available in only 1 of the 124 health posts. With the exception of one department, over 90% of health posts had a blood pressure monitor. CONCLUSIONS: This multi-level multi-method needs assessment using the building blocks framework highlights contextual factors in Guatemalas public health system that have been important in informing the implementation of a hypertension control trial. Long-term needs that are not addressed within the scope of this study will be important to address to enable sustained implementation and scale-up of the hypertension control approach.

METHODOLOGY: Data from cross-sectional telephone interviews of 1,001 Hong Kong adults in June, 2009 were tested against theory and data-derived hypothesized associations between trust in (formal/informal) information, understanding, self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility and worry, and hand hygiene and social distancing using Structural Equation Modelling with multigroup comparisons. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Trust in formal (government/media) information about influenza was associated with greater reported understanding of A/H1N1 cause ( = 0.36) and A/H1N1 prevention self-efficacy ( = 0.25), which in turn were associated with more hand hygiene ( = 0.19 and  = 0.23, respectively). Trust in informal (interpersonal) information was negatively associated with perceived personal A/H1N1 susceptibility ( = ?0.21), which was negatively associated with perceived self-efficacy ( = ?0.42) but positively associated with influenza worry ( = 0.44). Trust in informal information was positively associated with influenza worry ( = 0.16) which was in turn associated with greater social distancing ( = 0.36). Multigroup comparisons showed gender differences regarding paths from trust in formal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, trust in informal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, and understanding of A/H1N1 cause to perceived self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Trust in government/media information was more strongly associated with greater self-efficacy and handwashing, whereas trust in informal information was strongly associated with perceived health threat and avoidance behaviour.

Fintech enables customers to access financial services more efficiently and faster than traditional business, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic due to health protocols, including restrictions on physical contact. This study investigates financial literacy, fintech adoption, and the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the financial health of consumers in Vietnam. The relatively higher level of the unbanked population in Vietnam and the lower level of adult financial literacy compared with the ASEAN region motivated this study. Based on judgment sampling, participants were approached using the mall intercept technique, and those familiar with fintech were selected for the research interview. Thirty participants were interviewed and were given a survey form to be filled online using their mobile phones. Data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS software version 23. Perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, trust, brand image, government support, user innovativeness, and attitude are found to be significantly correlated with fintech adoption in Vietnam, while financial literacy was found to be not significantly correlated with fintech adoption. Furthermore, further analysis using multiple linear regression revealed user innovativeness and attitude have a positive impact towards fintech adoption, and in contrast, financial literacy showed significant negative impact on fintech. This inverse relationship could indicate that in Vietnam, fintech may play a role of bringing financial inclusion where people with lower financial literacy are able to use technology for financial transactions, which was previously inaccessible to them. This could also mean that Vietnamese with higher financial literacy do not see fintech as an important tool for their financial transactions, as they may already have strong access to traditional financial facilities. This research contributes to knowledge in the field of Fintech adoption in Vietnam at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak.

An advanced therapeutic approach to effectively penetrate and eliminate bacterial biofilm and to accelerate cell proliferation and migration at the wound is crucial. METHODS: The poly(?-caprolactone)-monomethoxyl poly (ethylene glycol) (PCL-mPEG) micelles loaded with Quercetin and Rifampicin (QRMs) were prepared. Bacterial biofilm proliferation and elimination effect of QRMs were evaluated with confocal laser scanning microscopy. Antibacterial assay was further performed to detect antibacterial activity and mechanism. The cell scratch assay and cellular uptake were performed in HaCaT skin epithelial cells. RESULTS: Our results showed that the small sized QRMs could penetrate the interior of MRSA biofilm to disperse and eradicate biofilm. Then, antibiotics are released and accumulated in the acidic biofilm environment. QRMs could kill bacteria through increasing bacterial membrane permeability and altering membrane potential and membrane fluidity. Moreover, QRMs improved intracellular and cytoplasmic delivery efficiency of drugs to epithelial cells, and in the scratch test, presented a stronger ability to promote migration and proliferation of HaCaT cells compared with free drugs. Hemolysis test further proved good biocompatibility of QRMs. CONCLUSIONS: QRMs could potentially be used as a novel dual-functional nanotherapeutic for anti-bacterial infection by eradicating biofilm and accelerating cells proliferation at MRSA infected wound.","output":"Dual Drug Loaded pH-sensitive Micelles for Efficient Bacterial Infection Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computer-based testing of humanities students has some inconveniences and difficulties, where the whole learning process is practically based on communicative methods. In this regard, one needs such a testing system, which would allow one to ask open-ended questions, and students would be able to enter detailed answers. Despite the popularity of using the shingle algorithm in determining plagiarism, few researchers have attempted to use it in assessing the academic achievements of students. In this regard, the aim of this study was to develop an intelligent testing system based on the shingle algorithm in assessing the academic achievements of humanities students. Taking into account that during testing humanities students will formulate answers of their own understanding, the developed system should be able to determine the degree of their identity to the correct answer. At the same time, answers with a high degree of correspondence to the answer stored in the dictionary should also be entered in the database as one of the variants of the correct answer. The shingle algorithm, stemming, and MD5 hashing algorithms were used to achieve this goal. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated in terms of degree of matching (S), completeness (P), F-measure and performance (t). The experiment involved 120 humanities students in 2C3 courses at the age of 18C20 years, including 80 girls and 40 boys. It was found that the effectiveness of the developed algorithm is achieved at the optimal time t = 77% and the degree of compliance of the final grade F = 77%. In this case, the final score of the F-measure fully reflects the result at the proportion of truthfulness equal to 0.5 and is directly proportional to the degree of compliance (S) and completeness (P) of use. It is found that a high value of the matching degree (S) is achieved with a smaller shingle length, while with a larger shingle length the matching degree decreases, thus, the probability of finding the same phrase in two documents increases. In addition, with smaller shingle lengths, the time spent calculating checksums is longer, and with larger shingle lengths, the time spent calculating checksums is shorter. Calculations showed that the optimal shingle algorithm efficiency was at the length of the shingle N = 5 of the average data processing time. The results of this study show that the developed algorithm can be included in pedagogical practice in order to objectively assess the learning achievements of humanities students, taking into account their communicative and cognitive abilities. In the future, the developed algorithm can also be used in other areas requiring text analysis, in particular for checking plagiarism.","output":"An intelligent testing system development based on the shingle algorithm for assessing humanities students' academic achievements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 showed various transmission rate (R t ) across different regions.

At global scale, the R t started to decrease approximately two weeks after policy interventions initiated. This lag from the date of policy interventions initiation to the date when R t started to decrease ranges from 9 to 19 days, largest in Europe and North America.

The transmission rate at the point of inflection (R I ) increases by 29.4% (25.2-34.0%) for 1% uptick in the proportion of people aged above 65, indicating elderly people face ~2.5 times higher infection risk than younger people. Air temperature is negatively correlated with transmission rate, which is mainly attributed to collinearities between air temperature and demographic factors. Our model predicted that temperature sensitivity of R I is only -2.7% (-5.2 - 0%) per C after excluding collinearities between air temperature and demographic factors.

Such investments will not only serve to support Canada's current pandemic response and post pandemic recovery, but will also prepare this country to weather future crises. Without such support, Canada risks falling behind other developed nations that are investing heavily in hardware automation at this time.","output":"Making Sense of the Robotized Pandemic Response: A Comparison of Global and Canadian Robot Deployments and Success Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1. Microarrays, a recent development, provide a revolutionary platform to analyse thousands of genes at once. They have enormous potential in the study of biological processes in health and disease and, perhaps, microarrays have become crucial tools in diagnostic applications and drug discovery. 2. Microarray based studies have provided the essential impetus for biomedical experiments, such as identification of disease-causing genes in malignancies and regulatory genes in the cell cycle mechanism. Microarrays can identify genes for new and unique potential drug targets, predict drug responsiveness for individual patients and, finally, initiate gene therapy and prevention strategies. 3. The present article reviews the principles and technological concerns, as well as the steps involved in obtaining and analysing of data. Furthermore, applications of microarray based experiments in drug target identifications and validation strategies are discussed. 4.

Over time, a series of fast-track surveys were conducted to determine the descriptive and injunctive norms for four COVID-19 prevention strategies: wearing a mask in public, physical distancing, limiting the size of indoor gatherings, and receiving or planning to get a vaccination. The results demonstrated that, at this particular university, an SNA-based public communications campaign would be a promising strategy for promoting these protective behaviors. First, a clear majority of the survey respondents reported engaging in the behaviors. Second, the respondents perceived the behaviors to be less common than was actually the case, with one exception: wearing a mask.

Frequently, treatments are not oriented to existing guidelines. In the future, digital elements may be promising tools to support guideline-oriented treatment in a broader range of patients. The cluster-randomized controlled Rise-uP trial aims to support a General Practitioner (GP)-centered back pain treatment (Registration No: DRKS00015048) and includes the following digital elements: 1) electronic case report form (eCRF), 2) a treatment algorithm for guideline-based clinical decision making of GPs, 3) teleconsultation between GPs and pain specialists for patients at risk for development of chronic back pain, and 4) a multidisciplinary mobile back pain app for all patients (Kaia App). METHODS: In the Rise-uP trial, 111 GPs throughout Bavaria (southern Germany) were randomized either to the Rise-uP intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG). Rise-uP patients were treated according to the guideline-oriented Rise-uP treatment algorithm. Standard of care was applied to the CG patients with consideration given to the National guideline for the treatment of non-specific back pain. Pain rating on the numeric rating scale was the primary outcome measure. Psychological measures (anxiety, depression, stress), functional ability, as well as physical and mental wellbeing, served as secondary outcomes. All values were assessed at the beginning of the treatment and at 3-month follow-ups. RESULTS: In total, 1245 patients (IG: 933; CG: 312) with NLBP were included in the study. The Rise-uP group showed a significantly stronger pain reduction compared to the control group after 3 months (IG: M=?33.3% vs CG: M=?14.3%). The Rise-uP group was also superior in secondary outcomes. Furthermore, high-risk patients who received a teleconsultation showed a larger decrease in pain intensity (?43.5%) than CG patients (?14.3%). ANCOVA analysis showed that the impact of teleconsultation was mediated by an increased training activity in the Kaia App. CONCLUSION: Our results show the superiority of the innovative digital treatment algorithm realized in Rise-uP, even though the CG also received relevant active treatment by their GPs. This provides clear evidence that digital treatment may be a promising tool to improve the quality of treatment of non-specific back pain. In 2021, analyses of routine data from statutory health insurances will enable us to investigate the cost-effectiveness of digital treatment.","output":"Digital Treatment of Back Pain versus Standard of Care: The Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial, Rise-uP"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We sought to support public health surveillance and response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through rapid development and implementation of novel visualization applications for data amalgamated across sectors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed and implemented population-level dashboards that collate information on individuals tested for and infected with COVID-19, in partnership with state and local public health agencies as well as health systems. The dashboards are deployed on top of a statewide health information exchange. One dashboard enables authorized users working in public health agencies to surveil populations in detail, and a public version provides higher-level situational awareness to inform ongoing pandemic response efforts in communities. RESULTS: Both dashboards have proved useful informatics resources. For example, the private dashboard enabled detection of a local community outbreak associated with a meat packing plant. The public dashboard provides recent trend analysis to track disease spread and community-level hospitalizations. Combined, the tools were utilized 133 637 times by 74 317 distinct users between June 21 and August 22, 2020. The tools are frequently cited by journalists and featured on social media.

As a result, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) had limited access to outpatient clinics and hospitals. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the perception of the COVID-19 emergency among patients with IBD during the early weeks of the lockdown. METHODS: We invited adult patients with IBD from the University of Salerno (Campania, South Italy) and the University of Padua (Veneto, North Italy) by email to answer an ad hoc anonymous survey about COVID-19. We also collected data on demographic and disease characteristics. RESULTS: In total, 167 patients with IBD from Padua and 83 patients from Salerno answered the survey (age: mean 39.7 years, SD 13.9 years; female: n=116, 46.4%). We found that patients with IBD were particularly worried about the COVID-19 pandemic (enough: 77/250, 30.8%; much/very much: 140/250, 56.0%), as they felt more vulnerable to COVID-19 due to their condition (enough: 70/250, 28.0%; much/very much: 109/250, 43.6%). Patients with IBD from the red zone of Veneto were more worried than patients from Campania (P=.001), and men felt more susceptible to the virus than women (P=.05). Additionally, remote medicine was appreciated more by younger patients than older patients (P=.04).

In this study, we investigated the fate of DC after intradermal (i.d.) or intranodal (i.n.) administration and the consequences for the immune activating potential of DC vaccines in melanoma patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN DC were i.d. or i.n. administered to 25 patients with metastatic melanoma scheduled for regional lymph node resection. To track DC in vivo with scintigraphic imaging and in lymph nodes by immunohistochemistry, cells were labeled with both [(111)In]-indium and superparamagnetic iron oxide. RESULTS After i.d. injection, maximally 4% of the DC reached the draining lymph nodes. When correctly delivered, all DC were delivered to one or more lymph nodes after i.n. injection. Independent of the route of administration, large numbers of DC remained at the injection site, lost viability, and were cleared by infiltrating CD163+ macrophages within 48 hours. Interestingly, 87 +/- 10% of the surviving DC preferentially migrated into the T-cell areas, where they induced antigen-specific T-cell responses. Even though more DC reached the T-cell areas, i.n. injection of DC induced similar antigen-specific immune responses as i.d. injection. Immune responses were already induced with <5 x 10(5) DC migrating into the T-cell areas. CONCLUSIONS Monocyte-derived DC have high immune activating potential irrespective of the route of vaccination.

Using annual data from 1990 to 2018, the long-run elasticity estimates confirm the nonlinear nexus and suggest that although rising crude oil prices do not facilitate renewable energy consumption initially, upon reaching a threshold level of crude oil price, further hikes in the oil prices are likely to elevate the renewable energy consumption figures. The estimated real oil price threshold, in this regard, is predicted to be around 135 US dollars per barrel, which is way above the prevailing oil price level. Identical nonlinearity is also confirmed in the context of the oil prices and renewable energy share in total final energy consumption volumes. Moreover, the nexus between renewable electricity share in aggregate electricity outputs and crude oil prices is also seen to exhibit nonlinearity. However, rising crude oil prices were not found to enhance the renewable electricity shares. Besides, the causality results implicated that movements in crude oil prices influenced the renewable energy transition process across the concerned South Asian economies.

The e-HEALS score in these subjects was lower than those reporting the natural origin of virus (28.4  6.2 vs 30.5  6.1, p<.001). Young people aged <35 y reported signs of depression (41%), anxiety (28%) and stress (36%) more than older participants (p=.0001). As for infection concern, it was higher in females (58% p<.001), those not living alone (56% p<.01), those living with a senior (62% p<.01) or with those at high risk of COVID-19 (64%p<.001). Greater worry meant stricter guideline adherence (hand washing 56% p<.0001; surface sanitation 42% p<.0001; social distancing 77% p<.0001) and mask usage before mandate (45% p<.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Although the sample was overall well informed and followed preventive measures, institutional communication was found to be confusing especially by experts. The findings highlighted the strong psychological impact on the community, young people especially. KEY MESSAGES: The study confirms the importance of putting effort on population health literacy and more effective institutional communication strategies.

After the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 2020, the number of confirmed cases and deaths has continued to increase. This situation may be prolonged until an effective, tested, and safe treatment is available. COVID-19 can occur at any age. However, the maximum confirmed cases and deaths have occurred among the elderly. Particularly, the mental and physical health of the elderly aged above 60 and classified as high-risk groups is more vulnerable than other age groups, requiring more attention. Strong social restraint, social distancing, and quarantine measures to prevent the COVID-19 spread have raised concerns about their mental health. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze and identify the psychological concepts and protective factors that support and constitute these guidelines and strategies and prepare practical suggestions and guidelines to protect the mental health of the elderly during COVID-19. These discussions will facilitate a deeper understanding and expansion of these guidelines and strategies. Therefore, this study explores factorsincluding pandemic-induced stress, self-integration, self-efficacy, and resiliencein order to prepare practical and detailed suggestions and guidelines using studies that considered these factors, including coping with COVID-19-induced stress, social support, and physical activity.","output":"Consideration of the Psychological and Mental Health of the Elderly during COVID-19: A Theoretical Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Myeloma remains an incurable disease and most patients will relapse. The optimal timing of salvage initiation remains uncertain although there is a trend to treating early biochemical relapse. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, delaying therapy of asymptomatic relapsed patients is also desirable, but avoidance of renal failure and symptomatic bony disease is important. Whole body STIR MRI with diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) has the potential to diagnose bone involvement at a very early, pre-symptomatic stage, before cortical destruction occurs. It may be a useful tool to assess the ability to defer therapy in myeloma patients with asymptomatic biochemical relapse. Methods: We performed a retrospective audit of newly diagnosed patients with symptomatic myeloma, diagnosed between April 2012 and Oct 2019. We studied only patients in first relapse who had achieved PR or better to first-line therapy. Patients were typically monitored with monthly serum protein electrophoresis and free light chain assessments. The preferred imaging modality during the study period was whole body STIR MRI with DWI analysis and additional dedicated spinal sequences. Response and relapse criteria were as defined by the IMWG with the exception that regular urine BJP monitoring was not performed. Rapid biochemical relapse was defined as per Sonneveld (ASH Education Book 2017). The decision to initiate therapy for relapse was at the discretion of the treating hematologist. Results: 125 patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic myeloma who achieved PR or better to first line therapy were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 64yrs (range, 32 to 89yrs) and 72% were male. Immunoglobulin type was IgG (54%), IgA (23%), light chain (22%) and IgD (1%). ISS stage was I (19%), II (60%) and III (21%) and 21% were high risk as defined by the presence of t(4;14), t(14;16) or del17p by bone marrow FISH. Half received autologous stem cell transplantation with bortezomib-based therapy being the commonest induction for both transplant- and non-transplant-eligible populations. Amongst this group with responsive disease, haematological response was CR (38%), VGPR (29%) and PR (33%). 75 (60%) of patients have relapsed at a median of 32 months. For patients in CR and VGPR, it took a median of 92 days from the first presence or increase in monoclonal immunoglobulin until IMWG defined relapse criteria were met. At the time of IMWG defined relapse, in terms of assessing need for therapy, the patients clinical status was defined as: rapid biochemical relapse (15%), relapse in a patient with high risk FISH (26%), relapse in a patient with renal failure at diagnosis (15%) and meeting CRAB criteria exclusive of MRI findings (7%), leaving 37% (n=27) in slow biochemical relapse without a definite indication for urgent therapy. MRI was performed as the bone imaging modality in 20 of these 27 slow biochemical relapse patients at a median of 42 days (range, -12 days to 210 days) after IMWG defined relapse: 10 demonstrated new focal bone lesions, 3 no lesions, 4 stable lesions and 3 improved bone lesions. Of these 10 patients with no new MRI detected bone disease, two were treated immediately at physician discretion. Thus, only 8 of 75 relapses were asymptomatic with a normal MRI, had no other indication for urgent therapy and were observed. For this group, the median time to treatment was 96 days (range, 34 to 576 days). Of these 5 had therapy initiated at physician discretion in the absence of clinical deterioration at a median of 78 days post biochemical relapse, one had treatment started 38 days after relapse due to renal deterioration and two were observed for 6 months and 1.4 years prior to the development of progressive focal bone lesions on MRI. None of the 10 patients with slow biochemical relapse and no new focal MRI bone lesions developed symptomatic bone disease within 6 months of that normal MRI. Conclusion: Whole body STIR MRI identifies new focal bone lesions in half of patients with slow biochemical relapse and no other treatment indication, jus ifying early therapy initiation at biochemical progression. In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, whole body STIR MRI with DWI may also be a useful tool to identify patients with slow biochemical relapse who are suitable for careful observation rather than salvage chemotherapy. Only a minority (11% in our study) of relapses, however, are potentially suitable for this approach.

Vampire bat feeding habits enable their contact with mammalian hosts and may enhance zoonotic spillover.

The human pathogens that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and possibly coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) all originated in bats but required bridge hosts to spread into human populations. To monitor the presence of potential zoonotic viruses in bats, the present work evaluated the presence of CoVs in vampire bats from southern Brazil. A total of 101 vampire bats were captured and euthanized between 2017 and 2019 in Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil. The brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys and intestines were collected and macerated individually. The samples were pooled and submitted to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) using the Illumina MiSeq platform and subsequently individually screened using a pancoronavirus RT-PCR protocol. We detected CoV-related sequences in HTS, but only two (2/101; 1.98%) animals had CoV detected in the intestines by RT-PCR. Partial sequences of RdRp and spike genes were obtained in the same sample and the RdRp region in the other sample. The sequences were classified as belonging to Alphacoronavirus. The sequences were closely related to alphacoronaviruses detected in vampire bats from Peru.

America is experiencing a high prevalence of substance use disorder, primarily involving legal and illegal opioid use. A 3000% increase in treatment for substance abuse has occurred between 2000 and 2016. Unfortunately, present day treatment of opioid abuse involves providing replacement therapy with powerful opioids to, at best, induce harm reduction, not prophylaxis. These interventions do not enhance gene expression and restore the balance of the brain reward systems neurotransmitters. We are proposing a generalized approach called Precision Behavioral Management. This approach includes 1) using the Genetic Addiction Risk Severity (GARS, a 10 candidate polymorphic gene panel shown to predict ASI-alcohol and drug severity) to assess early pre-disposition to substance use disorder; 2) using a validated reward deficiency syndrome (RDS) questionnaire; 3) utilization of the Comprehensive Analysis of Reported Drugs (CARD?) to assess treatment compliance and abstinence from illicit drugs during treatment, and, importantly; 4) utilization of a Pro-dopamine regulator (KB220) (via IV or oral [KB220Z] delivery systems) to optimize gene expression, restore the balance of the Brain Reward Cascades neurotransmitter systems and prevent relapse by induction of dopamine homeostasis, and; 5) utilization of targeted DNA polymorphic reward genes to direct mRNA genetic expression profiling during the treatment process. Incorporation of these events can be applied to not only the under-considered African-American RDS community, but all victims of RDS, as a demonstration of a paradigm shift that uniquely provides a novel putative standard of care based on DNA guided precision nutrition therapy to induce dopamine homeostasis and rebalance neurotransmitters in the Brain Reward Cascade.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced nations to take unprecedented measures including lockdowns that might impact tobacco smoking behaviour. We performed a systematic review and meta-analyses to assess smoking behaviour changes during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We searched Medline/Embase/PsycINFO/BioRxiv/MedRxiv/SSRN databases (January-November 2020) for published and pre-print articles that reported specific smoking behaviour changes or intentions after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used random-effects models to pool prevalence ratios comparing the prevalence of smokers during and before the pandemic, and the prevalence of smoking behaviour changes. RESULTS: 33 studies were included in meta-analyses, with smoking data for 230,000 participants across 24 countries. The proportions of smokers during and before the pandemic were similar, with a pooled prevalence ratio 0.85 (95%CI:0.76-0.95). In studies limited to smokers, 27% (95%CI:21-32%) smoked more, 17% (95%CI:13-21%) smoked less, 54% (95%CI:47-61%) smoked the same and 5% (95%CI:2-9%) reported quitting smoking. Among all participants, 1% (95%CI:0-2%) started smoking during the pandemic. All studies were at high risk of bias due to use of non-representative samples, likely non-response bias, and utilisation of non-validated questions. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking behaviour changes during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic were highly mixed.

Alcohol now also poses specific concerns, such as increased risk of severe lung infections, domestic violence, child abuse, depression and suicide. Its use is unlikely to aid physical distancing or other preventative behavioural measures. Globally, alcohol contributes to 20% of injury and 11.5% of non-injury emergency room presentations. We provide some broad comparisons between alcohol-attributable and COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths in North America using most recent data. For example, for Canada in 2017 it was recently estimated there were 105 065 alcohol-attributable hospitalisations which represent a substantially higher rate over time than the 10 521 COVID-19 hospitalisations reported during the first 5 months of the pandemic.

In many countries, alcohol is now more readily available and affordable than ever before, a situation global alcohol producers benefit from and have helped engineer. We argue that to protect frontline health-care services and public health more generally, it is essential that modest, evidence-based restrictions on alcohol prices, availability and marketing are introduced.

While international parent-advisory agencies, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics (2016), advise no screen time before 18 months, parents often do not follow this recommendation. Research on Italian infants early access to media is sparse, and only very few studies have investigated links with sleeping habits. METHOD: To address this gap, we examined concurrent associations between parent-reported surveys of child technology use and sleeping patterns. The Italian version of the 60 item Comprehensive Assessment of Family Media Exposure (CAFE) Survey, developed as part of a larger international study, (Barr et al., 2020), the Brief Screening Questionnaire for Infant Sleep Problems (BISQ) Sadeh, 2004) were completed online by 264 Italian parents of 8- to 36-month-olds and a subset (n = 134) completed the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) Abidin, 1995) between April 2017 and April 2018. RESULTS: More devices located in the childs room and the more time spent watching TV or using an iPad were associated with less hours of sleep at night. Furthermore, more time spent watching TV or using a smartphone, as well as the number of devices in the room was associated with going to sleep later at night. Instrumental media use was associated with less sleep. CONCLUSION: Like other countries, Italian infants have high levels of exposure to media, and differences in media patterns were associated with sleep patterns. Cultural factors influence both instrumental reasons for media use and sleep practices.

We assessed associations between risk factors and COVID-19-related mortality in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We did a population-based cohort study of people with diagnosed diabetes who were registered with a general practice in England. National population data on people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes collated by the National Diabetes Audit were linked to mortality records collated by the Office for National Statistics from Jan 2, 2017, to May 11, 2020. We identified the weekly number of deaths in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during the first 19 weeks of 2020 and calculated the percentage change from the mean number of deaths for the corresponding weeks in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The associations between risk factors (including sex, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, HbA1c, renal impairment [from estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)], BMI, tobacco smoking status, and cardiovascular comorbidities) and COVID-19-related mortality (defined as International Classification of Diseases, version 10, code U07.1 or U07.2 as a primary or secondary cause of death) between Feb 16 and May 11, 2020, were investigated by use of Cox proportional hazards models.

Of these total deaths, 464 in people with type 1 diabetes and 10a525 in people with type 2 diabetes were defined as COVID-19 related, of which 289 (623%) and 5833 (554%), respectively, occurred in people with a history of cardiovascular disease or with renal impairment (eGFR <60 mL/min per 173 m2). Male sex, older age, renal impairment, non-white ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and previous stroke and heart failure were associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Compared with people with an HbA1c of 48-53 mmol/mol (65-70%), people with an HbA1c of 86 mmol/mol (100%) or higher had increased COVID-19-related mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 223 [95% CI 150-330, p<00001] in type 1 diabetes and 161 [147-177, p<00001] in type 2 diabetes). In addition, in people with type 2 diabetes, COVID-19-related mortality was significantly higher in those with an HbA1c of 59 mmol/mol (76%) or higher than in those with an HbA1c of 48-53 mmol/mol (HR 122 [95% CI 115-130, p<00001] for 59-74 mmol/mol [76-89%] and 136 [124-150, p<00001] for 75-85 mmol/mol [90-99%]). The association between BMI and COVID-19-related mortality was U-shaped: in type 1 diabetes, compared with a BMI of 250-299 kg/m2, a BMI of less than 200 kg/m2 had an HR of 245 (95% CI 160-375, p<00001) and a BMI of 400 kg/m2 or higher had an HR of 233 (153-356, p<00001); the corresponding HRs for type 2 diabetes were 233 (211-256, p<00001) and 160 (147-175, p<00001).

The high abundance of TEs in the human genome, especially the Alu and Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 (LINE-1) repeats, makes them responsible for the molecular origin of several diseases. This involves several molecular mechanisms that are presented in this review: insertional mutation, DNA recombination and chromosomal rearrangements, modification of gene expression, as well as alteration of epigenetic regulations. This literature review also presents some of the more recent and/or more classical examples of human diseases in which TEs are involved. Whether through insertion of LINE-1 or Alu elements that cause chromosomal rearrangements, or through epigenetic modifications, TEs are widely implicated in the origin of human cancers. Many other human diseases can have a molecular origin in TE-mediated chromosomal recombination or alteration of gene structure and/or expression. These diseases are very diverse and include hemoglobinopathies, metabolic and neurological diseases, and common diseases. Moreover, TEs can also have an impact on aging. Finally, the exposure of individuals to stresses and environmental contaminants seems to have a non-negligible impact on the epigenetic derepression and mobility of TEs, which can lead to the development of diseases.

Here, we show that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), one of the most representative catechins present in green tea, acts as a differential inhibitor of human recombinant AKR1B1. A kinetic analysis of EGCG, and of its components, gallic acid (GA) and epigallocatechin (EGC) as inhibitors of the reduction of L-idose, 4-hydroxy2,3-nonenal (HNE), and 3-glutathionyl l-4-dihydroxynonanal (GSHNE) revealed for the compounds a different model of inhibition toward the different substrates. While EGCG preferentially inhibited L-idose and GSHNE reduction with respect to HNE, gallic acid, which was still active in inhibiting the reduction of the sugar, was less active in inhibiting HNE and GSHNE reduction. EGC was found to be less efficient as an inhibitor of AKR1B1 and devoid of any differential inhibitory action. A computational study defined different interactive modes for the three substrates on the AKR1B1 active site and suggested a rationale for the observed differential inhibition.

All participants completed a questionnaire about age, gender, weight, height, medical history, concurrent therapies, employment status, previous diagnosis/testing for SARS- CoV-2 infection, and a list of 24 AEs (solicited AEs). The development of at least one solicited AEs was the main outcome. AEs were stratified by the presence of injection-site symptoms, systemic symptoms or both, and the differences between strata were assessed as a secondary outcome. Biometric data and reports of a previous diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were also explored, as predictors of the main outcome. RESULTS: 7,014 healthcare workers were included. An incidence of 3 per 10.000 persons for serious AEs following the first administration of the mRNA BNT162b vaccine was found. An association between the development of non-serious AEs with young age, female gender, low body mass index, and previous history of SARS-CoV-2 was described.

Google released Community Mobility Report (CMR) data about the movement of people collated from mobile devices. OBJECTIVE: To explore the use of CMR to assess the role of mobility in spreading COVID-19 infection in India. METHODS: An Ecological study analyzed CMR for human mobility between March - October 2020. The data compared before (Between 14th -25th March 2020), during (25th March - 7th June 2020), and after lockdown (8th June 2020 - 15th October 2020) phases with the reference periods, i.e. (3rd January 2020 - 6th February 2020). Another dataset depicting the burden of COVID-19 as per various disease severity indicators was derived from a crowd-sourced Application Programming software. The relationship between the two datasets was investigated using Kendall's tau correlation to depict the correlation between mobility and disease severity. RESULTS: At the national level, mobility decreased from -38% to -77% for all but residential areas (an increase of 24.6%) during the lockdown compared to the reference period. At the beginning of unlocking, the state of Sikkim (minimum cases- seven) with a -60% reduction in mobility depicted more mobility compared to -82% in Maharashtra (maximum cases-1.59 million). Residential mobility negatively correlated (-0.05 to -0.91) with all other measures of mobility. The magnitude of correlations for intra-mobility indicators was comparatively low for the lockdown phase (corr &#8805; 0.5 for 12 indicators) compared to other phases (corr &#8805; 0.5 for 45 and 18 indicators in pre-lockdown and unlock phase, respectively). A high correlation coefficient between epidemiological and mobility indicators is observed for the lockdown and unlock phases compared to the pre-lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: We can use mobile-based open-source mobility data to assess the effectiveness of social distancing in mitigating the disease spread.

Organic farming is a potential way to reduce environmental impacts by excluding synthetic pesticides and fertilizers from the process. Despite ecological benefits, it is unlikely that conversion to organic can be financially viable for farmers, without additional support and incentives from consumers. This study models the interplay between consumer preferences and socio-environmental issues related to agriculture and food production. We operationalize the novel concept of extended agro-food supply chain and simulate adaptive behavior of farmers, food processors, retailers, and customers. Not only the operational factors (e.g., price, quantity, and lead time), but also the behavioral factors (e.g., attitude, perceived control, social norms, habits, and personal goals) of the food suppliers and consumers are considered in order to foster organic farming. We propose an integrated approach combining agent-based, discrete-event, and system dynamics modeling for a case of wine supply chain. Findings demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed model over the traditional sustainable supply chain models in incorporating the feedback between consumers and producers and analyzing management scenarios that can urge farmers to expand organic agriculture. Results further indicate that demand-side participation in transition pathways towards sustainable agriculture can become a time-consuming effort if not accompanied by the middle actors between consumers and farmers.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, elective procedures have been postponed indefinitely both to provide capacity to deal with the emergency caseload and to avoid exposure of elective patients to COVID-19. This survey aimed to explore the effect of the pandemic on chronic pain in this group and the views of patients towards undergoing SCS treatment when routine services should resume. Methods: This was a prospective, multi-centre telephone patient survey that analysed data from 330 patients with chronic pain who were on an SCS waiting list. Questions focussed on severity of pain, effect on mental health, medication consumption and reliance on support networks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Views towards undergoing SCS therapy were also ascertained. Counts and percentages were generated, and chi-square tests of independence explored the impact of COVID-19 risk (very high, high, low) on survey responses. Results: Pain, mental health and patients ability to self-manage pain deteriorated in around 47%, 50% and 38% of patients, respectively. Some patients reported increases in pain medication consumption (37%) and reliance on support network (41%). Patients showed a willingness to attend for COVID-19 testing (92%), self-isolate prior to SCS (94%) and undergo the procedure as soon as possible (76%). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains a strong clinical need for patients with chronic pain identified as likely SCS responders to be treated quickly. The current prioritisation of new SCS at category 4 (delayed more than 3 months) is challenged judging by this national survey.

Concerns have been raised that HCWs from ethnic minority groups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant (defined by the World Health Organisation as refusing or delaying a vaccination) than those of White ethnicity, but there are limited data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy and its predictors in UK HCWs. METHODS: Nationwide prospective cohort study and qualitative study in a multi-ethnic cohort of clinical and non-clinical UK HCWs. We analysed ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy adjusting for demographics, vaccine trust, and perceived risk of COVID-19. We explored reasons for hesitancy in qualitative data using a framework analysis. FINDINGS: 11,584 HCWs were included in the cohort analysis. 23% (2704) reported vaccine hesitancy. Compared to White British HCWs (21.3% hesitant), HCWs from Black Caribbean (54.2%), Mixed White and Black Caribbean (38.1%), Black African (34.4%), Chinese (33.1%), Pakistani (30.4%), and White Other (28.7%) ethnic groups were significantly more likely to be hesitant. In adjusted analysis, Black Caribbean (aOR 3.37, 95% CI 2.11 - 5.37), Black African (aOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.49 - 2.82), White Other ethnic groups (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.19 - 1.84) were significantly more likely to be hesitant. Other independent predictors of hesitancy were younger age, female sex, higher score on a COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs scale, lower trust in employer, lack of influenza vaccine uptake in the previous season, previous COVID-19, and pregnancy. Qualitative data from 99 participants identified the following contributors to hesitancy: lack of trust in government and employers, safety concerns due to the speed of vaccine development, lack of ethnic diversity in vaccine studies, and confusing and conflicting information. Participants felt uptake in ethnic minority communities might be improved through inclusive communication, involving HCWs in the vaccine rollout, and promoting vaccination through trusted networks. INTERPRETATION: Despite increased risk of COVID-19, HCWs from some ethnic minority groups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant than their White British colleagues. Strategies to build trust and dispel myths surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine in these communities are urgently required. Emphasis should be placed on the safety and benefit of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pregnancy and in those with previous COVID-19.

Midazolam undergoes extensive metabolism by CYP3A enzymes, which may be inhibited by hyperinflammation. Therefore, an exaggerated proinflammatory response, as often observed in COVID-19, may decrease midazolam clearance. To develop a population pharmacokinetic model for midazolam in adult intensive care unit patients infected with COVID-19 and to assess the effect of inflammation, reflected by IL-6, on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam. METHODS: Midazolam blood samples were collected once a week between March 31 and April 30 2020. Patients were excluded if they concomitantly received CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP3A4 inducers and/or continuous renal replacement therapy. Midazolam and metabolites were analyzed with an ultra-performance liquid chromatographyCtandem mass spectrometry method. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed, using nonlinear mixed effects modelling. IL-6 and CRP, markers of inflammation, were analyzed as covariates. RESULTS: The data were described by a one-compartment model for midazolam and the metabolites 1-OH-midazolam and 1-OH-midazolam-glucuronide. The population mean estimate for midazolam clearance was 6.7 L/h (4.8C8.5 L/h). Midazolam clearance was reduced by increased IL-6 and IL-6 explained more of the variability within our patients than CRP. The midazolam clearance was reduced by 24% (6.7C5.1 L/h) when IL-6 increases from population median 116 to 300 pg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation, reflected by high IL-6, reduces midazolam clearance in critically ill patients with COVID-19. This knowledge may help avoid oversedation, but further research is warranted.

Several inflammatory cytokines have been associated with COVID-19 progression, but have far too much daily intra-individual variability to be useful in tracking the course of the disease. In contrast, we have shown that the inflammatory biomarker {gamma} fibrinogen ({gamma} Fbg) has a 6-fold lower coefficient of variability compared to other inflammatory markers such as hs-CRP. Objectives: The aims of the study were to measure {gamma} Fbg in serial blood samples from COVID-19 patients at a tertiary care medical center in order to investigate its association with clinical measures of disease progression. MethodsCOVID-19 patients at a tertiary care medical center were retrospectively enrolled between 3/16/2020 and 8/1/2020. {gamma} Fbg was measured using a commercial ELISA. Results: Our results showed that nine out of the seventeen patients with COVID-19 had extremely high levels of {gamma} Fbg. {gamma} Fbg levels were significantly associated with the need for ECMO and with mortality. ConclusionsWe found that COVID-19 patients can develop extraordinarily high levels of {gamma} Fbg. The previous highest {gamma} Fbg level that we are aware of was 80.3 mg/dL found in a study of 10,601 participants in the ARIC study. These results have several important clinical implications. {gamma} Fbg contains a high affinity binding site for thrombin that binds to anion-binding exosite II on thrombin and protects it from inactivation by heparin. High levels of {gamma} Fbg therefore provide a reservoir of heparin-resistant clot-bound thrombin when the {gamma} Fbg is clotted. These findings have potential implications regarding prophylactic anticoagulation of COVID-19 patients and suggest that heparin prophylaxis may be less effective than using other anticoagulants, particularly direct thrombin inhibitors.","output":"Extreme ' fibrinogen levels in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human bocavirus was detected in 57 (18.3%) of 312 children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) who required hospitalization in Jordan.

Additionally, such research efforts could contribute to the identification of possible targets for the development of an effective vaccine to stem syphilis spread. METHODS: This study will recruit two cohorts of participants with active syphilis infection, one with de novo infection, one with repeat infection. Whole blood specimens will be collected from each study participant at baseline, 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks, to track specific markers of their immunological response, as well as to compare humoral reactivity to Treponema pallidum antigens between the two groups. Additionally, we will use serum specimens to look for unique cytokine patterns in participants with early syphilis. Oral and blood samples, as well as samples from any syphilitic lesions present, will also be collected to sequence any Treponema pallidum DNA found.

This potential, combined with its general pathological impact, raises the question if syphilis increases mortality in oral cancer patients. The aim of the study was to assess if the five-year survival rates among patients suffering from oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) with (cohort I) and without association with syphilis (cohort II) differ. METHODS: Retrospective clinical data of patients diagnosed with OSCC (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10 codes C01C06) within the past 20 years from the access date September 25, 2021 were retrieved from the TriNetX network (TriNetX, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) to gain initial cohort 0. Subjects also diagnosed with syphilis (ICD-10 codes A51C53) were assigned to cohort I. Cohort II was comprised of the remaining individuals of cohort 0 by creating a group with the same number of patients as cohort I, and by matching for age and gender. Subsequently, Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression were performed, and risk, odds and hazard ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Of a total of 73,736 patients in cohort 0, 199 individuals were each assigned to cohort I and II. During the five-year period after tumor diagnosis, 39 and 30 patients in cohort I and II died. The five-year survival probabilities did not significantly differ between the cohorts (I vs. II = 74.19% vs. 75.01%; p = 0.52; Log-Rank test), nor the risk of dying (I vs. II = 19.6% vs. 15.08%; risk difference = 4.52%; p = 0.23). The calculated risk, odds and hazard ratios were 1.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.84; 2.00), 1.37 (95% CI = 0.81; 2.31) and 1.17 (95% CI = 0.73; 1.88), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results indicate that the survival rate of individuals with OSCC might not be negatively influenced if syphilis is present/associated. However, the results need to be interpreted cautiously due to limitations related to the retrospective approach, especially as data on the tumor staging were not accessible.

Here, we combine observational and experimental methods to assess the courtship function of the female chatter call in brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater. While the chatter call is likely multifunctional, it is frequently used in social interactions and overlapping duets with males during the breeding season. Based on a combination of focal- and scan-sampling data from large naturalistic aviaries, we did not find support for the hypothesis that the chatter call elicits male attention or encourages continued courtship. However, we did find evidence that the chatter call plays a role in pair bond formation, as females preferentially chattered in response to songs from pair-bond males in the 2 weeks leading up to the median date of first copulation. Females were less selective in male-directed chatter use after copulations began. We also found support for the hypothesis that chatter is used to signal-jam male songs. Frame-by-frame video analysis revealed that the majority of female chatter calls were tightly time-locked to song, occurring less than 500 ms after male vocal onset. To test the effect of signal jamming on male song potency, we designed a laboratory experiment in which male song playbacks were jammed by various recorded stimuli. Natural chatter calls more effectively reduced female copulatory responses to song than high-pass filtered chatter calls, suggesting that the low frequencies in natural chatter (2-4 kHz) are important for interfering with male song and reducing its potency. Our results suggest that sexual conflict is operating in cowbird courtship, with signal jamming serving as a mechanism by which females guard, resist or select their mates. We also discuss ways in which cowbird vocal interactions may function cooperatively to coordinate reproduction or transition females into breeding condition.","output":"Female signal jamming in a socially monogamous brood parasite."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Tests for SARS-CoV-2 immunity are needed to help assess responses to vaccination, which can be heterogeneous and may wane over time. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is considered the gold standard for measuring serum neutralizing antibodies but requires high level biosafety, live viral cultures and days to complete. We hypothesized that competitive enzyme linked immunoassays (ELISAs) based on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) attachment to its host receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2r), would correlate with PRNT, given the central role of RBD-ACE2r interactions in infection and published studies to date, and enable evaluation of vaccine responses. Methods and Findings: Configuration and development of a competitive ELISA with plate-bound RBD and soluble biotinylated ACE2r was accomplished using pairs of pre/post vaccine serum. When the competitive ELISA was used to evaluate N=32 samples from COVID-19 patients previously tested by PRNT, excellent correlation in IC50 results were observed (rs= .83, p < 0.0001). When the competitive ELISA was used to evaluate N=41 vaccinated individuals and an additional N=14 unvaccinated recovered COVID-19 patients, significant differences in RBD-ACE2r inhibitory activity were associated with prior history of COVID-19 and type of vaccine received. In longitudinal analyses pre and up to 200 days post vaccine, surrogate neutralizing activity increased markedly after primary and booster vaccine doses, but fell substantially, up to <12% maximal levels within 6 months. Conclusions: A competitive ELISA based on inhibition of RBD-ACE2r attachment correlates well with PRNT, quantifies significantly higher activity among vaccine recipients with prior COVID (vs. those without), and highlights marked declines in surrogate neutralizing activity over a 6 month period post vaccination. The findings raise concern about the duration of vaccine responses and potential need for booster shots.","output":"Development and utilization of a surrogate SARS-CoV-2 viral neutralization assay to assess mRNA vaccine responses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Vaccination has provided a ray of hope in combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vaccines were rolled out as an emergency measure, with an expedited approval process. The available clinical trial data reveals the fact that vaccines mostly produce mild adverse events following immunization (AEFIs). Since the experiences are relatively new, it is important to monitor safety in a real-world setting. With this background, this survey was conducted. Methods This cross-sectional study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (IEC) of Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre. This was conducted over a period of four months at select apartment complexes around Whitefield, Bangalore. The participants were invited to fill up data through online Google Forms (Google, Mountain View, CA, USA). They were requested to provide demographic details, information related to vaccination, and AEFIs. Eligibility to participate included recipients of vaccines who received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in India. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.00 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Results The total number of participants in the study was 322. Out of this, 37.6% (121) were males and 62.4% (201) were females. The mean age of the participants was 34.9  12.4 (mean  standard deviation (SD) years. About 30% (96) of the study participants had comorbidities. Overall, 67.4% (217) of the participants suffered from AEFI. Of them, immediate reactions were reported by 18.3% (59) and 10.2% (32) of the participants after the first and second doses, respectively. A total of 0.9% (3) of the participants had immediate allergic reactions. The most common local and systemic AEFIs were pain at the injection site and extreme tiredness. AEFIs were found to be mild and with a probable association with vaccination as per the WHO scale. The number of females experiencing AEFIs was found to be higher when compared with males for both local and systemic reactions. There was a statistically significant increase in the number of individuals experiencing general adverse effects following the first dose of Covishield(TM) (Serum Institute of India Private Limited, Pune, India) when compared with Covaxin(TM)( )(Bharat Biotech Limited, Hyderabad, India) (P < 0.05). Of the participants, 5.9% (19) were diagnosed with COVID-19 post-vaccination. Among them, 15.8% (3) required hospitalization, with 10.5% (2) of them requiring an oxygen bed. It was observed that 76.5% (166) of the participants did not report their reactions to concerned authorities. Conclusion Based on our sample, the study reflects that COVID-19 vaccination causes mild AEFI in most vaccine recipients. It also provides an insight that reporting of AEFI is very low. It is, therefore, important to take up more awareness campaigns about reporting of AEFIs through the COVID Vaccine Intelligence Network (CoWIN) portal.","output":"Adverse Events Following COVID-19 Vaccination in Selected Apartments in Bangalore, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Elderly population is considered at high risk for pneumococcal diseases.

Chest compressions, one of the main components of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, require intense and dynamic movements of the upper body. We aimed to investigate the protective effect of tight-fitting powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) during chest compressions. METHODS This single-center simulation study was performed from February 2021 to March 2021. The simulated workplace protection factor (SWPF) is the concentration ratio of ambient particles and particles inside the PAPR mask; this value indicates the level of protection provided by a respirator when subjected to a simulated work environment. Participants performed continuous chest compressions three times for 2 min each time, with a 4-min break between each session. We measured the SWPF of the tight-fitting PAPR during chest compression in real-time mode. The primary outcome was the ratio of any failure of protection (SWPF <500) during the chest compression sessions. RESULTS Fifty-four participants completed the simulation. Overall, 78% (n = 42) of the participants failed (the measured SWPF value was less than 500) at least one of the three sessions of chest compressions. The median value and interquartile range of the SWPF was 4304 (685-16,191). There were no reports of slipping down of the respirator or mechanical failure during chest compressions.

DESIGN: Multivariate analysis with population weights. SETTING: Two hundred eighty-seven American Indian Reservations and tribal homelands (in Oklahoma) and, as of April 10, 2020, 861 COVID-19 cases on these reservation lands. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationship between rate per 1000 individuals of publicly reported COVID-19 cases at the tribal reservation and/or community level and average household characteristics from the 2018 5-Year American Community Survey records. RESULTS: By April 10, 2020, in regression analysis, COVID-19 cases were more likely by the proportion of homes lacking indoor plumbing (10.83, P = .001) and were less likely according to the percentage of reservation households that were English-only (-2.43, P = .03). Household overcrowding measures were not statistically significant in this analysis (-6.40, P = .326). CONCLUSIONS: Failure to account for the lack of complete indoor plumbing and access to potable water in a pandemic may be an important determinant of the increased incidence of COVID-19 cases. Access to relevant information that is communicated in the language spoken by many reservation residents may play a key role in the spread of COVID-19 in some tribal communities.

Because of their economic and logistical effects, tracking mobility changes during quarantines is crucial in assessing their efficacy and predicting the virus spread. Chile, one of the worst-hit countries in the world, unlike many other countries, implemented quarantines at a more localized level, shutting down small administrative zones, rather than the whole country or large regions. Given the non-obvious effects of these localized quarantines, tracking mobility becomes even more critical in Chile. To assess the impact on human mobility of the localized quarantines in Chile, we analyze a mobile phone dataset made available by Telef\\\\'onica Chile, which comprises 31 billion eXtended Detail Records and 5.4 million users covering the period February 26th to September 20th, 2020. From these records, we derive three epidemiologically relevant metrics describing the mobility within and between comunas.

Although the viral infection originates in the respiratory system, it is unclear how the virus can overcome the alveolar barrier, which is observed in severe COVID-19 disease courses. To elucidate the viral effects on the barrier integrity and immune reactions, we used mono-cell culture systems and a complex human chip model composed of epithelial, endothelial, and mononuclear cells. Our data show that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected epithelial cells with high viral loads and inflammatory response, including interferon expression. By contrast, the adjacent endothelial layer was neither infected nor did it show productive virus replication or interferon release. With prolonged infection, both cell types were damaged, and the barrier function was deteriorated, allowing the viral particles to overbear. In our study, we demonstrate that although SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the epithelium for efficient replication, the neighboring endothelial cells are affected, e.g., by the epithelial cytokines or components induced during infection, which further results in the damage of the epithelial/endothelial barrier function and viral dissemination.IMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 challenges healthcare systems and societies worldwide in unprecedented ways. Although numerous new studies have been conducted, research to better understand the molecular pathogen-host interactions are urgently needed. For this, experimental models have to be developed and adapted. In the present study we used mono cell-culture systems and we established a complex chip model, where epithelial and endothelial cells are cultured in close proximity. We demonstrate that epithelial cells can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, while the endothelium did not show any infection signs. Since SARS-CoV-2 is able to establish viremia, the link to thromboembolic events in severe COVID-19 courses is evident. However, whether the endothelial layer is damaged by the viral pathogens or whether other endothelial-independent homeostatic factors are induced by the virus is essential for understanding the disease development. Therefore, our study is important as it demonstrates that the endothelial layer could not be infected by SARS-CoV-2 in our in vitro experiments, but we were able to show the destruction of the epithelial-endothelial barrier in our chip model. From our experiments we can assume that virus-induced host factors disturbed the epithelial-endothelial barrier function and thereby promote viral spread.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 causes severe epithelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic that has affected millions of people worldwide, with no dedicated treatment or vaccine currently available. As pharmaceutical research against and the most frequently used tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection both depend on the genomic and peptide sequences of the virus for their efficacy, understanding the mutation rates and content of the virus is critical. Two key proteins for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication are the S protein, responsible for viral entry into the cells, and RdRp, the RNA polymerase responsible for replicating the viral genome. Due to their roles in the viral cycle, these proteins are crucial for the fitness and infectiousness of the virus. Our previous findings had shown that the two most frequently observed mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, 14408C>T in the RdRp coding region, and 23403A>G in the S gene, are correlated with higher mutation density over time. In this study, we further detail the selection dynamics and the mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 genes, comparing them between isolates carrying both mutations, and isolates carrying neither. We find that the S gene and the RdRp coding region show the highest variance between the genotypes, and their selection dynamics contrast each other over time. The S gene displays higher positive selection in mutant isolates early on, and undergoes increasing negative selection over time, whereas the RdRp region in the mutant isolates shows strong negative selection throughout the pandemic.","output":"Different selection dynamics of S and RdRp between SARS-CoV-2 genomes with and without the dominant mutations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Biometric fingerprint identity verification is currently introduced in visa application and entry screening at border control. The system implies physical contact between the skin and the surface of the fingerprint\\\\capturing and reading devices. AIM: To assess the risk of infection transmission through fingerprinting. METHODS: The medical literature was reviewed for the potential of microorganisms to be carried on the skin of hands in the community, to be transferred from hands to inanimate surfaces, to survive on surfaces, and to be transferred in doses exceeding the infectious dose. The fingerprinting procedures as currently applied were reviewed. RESULTS: Factors that favor transfer of microorganisms are large skinCsurface contact between flat fingers (2  20 cm(2)) and fingerprint\\\\capturing device, nonporous contact surface, large overlap of contact surface and short turnaround time between successive applicants, high contact pressure, and difficulties to disinfect devices. Transmission risk exists for enteric viruses (rotavirus, norovirus, and hepatitis A virus), respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, influenzavirus, etc.), and enteropathogenic bacteria with low infectious doses (Shigella dysenteriae, Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, etc.). Using Monte Carlo risk analysis on US data, transmission of human rotavirus is estimated at 191 [95% credible intervals (CI) 0C289] per million fingerprint\\\\capturing procedures. Application of 70% isopropyl hand rub and 85% ethanol hand gel reduces the risk to 77 (95% CI 0C118) and 0.3 (95% CI 0C0.3) transmissions per million procedures, respectively.

Outside of the acute (peak) phases of the disease, dentistry has begun to be practised again. However, there is emerging evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted via airborne routes, carrying implications for dental procedures that produce aerosol. At the time of writing, additional precautions are required when a procedure considered to generate aerosol is undertaken. This paper aims to present evidence-based treatments that remove or reduce the generation of aerosols during the management of carious lesions. It maps aerosol generating procedures (AGPs), where possible, to alternative non-AGPs or low AGPs. This risk reduction approach overcomes the less favourable outcomes associated with temporary solutions or extraction-only approaches. Even if this risk reduction approach for aerosol generation becomes unnecessary in the future, these procedures are not only suitable but desirable for use as part of general dental care post-COVID-19.

Patients were identified as having COPD if they had a diagnosis in the medical record and a history of airflow-obstruction on spirometry, or a history of tobacco use and prescribed long-acting bronchodilator(s). Computed tomography scans were evaluated by radiologists. Propensity matching was performed for age, body-mass index (BMI), and serologic data correlated with severity of COVID-19 disease (D-dimer, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, absolute lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, and lactate dehydrogenase). Results Of 577 patients admitted with COVID-19, 103 had a diagnosis of COPD and/or emphysema. The COPD/emphysema cohort was older (67 vs 58, p<0.0001) than the other cohort and had a lower BMI. Among unmatched cohorts those with COPD/emphysema had higher rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (35% vs 24.9%, p=0.036) and maximal respiratory support requirements, with more frequent invasive mechanical ventilation (21.4% vs 11.8%), but no significant difference in mortality. After propensity-matching there was no difference in ICU admission, maximal respiratory support requirements, or mortality. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses yielded similar results.

In response, these countries are considering the administration of a third dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose to address potential waning immunity over time and reduced effectiveness against the delta variant. We aimed to use the data repositories of Israel's largest health-care organisation to evaluate the effectiveness of a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine for preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Using data from Clalit Health Services, which provides mandatory health-care coverage for over half of the Israeli population, individuals receiving a third vaccine dose between July 30, 2020, and Sept 23, 2021, were matched (1:1) to demographically and clinically similar controls who did not receive a third dose. Eligible participants had received the second vaccine dose at least 5 months before the recruitment date, had no previous documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, and had no contact with the health-care system in the 3 days before recruitment. Individuals who are health-care workers, live in long-term care facilities, or are medically confined to their homes were excluded. Primary outcomes were COVID-19-related admission to hospital, severe disease, and COVID-19-related death. The third dose effectiveness for each outcome was estimated as 1 C risk ratio using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. FINDINGS: 1 158 269 individuals were eligible to be included in the third dose group. Following matching, the third dose and control groups each included 728 321 individuals. Participants had a median age of 52 years (IQR 37C68) and 51% were female. The median follow-up time was 13 days (IQR 6C21) in both groups. Vaccine effectiveness evaluated at least 7 days after receipt of the third dose, compared with receiving only two doses at least 5 months ago, was estimated to be 93% (231 events for two doses vs 29 events for three doses; 95% CI 88C97) for admission to hospital, 92% (157 vs 17 events; 82C97) for severe disease, and 81% (44 vs seven events; 59C97) for COVID-19-related death.

METHODS Cleaned lead wires (N = 320) from critical care and telemetry units, emergency departments, and operating rooms of 4 hospitals were swabbed and the specimens cultured for microbial growth. Bacterial species were grouped by their risk for human infection: at risk (n = 9), potential risk (n = 5), and no risk (n = 10). Work environments were compared by using pairwise contrasts from a generalized estimating equation model. RESULTS Fungi were rare (0.6%). Of 226 cultures from 201 wires (62.8%) with bacterial growth, 121 were of at- or potential-risk bacteria (37.8%). Urban hospitals had less growth (P  .001) and fewer bacterial species per wire (P  .001) than did community hospitals. Presence of any bacteria (P = .02) and number of bacterial species per wire (P = .002) were lowest in operating rooms; emergency departments and telemetry units had more growth than did critical care units.

Its high infection rate and rapid spread contribute to set the risk for relevant psychological stress in citizens. In this context, mother-infant health is at risk not only because of potential direct exposure to the virus but also due to high levels of stress experienced by mothers from conception to delivery. Prenatal stress exposure associates with less-than-optimal child developmental outcomes, and specific epigenetic mechanisms (eg, DNA methylation) may play a critical role in mediating this programming association. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We present the methodological protocol for a longitudinal, multicentric study on the behavioural and epigenetic effects of COVID-19-related prenatal stress in a cohort of mother-infant dyads in Northern Italy. The dyads will be enrolled at 10 facilities in Northern Italy. Saliva samples will be collected at birth to assess the methylation status of specific genes linked with stress regulation in mothers and newborns. Mothers will provide retrospective data on COVID-19-related stress during pregnancy. At 3, 6 and 12 months, mothers will provide data on child behavioural and socioemotional outcomes, their own psychological status (stress, depressive and anxious symptoms) and coping strategies. At 12 months, infants and mothers will be videotaped during semistructured interaction to assess maternal sensitivity and infant's relational functioning.

To assess and critically evaluate how EMA methods are currently being used in HIV research, we systematically reviewed recent published literature (October 2017-October 2019) and searched select conference databases for 2018 and 2019. RECENT FINDINGS Our searches identified 8 published articles that used EMA via smartphone app, a handheld Personal Digital Assistant, and web-based survey programs for real-time measurement of HIV-related exposures and outcomes in behavioral research. Overall trends include use of EMA and technology devices to address substance use, HIV primary prevention (e.g., condom use and preexposure prophylaxis), and HIV treatment (medication adherence).

The highly oxidizing, charge-separated state generated within its reaction center (RC) drives water oxidation. Spectroscopic studies on PS II RCs are difficult to interpret due to large spectral congestion, necessitating modeling to elucidate key spectral features. Herein, we present results from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations on the largest PS II RC model reported to date. This model explicitly includes six RC chromophores and both the chlorin phytol chains and the amino acid residues <6 ? from the pigments' porphyrin ring centers. Comparing our wild-type model results with calculations on mutant D1-His-198-Ala and D2-His-197-Ala RCs, our simulated absorption-difference spectra reproduce experimentally observed shifts in known chlorophyll absorption bands, demonstrating the predictive capabilities of this model. We find that inclusion of both nearby residues and phytol chains is necessary to reproduce this behavior. Our calculations provide a unique opportunity to observe the molecular orbitals that contribute to the excited states that are precursors to CS. Strikingly, we observe two high oscillator strength, low-lying states, in which molecular orbitals are delocalized over ChlD1 and PheD1 as well as one weaker oscillator strength state with molecular orbitals delocalized over the P chlorophylls. Both these configurations are a match for previously identified exciton-charge transfer states (ChlD1 +PheD1 -)* and (PD2 +PD1 -)*. Our results demonstrate the power of TDDFT as a tool, for studies of natural photosynthesis, or indeed future studies of artificial photosynthetic complexes.","output":"A TDDFT investigation of the Photosystem II reaction center: Insights into the precursors to charge separation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Across the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected economically disadvantaged groups.

Inequalities in isolation behavior are less important but non-negligible, while access to testing and contract-tracing plays practically no role because it is too slow to contain the virus.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 66 hemodialysis patients with confirmed COVID-19 from 1 January to 5 March 2020; the final date of follow-up was 25 March 2020. RESULTS: The clinical data were collected from 66 hemodialysis patients with confirmed COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 in our center was 11.0% (66/602), of which 18 patients died. According to different prognosis, hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 were divided into the survival and death group. A higher incidence of fever and dyspnea was found in the death group compared with the survival group. Meanwhile, patients in the death group were often accompanied by higher white blood cell count, prolonged PT time, increased D-dimer (p < .05). More patients in the death group showed hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes damage. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis suggested that fever, dyspnea, and elevated D-dimer were independent risk factors for death in hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 (OR, 1.077; 95% CI, 1.014 to 1.439; p = .044; OR, 1.146; 95% CI, 1.026 to 1.875; p = .034, OR, 4.974; 95% CI, 3.315 to 6.263; p = .007, respectively).

Parents were interviewed 12 months after hospitalisation to check whether their infants experienced recurrent wheezing. The rate of recurrent wheezing was higher in infants with bronchiolitis than in controls (52.7 versus 10.3%; p<0.001). Multivariate analysis identified rhinovirus (RV) infection (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.0-11.1) followed by a positive family history for asthma (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-4.9) as major independent risk factors for recurrent wheezing.

The choice of strategies is based on applying optimization and decision-making methods to select the most appropriate cable network design considering criteria established by the problem definition. However, this definition is itself a decision problem that has not received analysis in the literature. In particular, one of the most important questions is the necessity to define an expansion strategy. The first alternative (expansion) is to design a network to serve consumers with Internet demand equal to or greater than the predefined one to expand the network annually to serve consumers that reach the predefined Internet speed. The second alternative (oversizing) is to design a network to serve consumers with future Internet demand (after 5 years) at or above that the predefined one. Considering this, the objective of this research is to define the most advantageous strategy of expansion planning to attend a 5 years forecasted Internet demand, considering: (1) the possibility of utilizing a Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network technology; (2) the application of the minimal Steiner tree and Dijkstra algorithms in planning procedures; (3) the influence of economic and technological factors on the demand forecast; (4) the aggressive, moderate, and conservative scenarios in decision-making.

We aimed to determine if preoxygenation with non-invasive ventilation was more efficient than high-flow oxygen in reducing the risk of severe hypoxaemia during intubation. METHODS The FLORALI-2 multicentre, open-label trial was done in 28 intensive care units in France. Adult patients undergoing tracheal intubation for acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (a partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO2] to fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2] ratio of 300 mm Hg) were randomly assigned (1:1; block size, four participants) to non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen during preoxygenation, with stratification by PaO2/FiO2 ratio (200 mm Hg vs >200 mm Hg). Key exclusion criteria were intubation for cardiac arrest, altered consciousness (defined as a Glasgow coma score of less than eight points), other contraindications to non-invasive ventilation (recent laryngeal, oesophageal, or gastric surgery, and substantial facial fractures), pulse oximetry not available, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and refusal to participate. The primary outcome was the occurrence of severe hypoxaemia (pulse oximetry <80%) during the procedure, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02668458. FINDINGS Between April 15, 2016, and Jan 8, 2017, 2079 patients were intubated in the 28 participating units, and 322 were enrolled. We excluded five patients with no recorded data, two who withdrew consent or were under legal protection, one who was not intubated, and one who had a cardiac arrest. Of the 313 patients included in the intention-to-treat analysis, 142 were assigned to non-invasive ventilation and 171 to high-flow oxygen therapy. Severe hypoxaemia occurred in 33 (23%) of 142 patients after preoxygenation with non-invasive ventilation and 47 (27%) of 171 with high-flow oxygen (absolute difference -42%, 95% CI -137 to 55; p=039). In the 242 patients with moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia (PaO2/FiO2 200 mm Hg), severe hypoxaemia occurred less frequently after preoxygenation with non-invasive ventilation than with high-flow oxygen (28 [24%] of 117 patients vs 44 [35%] of 125; adjusted odds ratio 056, 032 to 099, p=00459). Serious adverse events did not differ between treatment groups, with the most common immediate complications being systolic arterial hypotension (70 [49%] patients in the non-invasive ventilation group vs 86 [50%] patients in the high-flow oxygen group) and chest infiltrate on x-ray (28 [20%] vs 33 [19%]), and the most common late complications being death at day 28 (53 [37%] vs 58 [34%]) and ventilator-associated pneumonia during ICU stay (31 [22%] vs 35 [20%]). INTERPRETATION In patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, preoxygenation with non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy did not change the risk of severe hypoxaemia. Future research should explore the effect of preoxygenation method in patients with moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia at baseline.

RESULTS: During this period, the FDA issued 3,139 Warning Letters of which 98 (3.14%) of these were focused on COVID-19-related drugs, devices, biologics, and dietary supplements (products and ingredients). Specifically, these Warning Letters revealed regulatory nonconformities involving 40 identified herbs, 22 minerals/compounds, 6 devices and biologicals, and 3 vitamins. Products included hand sanitizers; COVID-19 antibody test kits; herbal teas and tinctures; nasal gel; toothpaste; and 1 vaccine. Nine Warning Letters were issued for products being sold via the Amazon online shopping platform. CONCLUSION: A small percentage of FDA Warning Letters recently have been focused on COVID-19. These Letters expose the blatant and potentially harmful quackery of vendors across the world who prioritize financial gain over clinical beneficence. Patient history-taking should include queries about non-traditional and unapproved products to identify, document, and report potentially harmful quackery.

However, an economic depression is following due to the forced absence of worker from their job and to the closure of many productive activities. For these reasons, governments are lessening progressively the mass quarantine measures to avoid an economic catastrophe. However, most people has not been yet exposed to the virus, so are susceptible to Covid-19. Therefore, the reopening of firms and commercial activities might lead to a resurgence of infection, as already reported in South Korea and in China were epidemic was considered almost gone although in a few of cases. In the worst-case scenario, this might impose the return to strict lockdown measures.

However, molecular mechanisms underlying the autoimmunity remain to be fully elucidated. Even though toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like2 (Nrf2) pathways are implicated in autoimmune diseases (ADs), interplay of OS, TLR and Nrf2 in TCE-mediated autoimmune response remains unexplored. This study was, therefore, undertaken to clearly establish a link among OS, TLR4 and Nrf2 pathways in TCE-induced autoimmunity. Groups of female MRL+/+ mice were treated with TCE, sulforaphane (SFN, an antioxidant) or TCE + SFN (TCE, 10 mmol/kg, i.p., every 4th day; SFN, 8 mg/kg, i.p., every other day) for 6 weeks. TCE exposure led to greater formation of serum 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE)-protein adducts, HNE-specific circulating immune complexes (CICs) and protein carbonyls which were associated with significant increases in serum antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). Moreover, incubation of splenocytes from TCE-treated mice with HNE-modified proteins resulted in enhanced splenocyte proliferation and cytokine release evidenced by increased expression of cyclin D3, Cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) and phospho-pRb as well as increased release of IL-6, TNF- and INF-. More importantly, TCE exposure resulted in increased expression of TLR4, MyD88, IRAK4, NF-kB and reduced expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in the spleen. Remarkably, SFN supplementation not only attenuated TCE-induced OS, upregulation in TLR4 and NF-kB signaling and downregulation of Nrf2, but also ANA levels. These results, in addition to providing further support to a role of OS, also suggest that an interplay among OS, TLR4 and Nrf2 pathways contributes to TCE-mediated autoimmune response. Attenuation of TCE-mediated autoimmunity by SFN provides an avenue for preventive and/or therapeutic strategies for ADs involving OS.","output":"Interplay and roles of oxidative stress, toll-like receptor 4 and Nrf2 in trichloroethene-mediated autoimmunity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most of the success of electronic devices fabricated to actively interact with a biological environment relies on the proper choice of materials and efficient engineering of surfaces and interfaces.

Cardiac surgery is the only curative treatment. Little is known about patients with severe chronic RHD operated in LMICs, and challenges regarding postoperative follow-up are an important issue. At Tikur Anbessa Specialised Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, we aimed to evaluate the course and 12-month outcome of patients with severe chronic RHD who received open-heart surgery, as compared with the natural course of controls waiting for surgery and undergoing only medical treatment. METHODS: Clinical data and outcome measures were registered in 46 patients operated during five missions from March 2016 to November 2019, and compared with the first-year course in a cohort of 49 controls from the same hospitals waiting list for surgery. Adverse events were death or complications such as stroke, other thromboembolic events, bleeding, hospitalisation for heart failure and infectious endocarditis. RESULTS: Survival at 12 months was 89% and survival free from complications was 80% in the surgical group. Despite undergoing open-heart surgery, with its inherent risks, outcome measures of the surgical group were non-inferior to the natural course of the control group in the first year after inclusion on the waiting list (p0.45).

METHODS: We measured proET-1 in 74 consecutively admitted adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 and compared its prognostic accuracy to that of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (n = 876) and viral bronchitis (n = 371) from a previous study by means of logistic regression analysis.

RESULTS: Overall, median admission proET-1 levels were lower in COVID-19 patients compared to those with pneumonia and exacerbated bronchitis, respectively (57.0 pmol/l vs. 113.0 pmol/l vs. 96.0 pmol/l, p < 0.01). Although COVID-19 non-survivors had 1.5-fold higher admission proET-1 levels compared to survivors (81.8 pmol/l [IQR: 76 to 118] vs. 53.6 [IQR: 37 to 69]), no significant association of proET-1 levels and mortality was found in a regression model adjusted for age, gender, creatinine level, diastolic blood pressure as well as cancer and coronary artery disease (adjusted OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.0009 to 14.7).

Effective respiratory hygiene in the ED is imperative to limit the spread of dangerous respiratory pathogens, including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and bioterrorism agents, particularly given that these agents may not be immediately identifiable. Sustaining effective respiratory control measures is especially challenging in the ED because of patient crowding, inadequate staffing and resources, and ever-increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients.

The development of novel ACT approaches led researchers and clinicians to highly efficient technologies based on genetically engineered T lymphocytes, with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells as the most prominent example. CARs consist of an extracellular domain that represents the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) responsible for target recognition and the intracellular domain, which was built from up to several signaling motifs that mediated T cell activation. The number of potential targets amenable for CAR-T cell therapy is expanding rapidly, which means that the tremendous success of this approach in oncology could be further translated to treating other diseases.

This study investigated podiatrist's perceptions and satisfaction surrounding mandatory CPD requirements following the implementation of a new 2-year CPD programme. METHODS A cross-sectional study of NZ registered podiatrists was conducted between October 9th and December 9th, 2020. Data was collected using a web-based survey. The 39-item survey included questions to elicit participant characteristics, perceptions of CPD, difficulties undertaking CPD, and satisfaction with the new CPD programme. The survey findings were reported using descriptive statistics and conventional content analysis. RESULTS One hundred and thirty-four podiatrists completed the survey. Most respondents worked in private practice (n = 107, 80 %), were in full-time employment (n = 83, 62 %), and had greater than 16 years of work experience (n = 73, 54 %). Respondents agreed it was important to engage in CPD (n = 126, 94 %) and reported that knowledge gained from CPD contributed to their daily work (n = 78, 58 %). 44 % (n = 58) reported difficulties keeping up to date with CPD. The main barriers to CPD participation reported were workload (n = 90, 67 %) and lack of time (n = 84, 63 %). Three categories (understanding the CPD programme; access to CPD; and time to complete CPD) were identified from the qualitative analysis to describe why it was difficult to meet CPD requirements. CONCLUSIONS NZ podiatrists value CPD and are satisfied with most aspects of the mandatory CPD programme apart from the hours attributed to compulsory activities. The current approach to cultural safety CPD requires revision, with a move away from a time-based approach to a system that promotes an understanding and relevance to practice. Lack of time, practice workload, financial barriers, geographical location, and employment context were factors that influenced a practitioner's ability to engage in CPD. Facilitation of CPD activities that are flexible to ensure relevance to the practitioner's specific work within their scope of practice, and that can occur in the workplace environment, may address barriers and increase engagement with to CPD activities.","output":"Perceptions and satisfaction of a mandatory continuing professional development programme amongst Aotearoa New Zealand podiatrists."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, non-pharmaceutical protective measures taken by individuals remain pivotal.

The study was preregistered at OSF. The model explains 69% of the variance for behavioural intention, which is strongly correlated with behaviour ( = 0.84). The most influential predictor for protective behaviour is its perceived efficacy, followed by normative beliefs and perceptions about costs for protective behaviour. Distrusting beliefs in science and scientists negatively predicted response perceptions and were also strongly and negatively correlated with behaviour. Knowledge about COVID-19 was weakly linked with perceived response efficacy, as well as with behaviour.

METHODS: In the phase 3 portion of BLAZE-1 (NCT04427501), symptomatic patients with increased risk for severe COVID-19 were randomized (2:1) to a single infusion of 700 mg bamlanivimab and 1400 mg etesevimab or placebo. Hospitalization events, vital signs, and symptomatology were monitored throughout the trial. RESULTS: Overall, 769 patients were randomized to bamlanivimab and etesevimab together (n = 511) or placebo (n = 258). The time to sustained symptom resolution was significantly shorter among patients who received bamlanivimab and etesevimab compared with placebo (8 vs 10 days; P < .01). The median time to first sustained symptom resolution of body aches and pain, chills, fatigue, feeling feverish, headache, and shortness of breath was significantly different in patients receiving bamlanivimab and etesevimab compared to placebo (P < .05).

METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify distinct latent groups of internet users based on their PIU risk and to compare their psychosocial outcomes. To achieve this, a nationally representative sample of adolescents of the same grade (N = 1,066, Mean(age) = 13.46 years, range = 12C16) was recruited from several schools in Slovenia through stratified random sampling. RESULTS: A Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) revealed a two-class solution, with Class 1 (n = 853, 80%) featuring low PIU risk participants and Class 2 (n = 213, 20%) including high PIU risk participants. Behaviorally, the main feature of Class 1 denoted time management difficulties while Class 2 was best characterized by mood and time management issues. Further frequentist and Bayesian analyses indicated that Class 2 presented greater psychosocial risk compared to Class 1 due to significantly higher levels of PIU (generalized and across specific PIU subfactors) coupled with lower levels of subjective well-being and self-control. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to what was initially envisaged, the two classes did not differ in terms of perceived quality in parent-child relationship.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA The use of lightweight meshes in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair could have beneficial effects on quality of life and preservation of the spermatic structures due to a decreased foreign-body reaction. METHODS A total of 59 male patients planned for primary, unilateral or bilateral inguinal hernia repair were randomized between a standard polypropylene (Marlex) or lightweight mesh (Vypro II, TiMesh). Main outcome measures were fertility aspects, assessed preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up by semen analysis and scrotal ultrasonography. Secondary outcomes were quality of life (SF-36 and McGill Pain Questionnaire) and recurrence up to 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS Patients operated on with a VyproII or TiMesh mesh exhibited a decreased sperm motility (vs. preoperatively) compared with Marlex patients, respectively -9.5% and -5.5% versus +2% (P = 0.013). When the results after uni- and bilateral hernia repair were analyzed separately, this difference only remained significant in the bilateral hernia subgroup: -10% for VyproII and -17% for TiMesh versus +1% for Marlex (P = 0.037). Other fertility parameters (sperm concentration, morphology, and alpha-glucosidase level) were unchanged. There were no differences at any study point between the 3 groups regarding quality of life. Only for resumption of sport activities was a small advantage noted for VyproII versus Marlex patients (P = 0.045). After 1 year, no recurrences were observed; 3 patients (6%) complained of chronic disabling pain. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that the use of lightweight meshes for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair in male patients negatively influences sperm motility, without any benefit on quality of life. These alterations might be important in a subgroup of young male patients operated on laparoscopically for a bilateral hernia.

New-onset neurologic events as assessed by neurology consultants based on manifestations, clinical examination and investigations, in which critical events included disorders of consciousness, stroke, CNS infection, seizures and status epilepticus. RESULTS We enrolled 917 people with average age 48.7 years and 55% were male. The frequency of new onset critical neurologic events was 3.5% (32/917) overall and 9.4% (30/319) among those with severe or critical COVID-19. These were impaired consciousness (n=25) or/and stroke (n=10). The risk of critical neurologic events was highly associated with age above 60 years and previous history of neurological conditions. Non-critical events were seen in less than 1% (7/917), including muscle cramp, unexplained headache, occipital neuralgia, tic and tremor. Brain CT in 28 people led to new findings in nine. Findings from lumbar puncture in three with suspected CNS infection, unexplained headache or severe occipital neuralgia were unremarkable. CONCLUSIONS People with COVID-19 aged over 60 and neurologic comorbidities were at higher risk of developing critical neurologic impairment, mainly impaired consciousness and cerebrovascular accidents.

Moving forward, the lack of access to clean water, which threatens human health and strains precious energy resources, will worsen as the climate changes. Therefore, future innovations that produce potable water from contaminated sources must be sustainable. Inspired by nature, a solar absorber gel (SAG) is developed to purify water from contaminated sources using only natural sunlight. The SAG is composed of an elastic thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) hydrogel, a photothermal polydopamine (PDA) layer, and a sodium alginate (SA) network. Production of the SAG is facile; all processing is aqueous-based and occurs at room temperature. Remarkably, the SAG can purify water from various harmful reservoirs containing small molecules, oils, metals, and pathogens, using only sunlight. The SAG relies on solar energy to drive a hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase transformation at the lower critical solution temperature. Since the purification mechanism does not require water evaporation, an energy-intensive process, the passive solar water-purification rate is the highest reported. This discovery can be transformative in the sustainable production of clean water to improve the quality of human life.","output":"A Bioinspired Elastic Hydrogel for Solar-Driven Water Purification."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective and available therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 disease are limited.

However, the effect of the B.1.617.2 variant on disease severity remains unclear. This study aims to assess whether infection with the B.1.617.2 variant was associated with a higher risk of serious illness, compared with other co-circulating variants, measured through hospitalization and death by COVID-19 in Portugal. Methods We conducted a matched cohort study in adult individuals diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection between March 29 and August 1, 2021. Cases were individuals with a positive PCR test notified to the surveillance system. SARS-CoV-2 variants were classified first by genomic sequencing (WGS) and, if this information was unavailable, by detecting the S gene target failure. Delta (B.1.617.2) and Alpha (B.1.1.7) cases were matched on the week of diagnosis at a 1 to k ratio (k being the maximum number of unexposed available in that week) to maximize the inclusion of unexposed, using the nearest-neighbor algorithm. The hazard risk and 95% confidence intervals of hospitalization and death among those infected with the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant vs. Alpha (B.1.1.7) was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for confounding for sex, age, and vaccination status. Results A total of 2,778 cases were included in the study. Of the total, 1 742 (68%) were identified as B.1.617.2 variant cases and 3 629 (32%) as B.1.1.7 variant. Within the B.1.1.7 variant cases 106 (2.9%) were hospitalized, and 110 (6.3%) within the B.1.617.2 variant cases. A total of 29 deaths were reported, 8 (0.2%) in patients infected with B.1.1.7 variant and 21 (1.2%) in patients with the B.1.617.2 variant.

During a pandemic, the researches aimed at finding the new treatments for SARS-CoV-2 become relevant. The review focuses on studies of androgens and antiandrogens in this disease. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, it has been noted that men have more severe forms of infection and higher mortality. The main cause of both the severity of the disease and the high mortality of men from COVID-19 are associated with androgens. It was found that patients receiving androgen deprivation are less likely to become infected and easily tolerate COVID-19. The researchers explain the effect of the therapy by the effect on the TMPRSS2 protein. It was found that both TMPRSS2 expression and a more severe course of coronavirus infection are observed in men with hyperandrogenism - androgenic alopecia, acne, excessive facial hair growth and increased skin oiliness. In this regard, some researchers suggest to use androgen deprivation for men at high risk of developing COVID-19. Steroid and non-steroidal antiandrogens are used for androgen deprivation. At the same time, obtaned scientific data on the relationship of severe forms and mortality of COVID-19 with low testosterone levels leads to a hypothesis about the possibility of a positive effect not of androgen devrivation therapy but of androgen replacement therapy in case of hypogonadism have diagnosed.

The antibacterial effect was studied using serial dilution technique to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of nanoparticles. Results demonstrated that physicochemical properties of nanoparticles were affected by the above mentioned parameters where nanoscale size particles ranging from 175 to 212 nm were achieved. The highest encapsulation efficiency (53.2  2.4%) was obtained when the ratio of drug to polymer was 1:4. Zeta potential of the developed nanoparticles was fairly negative (-111.5). In-vitro release profile of nanoparticles showed two phases: an initial phase of burst release for 10 h followed by a slow release pattern up to the end. The antimicrobial results revealed that the nanoparticles were more effective than pure GLA against P. aeuroginosa, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. This improvement in antibacterial activity of GLA loaded nanoparticles when compared to pure GLA may be related to higher nanoparticles penetration into infected cells and a higher amount of GLA delivery in its site of action.

METHODS Data were sourced from official government and industry reports to update previous estimates of use (as amount sold) of antimicrobial products applied to animals in New Zealand. The data included antimicrobial sales and animal populations, weighted where appropriate by breed and age class. Antimicrobial use was estimated based on the amount of active ingredient sold, per kg of animal biomass standardised to the probable weight at time of treatment or lifetime average but not slaughter weight (population correction unit; PCU). New Zealand data for 2017 and 2018 were adjusted to account only for antimicrobials used for farm animals by discounting horticulture use, companion animal use and export. RESULTS Between 2014 and 2018 the estimated usage of antimicrobials in animals flattened to a 5-year rolling average of 10.40 mg/PCU. New data on use for companion animals and on exports of zinc bacitracin and tylosin, included previously in the gross New Zealand values, allow a more refined estimate of use of antimicrobials in food animals of 10.21 mg/PCU in 2018, the third lowest rate of use for countries reporting by the same methodology. The intensive industries of pigs and poultry combined use more than 500 mg/PCU whereas the extensive red meat and dairy industries use an estimated 6.25 mg/PCU. New Zealand uses proportionally more cephalosporins and macrolides, two of the critically important antimicrobial groups, when compared with European countries, but less quinolones. The most obvious difference is the extensive use of zinc bacitracin and tylosin fed to pigs and poultry in New Zealand but not in the European Union. CONCLUSIONS Use of antimicrobials in food animals has stabilised to a rate of approximately 10.2 mg/PCU. This baseline should be used by the animal health industry to measure future success in its efforts to reduce and make more refined use of antimicrobial drugs as New Zealand works to deliver the government's Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plan. High rates of use of zinc bacitracin and some critically important macrolides represent clear targets in attempts to reduce usage.

This study aimed to compare different outcomes of large cohorts of patients undergoing bilateral versus unilateral TEP. METHODS Based on prospective data of the Swiss Association of Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgery (SALTS), all patients undergoing elective unilateral or bilateral TEP from 1995 to 2006 were included in the study. The outcomes compared included conversion rates; intraoperative, surgical, and general postoperative complications; duration of operation; and length of hospital stay (LOS). Unadjusted and risk-adjusted multivariable analyses were performed. RESULTS Data for 6,505 patients undergoing unilateral (n = 3,457) and bilateral (n = 3,048) TEP were prospectively collected. The average age and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score were similar in the two groups. The patients undergoing bilateral TEP repair had a slightly increased rate of intraoperative complications (bilateral, 3.1% vs. unilateral, 1.9%) and surgical postoperative complications (bilateral, 3.2% vs. unilateral, 2.3%). The operation time was longer for bilateral TEP repair (86 vs. 67 min). No significant differences in postoperative LOS, general postoperative complications, or conversion rates were found. CONCLUSIONS This is the first population-based analysis in the literature to compare different outcomes in a prospective cohort of more than 6,500 patients undergoing bilateral versus unilateral TEP. Although the rates for intraoperative and surgical postoperative complications were slightly higher for the patients undergoing bilateral TEP repair, the absolute differences were small and of minor clinical relevance. Bilateral TEP repair is associated with a minimal increase in operating time and similar LOS, general postoperative complications, and conversion rates. Therefore, for patients with bilateral inguinal hernia, a simultaneous endoscopic approach represents an excellent therapeutic option.","output":"Bilateral total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TEP) has outcomes similar to those for unilateral TEP: population-based analysis of prospective data of 6,505 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online reviews are considered as one of the most prevalent reference indicators for people to evaluate the quality of different products or services before purchasing.

Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and the enzyme proteases, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and FURIN, are needed for viral attachment and invasion into host cells. Methods. We examined microarray mRNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN in sputum, bronchial brushing and bronchial biopsies of the European U-BIOPRED cohort. Clinical parameters and molecular phenotypes, including asthma severity, sputum inflammatory cells, lung functions, oral corticosteroid (OCS) use, and transcriptomic-associated clusters, were examined in relation to gene expression levels. Results. ACE2 levels were significantly increased in sputum of severe asthma compared to mild-moderate asthma. In multivariate analyses, sputum ACE2 levels were positively associated with OCS use and male gender. Sputum FURIN levels were significantly related to neutrophils (%) and the presence of severe asthma. In bronchial brushing samples, TMPRSS2 levels were positively associated with male gender and body mass index, whereas FURIN levels with male gender and blood neutrophils. In bronchial biopsies, TMPRSS2 levels were positively related to blood neutrophils. The neutrophilic molecular phenotype characterised by high inflammasome activation expressed significantly higher FURIN levels in sputum than the eosinophilic Type 2-high or the pauci-granulocytic oxidative phosphorylation phenotypes. Conclusion. Levels of ACE2 and FURIN may differ by clinical or molecular phenotypes of asthma. Sputum FURIN expression levels were strongly associated with neutrophilic inflammation and with inflammasome activation. This might indicate the potential for a greater morbidity and mortality outcome from SARS-CoV-2 infection in neutrophilic severe asthma.","output":"Sputum ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN gene expression in severe neutrophilic asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to determine the proportion of individuals who reported the deterioration of physical and psychological health during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Taiwan.

In this way, the Government of the State of Mato Grosso do Sul has created an incentive program (Precoce MS) that stimulates producers to fit into production systems that lead to the slaughter of animals at young ages and superior carcass quality, towards a more sustainable production model. This work aims to build a classification model of carcass fatness degree using machine learning algorithms and to provide the cattle ranchers with indicators that help them to early finishing cattle with better carcass finishing. The dataset from Precoce MS contains twenty-nine different features with categorical and discrete data and size of 1.05 million cattle slaughter records. In the data mining process, the data were cleaned, transformed and reduced in order to extract patterns more efficiently. In the model selection step, the data was divided into five different datasets for performing cross-validation. The training set received [Formula: see text] of the data and the test set received the other [Formula: see text] , emphasizing that both had their data stratified respecting the percentage of each target class. The algorithms analyzed and tested in this work were Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier. In order to obtain a better classification, the recursive feature elimination and grid search techniques were used in the models with the objective of selecting better characteristics and obtaining better hyperparameters, respectively. The precision, recall and f1 score metrics were applied in the test set to confirm the choice of the model. Finally, analysis of variance ANOVA indicated that there are no significant differences between the models.

It inflames air sacs in lungs which fill with fluid which further leads to problems in respiration. Pneumonia is interpreted by radiologists by observing abnormality in lungs in case of fluid in Chest X-Rays. Computer Aided Detection Diagnosis (CAD) tools can assist radiologists by improving their diagnostic accuracy. Such CAD tools use neural networks which are trained on Chest X-Ray dataset to classify a Chest X-Ray into normal or infected with Pneumonia. Convolution neural networks have shown remarkable performance in object detection in an image. Quaternion Convolution neural network (QCNN) is a generalization of conventional convolution neural networks. QCNN treats all three channels (R, G, B) of color image as a single unit and it extracts better representative features and which further improves classification. In this paper, we have trained Quaternion residual network on a publicly available large Chest X-Ray dataset on Kaggle repository and obtained classification accuracy of 93.75% and F-score of .94.

However, the propensity to adhere to the vaccination program has struggled to take off. Moreover, complying with the restrictive rules and maintaining social distancing have been highly distressing for many individuals. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE Italian participants (N = 140, females = 65%, mean age = 29.50, SD = 10.80) were presented with an online survey consisting of multiple-choice questions and two single-category implicit association tests (SC-IATs). One SC-IAT evaluated the tendency of participants to automatically associate personal protective equipment (PPE) and vaccines with safety or danger;the other evaluated their tendency to automatically associate social situations with good or bad. Multiple-choice questions explored individual, social, and environmental factors that were expected to contribute to vaccine propensity, compliance with restrictive rules, and feelings of distress. RESULTS Using scientific information sources was related to implicitly associating PPE and vaccines with safety, which in turn was associated with the propensity to get the vaccine. Moreover, being female, young, unsatisfied with social relationships, having suffered health and economic consequences due to the pandemic, and having negative implicit attitudes toward social situations contributed to increasing feelings of distress. CONCLUSIONS Communication may contribute to individuals' behavior and preferences and it can also be associated with implicit attitudes, becoming consequently one of the main leverages to reduce vaccine hesitancy.

We have previously demonstrated in the MIA mouse model that maternal administration of H(2) attenuates oxidative damage and neuroinflammation, including induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglial activation, in the fetal brain. Short-term memory, sociability and social novelty, and sensorimotor gating were evaluated using the Y-maze, three-chamber, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) tests, respectively, at postnatal 3 or 4 weeks. The number of neurons and oligodendrocytes was also analyzed at postnatal 5 weeks by immunohistochemical analysis. Offspring of the LPS-exposed dams showed deficits in short-term memory and social interaction, following neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss in the amygdala and cortex. Maternal H(2) administration markedly attenuated these LPS-induced abnormalities. Moreover, we evaluated the effect of H(2) on LPS-induced astrocytic activation, both in vivo and in vitro. The number of activated astrocytes with hypertrophic morphology was increased in LPS-exposed offspring, but decreased in the offspring of H(2)-administered dams. In primary cultured astrocytes, LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines were attenuated by H(2) administration. Overall, these findings indicate that maternal H(2) administration exerts neuroprotective effects and ameliorates MIA-induced neurodevelopmental deficits of offspring later in life.","output":"Administration of molecular hydrogen during pregnancy improves behavioral abnormalities of offspring in a maternal immune activation model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the occurrence of coronavirus diseaseZOl9, the epidemic has progressed rapidly and seriously that threatened people's health.

Therefore, the present clinical trial study was done to assess the effects of naringenin supplementation on lipid profile, aminotransferase levels, severity of steatosis, as well as probability of fibrosis in overweight/obese patients with NAFLD. MATERIALS AND METHODS This placebo-controlled, parallel randomized, double-blind clinical trial study was conducted on 44 eligible overweight/obese patients with NAFLD (naringenin-treated group (n = 22), control group (n = 22)) referred to the national Iranian oil company (NIOC) Central Hospital, Tehran City, Tehran Province, Iran. Participants were randomly assigned to receive naringenin capsules (100 mg) and identical placebo capsules twice a day, before lunch and dinner, for 4 weeks. The primary outcomes were improvement of liver steatosis and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), and secondary outcomes included changes in levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lipid profile. RESULTS Naringenin consumption significantly reduced percentages of NAFLD grades (p < 0.001), as well as, serum levels of triglyceride (TG) (p < 0.001), total cholesterol (TC) (p = 0.01), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (p = 0.02), and increased serum level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (p = 0.02) compared to the control group. Even after adjusting for the confounders the results were significant. However, there were no significant changes in AST, ALT, and NFS. CONCLUSION Our findings revealed that daily intake of 200 mg of naringenin for 4 weeks had beneficial effects on lipid profile and percentages of NAFLD grades as an indicator for severity of hepatic steatosis. Although, NFS values and serum levels of aminotransferase enzymes including AST and ALT did not remarkably change.","output":"Does Naringenin Supplementation Improve Lipid Profile, Severity of Hepatic Steatosis, and Probability of Liver Fibrosis in Overweight/Obese Patients with NAFLD?

Right heart failure (RHF) has been mostly addressed in the context of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), where it is not possible to discern pulmonary vascular- and RV-directed effects of therapeutic approaches. In part, opposing pathomechanisms in RV and pulmonary vasculature, i.e., regarding apoptosis, angiogenesis and proliferation, complicate addressing RHF in PAH. Therapy effective for left heart failure is not applicable to RHF, e.g., inhibition of adrenoceptor signaling and of the renin-angiotensin system had no or only limited success. A number of experimental studies employing animal models for PAH or RV dysfunction or failure have identified beneficial effects of novel pharmacological agents, with most promising results obtained with modulators of metabolism and reactive oxygen species or inflammation, respectively. In addition, established PAH agents, in particular phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, may directly address RV integrity. Promising results are furthermore derived with microRNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) blocking or mimetic strategies, which can target microvascular rarefaction, inflammation, metabolism or fibrotic and hypertrophic remodeling in the dysfunctional RV. Likewise, pre-clinical data demonstrate that cell-based therapies using stem or progenitor cells have beneficial effects on the RV, mainly by improving the microvascular system, however clinical success will largely depend on delivery routes. A particular option for PAH is targeted denervation of the pulmonary vasculature, given the sympathetic overdrive in PAH patients. Finally, acute and durable mechanical circulatory support are available for the right heart, which however has been tested mostly in RHF with concomitant left heart disease.

Until safe and efficacious vaccines or antiviral drugs become widely available, viral testing remains the primary mitigation measure for rapid identification and isolation of infected individuals. We aimed to assess the economic trade-offs of expanding and accelerating testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across the USA in different transmission scenarios. METHODS: We used a multiscale model that incorporates SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the population level and daily viral load dynamics at the individual level to assess eight surveillance testing strategies that varied by testing frequency (from daily to monthly testing) and isolation period (1 or 2 weeks), compared with the status-quo strategy of symptom-based testing and isolation. For each testing strategy, we first estimated the costs (incorporating costs of diagnostic testing and admissions to hospital, and salary lost while in isolation) and years of life lost (YLLs) prevented under rapid and low transmission scenarios. We then assessed the testing strategies across a range of scenarios, each defined by effective reproduction number (Re), willingness to pay per YLL averted, and cost of a test, to estimate the probability that a particular strategy had the greatest net benefit. Additionally, for a range of transmission scenarios (Re from 11 to 3), we estimated a threshold test price at which the status-quo strategy outperforms all testing strategies considered. FINDINGS: Our modelling showed that daily testing combined with a 2-week isolation period was the most costly strategy considered, reflecting increased costs with greater test frequency and length of isolation period. Assuming a societal willingness to pay of US$100a000 per YLL averted and a price of $5 per test, the strategy most likely to be cost-effective under a rapid transmission scenario (Re of 22) is weekly testing followed by a 2-week isolation period subsequent to a positive test result. Under low transmission scenarios (Re of 12), monthly testing of the population followed by 1-week isolation rather than 2-week isolation is likely to be most cost-effective. Expanded surveillance testing is more likely to be cost-effective than the status-quo testing strategy if the price per test is less than $75 across all transmission rates considered. INTERPRETATION: Extensive expansion of SARS-CoV-2 testing programmes with more frequent and rapid tests across communities coupled with isolation of individuals with confirmed infection is essential for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, resources recouped from shortened isolation duration could be cost-effectively allocated to more frequent testing.

FirstMIND (NCT04134936) is a Phase Ib, open-label, randomized study of tafa + R-CHOP or tafa + LEN + R-CHOP in newly diagnosed DLBCL. Methods: Eligible pts were 18 years, treatmentna?ve, with histologically confirmed DLBCL not otherwise specified, international prognostic index (IPI) 2-5 and ECOG performance status (PS) 0-2. Pts with known double-or triple-hit and transformed lymphoma were excluded. Treatment (Tx) comprised six 21-day cycles of tafa (12 mg/kg IV, Day [D] 1, 8, 15) + R-CHOP (arm A) or tafa (12 mg/kg IV, D1, 8, 15) + LEN (25 mg orally, D1-10) + R-CHOP (arm B). G-CSF and VTE prophylaxis was mandatory. Primary objective is safety;secondary objectives are ORR, PET-CR rate at end of Tx, PFS, long-term safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity. Results: From Dec 2019 to Aug 2020, 83 pts were screened in Europe and the US;66 were randomized (33 per arm). Data cut-off for this analysis: 9 Dec 2020;study is ongoing. Median age was 64.5 years (range 20-86). Overall, 30% (20/66) of pts were 70 years and many had high-risk disease: IPI 2 29%, IPI 3 46%, IPI 4 26%. ECOG PS: 47% of pts were ECOG PS 0, 44% PS 1, 9% PS 2. Most pts had stage III/IV disease (92%);46% had bulky disease. All pts experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). Grade 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 54.5% and 12.1% (arm A) and 66.7% and 30.3% (arm B) of pts, respectively (Table). Serious TEAEs occurred in 42.4% (arm A) and 51.5% (arm B) of pts. There were three deaths, unrelated to tafa and/or LEN (sepsis, urosepsis, and COVID-19 pneumonia).

If the effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine was launched on market, 420 (83%) of pediatrician accepted to get vaccine shot, 422 (83%) of them recommended vaccination to their family members, 380 (75%) of them accepted to vaccine their children and 445 (85%) of them offered vaccination to their pediatric patients. Among the participated pediatricians 304 (60%) of them thought COVID-19 vaccine should be mandatory. We found that there are high COVID-19 vaccine willingness rates for pediatricians for themselves, their own children, family members and their pediatric patients. We also found that being a pediatric subspecialist, believing in achieving an effective vaccine, willingness to participate in the phase 1-2 clinical vaccine trial, willingness to get an influenza shot this season, believing a vaccine and vaccine passport should be mandatory were significant factors in accepting the vaccine. It is important to share all information about COVID-19 vaccines, especially effectiveness and safety, with the public in a clear communication and transparency. The opposite will contribute to vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccine movement.","output":"Pediatricians' COVID-19 experiences and views on the willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccines: a cross-sectional survey in Turkey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes de COVID-19 disease use as a principal receptor the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). It has been suggested that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) can be another possible receptor for this virus. The present study aimed to establish if the DPP4 levels and DPP4 polymorphisms are associated with COVID-19 disease and its severity. METHODS: The study included 107 COVID-19 patients and 263 matched-healthy controls. Fifty patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. The DPP4 was quantified in serum using the Bioplex system. Based on the previous results and the functional prediction analysis, we select for the study 5 DPP4 polymorphisms (rs12617336, rs12617656, rs1558957, rs3788979, and rs17574) and these were determined using the 5exonuclease TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Low levels of DPP4 were observed in COVID-19 patients (46.5 [33.1-57.7] ng/mL) when compared to healthy controls (125.3 [100.3-157.3] ng/mL) (P < 0.0001). Also, patients that required mechanical ventilation showed lower DPP4 levels (42.8 [29.8-56.9] ng/mL) than those that did not need this procedure (49.2 [39.9-65.6] ng/mL) (P = 0.012). DPP4 levels correlated negatively with age, fibrinogen, and platelet levels, and positively with albumin, alanine aminotransferase, and percentage of neutrophils. The DPP4 rs3788979 polymorphism was associated with a high risk of COVID-19 disease and, the TT genotype carriers had the lowest DPP4 levels. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, in the present study, an association of low levels of DPP4 with COVID-19 disease and severity was found. The association of the DPP4 rs3788979 polymorphism with COVID-19 is also reported.","output":"Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 levels and DPP4 gene polymorphisms in patients with COVID-19.

PURPOSE: Automatic therapeutic substitution (ATS) protocols are formulary tools that allow for provider-selected interchange from a nonformulary preadmission medication to a formulary equivalent. Previous studies have demonstrated that the application of clinical decision support (CDS) tools to ATS can decrease ATS errors at admission, but there are limited data describing the impact of CDS on discharge errors. The objective of this study was to describe the impact of CDS-supported interchanges on discharge prescription duplications or omissions. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted at an academic medical center. Patients admitted between June 2017 and August 2019 were included if they were 18 years or older at admission, underwent an ATS protocol-approved interchange for 1 of the 9 included medication classes, and had a completed discharge medication reconciliation. The primary outcome was difference in incidence of therapeutic duplication or omission at discharge between the periods before and after CDS implementation. RESULTS: A total of 737 preimplementation encounters and 733 postimplementation encounters were included. CDS did not significantly decrease the incidence of discharge duplications or omissions (12.1% vs 11.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.3% to 4.2%) nor the incidence of admission duplication or inappropriate reconciliation (21.4% vs 20.7%; 95% CI, -3.4% to 4.8%) when comparing the pre- and postimplementation periods. Inappropriate reconciliation was the primary cause of discharge medication errors for both groups. CONCLUSION: CDS implementation was not associated with a decrease in discharge omissions, duplications, or inappropriate reconciliation. Findings highlight the need for thoughtful medication reconciliation at the point of discharge.","output":"Impact of clinical decision support therapeutic interchanges on hospital discharge medication omissions and duplications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Apnea of prematurity cannot be reliably measured with current monitoring techniques. Instead, indirect parameters such as oxygen desaturation or bradycardia are captured. We propose a Kalman filter-based detection of respiration activity and hence apnea using multichannel esophageal signals in neonatal intensive care unit patients. METHODS: We performed a single-center observational study with moderately preterm infants. Commercially available nasogastric feeding tubes containing multiple electrodes were used to capture signals with customized software. Multichannel esophageal raw signals were manually annotated, processed using extended Kalman filter, and compared with standard monitoring data including chest impedance to measure respiration activity. RESULTS: Out of a total of 405.4 h captured signals in 13 infants, 100 episodes of drop in oxygen saturation or heart rate were examined. Median (interquartile range) difference in respiratory rate was 0.04 (?2.45 to 1.48)/min between esophageal measurements annotated manually and with Kalman filter and ?3.51 (?7.05 to ?1.33)/min when compared to standard monitoring, suggesting an underestimation of respiratory rate when using the latter. CONCLUSIONS: Kalman filter-based estimation of respiratory activity using multichannel esophageal signals is safe and feasible and results in respiratory rate closer to visual annotation than that derived from chest impedance of standard monitoring.","output":"Multichannel esophageal signals to monitor respiratory rate in preterm infants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic led to significant uncertainty among physicians and patients about the safety of immunosuppressive medications used for the management of dermatologic conditions.

In the absence of data on the effect of immunosuppressants on COVID-19, these data could be used to make clinical decisions on initiation and continuation of immunosuppressive medications during this pandemic. In summary, we recommend considering the discontinuation of oral JAK inhibitors and prednisone, considering the delay of rituximab infusion, and the careful continuation of cyclosporine, mycophenolate, azathioprine, methotrexate, and biologics in patients currently benefitting from such treatments.","output":"Evidenced-based best practice advice for patients treated with systemic immunosuppressants in relation to COVID-19()()()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION This study assessed the influence of High (H, 4.13%), Medium (M, 2.0%) and Low (L, 0.1%) doses of menthol on temperature perception and regulation, compared to a Placebo Condition (P). METHOD Sixteen participants underwent the aforementioned conditions on four separate days. During each test participants rested supine (Environmental conditions: 30 C, 50% rh) for 30-min before 40 mL of L, M, H or P gel was applied to the anterior upper body, then rested 30-min thereafter. Primary measures included thermal sensation (TS), thermal comfort (TC), irritation (IRR), rectal temperature (Tre), and skin temperature (chest, forearm, thigh, calf), and EMG (trapezius, pectoralis major, sternocleidomastoid). The area under the curve (AUC) from minute 30 to 60 was compared between conditions using relevant non/parametric tests (alpha level = 0.05). RESULTS A cooling trend in Tre was observed following Placebo gel application, but this significantly (p < 0.05) reversed into a heat storage response in M and H. Both TS and TC significantly differed by condition (p < 0.001) in a dose-dependent manner, with L, M, and H doses eliciting significantly cooler sensations and more discomfort than P (p < 0.05). Irritation significantly differed by condition (p < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner, with L and M eliciting significantly greater irritation than P (p < 0.01). No other differences were observed. CONCLUSIONS Menthol exerts perceptual and thermoregulatory effects independent of skin temperature. A menthol dose-dependent perceptual cooling effect was evident with possible saturation at the moderate dose.

The selection of components during virus assembly must therefore be flexible enough to allow the incorporation of unrelated viral membrane proteins, yet specific enough to exclude the bulk of host proteins. This apparent contradiction has been termed the pseudotypic paradox. There is mounting evidence that lipid rafts play a role in the assembly pathway of non-icosahedral, enveloped viruses. Viral components are concentrated initially in localized regions of the plasma membrane via their interaction with lipid raft domains. Lateral interactions of viral structural proteins amplify the changes in local lipid composition which in turn enhance the concentration of viral proteins in the rafts. An affinity for lipid rafts may be the common feature of enveloped virus proteins that leads to the formation of pseudotypes.","output":"Do lipid rafts mediate virus assembly and pseudotyping?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Notwithstanding its level of socio-economic development, health failure is a threat to any country. Globally, the Covid-19 pandemic is believed to be the greatest threat to the existentiality of humanity since the end of World War II. The level of global interconnectivity also made it the most destructive to human existence. The accelerating growth of the pandemic in South Africa has devastated effects on its economy and cuttingly intensified prior socio-economic challenges and inadvertently, presented South Africa with an unseen and formidable enemy that does not know the differences between South African Black, Coloured, Indian or White. The study used a qualitative research approach, underpinned by the rationality for South Africa, to embrace innovative diplomacy as a means to an end for its health safety and security amidst the covid-19 pandemic. The paper argued that South Africa must innovatively engage the acceptable global mechanisms and other health security measures with focus on its commitment to the goals of its national interests, while strengthening the efficiency of its health initiatives through better-quality governance where both local and international investors are allowed to participate actively in state socio-economic activities that respond to the safety and health security of the emotionalized publics. Thus, in a globalised system of innovation, South Africa needs to see the innovation environment as a steady pipeline of its domestic ability to control the negative effect of Covid-19 on its national health security.

Recently, its intensifying role has also been noticed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, technology adoption to pursue an e-commerce model for agribusinessmen is not easy, while the COVID-19 has made them lose customers and led them to crises. In that context, the role of social capital (SC) has increasingly been paid significant attention, especially for micro and family businesses. Agribusinessmen can use SC to adopt technology, renew and reinforce their businesses in the global agricultural supply chain disruption context. However, there seems to be a dearth of an integral measurement of social capital (IMSC) to apply to the practice effectively. Recognizing this need, the current study aims to develop an integral scale for SC. Design/methodology/approach This research adopts a widely accepted and rigorous scale development process, a mixed-methods research design and essential statistical techniques to develop an IMSC. Findings The result develops an IMSC consisting of nine facets: linking-corporate, bonding-bridging, trust in political institutions, trust in public services, generalized social trust, norms and social sanctions, subjective safety, civicness and community cohesiveness.

Our objective was to compare the effect of autoregulated load prescription (repetitions in reserve-based rating of perceived exertion and velocity-based training) to standardized load prescription (percentage-based training) on chronic one-repetition maximum (1RM) strength and cross-sectional area (CSA) hypertrophy adaptations in resistance-trained individuals. We also aimed to investigate the effect of volume autoregulation with velocity loss thresholds  25% compared to > 25% on 1RM strength and CSA hypertrophy. METHODS This review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus was conducted. Mean differences (MD), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated. Sub-analyses were performed as applicable. RESULTS Fifteen studies were included in the meta-analysis: six studies on load autoregulation and nine studies on volume autoregulation. No significant differences between autoregulated and standardized load prescription were demonstrated for 1RM strength (MD = 2.07, 95% CI - 0.32 to 4.46 kg, p = 0.09, SMD = 0.21). Velocity loss thresholds  25% demonstrated significantly greater 1RM strength (MD = 2.32, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.31 kg, p = 0.02, SMD = 0.23) and significantly lower CSA hypertrophy (MD = 0.61, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.16 cm2, p = 0.03, SMD = 0.28) than velocity loss thresholds > 25%. No significant differences between velocity loss thresholds > 25% and 20-25% were demonstrated for hypertrophy (MD = 0.36, 95% CI - 0.29 to 1.00 cm2, p = 0.28, SMD = 0.13); however, velocity loss thresholds > 25% demonstrated significantly greater hypertrophy compared to thresholds  20% (MD = 0.64, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.20 cm2, p = 0.03, SMD = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS Collectively, autoregulated and standardized load prescription produced similar improvements in strength. When sets and relative intensity were equated, velocity loss thresholds  25% were superior for promoting strength possibly by minimizing acute neuromuscular fatigue while maximizing chronic neuromuscular adaptations, whereas velocity loss thresholds > 20-25% were superior for promoting hypertrophy by accumulating greater relative volume.

One main cause of this condition is perinatal hypoxia and oxidative stress. Thus, it is a public health concern for populations living above 2500 m and in cases of intrauterine chronic hypoxia in lowlands. Still, pulmonary and cardiac impairments in PAHN lack effective treatments. Previously we have shown the beneficial effects of neonatal melatonin treatment on pulmonary circulation. However, the cardiac effects of this treatment are unknown. In this study, we assessed whether melatonin improves cardiac function and modulates right ventricle (RV) oxidative stress. Ten lambs were gestated, born, and raised at 3600 m. Lambs were divided in two groups. One received daily vehicle as control, and another received daily melatonin (1 mgkg(?1)d(?1)) for 21 days. Daily cardiovascular measurements were recorded and, at 29 days old, cardiac tissue was collected. Melatonin decreased pulmonary arterial pressure at the end of the experimental period. In addition, melatonin enhanced manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase (CAT) expression, while increasing CAT activity in RV. This was associated with a decrease in superoxide anion generation at the mitochondria and NADPH oxidases in RV. Finally, these effects were associated with a marked decrease of oxidative stress markers in RV.

In this study, we aimed to develop a triplex real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the simultaneous differential detection of these three intestinal protozoa. METHODS: Specific primers and TaqMan probes were designed for the 16S-like SSU rRNA sequence of E. histolytica, the gdh sequence of G. lamblia, and the 18srRNA sequence of C. parvum. A triplex qPCR assay was developed based on single-duplicate experiments to evaluate its limit of detection (LOD), specificity, stability, and reproducibility. Additionally, 163 fecal samples from patients with diarrhea who tested positive for copro-antigen were tested to verify the practicality of the assay. RESULTS: The triplex qPCR assay could specifically detect E. histolytica, G. lamblia, and C. parvum without cross-reactivity amongst the target-specific TaqMan probes of these three intestinal protozoan parasites and did not produce amplification curves for any other non-target species, and had good specificity. Amplification of serial dilutions showed that the triplex qPCR detected as little as 500 copies/L of standard plasmid DNA. The standard curve displayed good linearity between 5  10(2) and 5  10(8) copies/L; qPCR assays were performed with an efficiency of more than 95% and R(2) values were greater than 0.99.

Retrospective information obtained included disease presentation, progression, medical and surgical history, medications, family history, management, complications, and cause of death, as well as the impact of disease on families. RESULTS: Data from 23 patients were analyzed (20 deceased and 3 living), showing a mean age at death of 19.2 months, ranging from 3 - 55 months. Fourteen patients were treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), 2 were treated with substrate reduction therapy (SRT) and 3 underwent bone marrow transplantation. Five patients received Ambroxol and one was on N-acetylcysteine, both considered experimental treatments. Fifteen patients had gastrostomy tubes (G-Tube) placed, while 10 underwent tracheostomies. Neurological disease manifestations included choking episodes, myoclonic jerks, autonomic dysfunction, apnea, seizures and diminished blinking, all of which worsened as disease progressed. CONCLUSIONS: Current available therapies appear to prolong life but do not alter neurological manifestations. Despite aggressive therapeutic interventions, GD2 still remains a progressive disorder with a devastating prognosis, that may benefit from new treatment approaches.","output":"The Natural History of Type 2 Gaucher Disease in the 21st Century: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The stability of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers is critical for developing lithium (Li) metal batteries.

As a vulnerable population to adverse events, the health status of the COVID-19 recovered pediatric patients is of great concern. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of behavioral problems among pediatric patients recovered from the COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. METHODS: A total of 122 children who were suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases and hospitalized for treatment were enrolled in the study between April 2020 and May 2020 in Wuhan, China. We collected related information about hospitalization and discharge of the children and emotional symptoms of their parents through electronic medical records and questionnaire. The behavioral problems of children were examined by applying the parent-reported the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). RESULTS: The participant children were discharged from hospital after about two months. Among them, 76 (62%) were boys, and the mean age was 6.71 years old. The highest prevalence of behavioral problems among pediatric children with COVID-19 was for prosocial behavior (15%), followed by total difficulties (13%), emotional symptoms (11%), hyperactivity (10%), conduct problems (9%), and peer problems (1%). With regarding to their parents, 26% reported having symptoms of anxiety and 23% as having symptoms of depression.

The coactivator proteins adopt two hotspot sites, namely &#945;-helix and &#937;-loop, to interact with TEAD. Here, we demonstrate that both the &#945;-helix and &#937;-loop peptides cannot maintain in structured state when splitting from the full-length coactivator proteins; they exhibit a large intrinsic disorder in free state that prevents the coactivator peptide recognition by TEAD. Rational design is used to optimize the interfacial residues of coactivator &#945;-helix peptides, which can effectively improve the favorable direct readout effect upon the peptide binding to TEAD. Chemical modification is employed to constrain the free &#945;-helix peptide into native ordered conformation. The method introduces an all-hydrocarbon bridge across i and i + 4 residues to stabilize the helical structure of a free coactivator peptide, which can considerably reduce the unfavorable indirect readout effect upon the peptide binding to TEAD. The all-hydrocarbon bridge is designed to point out of the TEAD-peptide complex interface, which would not disrupt the direct intermolecular interaction between the TEAD and peptide. Therefore, the stapling only improves peptide affinity, but does not alter peptide specificity, to TEAD. Affinity assay confirms that the binding potency of coactivator &#945;-helix peptides is improved substantially by >5-fold upon the rational design and chemical modification. Structural analysis reveals that the optimized/stapled peptides can form diverse nonbonded interactions such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts with TEAD, thus conferring stability and specificity to the TEAD-peptide complex systems.","output":"Rational design and chemical modification of TEAD coactivator peptides to target hippo signaling pathway against gastrointestinal cancers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this retrospective observational study, we evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in London on paediatric radiology activity, as a surrogate of overall hospital activity.

Elderly patients, people with underlying chronic illnesses, cancer patients, and those who are immunocompromised are at higher risk and account for higher mortality rate. Unfortunately, there is no approved medication for treatment, till date, thereby supporting triage management and difficult decision-making. Thus, there should be a substantial increase in the palliative care in times of pandemic. There should be an increase in the availability of palliative care services in different care settings. Due to a surge in the number of cases of COVID-19, it has been reported on how palliative care is being delayed, discontinued, or deprioritized. AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the barriers occurring in providing the palliative care to the patients with nonmalignant illness. METHODOLOGY: A questionnaire was designed after studying previous work over palliative care and pandemic crisis and was distributed among the physicians, surgeons, and the residents; a total of 95 health-care workers were involved. The survey was done through mails. The response then was evaluated and analyzed. RESULTS: As seen by the responses we got from the health-care workers, the main issue is the nonavailability of the personal protective equipment during this pandemic. Keeping the current scenario in mind, regarding COVID-19, the patients are at fear of coming to the hospital at first place, and even if they come then the fear of being alone haunts them. One of the biggest fears of the patient is dying alone, without being in contact with their loved ones. CONCLUSION: Palliative care should be an essential part of any health-care service in any humanitarian crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic.

Noise is part of the exposome and is increasingly being investigated as a health risk factor impacting neurological, cardiometabolic, endocrine, and immune health. Beyond the well-characterized effects of high-intensity noise on cochlear damage, noise is relatively well-studied in the cardiovascular field, where evidence is emerging from both human and translational experiments that noise from traffic-related sources could represent a risk factor for hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. In the present review, we comprehensively discuss the current state of knowledge in the field of noise research. We give a brief survey of the literature documenting experiments in noise exposure in both humans and animals with a focus on cardiovascular disease. We also discuss the mechanisms that have been uncovered in recent years that describe how exposure to noise affects physiological homeostasis, leading to aberrant redox signaling resulting in metabolic and immune consequences, both of which have considerable impact on cardiovascular health.

However, quantitative data on carnivore species coexisting with humans in different land-use types remain largely missing. Thus, this paper investigated the effect of anthropogenic land-use and landscape drivers on carnivore species richness and distribution in the Faragosa-Fura Landscape, Gamo Zone, southern Ethiopia. To collect data, we employed the line transect method using three complementary field surveys techniques: sign survey, camera-trapping, and opportunistic sighting survey during wet and dry seasons in 2020 and 2021. We stratified the study landscape into five land-use types-forest, wetland, grassland, agricultural land, and settlement. The result proved the occurrence of 12 carnivore species belonging to six families, including vulnerable Felidae species - Panthera pardus. Family Felidae and Herpestidae were composed of a greater number of species, while Hyaenidae and Mustelidae were each represented by single species. Out of identified species, only two species (Panthera pardus and Crocuta crocuta) were large-sized, while the rest were medium and small-sized carnivores. Overall, the mean richness of the study area was 5.730.284(SE). The species richness was highest in the wetland (n = 12, mean = 7.670.494(SE)) and lowest in the settlement (n = 5, mean = 4.250.479(SE)). The regression analysis showed that most of the carnivores displayed a strong negative relationship with agriculture, roads, and settlement while displayed a strong positive relationship with wetland and forest. In general, out of 32 species recorded in Ethiopia, this study quantified 12 carnivore species that signify the area is an important area for wildlife conservation in Ethiopia. Further, the study concluded that the wetland is the most important habitat, particularly for larger-sized and habitat specialists while anthropogenic land-uses types adversely affecting species richness. Thus, a generic paradigm to reconcile land management and biodiversity conservation is highly important.","output":"Effects of land-use and landscape drivers in the species richness and distribution of carnivores in Faragosa-Fura Landscape of Southern Rift Valley, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Respiratory viruses are the main causes of upper and lower respiratory tract diseases.

Available guidance is discordant, ranging from standard care to the use of therapeutic anticoagulation for enhanced thromboprophylaxis (ET). Local ET protocols have been empirically determined and are generally intermediate between standard prophylaxis and full anticoagulation. Concerns have been raised in regard to the potential risk of haemorrhage associated with therapeutic anticoagulation. This report describes the prevalence and safety of ET strategies in European Intensive Care Unit (ICUs) and their association with outcomes during the first wave of the COVID pandemic, with particular focus on haemorrhagic complications and ICU mortality. METHODS: Retrospective, observational, multi-centre study including adult critically ill COVID-19 patients. Anonymised data included demographics, clinical characteristics, thromboprophylaxis and/or anticoagulation treatment. Critical haemorrhage was defined as intracranial haemorrhage or bleeding requiring red blood cells transfusion. Survival was collected at ICU discharge. A multivariable mixed effects generalised linear model analysis matched for the propensity for receiving ET was constructed for both ICU mortality and critical haemorrhage. RESULTS: A total of 852 (79% male, age 66 [37-85] years) patients were included from 28 ICUs. Median body mass index and ICU length of stay were 27.7 (25.1-30.7) Kg/m2 and 13 (7-22) days, respectively. Thromboembolic events were reported in 146 patients (17.1%), of those 78 (9.2%) were PE. ICU mortality occurred in 335/852 (39.3%) patients. ET was used in 274 (32.1%) patients, and it was independently associated with significant reduction in ICU mortality (log odds = 0.64 [95% CIs 0.18-1.1; p = 0.0069]) but not an increased risk of critical haemorrhage (log odds = 0.187 [95%CI - 0.591 to - 0.964; p = 0.64]). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of critically ill patients with a high prevalence of thromboembolic events, ET was associated with reduced ICU mortality without an increased burden of haemorrhagic complications. This study suggests ET strategies are safe and associated with favourable outcomes. Whilst full anticoagulation has been questioned for prophylaxis in these patients, our results suggest that there may nevertheless be a role for enhanced / intermediate levels of prophylaxis.

The associations of lockdown-date, and turning points of these trends were assessed. RESULTS There were 982,332 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in the EU states (median 7,896, interquartile 1,689 to 25,702 for individual states) during the study-period. COVID-19 and human mobility had 3 trend-segments, including an upward trend in COVID-19 daily incidence and a downward trend in most human mobilities in the middle segment.

Qualitative results revealed that participants found the program to be generally helpful and would recommend the program to others. Perceived benefits included increased parental empathy toward teens, enhanced parental involvement in teens' diabetes management, and decreased parent-teen conflict. Participants conveyed that these benefits were particularly impactful given increased family contact and tensions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Identified areas for improvement included adding follow-up group sessions with parents to maintain program impact on parenting over time and to target teens in early adolescence, when family dynamics are more malleable.

The study included patients with laboratory and clinical proof of autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD). Incidence rates were calculated with age standardisation using European standard population. Trends in incidence were evaluated as moving three-year averages. RESULTS: During the observed period, 1875 patients satisfied the diagnostic criteria for CAITD with male to female ratio of 1: 8.01. Median age of all cases was 46 years (interquartile range: 31 to 61) and women and men were on average the same age at the time of diagnosis. The overall standardized incidence was found to be 71.25 per 105 (%95 CI=63.36C79.15). The overall standardized incidence in men was 16.25 per 105 and 123.74 per 105 in women. In the end of the observed period, AITD prevalence was 427.52 per 105 (% 95 CI=408.17-446.87). CONCLUSION: There was a slight decline of incidence in our region during the observed period. This decrease might be the result of combination of various factors, mainly the Corona epidemics outbreak and emigration. On the basis of the lower incidence rate in the Tuzla Canton, one can assume that iodine prophylaxis carried out in order to eradicate goitre had satisfied expectations because there had not been any enormous increase in patients with AITD.","output":"The Epidemiological Characteristics of Autoimmune Thyroiditis in the Tuzla Canton in the Period from 2015 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using computational techniques to foster new empathetic relationships between human bodies and the space around them, Behnaz Farahi, Assistant Professor in the Department of Design at the California State University in Long Beach, presents some of the concepts and events that have inspired her research and focuses on a recent project for an interactive niqab.

Yet, it is uncertain how people have responded to protective behaviours in this pandemic. This study aims to evaluate how trust in different types of information sources influences the intention to adopt protective behaviours. Methods: In total, 122 Chinese completed a survey on Qualtrics in March 2021. Data on demographic information, protective behaviours, trust in formal information, trust in informal information, perceived risk, worry and social desirability were collected. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to identify associations between these variables. Results: Trust in formal information was significantly associated with perceived risk ( = ?.18) and significantly and positively associated with worry ( = .28). Trust in informal information was significantly and positively associated with perceived risk ( = .57). Subsequently, perceived risk was significantly associated with social distancing ( = ?.17), and worry was significantly and positively associated with mask wearing ( = .25) and significantly associated with hand washing ( = ?.27). Trust in formal information was significantly and positively associated with hand washing ( = .26) while trust in informal information was significantly and positively associated with social distancing and hand washing ( = .26). Perceived risk was significantly and positively associated with worry ( = .32). Conclusion: People who trust in informal information from social media and interpersonal communication would be more likely to adopt mask wearing and hand washing protective behaviours. People who trust in formal information from government-agency source would have a lower perceived risk of COVID-19 and are less likely to adopt social distancing, but people who trust in formal information have a greater worry about contracting COVID-19 and are more likely to wear masks.","output":"Source of Information on Intentions to Adopt Protective Behaviours During COVID-19 in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a pandemic disease caused by a coronavirus, designed as SARS CoV-2, whose clinical presentation is widely variable, with most patients having mild or no symptoms, but others developing a malign disease with multi-organ failure and even death. Accumulating data from different populations have shown that obesity is a risk factor for a severe evolution of the disease, however, the mechanisms that explain this association are not clearly understood. An ominous evolution of COVID-19 has been attributed to an exacerbated inflammatory response, designed as cytokine storm with augmented production of cytokines/chemokines through the activation of toll-like receptors (TLR) by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, that triggers an inflammatory downstream response, mediated in part by the adaptor molecule, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). Previous studies have reported an increased expression of MyD88 and TLRs in people with obesity, mainly in those with metabolic complications. Therefore, we hypothesize, that an underlying increased Myd88/TLR signaling may predispose to patients with obesity to develop an exaggerated and dangerous inflammatory reaction against SARS CoV-2 infection, explaining at least in part, the higher severity of COVID-19. In addition, MyD88/TLR signaling in people with obesity could have a role in the development of several chronic diseases.","output":"Increased TLR/MyD88 signaling in patients with obesity: is there a link to COVID-19 disease severity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes in Chinese residents' psychological state and its influencing factors after the Wuhan shutdown on 23 Jan. METHODS: Two surveys were conducted on Feb 1-5 and Feb 20-24, separately, using an online self-administrated questionnaire among 3145 and 3814 participants, respectively. Subjective indicators of daily-life changes include level of attention, risk of infection, impact of daily life, self-perceived health status, and mental health help-seeking. And individual scores on changes in anxiety, depression, and stress were generated by 6-item, 4-item, and 3-item questions. A multivariate regression model was fitted in each survey, separately and combined. RESULTS: A total of 6959 residents participated in the study, with 32.78% male and 67.22% female, people living in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province accounted for 25.22% and 18.85%, respectively. One week after the Wuhan shutdown, their anxiety, depression, and stress had all increased. Compared to the 1st survey, the changes in the scores of anxiety, depression, and stress in the 2nd survey were decreased (?=-1.220, -0.798, and -0.623, all p<0.001). The level of attention, risk of infection, and self-perceived health status tended to be positively associated with the changes in the scores of anxiety, depression, and stress.

These restrictions were justified on the basis the health system may be overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases and in order to prevent deaths. Governments are now considering how they may de-escalate these restrictions. This article argues that an appropriate approach may be to lift the general lockdown but implement selective isolation of the elderly. While this discriminates against the elderly, there is a morally relevant difference-the elderly are far more likely to require hospitalisation and die than the rest of the population. If the aim is to ensure the health system is not overwhelmed and to reduce the death rate, preventing the elderly from contracting the virus may be an effective means of achieving this. The alternative is to continue to keep everyone in lockdown. It is argued that this is levelling down equality and is unethical. It suggests that in order for the elderly to avoid contracting the virus, the whole population should have their liberty deprived, even though the same result could be achieved by only restricting the liberty of the elderly. Similar arguments may also be applied to all groups at increased risk of COVID-19, such as men and those with comorbidities, the obese and people from ethnic minorities or socially deprived groups. This utilitarian concern must be balanced against other considerations, such as equality and justice, and the benefits gained from discriminating in these ways must be proportionately greater than the negative consequences of doing so. Such selective discrimination will be most justified when the liberty restriction to a group promotes the well-being of that group (apart from its wider social benefits).","output":"Why lockdown of the elderly is not ageist and why levelling down equality is wrong"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A randomized-trial of community-level mask promotion in rural Bangladesh during COVID-19 shows that the intervention tripled mask usage and is a cost-effective means of promoting public health.","output":"Normalizing Community Mask-Wearing: A Cluster Randomized Trial in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although most cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have occurred in low-resource countries, little is known about the epidemiology of the disease in such contexts.

The aim of the present paper is to provide a scientific overview on the pathogenesis of mucormycosis in COVID-19 beyond the conventional understanding of the disease process, which may not otherwise explain the increased incidence of mucormycosis in SARS-CoV-2.

Apart from the acknowledged role of ketoacidosis, high blood sugar, and iron metabolism in the pathogenesis of mucormycosis, other factors involved in pathophysiology of COVID-19 which might alter or enhance the mucormycosis infection such as (1) the role of ferritin, (2) high serum iron, (3) free radical-induced endothelitis, (4) hepcidin activation, (5) upregulation of glucose receptor protein (GRP78) are discussed in the pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis.

Several studies have reported SARS-CoV-2 proteins could serve as ideal vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 infection by activating the T cell responses. In the current study, based on the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and distribution of host human leukocyte antigen (HLA), we predicted the possible epitopes for the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infections. Firstly, the current study retrieved the SARS-CoV-2 S and N protein sequences from the NCBI Database. Then, using the Immune Epitope Database Analysis Resource, we predicted the CTL epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins according to worldwide frequency distributions of HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles (>1%). Our results predicted 90 and 106 epitopes of N and S proteins, respectively. Epitope cluster analysis showed 16 and 34 respective clusters of SARS-CoV-2 N and S proteins, which covered 95.91% and 96.14% of the global population, respectively.

Whether the lockdown had consequences on the management of medical emergencies such as stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) has yet to be fully evaluated. This article describes hospitalization rates for acute stroke in 2 French regions that experienced contrasting rates of COVID-19 infection, before, during, and after the nationwide lockdown (January to June 2020). METHODS: All patients admitted for acute stroke/TIA into all public and private hospitals of the 2 study regions were included. Data were retrieved from the National Hospitalization Database (PMSI). In the most affected region (Grand-Est), the hospitalization rates observed in April 2020 were compared with the rates in the same period in the least affected region (Occitanie) and in the 3 prior years (2017-2019). RESULTS: There was a significant decline in hospitalization rates for stroke/TIA within the region most affected by COVID-19 during the month of April 2020 compared with previous years, while no significant change was seen in the least affected region. After lockdown, we observed a fast rebound in the rate of hospitalization for stroke/TIA in the most affected region, contrasting with a slower rebound in the least affected region. In both regions, patients with COVID-19 stroke more frequently had ischemic stroke, a nonsignificant greater prevalence of diabetes, they were less frequently admitted to stroke units, and mortality was higher than in patients without COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrates a significant drop in stroke/TIA hospitalizations and a fast recovery after the end of the French lockdown in the most affected region, while the least affected region saw a nonsignificant drop in stroke/TIA hospitalizations and a slow recovery.

Maximum likelihood (ML) and diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) dominate the estimation of SEMs with continuous or categorical endogenous variables, respectively. When a model is correctly specified, ML and DWLS function well. But, in the face of incorrect structures or nonconvergence, their performance can seriously deteriorate. Model implied instrumental variable, two stage least squares (MIIV-2SLS) estimates and tests individual equations, is more robust to misspecifications, and is noniterative, thus avoiding nonconvergence.

The concentrations of the ten detected pesticides ranged from not detected (ND) to 323.44 ng L-1 in different water samples from Beijing; metalaxyl was detected to have the highest concentration (89.58 ng L-1), and the detection frequencies of atrazine and metalaxyl were 100%. The maximum concentrations of pesticides in the Wenyu River, STPs, and the hospital were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those in the groundwater. Good removal efficiencies by the treatment processes were observed for ametryn (100%), while the removal efficiencies for atrazine and omethoate were the lowest in the three STPs (- 9.6% and 12.67%, respectively). Finally, risk quotient (RQ) values of each contaminant were estimated from the maximum values determined for typical urban to assess the ecology and health effects.

We employ CMIE's Consumer Pyramids Household Survey to examine the timing, distribution, and mechanism of the impacts from this shock on income and consumption through December 2020. First, we estimate large and heterogeneous drops in income, with ambiguous effects on inequality. While incomes of salaried workers fell 35%;incomes of daily laborers fell 75%. At the same time, we observe that income fell more for individuals from households in the highest income quartile. Second, we document an increase in effort to buffer income shocks by switching occupations. We employ a Roy Model to estimate the gains from occupation churn and find, surprisingly, that reservation wages fell, implying that the risk of COVID did not reduce the value of employment. Third, we find that consumption fell less than income, suggesting households were able to smooth the idiosyncratic components of the COVID shock as well as they did before COVID. Finally, consumption of food and fuel fell less than consumption of durables such as clothing and appliances. Following Costa (2001) and Hamilton (2001), we estimate Engel curves and find that changes in consumption reflect large price shocks (rather than a retreat to subsistence) in sectors other than food and fuel/power. In the food sector, it appear that lockdown successfully distinguished essential and non-essential services, at least to the extent that it did not increase the relative price of food. There is some suggestive evidence that the price shocks outside the food sector were larger in places with greater COVID-19 cases, even during the lockdown.","output":"Explaining the Income and Consumption Effects of COVID in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Typical responses to a confrontation with failures in authority, or what Lacanians term 'the lack in the Other', involve attempts to shore it up.

The primary aims of this study were to 1) estimate the association between partners education attainment and early ANC, and 2) determine whether partners level of education modified the relationship between mothers education, mothers age, planned pregnancy, employment status and early ANC. METHODS: Data were obtained from a cross-sectional study conducted from April to May 2021 among 519 mothers with a live birth in the past year in the Nabdam district in the Upper East Region in northern Ghana. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess whether partners level of education modified the relationship between mothers education, mothers age, planned pregnancy, employment status and early ANC. Effect modification was assessed on the additive and multiplicative scales using adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Mothers whose partners had secondary or higher education had a 26% higher prevalence of early ANC compared to mothers whose partners had less than a secondary level of education (aPR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.05,1.51). There was evidence of effect modification by partners education on the relationship between planned pregnancy and early ANC on both the additive (Relative excess risk due to interaction [RERI]: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.07,0.99), and multiplicative (ratio of PRs: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.01,2.70) scales. Among mothers whose partners had less than secondary education, mothers who had teenage pregnancy (i.e., aged 18C19 years old during pregnancy) were less likely to have early ANC compared to those who did not have teenage pregnancy (aPR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.53,0.97). Among mothers whose partners had a secondary or higher education, early ANC was more prevalent among employed mothers compared to those who were unemployed (aPR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02,1.57). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that whilst mothers whose partners had a secondary or higher education were more likely to initiate early ANC, supporting such women to plan their pregnancies can further increase the coverage of early ANC.","output":"The moderating role of partners education on early antenatal care in northern Ghana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aiming to prevent the spread of contagious diseases has long been a central tenet of public health.

Two distinct pathways can promote protein carbamylation. One results from urea decomposition, forming an equilibrium mixture of cyanate (CNO-) and the reactive electrophile isocyanate. The second pathway involves myeloperoxidase (MPO)-catalyzed oxidation of thiocyanate (SCN-), yielding CNO- and isocyanate. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein constituent of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), is a known target for MPO-catalyzed modification in vivo, converting the cardioprotective lipoprotein into a pro-atherogenic, pro-apoptotic one. We hypothesized that monitoring site-specific carbamylation patterns of apoA-I recovered from human atherosclerotic aorta could provide insights into the chemical environment within the artery wall. To test this, we first mapped carbamyllysine obtained from in vitro carbamylation of apoA-I by both the urea-driven (non-enzymatic) and inflammatory-driven (enzymatic) pathways in lipid-poor and lipidated apoA-I (reconstituted HDL). Our results suggest that lysine residues within proximity of the known MPO binding sites on HDL are preferentially targeted by the enzymatic (MPO) carbamylation pathway, whereas the non-enzymatic pathway leads to nearly uniform distribution of carbamylated lysine residues along the apoA-I polypeptide chain. Quantitative proteomic analyses of apoA-I from human aortic atheroma identified 16 of the 21 lysine residues as carbamylated, and suggested that the majority of apoA-I carbamylation in vivo occurs on 'lipid-poor' apoA-I forms via the non-enzymatic CNO- pathway. Monitoring patterns of apoA-I carbamylation recovered from arterial tissues can provide insights into both apoA-I structure and the chemical environment within human atheroma.","output":"The pattern of apolipoprotein A-I lysine carbamylation reflects its lipidation state and the chemical environment within human atherosclerotic aorta"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the worst calamities the world is facing since early 2020 is corona virus or Covid-19 disease which has turned into a pandemic claiming millions of lives across the globe.

Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, and Google Scholar from January 2020 to 7 January 2021 to identify all studies describing clinical profile, outcome and mortality rates regarding DKA, HHS, DKA/HHS and EDKA cases in COVID-19 patients. The appropriate Joanna Briggs Institute tools were used for quality assessment; quality of evidence was approached using GRADE. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess correlations between clinical characteristics and outcome based on case reports. Combined mortality rates (CMR) were estimated from data reported in case report series, cross-sectional studies, and meta-analyses. The protocol was submitted to PROSPERO (ID: 229356/230737). Results: From 312 identified publications, 44 were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Critical COVID-19 necessitating ICU (P = 3  10-8), DKA/HHS presence (P = 0.021), and AKI (P = 0.037) were independently correlated with death. Increased COVID-19 severity (P = 0.003), elevated lactates (P < 0.001), augmented anion gap (P < 0.001), and AKI (P = 0.002) were associated with DKA/HHS.

Some diseases, for instance diabetes, is continuously suggested as a risk factor which contributes to the severity and mortality of COVID-19. However, to date, there are no comprehensive studies aiming to explain the exact relationship between diabetes and COVID-19. Thus, this study aims to summarize the evidence about diabetes and COVID-19 outbreak through a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. METHOD: A literature review was implemented within databases of Scopus, PubMed, Science direct, and Web of science. Observational reviews, case-report, and case-series studies that assessed the diabetes in COVID-19 patients, were included. Data extraction and assessment were guided by PRISMA checklist. FINDINGS: Some studies suggest that there were no significant differences in symptoms between patients who suffered from both diabetes and COVID-19 and those who only suffered COVID-19. In the subsequent meta-analysis 14.5 % of the subjects were diabetic patient. These clients have poor ARDS prognosis, severe symptoms, and the death rate is higher among COVID-19 patients. In addition, it is suggested the diabetic patients will be treated with antibiotics, antivirals, and HCQ.

Prediction of TCR:peptide recognition is important for many clinically relevant problems: prediction of cross-reactivity of TCRs used in adoptive T-cell-based therapies, identification of targets for antigen-specific therapies of autoimmune disorders and cancer, vaccine design. In this work, we describe a novel computational method that ranks TCR-peptide pairs based on statistical estimation of binding energy to select the most likely cognate epitopes. Our method starts from a structure of a peptide-MHC complex with the TCR of interest (either experimentally derived or based on a homology model) and a set of candidate epitopes and generates a ranked list of these peptides with predicted recognition probabilities. In our method interaction energy between TCR and peptide residues is estimated using statistical potential TCRen which we derived via statistical analysis of amino acid contact preferences in TCR-peptide interfaces from crystal structures of TCR-peptide-MHC complexes. We demonstrate excellent performance of our method for two tasks related to TCR-peptide recognition: 1) discrimination between cognate epitopes and unrelated peptides; 2) discrimination between real and mocked TCR-peptide-MHC complexes. Comparison of TCRen with potentials reflecting the rules of general protein-protein interaction and protein folding reveals the distinctive features of TCR-peptide interactions, such as intrinsic asymmetry of the interface, a complex interplay between different physico-chemical properties of contacting residues and lower impact of hydrophobic interactions.

In this review, we aim to narrate the current state of the literature on telehealth applied to migraine care. First, telemedicine in the context of non-acute headache management has been shown to produce non-inferior patient outcomes when compared to traditional face-to-face appointments. The assignment of patients to telehealth appointments should be made after referring more urgent cases to dedicated in-person clinics. During the virtual appointment, physicians can ask their patients about the 3 Fs in order to perform a thorough assessment of their headaches: frequency of headache days, frequency of acute medication usage and functional impairment. Clinical assessment scores that have been studied and deemed feasible for telemedicine, safe and efficient include the HIT-6, VAS and MIDAS scores. Although MIDAS was found to be redundant and inadequate to use on a daily basis, we suggest that it can be useful in periodic remote follow-up appointments. Additionally, several mobile health apps have been studied including Migraine Buddy, Migraine Coach and Migraine Monitor. All of these are appropriate for use in telemedicine when combined with an adequate trial period with Migraine Buddy being rated the highest, as it captures the most detailed clinical picture. High satisfaction rates have been reported for virtual headache management which were shown to be equal to in-person consults. These are based on patients perceived increase in convenience due to avoided travel time, less disruption of their daily routine and feeling more comfortable in the environment of their choice.

The probe frequencies were 2C5 MHz (convex probe) and 3C12 MHz for the linear probe. As a reference standard, all patients were also examined using high-end ultrasound (LOGIQ E9/LOGIQ E10). Results were interpreted independently by two examiners in consensus, also with regard to the image quality (0C4, from not assessable = 0, to excellent 4). RESULTS: In all 40 patients (100%) examination with conventional high-end ultrasound and the Vscan Air ultrasound device was feasible.

As medical treatment improves, CYPwH are experiencing better outcomes; therefore, more challenging measures are required to monitor physical performance. Such testing is not performed routinely, due to practical and safety concerns. AIM: Evaluate the feasibility, safety and acceptability of select outcome measures as part of a study protocol testing CYPwH; including myometry, 10 metre incremental shuttle walk test (10-m ISWT), iSTEP (an incremental step test, with data from TDB), and 1 week of accelerometry-wear at home. METHODS: Sixty-six boys aged 6C15 years with mild, moderate or severe haemophilia A or B (including inhibitors) attending routine clinics at Great Ormond Street Hospital were approached to participate. Descriptive statistics and content analysis were used to assess outcomes of feasibility, safety and acceptability, which included recruitment/retention rates, protocol completion within routine appointment timeframes, performance testing without serious adverse events/reactions (SAE/SARs), and acceptability to CYPwH of high-level performance measures. RESULTS: Outcomes were met: 43 boys completed testing at clinic review (JanCNov 2018) within a 10-month timeframe, retention was 95% at completion of protocol and no SAE/SARs were reported throughout testing.

Translating these real-time effects into their long-term consequences remains a challenge. The rapid and extreme warming period that occurred after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (7-12 thousand years ago) provides an opportunity to gain insights into the long-term responses of natural populations to periods with global warming. The effects of this post-LGM warming period have been assessed in many terrestrial taxa, whereas insights into the impacts of rapid global warming on marine taxa remain limited, especially for megafauna. In order to understand how large-scale climate fluctuations during the post-LGM affected baleen whales and their prey, we conducted an extensive, large-scale analysis of the long-term effects of the post-LGM warming on abundance and inter-ocean connectivity in eight baleen whale and seven prey (fish and invertebrates) species across the Southern and the North Atlantic Ocean; two ocean basins that differ in key oceanographic features. The analysis was based upon 7032 mitochondrial DNA sequences as well as genome-wide DNA sequence variation in 100 individuals. The estimated temporal changes in genetic diversity during the last 30,000 years indicated that most baleen whale populations underwent post-LGM expansions in both ocean basins. The increase in baleen whale abundance during the Holocene was associated with simultaneous changes in their prey and climate. Highly correlated, synchronized and exponential increases in abundance in both baleen whales and their prey in the Southern Ocean were indicative of a dramatic increase in ocean productivity. In contrast, the demographic fluctuations observed in baleen whales and their prey in the North Atlantic Ocean were subtle, varying across taxa and time. Perhaps most important was the observation that the ocean-wide expansions and decreases in abundance that were initiated by the post-LGM global warming, continued for millennia after global temperatures stabilized, reflecting persistent, long-lasting impacts of global warming on marine fauna.","output":"Strong and lasting impacts of past global warming on baleen whales and their prey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To report the initial experience of one surgeon, with contemporary experience of both open radical prostatectomy (ORP) and reconstructive laparoscopy, in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) in 1000 patients, and to investigate the rate of change of various outcome variables for this procedure with time.

RESULTS The median (range) operative duration was 177 (78-600) min. There was one conversion (patient 8) to open surgery. The median blood loss was 200 (10-1300) mL and four patients were transfused (0.4%). The median postoperative hospital stay was 3.0 (3-28) nights. The median catheterization time was 10.0 (0.8-120) days. There were 48 complications (4.8%) requiring surgical intervention in 33 (3.3%) patients, 58% of these as a day-case admission. The positive margin rates according to d'Amico risk groups were: low, 9.1%; intermediate, 20.3%; and high, 36.8%. The overall positive margin rate was 13.3%. The PSA level was < or =0.1 mg/L at 3 months in 99.1% of patients. At a mean follow-up of 27.7 (3-72) months, 96.1% of patients were free of biochemical recurrence. In patients with a follow-up of > or =24 months potency rates peaked in the series at 86% for all men and 94% for men aged < or =65 years, and continence rates at 98% before declining thereafter in men with a shorter follow-up. CONCLUSION The learning curve for operating time and blood loss was overcome within the first 100-150 cases, but complication and continence rates took 150-200 cases to reach a plateau. The longest learning curve was for potency, which did not stabilize until 700 cases. These learning curves are likely to be considerably shorter when surgeons are taught in departments with a high throughput of cases but both surgeons and patients should be aware of them. In view of these findings, the authors recommend that LRP should not be self-taught and should be learned within an immersion teaching programme. Even then, a large surgical volume is likely to be needed to maintain clinical outcomes at the highest level.","output":"The first 1000 cases of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in the UK: evidence of multiple 'learning curves'."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Options for effective techniques for vessel and tissue sealing in infants and children are limited because of the size and limited intracorporeal space of many pediatric patients. We evaluated a new energy source, the ForceTriad (Covidien, West Windsor, NJ) LigaSure, which delivers both mono- and bipolar energy in a 5-mm format and allows for tissue fusion and vessel sealing and division. This report documents our experience with this device. METHODS A database review was performed, looking for all cases that were performed in children using the ForceTriad LigaSure as the main source of hemostasis and tissue fusion. Two different handpieces were used a fine Maryland dissector-type instrument with no cutting blade, and a sealer/cutter, both in a 5-mm format. RESULTS A total of 60 cases were performed in children from September 2006 to September 2007, using the ForceTriad. The two most common cases were Nissen fundoplication (40 cases; weight: 8.5-95 kg [average,40.7]; operating room [OR] time: 15-70 min [average, 32]; average days to full feeds: 2) and lung lobectomy (11)cases (weight: 4.6-63 kg [average, 27.3]; OR time: 60-180 min [average, 123]; average hospital days: 3.1). Other procedures included, excision of choledochal cyst (3), aortopexy, closure of bronchopleural fistula, nephrectomy(1), thymectomy (1), parathyroid adenoma excision (1), total colectomy (2), and intestinal duplication resection(2). There were no failures of vessel or tissue fusion and no operative complications. A delayed hydropneumothorax developed in 1 lung resection and spontaneously resolved. CONCLUSION The ForceTriad provides a safe, effective energy source in a 5-mm format. As compared to previous versions of the LigaSure, there was less sticking, a quicker seal, and no tissue-fusion failures.","output":"Experience with a new energy source for tissue fusion in pediatric patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background : The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a sudden transition to remote learning in medical schools. We aimed to assess student perceptions of remote learning during the pre-clinical curricular training phase. Methods: A survey was distributed to first- and second-year medical students enrolled at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine in March 2020. Frequencies of responses to structured multiple-choice questions were compared regarding impacts of remote learning on quality of instruction and ability to participate, value of various remote learning resources, living environment, and preparedness for subsequent stages of training. Responses to open-ended questions about strengths and weaknesses of the remote curriculum and overall reflections were coded for thematic content. Results: Of 268 students enrolled, 104 responded (53.7% of first-year students and 23.9% of second-year students). Overall, students felt the quality of instruction and their ability to participate had been negatively affected. Most (64.1%) preferred the flexibility of learning material at their own pace. Only 25.5% of respondents still felt connected to the medical school or classmates. Most second-year students (56.7%) felt their preparation for the USMLE Step 1 exam was negatively affected and 43.3% felt unprepared to begin clerkships. In narrative responses, most appreciated the increased flexibility of remote learning but recognized that digital fatigue, decreased ability to participate, and lack of clinical skills and hands-on lab learning were notable deficits. Conclusions: Videocasted lectures uploaded in advance, electronic health record and telehealth training for students, and training for teaching faculty to increase technological fluency may be considered to optimize remote learning curricula.","output":"Pre-Clinical Remote Undergraduate Medical Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey Study&nbsp;"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite demonstrated efficacy of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), widespread hesitancy to vaccination persists. Improved knowledge regarding frequency, severity, and duration of vaccine-associated symptoms may help reduce hesitancy. In this prospective observational study, we studied 1032 healthcare workers who received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and completed post-vaccine symptom surveys both after dose 1 and after dose 2. We defined appreciable post-vaccine symptoms as those of at least moderate severity and lasting at least 2 days. We found that symptoms were more frequent following the second vaccine dose than the first (74% vs. 60%, P < 0.001), with >80% of all symptoms resolving within 2 days. The most common symptom was injection site pain, followed by fatigue and malaise. Overall, 20% of participants experienced appreciable symptoms after dose 1 and 30% after dose 2. In multivariable analyses, female sex was associated with greater odds of appreciable symptoms after both dose 1 (OR, 95% CI 1.73, 1.19C2.51) and dose 2 (1.76, 1.28C2.42). Prior COVID-19 was also associated with appreciable symptoms following dose 1, while younger age and history of hypertension were associated with appreciable symptoms after dose 2.

Molecular understanding of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) would greatly help advance the development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy, as well as the design of next generation recombinant vaccines. Here, we applied H2L2 transgenic mice encoding the human immunoglobulin variable regions, together with a state-of-the-art antibody discovery platform to immunize and isolate NAbs. From a large panel of isolated antibodies, 25 antibodies showed potent neutralizing activities at sub-nanomolar levels by engaging the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). Importantly, one human NAb, termed PR1077, from the H2L2 platform and 2 humanized NAb, including PR953 and PR961, were further characterized and subjected for subsequent structural analysis. High-resolution X-ray crystallography structures unveiled novel epitopes on the receptor-binding motif (RBM) for PR1077 and PR953, which directly compete with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for binding, and a novel non-blocking epitope on the neighboring site near RBM for PR961. Moreover, we further tested the antiviral efficiency of PR1077 in the Ad5-hACE2 transduction mouse model of COVID-19.

METHODS: A pragmatic clinical trial was conducted in an intensive care unit from March 2009 to September 2016. Patients on mechanical ventilation > 24 hours who developed acute respiratory failure after scheduled extubation were included and were assigned to noninvasive ventilation or conventional oxygen therapy. The primary objective was to reduce the reintubation rate. The secondary objectives were to improve respiratory parameters and reduce complications, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the intensive care unit stay, the hospital stay, and mortality in the intensive care unit, in the hospital, and 90 days after discharge. Factors correlated with reintubation were also analyzed. RESULTS: Of a total of 2,574 patients, 77 were analyzed (38 in the noninvasive ventilation group and 39 in the conventional oxygen therapy group). Noninvasive ventilation reduced the respiratory and cardiac rates more rapidly than conventional oxygen therapy. Reintubation was less common in the noninvasive ventilation group [12 (32%) versus 22 (56%) in the conventional oxygen therapy group, relative risk 0.58 (95%CI 0.34 - 0.97), p = 0.039]. The rest of the parameters did not show significant differences. In the multivariate analysis, noninvasive ventilation protected against reintubation [OR 0.17 (95%CI 0.05 - 0.56), p = 0.004], while liver failure before extubation and the inability to maintain airway patency predisposed patients to reintubation.

This posed challenges to many countries, prominent among which is communication with the public to gain their cooperation. Israel faces different challenges from other countries in its management of the COVID-19 crisis because it is in the midst of a deep constitutional crisis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to examine the response of the Israeli public to the government's emergency instructions regarding the pandemic in terms of correlations between overall risk perception and crisis management; overall risk perception and economic threat perception; crisis management and compliance with behavioral guidelines; and crisis management and economic threat perception. We also made comparisons between crisis management and spokesperson credibility and between crisis management and the credibility of information sources. METHODS: The sample was established using an online survey that enabled rapid and effective distribution of an online questionnaire during the COVID-19 crisis. The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit participants (N=1056) through social network posts asking the general public (aged &#8805;18 years) to answer the survey. RESULTS: Participants aged &#8805;65 years perceived higher personal risk compared to those aged 18-30 years (mean difference 0.33, 95% CI 0.04-0.61) and those aged 46-64 years (mean difference 0.38, 95% CI 0.12-0.64). Significant correlations were found between overall risk perception and attitudes toward crisis management (r=0.19, P<.001), overall risk perception and economic threat perception (r=0.22, P<.001), attitudes toward crisis management and compliance with behavioral guidelines (r=0.15, P<.001), and attitudes toward crisis management and economic threat perception (r=-0.15, P<.001). Participants who perceived that the prime minister was the most credible spokesperson evaluated the crisis management significantly higher than all other groups. The crisis management was evaluated significantly lower by participants who stated that infectious disease specialists were the most credible spokespersons. Participants for whom the Ministry of Health website was the most credible source of information evaluated the crisis management higher than all other groups. Participants for whom scientific articles were the most credible source of information evaluated the crisis management lower than those who perceived that the WHO/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites or Ministry of Health/hospital websites and health care workers were the most credible. CONCLUSIONS: The higher the public trust and evaluation of crisis management, the greater the compliance of the public with guidelines. It was also found that crisis management and information cannot be approached in the same way for the overall public. Furthermore, unlike other epidemics, the COVID-19 crisis has widespread economic and social consequences; therefore, it is impossible to focus only on health risks without communicating economic and social risks as well.","output":"Analysis of Public Perception of the Israeli Government's Early Emergency Instructions Regarding COVID-19: Online Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hypoxemia is readily detectable by assessing SpO(2) levels, and these are important in optimizing COVID-19 patient management.

Herein, we searched for innovative fat collection and ASC isolation technologies and applications and evaluated each studys relevance to plastic surgery. METHODS: A narrative literature review was carried out using the MEDLINE/PubMed databases. Studies published from January 1993 to August 2020 and written in English, Portuguese, or Spanish were considered. RESULTS: The selection process yielded 33 articles for subsequent review, involving exploratory, selective, and interpretive reading, material choice, and text analysis. Twenty-three articles employed enzymatic dissociation methods to isolate ASCs, and 25 employed liposuction as the plastic surgery technique. Moreover, articles describing new devices (n = 2), techniques (n = 4), computational models (n = 1), tissue scaffolds (n = 21), and therapies and/or treatments (n = 5) were identified.

This cell type expresses integrin 5 (ITGA5), which is essential to the Tie2 signaling pathway. The microRNA miR-218-5p is upregulated in endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) after hypoxia, but microRNA regulation of Tie2 in the EPC lineage is unclear. METHODS: We isolated human kidney-derived EPCs (hkEPCs) and surveyed microRNA target transcripts. A preclinical model of ischemic kidney injury was used to evaluate the effect of hkEPCs on capillary repair. We used a genetic knockout model to evaluate the effect of deleting endogenous expression of miR-218 specifically in angioblasts. RESULTS: After ischemic in vitro preconditioning, miR-218-5p was elevated in hkEPCs. We found miR-218-5p bound to ITGA5 mRNA transcript and decreased ITGA5 protein expression. Phosphorylation of 42/44 MAPK decreased by 73.6% in hkEPCs treated with miR-218-5p. Cells supplemented with miR-218-5p downregulated ITGA5 synthesis and decreased 42/44 MAPK phosphorylation. In a CD309-Cre/miR-218-2-LoxP mammalian model (a conditional knockout mouse model designed to delete pre-miR-218-2 exclusively in CD309+ cells), homozygotes at e18.5 contained avascular glomeruli, whereas heterozygote adults showed susceptibility to kidney injury. Isolated EPCs from the mouse kidney contained high amounts of ITGA5 and showed decreased migratory capacity in three-dimensional cell culture. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the critical regulatory role of miR-218-5p in kidney EPC migration, a finding that may inform efforts to treat microvascular kidney injury via therapeutic cell delivery.","output":"Integrin 5 Is Regulated by miR-218-5p in Endothelial Progenitor Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To illustrate the effect of corticosteroids and heparin, respectively, on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients' CD8+ T cells and D-Dimer METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study involving 866 participants diagnosed with COVID-19, patients were grouped by severity Generalized additive models were established to explore the time-course association of representative parameters of coagulation, inflammation and immunity Segmented regression was performed to examine the influence of corticosteroids and heparin upon CD8+ T cell and D-Dimer, respectively RESULTS: There were 541 moderate, 169 severe and 156 critically ill patients involved in the study Synchronous changes of levels of NLR, D-Dimer and CD8+ T cell in critically ill patients were observed Administration of methylprednisolone before 14 DFS compared with those after 14 DFS ( = 0 154%, 95% CI=(0, 0 302), p = 0 048) or a dose lower than 40 mg per day compared with those equals to 40 mg per day ( = 0 163%, 95% CI=(0 027, 0 295), p = 0 020) significantly increased the rising rate of CD8+ T cell in 14 to 56 DFS CONCLUSION: The parameters of coagulation, inflammation and immunity were longitudinally correlated, and an early low-dose corticosteroid treatment accelerated the regaining of CD8+ T cell to help battle against SARS-Cov-2 in critical cases of COVID-19","output":"Time-course analysis reveals that corticosteroids resuscitate diminished CD8+ T cells in COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The gradient-index (GRIN) Luneburg lens antenna offers significant benefits, e.g. high aperture efficiency, low-power, minimal cost, wide beam scanning angle and broad bandwidth, over phased array antennas and reflector antennas.

To eliminate the feed mismatch problem, the quasi-conformal transformation optics (QCTO) method can be adopted to modify the lens' spherical feed surface into a planar one. However, Luneburg lenses designed with QCTO method are limited to poor performance due to the presence of the reflections and beam broadening arising from the quasi-conformal mapping.

Reimbursement policies have been limited historically due to concerns of overutilization of visits and testing. Additionally, there is limited literature on endocrinology care delivered via TH for conditions other than diabetes. We assess real-world TH use for endocrinology in a prepandemic environment with the hypothesis that TH would not increase the utilization of total visits or related ancillary testing services compared with conventional (CVL) face-to-face office visits. METHODS: A single-institution retrospective cohort study assessing the prepandemic use of TH in endocrinology, consisting of 75 patients seen via TH and 225 patients seen in CVL visits. For most patients, TH was conducted via a clinic-to-clinic model. Outcomes measured were total endocrine visit frequency and frequency of related laboratory and radiology testing per patient, hemoglobin A1C, microalbumin, low-density lipoprotein, thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin, and thyroid ultrasounds. RESULTS: For all endocrine visits, TH patients had a median of 0.24 (interquartile range, 0.015-0.36) visits per month. CVL patients had a median of 0.20 visits per month (interquartile range, 0.11-0.37). Total visits per month did not vary significantly between groups (P = .051). Hemoglobin A1C outcomes were equivalent and there was no increase in ancillary laboratory testing for the TH group.

Our aim is to assess whether patients receiving chronic statin treatment who are hospitalized with COVID-19 have reduced in-hospital mortality if statin therapy is maintained during hospitalization. METHODS: This work is a cross-sectional, observational, retrospective multicenter study that analyzed 2921 patients who required hospital admission at 150 Spanish centers included in the nationwide SEMI-COVID-19 Network. We compared the clinical characteristics and COVID-19 disease outcomes between patients receiving chronic statin therapy who maintained this therapy during hospitalization versus those who did not. Propensity score matching was used to match each statin user whose therapy was maintained during hospitalization to a statin user whose therapy was withdrawn during hospitalization. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, continuation of statin therapy was associated with lower all-cause mortality (OR 0.67, 0.54-0.83, p < 0.001); lower incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 0.76,0.6-0.97, p = 0.025), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR 0.78, 0.69- 0.89, p < 0.001), and sepsis (4.82% vs 9.85%, p = 0.008); and less need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (5.35% vs 8.57, p < 0.001) compared to patients whose statin therapy was withdrawn during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Patients previously treated with statins who are hospitalized for COVID-19 and maintain statin therapy during hospitalization have a lower mortality rate than those in whom therapy is withdrawn.

The technique involves creating a laminotomy trough to provide an adequate window for dissection of scar tissue to ensure safe placement of the electrode. We have applied this technique in eight patients. RESULTS Safe placement of SCS electrode was achieved in all eight patients without any complications. All electrodes were placed between T8 and T10 levels, and we were able to place the electrodes in the midline and achieve adequate coverage in all cases. CONCLUSION SCS is a widely accepted treatment modality for chronic neuropathic pain. Placement of paddle electrode can be challenging, usually because of the presence of epidural scar tissue.

The estimated frequency of renal involvement is 30% in Type 1 CG. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening disease in which there is a deficiency in ADAMTS13, a protease which normally functions to cleave von Willebrand factor (vWF). A deficiency leads to persistence of large vWF multimers and the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the microvasculature. We present a case of 52 years old female with Type 1 CG and acquired autoimmune TTP secondary to mild Covid-19 disease. Case Report: A 52-year-old woman with medical history significant for CKD stage 2, with baseline creatinine (Cr) of 2.5, Diffuse Large B-Cell Gastric Lymphoma (DLBCL), in complete remission, and recent diagnosis with COVID-19 presented to the ED for evaluation of three days of a petechial rash on her bilateral extremities. Significant labs on arrival included hemoglobin (Hgb) 8.9, platelet count 65, Cr of 3.65, and K+ 6.6, meeting criteria for acute kidney injury (AKI). Peripheral blood smear showed thrombocytopenia and normochromic normocytic anemia with no schistocytes or microangiopathic changes. ADAMTS13 was 43% and there was no clinical suspicion for TTP. The patient's Cr continued to worsen up to 8.1 during admission, prompting renal biopsy. Renal biopsy showed Type 1 cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis with vasculitis and 30 to 40% fibrosis of glomeruli. The patient was started on systemic steroids, plasma exchange every 2-3 day (completed 6 sessions) and hemodialysis. Her platelet counts steadily increased to 212 but had a significant drop to 32 when rechecked seven days later, prompting further investigation. ADAMTS13 was rechecked and found to be 5% with presence of inhibitor, Hgb was 7.7, haptoglobin was <20, and a diagnosis of TTP was made. The patient was started on daily plasmapheresis, rituximab, Caplacizumab and high dose systemic steroid therapy. Our patient had prior history of DLBCL and was treated with radiation therapy. Restaging PET/CT and EGD with biopsy showed no evidence of recurrence. Bone marrow biopsy was negative for evidence of lymphoma. Several serologic tests were used to rule out other etiologies of Type I CG and came back negative including: SLE, HIV, hepatitis C, multiple myeloma, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. The patient had elevations in multiple immune markers including IgG, IgM, free kappa light chains, and free lambda light chains. She also had hypocomplementemia of both C3 and C4. Discussion: The relationship of Type I CG and COVID-19 is unclear, though viral infections can trigger autoimmune diseases [3]. Previously, all patients with Type I CG had either a hematologic malignancy, solid-organ malignancy, infection, or autoimmune syndromes. Interestingly, in our patient, several serologic tests were performed and negative, which ruled out these etiologies of Type I CG. Our patient's manifestation of Type I CG was petechial rash on extremities and acute on chronic renal disease. Specific treatment of CG can include plasma exchange, corticosteroids, rituximab, and hemodialysis, depending on underlying cause. Our patient was started on systemic steroids, plasma exchange every 2-3 days, and hemodialysis due to worsening renal functions. Despite cases of covid-19 and TTP being reported, the relationship between the disease processes remains unclear. COVID-19 infection can cause disproportionate activation of the complement system and lead to excessive coagulation and thrombotic events. Systemic infection can decrease ADAMTS-13 activity, and this has also been noted in COVID studies. ADAMTS-13 deficiency has no pathophysiologic relevance specific to Type 1 CG. Our patient developed anemia and thrombocytopenia, and ADAMTS13 activity testing was found to be 5% with presence of an inhibitor. Considered as high-risk disease, our patient was started on steroids, rituximab, Caplacizumab and daily plasmapheresis. Repeated weekly ADAMTS13 level was 26% and platelets were stabilized at 69k/microL. Conclusion: Suggests that Covid-19 virus has the capability to induce cryoglobulinemia through an unknown mechanism ? There are two other case reports of an association between Covid-19 and TTP. ? May be the first case indicating a possible association of Covid-19 with cryoglobulinemia.

MethodsThe present retrospective cohort study evaluated the effectiveness of Vaxzevria and CoronaVac vaccines for COVID-19-related infection in 75,919,840 Brazilian vaccinees from January 18 to July 24, 2021. Study outcomes included documented infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19-related hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. We estimated VE using Cox regression adjusted for individual demographic characteristics. ResultsVaccination with Vaxzevria or CoronaVac was effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection and highly effective against hospitalization, ICU admission, and death in individuals up to 79 years. From 80-89 years of age, Vaxzevria led to 89.9%(95CI:87.7-91.7) VE against death versus 67.2%(95CI:63.6-70.5) for CoronaVac. Above 90 years, 65.4%(95CI:46.1-77.8) protection was conferred to Vaxzevria-vaccinated individuals versus 33.6%(95CI:21.9-43.5) in CoronaVac-vaccinated individuals. Furthermore, the post-vaccination daily incidence rate shows a stepwise increase from younger to elder decades of life. ConclusionsVaxzevria demonstrated overall effectiveness against severe COVID-19 up to 89 years and CoronaVac up to 79 years of age. There is a stepwise effectiveness reduction for both vaccines for each decade of life. Our results suggest that individuals aged 80 years or older may benefit from an expedited booster dose.

In the context of the work, illness-related absence was also named as one of the causes of stigma. The interviewees reported about distancing and avoiding contact, as well as allegations they were faced with. As a result, they suffered from negative feelings and partially from psychosomatic complaints. Some interviewees tried to avoid stigmatization by concealing their own profession or place of work.

The envelope mainly consists of the lipid bilayer, taken from the host cells at assembly/budding stage of the viral life cycle. Therefore the constitution of the lipid bilayer should be common in all SARS, MERS and influenza viruses, even after mutations, and thus these closely-related viruses will be disinfected by exposure to ethanol with the same concentration. Existing experimental data indicate that an ethanol concentration of 30~40 v/v% is sufficient to inactivate Influenza-A viruses in solution[1,2,3]. The author suggests that it may be possible to use alcoholic beverages of 16~20 v/v% concentration for this disinfection process, such as Whisky (1:1 hot water dilution) or Japanese Sake, because they are readily available and safe (non-toxic). By inhaling the alcohol vapor at 50~60$^\\\\circ$C (122~140$^\\\\circ$F) through the nose for one or two minutes, it will condense on surfaces inside the respiratory tract; mainly in the nasal cavity. The alcohol concentration will be intensified to ~36 v/v% by this process, which is enough to disinfect the corona virus on the mucous membrane. This method also provides more moisture into respiratory tract, and helps to clean the inside of the nasal cavity by stimulating blowing of the nose, and also makes the mucous escalator work actively so that the self-clearing mechanism in the trachea will remove viruses faster.

METHODS: Plaque-bearing APPswe/PS1 E9 and wildtype mice were treated with paroxetine per os at a dose of 5amg/kg/day, from 9 to 18 months of age. The per os treatment was monitored by recording of the body weights and serum paroxetine concentrations, and by assessment of the serotonin transporter occupancy by [3H]DASB-binding in wildtype mice. Additionally, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine was administered to 9-month-old APPswe/PS1 E9 mice, to examine the effect of serotonin depletion on A? pathology. A? pathology was evaluated by A? plaque load estimation and the A? 42/A? 40 ratio by ELISA. RESULTS: Paroxetine treatment led to > a80% serotonin transporter occupancy. The treatment increased the body weight of wildtype mice, but not of APPswe/PS1 E9 mice.

The performance of active chlorine generation at the anode was evaluated in Na2SO4/NaCl media, and a higher amount of active chlorine was produced at greater chloride concentration and higher current density. The probe experiments confirmed the coexistence of hydroxyl radical (a?OH) and Fe(IV)-oxo complex (FeIVO2+) in the HClO/Fe2+ system. The influence of initial pH, Fe2+ concentration, and applied current density on COD and NH4+-N abatement was elaborately investigated. The optimum pH was found to be 3.0, and the proper increase in Fe2+ dosage and current density resulted in higher COD removal due to the accelerated accumulation of a?OH and FeIVO2+ in the bulk liquid phase, whereas, the NH4+-N oxidation was significantly affected by the applied current density because of the effective active chlorine generation at higher current but was nearly independent of Fe2+ concentration. The reaction mechanism of electrochemical assisted HClO/Fe2+ treatment of landfill leachate was finally proposed. The powerful a?OH and FeIVO2+, in concomitance with active chlorine and M(a?OH), were responsible for COD abatement, and active chlorine played a key role in NH4+-N oxidation.

Nevertheless, OT effects on gliotransmitter release have been neglected. Methods: In purified astrocyte processes from adult rat striatum, we assessed OT receptor (OTR) and adenosine A2A receptor expression by confocal analysis. The effects of receptors activation on glutamate release from the processes were evaluated; A2A-OTR heteromerization was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation and PLA. Structure of the possible heterodimer of A2A and OT receptors was estimated by a bioinformatic approach. Results: Both A2A and OT receptors were expressed on the same astrocyte processes. Evidence for A2A-OTR receptor-receptor interaction was obtained by measuring the release of glutamate: OT inhibited the evoked glutamate release, while activation of A2A receptors, per se ineffective, abolished the OT effect. Biochemical and biophysical evidence for A2A-OTR heterodimers on striatal astrocytes was also obtained. The residues in the transmembrane domains 4 and 5 of both receptors are predicted to be mainly involved in the heteromerization. Conclusions: When considering effects of OT in striatum, modulation of glutamate release from the astrocyte processes and of glutamatergic synapse functioning, and the interaction with A2A receptors on the astrocyte processes should be taken into consideration.","output":"Heterodimer of A2A and Oxytocin Receptors Regulating Glutamate Release in Adult Striatal Astrocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The medication review process (MRP) is an extended, vital role of community pharmacists in improving health outcomes of medication use, yet it is neither systematically nor comprehensively provided bycommunity pharmacies in Jordan.

By using several experimental approaches, we investigated the potential association between SARS-CoV-2 IgGs recognizing the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) targeting S, and COVID-19 severity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This unicenter, retrospective, observational study included 51 hospitalized patients (24 at the intensive care unit; ICU). A total of 93 sera from these patients collected at different time points from the onset of symptoms were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgGs were quantitated by ELISA and NtAb50 titers were measured in a GFP reporterbased pseudotyped virus platform. Demographic and clinical data, complete blood counts, as well as serum levels of ferritin, Dimer-D, C reactive protein (CRP), lactose dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were retrieved from clinical charts. RESULTS: The overall correlation between levels of both antibody measurements was good (Rhoa?=a?0.82; Pa?=a?0a?<a?0.001). SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG and NtAb50 levels in sera collected up to day 30 after the onset of symptoms were comparable between ICU and non-ICU patients (P=>0.1).

Reporting of mEMA protocols and compliance has been identified as problematic within systematic reviews of children, youth, and specific clinical populations of adults. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to describe the use of mEMA for self-reported behaviors and psychological constructs, mEMA protocol and compliance reporting, and associations between key components of mEMA protocols and compliance in studies of nonclinical and clinical samples of adults. METHODS In total, 9 electronic databases were searched (2006-2016) for observational studies reporting compliance to mEMA for health-related data from adults (>18 years) in nonclinical and clinical settings. Screening and data extraction were undertaken by independent reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Narrative synthesis described participants, mEMA target, protocol, and compliance. Random effects meta-analysis explored factors associated with cohort compliance (monitoring duration, daily prompt frequency or schedule, device type, training, incentives, and burden score). Random effects analysis of variance (P.05) assessed differences between nonclinical and clinical data sets. RESULTS Of the 168 eligible studies, 97/105 (57.7%) reported compliance in unique data sets (nonclinical=64/105 [61%], clinical=41/105 [39%]). The most common self-reported mEMA target was affect (primary target: 31/105, 29.5% data sets; secondary target: 50/105, 47.6% data sets). The median duration of the mEMA protocol was 7 days (nonclinical=7, clinical=12). Most protocols used a single time-based (random or interval) prompt type (69/105, 65.7%); median prompt frequency was 5 per day. The median number of items per prompt was similar for nonclinical (8) and clinical data sets (10). More than half of the data sets reported mEMA training (84/105, 80%) and provision of participant incentives (66/105, 62.9%). Less than half of the data sets reported number of prompts delivered (22/105, 21%), answered (43/105, 41%), criterion for valid mEMA data (37/105, 35.2%), or response latency (38/105, 36.2%). Meta-analysis (nonclinical=41, clinical=27) estimated an overall compliance of 81.9% (95% CI 79.1-84.4), with no significant difference between nonclinical and clinical data sets or estimates before or after data exclusions. Compliance was associated with prompts per day and items per prompt for nonclinical data sets. Although widespread heterogeneity existed across analysis (I2>90%), no compelling relationship was identified between key features of mEMA protocols representing burden and mEMA compliance. CONCLUSIONS In this 10-year sample of studies using the mEMA of self-reported health-related behaviors and psychological constructs in adult nonclinical and clinical populations, mEMA was applied across contexts and health conditions and to collect a range of health-related data. There was inconsistent reporting of compliance and key features within protocols, which limited the ability to confidently identify components of mEMA schedules likely to have a specific impact on compliance.","output":"Compliance With Mobile Ecological Momentary Assessment of Self-Reported Health-Related Behaviors and Psychological Constructs in Adults: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Viral infections contribute to morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF), but the impact of respiratory viruses on the development of airway disease is poorly understood. METHODS: Infants with CF identified by newborn screening were enrolled prior to 4 months of age to participate in a prospective observational study at 4 centers. Clinical data were collected at clinic visits and weekly phone calls. Multiplex PCR assays were performed on nasopharyngeal swabs to detect respiratory viruses during routine visits and when symptomatic. Participants underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and a subset underwent pulmonary function testing. We present findings through 8.5 months of life. RESULTS: Seventy infants were enrolled, mean age 3.1  0.8 months. Rhinovirus was the most prevalent virus (66%), followed by parainfluenza (19%), and coronavirus (16%). Participants had a median of 1.5 viral positive swabs (range 0C10). Past viral infection was associated with elevated neutrophil concentrations and bacterial isolates in BAL fluid, including recovery of classic CF bacterial pathogens. When antibiotics were prescribed for respiratory-related indications, viruses were identified in 52% of those instances. CONCLUSIONS: Early viral infections were associated with greater neutrophilic inflammation and bacterial pathogens. Early viral infections appear to contribute to initiation of lower airway inflammation in infants with CF. Antibiotics were commonly prescribed in the setting of a viral infection.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed 370 HCPs employed at All India Institute of Medical Sciences Patna over 3 months, using the standard Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) for suspected GAD and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for sleep quality. Results were tabulated and multivariable binomial logistic regression analysis was done to determine the predictors of poor sleep. Significance was attributed to p<0.05. RESULTS: Of the 370 HCPs screened, 52 (14.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.8%C18.1%) were found to have GAD and 195 (52.7%; 95% CI, 47.5%C57.9%) were found to be poor sleepers.

Recent job losses, rising debt, bereavement and deteriorated mental health, all inevitably increase hardship. Poverty increases the risk of chronic diseases, mental illnesses, accidents and trauma. Surprisingly, families living in the west of Enfield and Haringey live almost 15 years longer in good health than those in the east!ObjectivesWe challenged our paediatric staff to start seeing poverty as a chronic health problem and not just a moral issue. By screening for poverty, as we do other health risks, we can identify and intervene for vulnerable families and offer them essential help.MethodsIn July 2019 we explored paediatric doctors awareness of the social determinants of health. Using quality improvement methodology we built upon our pilot project in Kingston Hospital. Barriers to screening and possible questions were discussed. Education sessions, email communications, text reminders and leaflets were shared regularly with paediatric staff. Surveys were planned to monitor staff progress and record families being signposted.ResultsBarriers to screening for poverty included a perceived lack of time, inexperience, being unaware of resources and inadequate privacy during clinical assessments. In October 2019, only 10% of staff surveyed routinely screened for poverty. 13% felt they had sufficient knowledge of where to signpost families in need and 22% recalled giving social help in the preceding 3 months.To improve these rates we devised change ideas:screening questions co-designed with parents,123 fight inequality leaflets of practical resources co-produced,presentations and workshops with local parents who had suffered hardship.Despite these and regular communications to staff, poverty screening rates worsened during the pandemic. In October 2020 we re-launched Connected Communities (CC) and the provision of support workers within the hospital. Staff reported feeling empowered knowing that practical help would be given. A poverty screening guideline was drafted with case studies and recommended screening using framing like:Since the pandemic we know more parents are finding it difficult to pay bills/debts, afford food or find employment, - do you? Or asking do you worry that your housing is affecting your childs health? We delivered teaching together with CC support workers in February 2021.In March 2021, 43% of doctors and nurses surveyed reported they had screened the last patient they saw;79% were aware of resources and;67% had signposted someone to help in the last 3 months. From zero introductions to Connected Communities in October 2020, a staggering 95 parents have been screened and recommended to contact our support workers. Only 23 have engaged so far and they have received help with housing, finances/benefits and citizenship. Ten do not speak English but will be supported to access advice.ConclusionsTackling health inequalities takes commitment. By seeing, screening and intervening, we help reduce stigma and identify vulnerable families. Our close partnership with Connected Communities increased staff confidence and increased introductions.

Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective study of 56 COVID-19 infected hospitalized African American males 50+ years of age selected from among non-intensive care unit (ICU) and ICU status patients. Demographics, hospitalization-related variables, and medical history were collected from electronic medical records. Plasma samples collected close to admission (2 days) were evaluated for cytokines and renal markers; results were compared to a control group (n = 31) and related to COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. Results: Among COVID-19 patients, eight (14.2%) suffered in-hospital mortality; seven (23.3%) in the ICU and one (3.8%) among non-ICU patients. Interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-33 were elevated at admission in COVID-19 patients in comparison with controls. IL-6, IL-18, MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-1/CCL3, IL-33, GST, and osteopontin were upregulated at admission in ICU patients in comparison with controls.

All over the world, since the very beginning of the pandemic, older adults have been considered one of the groups at highest risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and death due to COVID-19. The aim of the study was to evaluate the severity of anxiety symptoms related to COVID-19 in the older adults who are participants of the Universities of the Third Age in Poland. Material and methods: The study included participants of the University of the Third Age in Poland. A total of 296 persons were enrolled, including 258 women and 38 men. The study was a diagnostic survey, conducted with the use of the following validated psychometric scales: General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: In two scales (STAI and SHAI), the mean scores demonstrated mild symptoms indicative of anxiety disorders in the older respondents. Women and men did differ significantly in terms of the scores obtained in STAI X-1 and STAI X-2. Single respondents differed significantly from divorced ones in terms of STAI X-1 scores. Moreover, widows/widowers differed significantly from divorced ones in terms of STAI X-2, and GAD-7 scores. Respondents declaring their financial status as average differed significantly from those declaring their financial status as good in terms of: STAI X-1, STAI X-2, SHAI, and GAD-7 scores. Conclusions: The subjective experience of anxiety symptoms associated with fear of contracting COVID-19 was increased due to the ongoing pandemic, but was not significantly high in the analysed population of older people. COVID-19-related anxiety was significantly more common in lonely individuals and in those of worse financial status.

A chest CT scan showed an acute type B aortic dissection (ATBAD) and bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity, compatible with interstitial pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal swabs resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. For the persistence of chest pain, despite the analgesic therapy, we decided to treat her with a TEVAR. Patient's chest and back pain resolved during the first few days after the procedure. No surgical or respiratory complications occurred and the patient was discharged 14 days after surgery.

In this study, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and perform meta-analyses of the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D among the children of the South Asian countries. METHODS: Two major electronic search engines (PubMed and Scopus) and one database (Google scholar) were used; original studies, conducted among South Asian children and adolescents and published between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2019. A random-effect meta-analysis was also performed to calculate the pooled prevalence of hypovitaminosis D followed by subgroup analyses for countries and age groups. RESULTS: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 41 studies with a total population size of 18,233 were finally selected. The overall prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was 61% [95% CI: 46% to 71%] with highly significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 99.72%; p < 0.0001). The average level of serum vitamin D ranged from 5 ng/mL to 34 ng/mL, with a weighted mean of 19.15 ng/mL (weighted standard deviation 11.59 ng/mL). Country-wise analysis showed that hypovitaminosis D in Afghanistan was the highest [96.2%; 95% CI: 91% to 99%], followed by Pakistan [94%; 95% CI: 90% to 96%], India [64%; 95% CI: 46% to 79%], Bangladesh [35.48%; 95% CI: 32% to 39%], Nepal [35%; 95% CI: 1% to 83%], and Sri Lanka [25%; 95% CI: 16% to 36%].

Design: Using the 2005C2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we employed Negative Binomial Regression (NBRG) in a sample of 24,166 adults. We used a 9-item PHQ (Public Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9) to measure the presence of depressive symptoms as an outcome variable. Additionally, we plotted a concentration curve to explain how depression is distributed among PIR. Results: In comparison with high-income, the low-income population in the study suffered more from greater than or equal to ten on the PHQ-9 by 4.5 and 3.5 times, respectively.

Forty-two tracheostomies were performed in COVID-19 patients aged 68.4  11.1 years, predominantly men (71%) and caucasians (81%). They had at least 1 comorbidity (93%), on average 3. The most frequent were heart disease (71%), age > 65 years (67%) diabetes (40%) and obesity (33%). The greater number of comorbidities was associated with the lesser probability of the patient's recovery (p = .001). Age (p = .047) and renal failure (p = .013) were associated with higher mortality. Patients were tracheostomized by prolonged endo-tracheal intubation (50%), pneumonia (33%) and extubation failure (10%). Ventilation time before the tracheostomy (22.9  6.5 days) was higher than ventilation time after the tracheostomy (7.1  15.1 days) (p < 0.001). No differences were found in ventilation time (p = 0.094) and tracheostomy time (p = 0.514) in the different indications. There were 3 minor complications (7.1%), 25 discharges (60%) and 11 deaths (26%). During the same period 49 tracheostomies were performed in patients without COVID-19, with a homogeneous gender and age distribution, 31% without comorbidities, with an average of 1 comorbidity per patient and higher mortality (43%).

In addition, studies have shown the impact of a child's physical and psychosocial environment on developing brain structure and function. A rate-limiting complication in these studies, however, is the high cost and infrastructural requirements of modern MRI systems. High costs mean many neuroimaging studies typically include fewer than 100 individuals and are performed predominately in high resource hospitals and university settings within high income countries (HICs). As a result, our knowledge of brain development, particularly in children who live in lower and middle income countries (LMICs) is relatively limited.

In an effort to have a better predictive model of animal host susceptibility to SC2, we expressed the ACE2 and/or transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) genes from humans and other animal species in the avian fibroblast cell line, DF1, that is not permissive to infection. We demonstrated that expression of both human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes is necessary to support SC2 infection and replication in DF1 and a non-permissive sub-lineage of MDCK cells. Titers of SC2 in these cell lines were comparable to those observed in control Vero cells. To further test the model, we developed seven additional transgenic cell lines expressing the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 derived from Felis (cat), Equus (horse), Sus (pig), Capra (goat), Mesocricetus (Golden hamster), Myotis lucifugus (Little Brown bat) and Hipposideros armiger (Great Roundleaf bat) in DF1 cells. Results demonstrate permissive replication of SC2 in cat, Golden hamster, and goat species, but not pig or horse, which correlated with the results of reported challenge studies. The development of this cell culture model allows for more efficient testing of the potential susceptibility of many different animal species for SC2 and emerging variant viruses. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) is believed to have originated in animal species and jumped into humans where it has produced the greatest viral pandemic of our time. Identification of animal species susceptible to SC2 infection would provide information on potential zoonotic reservoirs, and transmission potential at the human-animal interface. Our work provides a model system to test the ability of the virus to replicate in an otherwise non-permissive cell line by transgenic insertion of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes from human and other animal species. The results from our in vitro model positively correlate with animal infection studies enhancing the predicative capability of the model. Importantly, we demonstrate that both proteins are required for successful virus replication. These findings establish a framework to test other animal species for susceptibility to infection that may be critical zoonotic reservoirs for transmission, as well as to test variant viruses that arise over time.","output":"Development of an in vitro model for animal species susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 replication based on expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in avian cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infrasternal mediastinoscopic single-incision surgery is a minimally invasive surgical option for patients with anterior mediastinal lesions.

METHODS Over a period of 56 months, all consecutive patients who underwent SG were documented in this prospective, single-center, observational study. The study endpoints included complication rates, nutritional deficiencies and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL). RESULTS From September 26, 2005 to May 28, 2009, 100 patients (female: male = 59:41) with a mean age of 43.6 years (range: 22-64) and a preoperative BMI of 52.3 kg/2 (range: 36-77) underwent SG. The mean operative time was 86.4 min (range: 35-275). Major complications were observed in 8.0 % of the patients. During the follow-up period, 25 patients (25.0 %) underwent a second bariatric intervention (22 DS and 3 RYGBP). Out of the total 100 patients, 48 % were supplemented with iron, 33 % with zinc, 34 % with a combination of calcium carbonate and cholecalciferol, 24 % with vitamin D, 42 % with vitamin B12 and 40 % with folic acid. The patients who received only a SG (n = 75) had %EWL of 53.6, 65.8 and 62.6 % after 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively.

These patients had an overweight, stocky habitus, a plethoric appearance with suffusion of the eyes, tense and anxious personalities, a cigarette smoking habit, vascular disease, headaches, and facial rubor. Later studies identified alcoholism, diuretic therapy, and physical or emotional stress as additional risk factors that might contribute to the onset of this syndrome. This review revisits Gaisbock syndrome based on recent literature, and will highlight contemporary studies that have established an association between erythrocytosis and hypertension and associated risk factors. Several mechanisms help explain the pathophysiology underlying Gaisbock's observations, and these include psychiatric disorders resulting in chronic stress, volume contraction secondary to diuretics and hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea with nocturnal hypoxemia and erythropoietin production. Complications associated with this syndrome include the formation of microthrombi with cerebral infarction; treatment should focus on the management of hypertension and a reduction in risk factors, such as obesity, cigarette smoking, and alcohol use.

Eligible participants were adult patients with CKD, defined as a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) 200C5000 mg/g and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 25C75 mL/min/1.73 m(2). All-cause mortality was a key secondary endpoint. Cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular death was adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee. The DAPA-CKD trial randomized participants to dapagliflozin 10 mg/day (n = 2152) or placebo (n = 2152). The mean age was 62 years, 33% were women, the mean eGFR was 43.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and the median UACR was 949 mg/g.

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) was used to measure antibody affinity against prefusion spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) and RBD mutants. FINDINGS: Higher neutralizing antibodies were observed in convalescent vs. na?ve adults against, WA-1, VOCs, and VOIs. Antibody binding to RBD and RBD mutants showed lower binding of post-vaccination sera from na?ve compared with convalescent individuals. Moreover, we observed early antibody affinity maturation in convalescent individuals after one vaccine dose and higher antibody affinity after two doses compared with the na?ve group. Among the na?ve participants, antibody affinity against the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion spike was significantly higher for males than females even though there were no difference in neutralization titers between sexes.

The primary aim of the study is to describe the chronology of lung pathologic changes in COVID-19 by using a post-mortem transbronchial lung cryobiopsy approach. Our secondary aim is to correlate the histologic findings with computed tomography patterns. SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, who died while intubated and mechanically ventilated, were enrolled. The procedure was performed 30 min after death, and all lung lobes sampled. Histopathologic analysis was performed on thirty-nine adequate samples from eight patients: two patients (illness duration < 14 days) showed early/exudative phase diffuse alveolar damage, while the remaining 6 patients (median illness duration-32 days) showed progressive histologic patterns (3 with mid/proliferative phase; 3 with late/fibrotic phase diffuse alveolar damage, one of which with honeycombing). Immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was positive predominantly in early-phase lesions. Histologic patterns and tomography categories were correlated: early/exudative phase was associated with ground-glass opacity, mid/proliferative lesions with crazy paving, while late/fibrous phase correlated with the consolidation pattern, more frequently seen in the lower/middle lobes. This study uses an innovative cryobiopsy approach for the post-mortem sampling of lung tissues from COVID-19 patients demonstrating the progression of fibrosis in time and correlation with computed tomography features.

In the complete absence of O2, E. coli can perform a mixed-acid fermentation that contains within it an elaborate metabolism of formic acid. In this study, we use cavity-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (CERS), FTIR, liquid Raman spectroscopy, isotopic labelling and molecular genetics to make advances in the understanding of bacterial formate and H2 metabolism. It is shown that, under anaerobic (anoxic) conditions, formic acid is generated endogenously, excreted briefly from the cell, and then taken up again to be disproportionated to H2 and CO2 by formate hydrogenlyase (FHL-1). However, exogenously added D-labelled formate behaves quite differently from the endogenous formate and is taken up immediately, independently, and possibly by a different mechanism, by the cell and converted to H2 and CO2. Our data support an anion-proton symport model for formic acid transport. In addition, when E. coli was grown in a micro-aerobic (micro-oxic) environment it was possible to analyse aspects of formate and O2 respiration occurring alongside anaerobic metabolism. While cells growing under micro-aerobic conditions generated endogenous formic acid, no H2 was produced. However, addition of exogenous formate at the outset of cell growth did induce FHL-1 biosynthesis and resulted in formate-dependent H2 production in the presence of O2.","output":"Hydrogen production in the presence of oxygen by Escherichia coli K-12."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Saliva specimens collected in school populations may offer a more feasible, noninvasive alternative to nasal swabs for large-scale COVID-19 testing efforts in kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) schools.

Both critical illness and chronic illness are characterized by inflammation and, as such, hepatic reprioritization of protein synthesis occurs, resulting in lower serum concentrations of albumin and prealbumin. In addition, the redistribution of serum proteins occurs because of an increase in capillary permeability. There is an association between inflammation and malnutrition, however, not between malnutrition and visceral-protein levels. These proteins correlate well with patients' risk for adverse outcomes rather than with protein-energy malnutrition. Therefore, serum albumin and prealbumin should not serve as proxy measures of total body protein or total muscle mass and should not be used as nutrition markers.

Here, a new point-of-care approach for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody detection in human serum based on magnetic immuno-detection is described and compared to standard ELISA. For magnetic immuno-detection, immunofiltration columns were coated with a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide. SARS-CoV-2 peptide reactive antibodies, spiked at different concentrations into PBS and human serum, were rinsed through immunofiltration columns. Specific antibodies were retained within the IFC and labelled with an isotype specific biotinylated antibody. Streptavidin-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles were applied to label the secondary antibodies. Enriched magnetic nanoparticles were then detected by means of frequency magnetic mixing detection technology, using a portable magnetic read-out device. Measuring signals corresponded to the amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in the sample. Our preliminary magnetic immuno-detection setup resulted in a higher sensitivity and broader detection range and was four times faster than ELISA.

Initially, four hundred RMW image samples, including non-tumor and tumor(s) in different locations are collected from the implemented MWHI system. The RMW image dimension is 640  640 pixels. After that, image pre-processing and augmentation techniques are applied to generate the training dataset, consisting of 4400 images. Later, 80% of images are used to train the models, and 20% are used for testing. Later, from the 80% training dataset, 20% are utilized to validate the models. The detection and classification performances are evaluated by three variations of the YOLOv5 model: YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, and YOLOv5l. It is investigated that the YOLOv5l model performed better compared to YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, and state-of-the-art object detection models.

This study aimed to assess the safety and feasibility of robotic transaxillary thyroidectomy (RTT) for GD in comparison with the conventional open thyroidectomy (open group: OG) approach. METHODS A total of 192 patients who underwent surgical resection for GD were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 51 patients underwent RTT and the remaining 141 patients were in the conventional OG. RESULTS All robotic operations were performed successfully without open conversion. Patients who underwent RTT were significantly younger (P < 0.001) and predominantly of the female sex. Operative time was longer for RTT than for the OG (182.5  58.1 vs. 112.0  29.5; P < 0.001). The mean intraoperative blood loss was not statistically different between RTT and the OG (113.3  161.6 vs. 95.3  209.1, P = 0.223). The mean weight of the resected thyroid was reduced in those who underwent RTT compared with open thyroidectomy (P = 0.033). The overall complication rate for RTT and open thyroidectomy was not significantly different (33.3% vs. 22.7%, P = 0.135). In RTT, the most common complication was transient hypocalcemia (21%). Permanent hypocalcemia and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury occurred in only one patient in each group.

First, a Millian-liberal argument justifies lockdown measures in order to protect liberty under pandemic conditions, consistent with commonly accepted principles of public health ethics. Second, a wider argument contextualizes specific issues that attend acting on the justified lockdown for western liberal democratic states, as modeled on discourse and accounted for by Jrgen Habermas. The authors argue that a range of norms are constructed in societies that, justifiably, need to be curtailed for the pandemic. The state has to take on the unusual role of sole guardian of norms under emergency pandemic conditions. Consistently with both the Millian-liberal justification and elements of Habermasian discourse ethics, they argue that that role can only be justified where it includes strategy for how to return political decisionmaking to the status quo ante. This is because emergency conditions are only justified as a means to protecting prepandemic norms. To this end, the authors propose that an emergency power committee is necessary to guarantee that state action during pandemic is aimed at re-establishing the conditions of legitimacy of government action that ecological factors (a virus) have temporarily curtailed.","output":"Return to Status Quo Ante: The Need for Robust and Reversible Pandemic Emergency Measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic intensified the global health crisis, the containment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancies, and the inherent risk of vertical transmission of virus from mother-to-fetus (or neonate) poses a major concern. Most COVID-19-Pregnancy patients showed mild to moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with no pregnancy loss and no congenital transmission of the virus; however, an increase in hypoxia-induced preterm deliveries was apparent. Also, the breastmilk of several mothers with COVID-19 tested negative for the virus. Taken together, the natural barrier function during pregnancy and postpartum seems to deter the SARS-CoV-2 transmission from mother-to-child. This clinical observation warrants to explore the maternal-fetal interface and identify the innate defense factors for prevention and control of COVID-19-Pregnancy. Lactoferrin (LF) is a potent antiviral iron-binding protein present in the maternal-fetal interface. In concert with immune co-factors, maternal-LF modulates chemokine release and lymphocyte migration and amplify host defense during pregnancy. LF levels during pregnancy may resolve hypertension via down-regulation of ACE2; consequently, may limit the membrane receptor access to SARS-CoV-2 for cellular entry. Furthermore, an LF-derived peptide (LRPVAA) has been shown to block ACE receptor activity in vitro. LF may also reduce viral docking and entry into host cells and limit the early phase of COVID-19 infection.

Our main objective was to develop a core outcome set (COS) for use in trials aimed at improving AMS in care homes. METHODS: A refined inventory of outcomes for AMS interventions in care homes, compiled from a previous study, was rated in a three-round international Delphi survey with 82 participants, using a nine-point Likert scale (from 1, unimportant, to 9, critical). This was followed by an online consensus exercise with 12 participants from Northern Ireland to finalise the COS content. Subsequently, a suitable outcome measurement instrument (OMI) was selected for each outcome in the COS by: identifying existing OMIs through a literature search and experts' suggestions, assessing the quality of OMIs, and selecting one OMI for each core outcome via a two-round international Delphi survey with 59 participants. RESULTS: Of 14 outcomes initially presented, consensus was reached for inclusion of five outcomes in the COS after the three-round Delphi survey and the online consensus exercise, comprising the total number of antimicrobial courses prescribed, appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing, days of therapy per 1000 resident-days, rate of antimicrobial resistance, and mortality related to infection.

In addition to respiratory involvement, COVID-19 was also associated with significant multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Cardiovascular impairment has been observed and is now drawing growing attention. Cardiovascular protective strategies are urgent and of great significance to the overall prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Direct viral infection, cytokine storm, and aggravation of existing cardiovascular diseases were recognized as possible mechanisms of cardiovascular impairment in COVID-19. Hyperactivated inflammation plays an important role in all three mechanisms and is considered to be fundamental in the development of cardiovascular impairment and MODS in COVID-19. Therefore, in addition to conventional cardiovascular treatment, anti-inflammatory therapy is a reasonable strategy for severe cases to further enhance cardiovascular protection and potentially mitigate MODS. We reviewed the inflammatory features and current promising treatments of COVID-19 as well as cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapies that have been verified in previous clinical trials with positive outcomes. We believe that targeting the central pathway (IL-1, TNF-, IL-6), balancing the Th1 and Th2 response, and administering long-term anti-inflammatory therapy might be promising prospects to reduce cardiovascular impairment and even MODS during the acute and recovery phases of COVID-19. The cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapies might be of great application value to the management of COVID-19 patients and we further propose an algorithm for the selection of anti-inflammatory therapy for COVID-19 patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular impairment. We recommend to take the experiences in cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapy as references in the management of COVID-19 and conduct related clinical trials, while the clinical translation of novel treatments from preclinical studies or in vitro drug screening should proceed with caution due to unguaranteed efficacy and safety profiles.","output":"Cardiovascular Impairment in COVID-19: Learning From Current Options for Cardiovascular Anti-Inflammatory Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen Antecedentes y objetivo: En los ltimos meses se han realizado grandes esfuerzos para evaluar las terapias ms eficaces en el manejo de pacientes con COVID-19.

Abstract Background and objectives: In the last months great efforts have been developed to evaluate the more efficient therapeutic agents in the management of patients with COVID-19. Currently, no specific drug combination has consistently demonstrated an association with mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the pattern of associations observed between the different in-hospital treatments administered to a series of 238 patients admitted for COVID-19 and their relationship with mortality. Methods: The electronic medical records of patients that discharged or died from COVID-19 in the Hospital Universitario San Cecilio (Granada, Spain) between March 16 and April 10, 2020 were analysed. From these records, information was obtained on sex, age, comorbidities at admission, clinical information, analytical parameters, imaging tests and empirical treatments used. The outcome variable was the in-hospital mortality. To estimate the associations between the different therapeutic alternatives and the risk of mortality, Hazard Ratios adjusted for age, sex, previous pathologies and severity at discharge were estimated using Cox Regression models. Results: The most frequently used combination of drugs was low molecular weight heparins, hydroxychloroquine, and ritonavir/lopinavir. None of the analysed treatments showed independent association with mortality. The drugs that showed a greater inverse association with mortality were tocilizumab and corticoids. Conclusions: The observed association patterns are consistent with previous literature. It seems necessary to design randomized controlled clinical trials that evaluate the possible protector effect of tocilizumab and corticoids in the risk of mortality for some subgroups of COVID-19 hospitalized patients.","output":"Agentes teraputicos utilizados en 238 pacientes hospitalizados por COVID-19 y su relacin con la mortalidad"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Transperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) urethrovesical anastomosis is a critical step. Although the prevalence of urine leaks ranges from 4.5% to 7.5% at high-volume RALP centers, urine leaks prolong catheterization and may lead to ileus, peritonitis, and require intervention. Barbed polyglyconate sutures maintain running suture line tension and may be advantageous in RALP anastomosis for reducing this complication. OBJECTIVE To compare barbed polyglyconate and polyglactin 910 (Vicryl, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) running sutures for RALP anastomosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-surgeon study comparing RALP anastomosis using either barbed polyglyconate (n = 45) or polyglactin 910 (n = 36) sutures. SURGICAL PROCEDURE RALP anastomosis using either barbed polyglyconate or polyglactin 910 sutures was studied. MEASUREMENTS Operative time, cost differential, perioperative complications, and cystogram contrast extravasation by anastomosis suture type were measured. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Although baseline characteristics and overall operative times were similar, barbed polyglyconate sutures were associated with shorter mean anastomosis times of 9.7 min versus 9.8 min (p = 0.014). In addition, anastomosis with barbed polyglyconate rather than polyglactin 910 sutures was associated with more frequent cystogram extravasation 8 d postoperatively (20.0% vs 2.8%; p = 0.019), longer mean catheterization times (11.1 d vs 8.3 d; p = 0.048), and greater suture costs per case ($51.52 vs $8.44; p < 0.001). After 8 of 29 (27.6%) barbed polyglyconate anastomosis sites demonstrated postoperative day 8 cystogram extravasation, we modified our technique to avoid overtightening, reducing cystogram extravasation to 1 (6.3%) of 16 subsequent barbed polyglyconate anastomosis sites. Potential limitations include small sample size and the single-surgeon study design. CONCLUSIONS Compared to traditional sutures, barbed polyglyconate is more costly and requires technical modification to avoid overtightening, delayed healing, and longer catheterization time following RALP.","output":"Randomized controlled trial of barbed polyglyconate versus polyglactin suture for robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy anastomosis: technique and outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a novel Hamming distance tolerant content-addressable memory (HD-CAM) for energy-efficient in memory approximate matching applications.

We studied Spike-specific humoral and cellular immunity in Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated individuals (n=55) who were either primed with Ad26.COV2.S only (n=13), or boosted with a homologous (Ad26.COV2.S, n=28) or heterologous (BNT162b2, n=14) second dose.

We observed that a strategy of heterologous vaccination enhanced the quantity and breadth of both, Spike-specific humoral and cellular immunity in Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated. In contrast, the impact of homologous boost was quantitatively minimal in Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated and Spike-specific antibodies and T cells were narrowly focused to the S1 region.

Methods: Three hundred subjects who were divided into five groups according to age were enrolled in this study. AA and pupil diameter were measured three times from both eyes using Tonoref III (NIDEK Co., Ltd.). Results: The mean AA was 1.63250.061 Diopter (D) (0.13-9.11 D). The mean AA values were statistically significantly different between the groups (p=0.000). It was not observed gender effect on AA (p=0.115). Although there was no significant difference between emmetropic and myopic groups, there were significant differences between emmetropic and hyperopic groups and also between myopic and hyperopic groups concerning AA (p=0.000, for both). A statistically significant difference was found for the mean AA between the groups with and without refractive surgery (p=0.028). Correlation analysis revealed that AA is increased as the mean pupil diameter increases (p=0.000, r=0.202) and the mean pupil diameter decreases with increasing age (p=0.000, r=-0.308). When the AA obtained from the patients in group 1 were compared with the AA values obtained by subjective accommodation tests, the AA values obtained by autorefractometer device were found to be correlated with push up, push down and minus lens tests (r=0.577, r=0.682, r=0.427) AA values obtained by autorefractometer device were found to be statistically significantly lower than other subjective tests (p<0.001). Conclusion: The Tonoref III device seems to provide objective AA measurements in presbyopic or non-presbyopic individuals.

The restoration of skin's anatomic continuity and function following injury is a multifaceted, dynamic, well-coordinated process that is highly dependent on signalling pathways, including the canonical Wnt/? catenin pathway, all aimed at restoring the skin's protective barrier. Compromised and inappropriate tissue restoration processes are often the source of wound chronicity. Diabetic patients have a high risk of developing major impediments including wound contamination and limb amputation due to chronic, non-healing wounds. Photobiomodulation (PBM) involves the application of low-powered light at specific wavelengths to influence different biological activities that incite and quicken tissue restoration. PBM has been shown to modulate cellular behaviour through a variety of signal transduction pathways, including the Wnt/? catenin pathway; however, the role of Wnt/? catenin in chronic wound healing in response to PBM has not been fully defined. This review largely focuses on the role of key signalling pathways in human skin wound repair, specifically, the canonical Wnt/?-catenin pathway, and the effects of PBM on chronic wound healing.","output":"Regulatory Processes of the Canonical Wnt/?-Catenin Pathway and Photobiomodulation in Diabetic Wound Repair"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Central pancreatectomy is a definitive treatment for low-grade tumors of the pancreatic neck that preserves pancreatic and splenic function at the potential expense of postoperative pancreatic fistula. We analyzed outcomes after robot-assisted central pancreatectomy (RACP) to reexamine the risk-benefit profile in the era of minimally invasive surgery. METHODS Retrospective analysis of nine RACP performed between August 2009 through June 2010 at a single institution. RESULTS The average age of the cohort was 64 (range 18-75 years) with six women (67 %). Indications for surgery included: five benign cystic neoplasm and four pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Median operative time was 425 min (range 305-506 min) with 190 ml median blood loss (range 50-350 ml) and one conversion to open due to poor visualization. Median tumor size was 3.0 cm (range 1.9-6.0 cm); all patients achieved R0 status. Pancreaticogastrostomy was performed in seven cases and pancreaticojejunostomy in two. The median length of hospital stay was 10 days (range 7-19). Two clinically significant pancreatic fistulae occurred with one requiring percutaneous drainage. No patients exhibited worsening diabetes or exocrine insufficiency at the 30-day postoperative visit. CONCLUSIONS RACP can be performed with safety and oncologic outcomes equivalent to published open series.

Since single molecule sensors, e.g., nanopores, can sense biomolecules at low concentrations, they have the potential to become clinically relevant in many of today's medical settings. With nanopore-based sensing, lower volumes and concentrations are required for detection, enabling it to be clinically beneficial. Other advantages to using nanopores include that they are tunable to an enormous variety of molecules and boast low costs, and fabrication is scalable for manufacturing.

We introduce a subsistence level of consumption into a tractable heterogeneous agent framework, and use this framework to characterize optimal joint policies of a lockdown and transfer payments. In our model, a more stringent lockdown helps fighting the pandemic, but it also deepens the recession, which implies that poorer parts of society find it harder to subsist. This reduces their compliance with the lockdown, and may cause deprivation of the very poor, giving rise to an excruciating trade-off between saving lives from the pandemic and from deprivation. Transfer payments help mitigate this trade-off. We show that, ceteris paribus, the optimal lockdown is stricter in richer countries and the aggregate death burden and welfare losses smaller. We then consider a government borrowing constraint and show that limited fiscal space lowers the optimal lockdown and welfare, and increases the aggregate death burden during the pandemic. This is particularly true in societies where a larger fraction of the population is in poverty. We discuss evidence from the literature and provide reduced-form regressions that support the relevance of our main mechanisms.

Among antibody sources, immunoglobulin Y (IgY) is the major antibody found in chicken eggs and can be used as an alternative to mammalian antibodies normally used in research and immunotherapy. In this study, phage-expressing chicken monoclonal scFv antibody was chosen and characterized with phage display antibody technology. Truncated fragments of SARS-CoV spike protein were cloned in pET-21 vector and expressed in BL-21 Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells. After purification, the purity of these recombinant spike proteins was examined on SDSCPAGE and their identity verified with Western blot analysis using anti-his antibodies and sera from convalescent stage SARS-CoV-infected patients. Using these bacteria-derived proteins to immunize chickens, it was found that polyclonal IgY antibodies in the egg yolk and sera were highly reactive to the immunogens, as shown by Western blot and immunocytochemical staining analysis. A phage displaying scFv library was also established from spleen B cells of immunized chicken with 5  10(7) clones. After four panning cycles, the eluted phage titer showed a 10-fold increase. In sequence analysis with chicken germline gene, five phage clones reacted, with large dissimilarities of between 31 and 62%, in the complementarity-determining regions, one dominant phage 4S1 had strong binding to fragment Se-e, located between amino acid residues 456C650 of the spike protein and this particular phage had significantly strong binding to SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells.

Stopping the relatively small number of parasites injected by the mosquito before they can migrate from the skin to the liver is an attractive means to this goal. Antibody-eliciting vaccines have been used to pursue this objective by targeting the major parasite surface protein present during this stage, the circumsporozoite protein (CSP). While CSP-based vaccines have recently had encouraging success in disease reduction, this was only achieved with extremely high antibody titers and appeared less effective for a complete block of infection (i.e., sterile protection). While such disease reduction is important, these and other results indicate that strategies focusing on CSP alone may not achieve the high levels of sterile protection needed for malaria eradication. Here, we show that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing another sporozoite protein, TRAP/SSP2, exhibit a range of inhibitory activity and that these mAbs may augment CSP-based protection despite conferring no sterile protection on their own.

Information regarding symptoms was collected and all patients were simultaneously tested using two rapid diagnostic tests - RDTs (Combined - cRDT and Differentiated - dRDT). The association between symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated by non-conditional logistic regression, with estimation of Odds Ratio. RESULTS: A total of 110 subjects were studied, 52% of whom were women (mean age: 48.211.0 years). There were 42.3% of negative RT-qPCRs that were positive in some RDTs.

Second, we constructed two recombinant L. plantarum strains that anchored IFN-3 via pgsA (N-terminal transmembrane anchor) and CWA. Third, we demonstrated that both recombinant strains possess strong antiviral effects against coronavirus infection in the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line J2 (IPEC-J2).

Scalable, sensitive and specific serological assays are essential to this process. The detection of antibody in hospitalized patients with severe disease has proven straightforward; detecting responses in subjects with mild disease and asymptomatic infections has proven less reliable. We hypothesized that the suboptimal sensitivity of antibody assays and the compartmentalization of the antibody response may contribute to this effect. METHODS: We systemically developed an ELISA assay, optimising different antigens and amplification steps, in serum and saliva from symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects. RESULTS: Using trimeric spike glycoprotein, rather than nucleocapsid enabled detection of responses in individuals with low antibody responses. IgG1 and IgG3 predominate to both antigens, but more antispike IgG1 than IgG3 was detectable. All antigens were effective for detecting responses in hospitalized patients. Anti-spike, but not nucleocapsid, IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses were readily detectable in saliva from non-hospitalized symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.

Minimum inhibitory concentration MICs and killing kinetics in RPMI-1640 and RPMI-1640 plus 50% serum (50% serum) were determined. The four echinocandins were never fungicidal and induced large aggregates in RPMI-1640 and, less markedly, in 50% serum. Colony forming unit CFU decreases were found more consistently in 50% serum than in RPMI-1640. Isolates from the East Asian clade were killed at 1C 4 mg/L with all echinocandins regardless of media. Anidulafungin and micafungin produced killing at peak drug serum concentration (8 mg/L) against environmental but not clinical isolates from the South American and the South African clades. Micafungin at 8 mg/L but not anidulafungin produced CFU decreases against the South Asian clade as well. In 50% serum, rezafungin at 1C 8 mg/L produced killing against all four clades.

So, it is rational that the new virus causes pleiotropic alterations in glucose metabolism, resulting in the complication of pre-existing diabetes's pathophysiology or creating new disease mechanisms. However, it seems that less attention has been paid to this issue. This review aimed to highlight the importance of long-term consequences and pleiotropic alterations in glucose metabolism following COVID-19 and emphasize the need for basic and clinical research in metabolism and endocrinology. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 shifts cellular metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, which leads to a decrease in ATP generation. Together with metabolic imbalance, the impaired immune system elevates the susceptibility of patients with diabetes to this deadly virus. SARS-CoV-2-induced metabolic alterations in immune cells can result in hyper inflammation and a cytokine storm. Metabolic dysfunction may affect therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The effective control of metabolic complications could prove useful therapeutic targets for combating COVID-19. It is also necessary to understand the long-term consequences that will affect patients with diabetes who survived COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Since the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is still mostly unknown, identifying the metabolic mechanisms contributing to its progression is essential to provide specific ways to prevent and improve this dangerous virus's detrimental effects. The findings show that the new virus may induce new-onset diabetes with uncertain metabolic and clinical features, supporting a potential role of COVID-19 in the development of diabetes.","output":"The complex combination of COVID-19 and diabetes: pleiotropic changes in glucose metabolism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mortality of COVID-19 patients is increasing in logarithmic fashion and is mostly observed in older age people and patients having history of chronic ailments like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular & cerebrovascular dysfunction, compromised immunity, renal comorbidities, hepatic, obesity problems etc., and recently investigated thrombotic complications.

Previous studies on the association of serum uric acid with risk of adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 have produced contradictory results. The precise relationship between admission serum uric acid and adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients is unknown. METHODS: Data of patients affected by laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and admitted to Leishenshan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome was composite and comprised events, such as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the association between serum concentrations of uric acid and the composite outcome, as well as each of its components. To determine the association between serum uric acid and in-hospital adverse outcomes, serum uric acid was also categorized by restricted cubic spline, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to estimate odds ratios (OR). RESULTS: The study cohort included 1854 patients (mean age, 58 years; 52% women). The overall mean  SD of serum levels of uric acid was 308  96 mol/L. Among them, 95 patients were admitted to ICU, 75 patients received mechanical ventilation, and 38 died. In total, 114 patients reached composite end-points (have either ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or death) during hospitalization. Compared with a reference group with estimated baseline serum uric acid of 279-422 mol/L, serum uric acid values  423 mol/L were associated with an increased risk of composite outcome (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.07- 6.29) and mechanical ventilation (OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.06- 8.51). Serum uric acid  278 mol/L was associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.18- 3.65), ICU admission (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.17- 4.05]), and mechanical ventilation (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.06- 4.28), as assessed by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the association between admission serum uric acid and composite outcome of COVID-19 patients was U-shaped. In particular, we found that compared with baseline serum uric acid levels of 279-422 mol/L, values  423 mol/L were associated with an increased risk of composite outcome and mechanical ventilation, whereas levels  278 mol/L associated with increased risk of composite outcome, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation.","output":"Serum Uric Acid Concentrations and Risk of Adverse Outcomes in Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The Republic of the Congo detected its first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on March 14, 2020, and within several weeks, the country had introduced protective measures that were still in force in July 2020. Over the course of time, the progression in the number of clinical cases has appeared to be lower than expected, although reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing has been somewhat limited. In order to evaluate the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the Congolese population, a seroprevalence study was conducted on healthy individuals from different districts of Brazzaville who were willing to know their COVID-19 infection status. METHODS: Oropharyngeal swab and blood samples were collected from 754 healthy volunteers between April 2020 and July 2020. The samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 using a qualitative RT-PCR assay, and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were detected using two different rapid tests. RESULTS: A total of 56 participants (7.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The remaining 698 participants (92.6%) had negative RT-PCR results; of these, 117 were found to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using serological tests. For these RT-PCR-negative subjects, the seroprevalence of IgG and IgM was found to increase over time: from 1.7% and 2.5% in April, up to 14.2% and 17.6% in July, respectively. In April 2020, 5% of the women were found to have IgG or IgM antibodies, whereas the antibodies were not detected in any of the men. The seroprevalence in RT-PCR negative subjects was significantly higher in women within IgG (P = 0.012) and IgM (P = 0.045) over the first three months. CONCLUSION: The proportion of the population who seroconvert over the course of the first wave is an important data to predict the risk of future COVID-19 waves and this will facilitate the efficient use of limited resources in a low income country like the Republic of the Congo.","output":"High SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IGM seroprevalence in asymptomatic Congolese in Brazzaville, the Republic of Congo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the motives behind the dissemination of fake news and examines its sociodemographic correlates, namely, gender, age, frequency of using social media and frequency of accessing digital news.

Physiotherapists perceptions and willingness are two key factors that influence the provision of remote physiotherapy. AIM: To investigate physiotherapists perceptions of and willingness to use telerehabilitation in Kuwait during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore the barriers that may hinder the use of telerehabilitation in this sector. METHODS: The following methods were used: (1) a cross-sectional survey and (2) face-to-face semi-structured interviews. In the cross-sectional survey, an electronic questionnaire was sent to 747 physiotherapists who were working in the governmental health sector. The questionnaire included four sections: perceptions of telerehabilitation, comfort with technology, willingness to use telerehabilitation, and barriers to using telerehabilitation. Six interviews were conducted with physiotherapy managers to explore the barriers and facilitators of telerehabilitation practice. DATA ANALYSIS: In this study, descriptive data analysis was conducted, and a cross-tabulation technique was used to find the associations between the variables, in which chi-square tests were used to identify the significance of the results, where p < 0.05. Thematic content analysis was used for the interviews. RESULTS: Only 273 completed questionnaires were received, giving a response rate of 36.5%. Most of the respondents (237; 86.8%) considered telerehabilitation a viable option to deliver healthcare to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of the lack of information and communication technology (ICT) (156; 57.1%), 89% (243) of the respondents were willing to integrate telerehabilitation into their conventional practice, as cultural and social norms were not against the use of telerehabilitation systems. The results indicate that the more the physiotherapists used the internet and email in their work and the more comfortable they were with technology, the more willing they were to use telerehabilitation systems (p = 0.01). The physiotherapy managers reported that patients privacy and the confidentiality of their data were considered barriers. CONCLUSION: In Kuwait, physiotherapists show overall positive perceptions towards and a willingness to use telerehabilitation to facilitate patients access to physiotherapy services. There are several barriers to employing telerehabilitation. Accordingly, recommendations are suggested.

Today, we get informed through many different channels, at different times of the day, in different contexts, and on many different devices. In addition to that, more complexity is added by the bidirectional nature of the communication itself. People today react very quickly to specific topics through various means such as rating, sharing, commenting, tagging, icons, tweeting, etc. Such activities generate additional metadata to the information itself which become part of the original message. When planning proper communication we should consider all this. In such a complicated environment, the likelihood of a messages real meaning being received in a distorted or confused way is very high. However, as we have seen recently during the Covid-19 pandemic, at times, there is the need to communicate something, somewhat complicated in nature, while we need to make sure citizens fully understand the actual terms and meaning of the communication. This was the case faced by many governments worldwide when informing their population on the rules of conduct during the various lockdown periods. We analyzed trends and structure of social network data generated as a reaction to those official communications in Italy. Our goal is to derive a model to estimate whether the communication intended by the government was properly understood by the large population. We discovered some regularities in social media generated data related to poorly communicated issues. We believe it is possible to derive a model to measure how well the recipients grasp a specific topic.

Methods Retrospective analysis of 4 cases of bilateral lung transplant (LTx) at a private health facility between August to October 2020 Results All patients were male, with mean age of 52.1 years. The mean duration of ventilation before ECMO was 3 weeks. 3 patients had VV ECMO and one had a VA ECMO for circulatory collapse. This patient had previous coronary revascularization. The median duration on ECMO was 26 days. All patients were awake, involved in LTx discussion and actively rehabilitated. Profound myopathy was dominant in all. All had more than one episode of severe sepsis with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter requiring aggressive resuscitation and pressors. All had a trachestomy. Pneumothorax was treated with chest drains, 1 had hemothorax requiring thoracotomy. The lung was found to be extremely friable with dense adhesions in 3 with excessive chest wall bleeding. The ECMO was weaned off in all patients, 2 in the operating room and 2 in the ICU after 48 to 96 hours. The patient with CAD required VA ECMO due to transient left ventricular dysfunction. All patients could be weaned off the ventilator with excellent lung function breathing room air. The patient with CAD had Elizabeth meningoseptica septic shock in the late post op period with multi organ failure and death, while the other 3 are recovering and undergoing physical rehabilitation.Histology of the lungs showed alveolar damage, interstitial fibrosis with mononuclear infiltration, vasculitis and organizing fibrin thrombi, even in larger blood vessels.

Since the putative receptor for the virus is identified in reproductive organs, it is important to examine if SARS-CoV-2 targets the human reproductive tract. And, if so, is COVID-19 a sexually transmitted disease (STD)? Evidence Review A systematic review of English publications to December 11, 2020, was conducted in PubMed, NIH iCite COVID-19 portfolio, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases, searching for SARS-CoV-2 in testes, seminal, prostatic and vaginal fluids, and in cervical smears. 1,997 records were identified, duplicates were removed, and 1,490 records were reviewed for eligibility by examining titles and abstracts. 202 full-text relevant articles were reviewed by two independent reviewers. 47studies (literature reviews, editorials, and guidelines) were assessed qualitatively and 23 studies that tested the male and female reproductive tracts of COVID-19 patients for SARS-CoV-2 were quantitatively analyzed. Findings No epidemiological investigations to date have described evidence suggesting that COVID-19 is an STD. While ACE2 receptor is found in reproductive organs, the lack of co-expression of the TMPRSS2 modulatory protein, required for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, in testicular cells, sperm, or oocytes, argues against the hypothesis that gametes transmit SARS-CoV-2. Molecular detection studies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the male and female reproductive tracts were summarized: 98.0% (293/299) of the seminal fluids, 16/17 testicular biopsies, all 89 prostatic fluids, 98.3% (57/58) of the vaginal fluids, all 35 cervical smears, and all 16 oocyte samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. None of the studies confirmed sexual transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Nonetheless, COVID-19 may have detrimental effects on male reproduction by inducing orchitis and/or decreasing testosterone levels, sperm counts, and motility. Conclusions Based on the current worldwide published information, COVID-19 is not an STD. This information is important for clinicians, proposed guidelines for public health, FDA guidelines for gamete and tissue donor eligibility, and for fertility treatments. Universal precautions, currently practiced worldwide, are adequate and sufficient at this time to prevent the transmission of known or unknown viral infections.

Guatemala has one of the world's highest levels of stunting despite the sustained commitment to international nutrition policy best practices endorsed by the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement. Our objective was to use Guatemala as a case study to project the impact of a recently published national nutrition policy, the Great Crusade, that is consistent with SUN principles. METHODS: We used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to project the impact of scaling-up of nutrition interventions proposed in the Great Crusade and recommended by SUN. Our outcomes were changes in stunting prevalence, number of stunting cases averted, and number of cases averted by intervention in children under 5 years of age from 2020 to 2030. We considered 4 scenarios: (1) intervention coverage continues based on historical trends, (2) coverage targets in the Great Crusade are achieved, (3) coverage targets in the Great Crusade are achieved with reduced fertility risk, and (4) coverage reaches an aspirational level. RESULTS: All scenarios led to modest reductions in stunting prevalence. In 2024, stunting prevalence was estimated to change by ?0.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]= 0.0%,?0.2%) if historical trends continue, ?1.1% (95% CI=?0.8%,?1.5%) in the Great Crusade scenario, and ?2.2% (95% CI=?1.6%,?3.0%) in the aspirational scenario.

Complementary feeding, sanitation, and breastfeeding were the highest-impact interventions across models. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted reductions in child stunting prevalence in Guatemala are unlikely to be achieved solely based on increases in intervention coverage.

Terrorist and violent extremist groups have already attempted to incite the intentional spread of Covid19 and to use it as an improvised form of a biological weapon. This study aims to provide an epidemiological description of all terrorism-related attacks using biological agents sustained between 1970 and 2019. METHODS: Data collection was performed using a retrospective database search through the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). The GTD was searched using the internal database search functions for all events using biological weapons between January 1, 1970 - December 31, 2019. RESULTS: 33 terrorist attacks involving biological agents were recorded between 1970 and 2019, registering 9 deaths and 806 injuries. 21 events occurred in the United States, 3 in Kenya, 2 each in both the United Kingdom and Pakistan and a single event in Japan, Columbia, Israel, Russia and Tunisia. CONCLUSION: The reported use of biological agents as a terrorist weapon is extremely rare and accounts for 0.02% of all historic terrorist attacks.

A number of these protests have resorted to violent means, resisting the police or protesting directly against their role and methods. The present study sought to investigate the prototypical representations of the police that lay citizens use to forge or desist identification with police officers. Social identification enables citizens to consider the police as ingroup members, facilitating respect for their authority. Conversely, identifying the police as outgroup precipitates resistance. The study involved 41 in-depth interviews carried out with citizens of Malta between May and June 2020. Thematic Networks Analysis revealed various points of consensus as well as a number of controversial themes. In particular, respondents demonstrated sceptical attitudes regarding policing on the beat for fear of overfamiliarity, rooted in introspective attributions projected at the police as merely human. Moreover, respondents expressed support for technological innovations that overcome natural psychological tendencies. The findings of this study suggest that seeking increasing trust in the police may be a red herring for policymakers. Rather, efforts should be directed at developing inter-objective systems, (e.g. body-cams), that overcome individual psychological propensities.","output":"Introspective Projection: Prototypical Representations of Policing in the Service of Rule of Law"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: During public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, populations can experience worsening mental health. Prior reports have suggested that Black Americans experienced lower rates of anxiety and depression than White Americans before the pandemic; however, during the pandemic, outcomes may be different as Black Americans have been disproportionately affected in terms of mortality, hospitalization, COVID-19 infection, and job loss. We documented the differential mental health impact of COVID-19 on Black and Non-Black Americans. METHODS: We analyzed nationally representative longitudinal data from the Understanding America Study COVID-19 Tracking Survey spanning March through November of 2020 to assess differences over time in prevalence of anxiety and depression between Black and non-Black Americans. RESULTS: We found that Black Americans were significantly less likely to report symptoms for anxiety, depression, or both during the pandemic. In a given month between March through November of 2020, the odds of Black Americans reporting such symptoms was on average about half that of Non-Black Americans. We also found that in September 2020, the gap in reporting symptoms for depression began to widen gradually. Specifically, since that time, prevalence of depression remained stable among non-Black Americans while it declined gradually among Black Americans. Our main results were robust to adjusting for demographics, risk perceptions, and baseline pre-pandemic mental health status. CONCLUSIONS: Black Americans maintained significantly better mental health than Non-Black Americans despite their struggle against economic, health, and racial inequalities during the pandemic.

Chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-dependent monocyte trafficking plays an essential role in the establishment of CD8 TRMs in lungs of IAV-infected mice. Here, we used a combination adjuvant-based subunit vaccine strategy that evokes multifaceted (TC1/TC17/TH1/TH17) IAV nucleoprotein-specific lung TRMs, to determine whether CCR2 and monocyte infiltration are essential for vaccine-induced TRM development and protective immunity to IAV in lungs. Following intranasal vaccination, neutrophils, monocytes, conventional DCs and monocyte-derived dendritic cells internalized and processed vaccine antigen in lungs. We found that Basic Leucine Zipper ATF-Like Transcription Factor 3 (BATF-3)-dependent DCs were essential for eliciting T cell responses, but CCR2 deficiency enhanced the differentiation of CD127HI/KLRG-1LO, OX40+veCD62L+ve and mucosally imprinted CD69+veCD103+ve effector and memory CD8 T cells in lungs and airways of vaccinated mice. Mechanistically, increased development of lung TRMs, induced by CCR2 deficiency was linked to dampened expression of T-bet, but not altered TCF-1 levels or T cell receptor signaling in CD8 T cells. T1/T17 functional programming, parenchymal localization of CD8/CD4 effector and memory T cells, recall T cell responses and protective immunity to a lethal IAV infection were unaffected in CCR2-deficient mice. Taken together, we identified a negative regulatory role for CCR2 and monocyte trafficking in mucosal imprinting and differentiation of vaccine-induced TRMs. Mechanistic insights from this study may aid the development of T-cell-based vaccines against respiratory viral pathogens including IAV and SARS-CoV-2.ImportanceWhile antibody-based immunity to influenza A virus (IAV) is type and sub-type specific, lung and airway-resident memory T cells that recognize conserved epitopes in the internal viral proteins are known to provide heterosubtypic immunity. Hence, broadly protective IAV vaccines need to elicit robust T-cell memory in the respiratory tract. We have developed a combination adjuvant-based IAV nucleoprotein vaccine that elicits strong CD4 and CD8 T cell memory in lungs and protects against H1N1 and H5N1 strains of IAV. In this study, we examined the mechanisms that control vaccine-induced protective memory T cells in the respiratory tract. We found that trafficking of monocytes into lungs might limit the development of anti-viral lung-resident memory T cells, following intranasal vaccination. These findings suggested that strategies that limit monocyte infiltration can potentiate vaccine-induced frontline T-cell immunity to respiratory viruses, such as IAV and SARS-CoV-2.","output":"CCR2 Regulates Vaccine-Induced Mucosal T-Cell Memory to Influenza A Virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) screening testing of a massive number of suspected cases for proper quarantine and treatment is a priority.

Sustainable nutrition, or sustainable diet, refers to diets with low environmental impacts that contribute to food security and health. This systematic review aimed to identify factors that influence whether professionals in health-related institutions integrate sustainable nutrition into their practice. METHODS A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted using the MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases. To be included, the studies had to document perspectives on sustainable nutrition from health professionals, including dietitians, students and educators in health sciences, public health officers, and hospital food service managers. Data extraction focused on perceived barriers, facilitating factors, and top recommendations for promoting sustainable nutrition. SYNTHESIS Twenty studies were included, most of which focused on dietitians. Data analysis revealed that 25 factors influenced the integration of sustainable nutrition into professional practice. The factors most reported in the included studies were perceived knowledge of sustainable nutrition, self-efficacy, awareness of environmental issues, and perceiving the promotion of sustainable nutrition to be part of one's professional role. Increasing societal support through awareness campaigns and increasing institutional support through guidelines, information tools, and financial support were also frequently mentioned. CONCLUSION Sustainable nutrition is a multifaceted concept; integrating it into already complex professional practices is therefore challenging. At the present time, dietitians seem to be the health professionals predominantly researched regarding their views on sustainable nutrition.

Understanding current patterns of the pandemic spread and forecasting its long-term trajectory is essential in guiding policies aimed at curtailing the pandemic. This is particularly important in regions with weak economies and fragile health care systems such as West-Africa. We formulate and use a deterministic compartmental model to (i) assess the current patterns of COVID-19 spread in West-Africa, (ii) evaluate the impact of currently implemented control measures, and (iii) predict the future course of the pandemic with and without currently implemented and additional control measures in West-Africa. An analytical expression for the threshold level of control measures (involving a reduction in the effective contact rate) required to eliminate the pandemic is computed. Considering currently applied health control measures, numerical simulations of the model using baseline parameter values estimated from West-African COVID-19 data project a 60% reduction in the daily number of cases when the epidemic attains its peak. More reduction in the number of cases will be achieved if additional public health control measures that result in a reduction in the effective contact rate are implemented. We found out that disease elimination is difficult when more asymptomatic individuals contribute in transmission or are not identified and isolated in a timely manner. However, maintaining a baseline level of asymptomatic isolation and a low transmission rate will lead to a significant reduction in the number of daily cases when the pandemic peaks. For example, at the baseline level of asymptomatic isolation, at least a 53% reduction in the transmission rate is required for disease elimination, while disease elimination is also possible if asymptomatic individuals are identified and isolated within 2 days (after the incubation period). Combining two or more measures is better for disease control, e.g., if asymptomatic humans are contact traced or identified and isolated in less than 3 days then only about a 31% reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Furthermore, we showed that the currently implemented measures caused the time-dependent effective reproduction number to reduce by approximately 37% from February 28, to August 24, 2020. We conclude that COVID-19 elimination requires more control measures than what is currently being applied inWest-Africa and that mass testing and contact tracing in order to identify and isolate asymptomatic individuals early is very important in curtailing the burden of the pandemic.","output":"Predicting COVID-19 spread and public health needs to contain the pandemic in West-Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rapid antigen tests (RATs) may be included in national strategies for handling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as they provide test results rapidly, are easily performed outside laboratories, and enable immediate contract tracing.

We reviewed 33 papers' full text out of 1053 papers. There were 32 papers from China and 1 from Taiwan. There was no language or study level limit. Prevalence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancies, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic liver disease and smoking were extracted to measure the pooled estimates. We used OpenMeta and used random-effect model to do a single arm meta-analysis. Results: The mean age of the diagnosed patients was 51 years. The male to female ratio was 55 to 45.

Therefore, when assessing potential blood donor exposure to EIDs, the use of general population characteristics, such as U.S. travel statistics, may invoke uncertainties that result in inaccurate estimates of blood donor exposure. This may, in turn, lead to the creation of donor deferral policies that do not match actual risk. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This article reports on the development of a system to rapidly assess EID risks for a nationally representative portion of the U.S. blood donor population. To assess the effectiveness of this system, a test survey was developed and deployed to a statistically representative sample frame of blood donors from five blood collecting organizations. Donors were directed to an online survey to ascertain their recent travel and potential exposure to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). RESULTS: A total of 7128 responses were received from 54 256 invitations. The age-adjusted estimated total number of blood donors potentially exposed to MERS-CoV was approximately 15 640 blood donors compared to a lower U.S. general population-based estimate of 9610 blood donors.

This conclusion seemed reasonable considering the size of the PNS and the results of early behavioral tests [3, 6-8].

Lifestyle indexes included traditional and emerging lifestyle risk factors based on health guidelines and best practice recommendations for: physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep quality, diet quality, alcohol consumption, and smoking status. The main outcome was mortality from infectious diseases, including pneumonia, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Meeting public health guidelines or best practice recommendations among combinations of lifestyle risk factors was inversely associated with mortality. Hazard ratios ranged between 0.26 (0.23-0.30) to 0.69 (0.60-0.79) for infectious disease and pneumonia. Among participants with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or cancer, hazard ratios ranged between 0.30 (0.25-0.34) to 0.73 (0.60-0.89). COVID-19 mortality risk ranged between 0.42 (0.28-0.63) to 0.75 (0.49-1.13). We found a beneficial dose-response association with a higher lifestyle index against mortality that was consistent across sex, age, BMI, and socioeconomic status. There was limited evidence of synergistic interactions between most lifestyle behaviour pairs, suggesting that the dose-response relationship among different lifestyle behaviours is not greater than the sum of the risk induced by each behaviour.

The aim of this study is to assess the frequency of neurological manifestations and complications, identify the neurodiagnostic findings, and compare these aspects between severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases was conducted for studies published between the 1st of January 2020 and 22nd of April 2020. In addition, we scanned the bibliography of included studies to identify other potentially eligible studies. The criteria for eligibility included studies published in English language (or translated to English), those involving patients with COVID-19 of all age groups, and reporting neurological findings. Data were extracted from eligible studies. Meta-analyses were conducted using comprehensive meta-analysis software. Random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled percentages and means with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of individual studies on the summary estimate. A subgroup analysis was conducted according to severity. The main outcomes of the study were to identify the frequency and nature of neurological manifestations and complications, and the neuro-diagnostic findings in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: 44 articles were included with a pooled sample size of 13,480 patients. The mean age was 50.3 years and 53% were males. The most common neurological manifestations were: Myalgia (22.2, 95% CI, 17.2 to 28.1%), taste impairment (19.6, 95% CI, 3.8 to 60.1%), smell impairment (18.3, 95% CI, 15.4 to 76.2%), headache (12.1, 95% CI, 9.1 to 15.8%), dizziness (11.3, 95% CI, 8.5 to 15.0%), and encephalopathy (9.4, 95% CI, 2.8 to 26.6%).

OBJECTIVE: We performed a prospective observational study to assess the antibody response of healthcare workers against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (nAb) and spike (S) protein-IgG (S-IgG) antibody titers were examined in participants who received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in a single center between March 1, 2021, and October 11, 2021. Antibody levels were analyzed at four times: before vaccination (visit 1), 4 weeks after the first vaccination (visit 2), 3 months after the second vaccination (visit 3), and 6 months after the second vaccination (visit 4). RESULTS: A total of 249 healthcare workers at Jeju National University Hospital were enrolled in this study, and 982 blood samples were analyzed. The mean age was 38.1  9.5 years, and 145 (58.2%) participants were females. Positive nAbs (inhibition rates  20%) were measured in 166/249 (66.7%) subjects at visit 2, 237/243 (97.5%) subjects at visit 3, and 150/237 (63.3%) subjects at visit 4. A S-IgG (50 AU/mL) positivity was detected in 246/249 (98.8%) subjects at visit 1, and all participants had positive S-IgG antibody levels at visits 3 and 4 after being fully vaccinated. Further analysis of S-IgG levels revealed a median quantitative antibody level of 1275.1 AU/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 755.5C2119.0) at visit 2, 2765.9 AU/mL (IQR 1809.8C4138.4) at visit 3, and 970.1 AU/mL (IQR 606.0C1495.9) at visit 4. Patient characteristics, such as age, body mass index, and comorbidity, had no relationship with nAb or S-IgG levels at any of the visits. Considering the change in antibody levels over time, both nAb and S-IgG levels at visit 4 decreased compared with the corresponding levels at visit 3. No evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was found among any of the participants throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was effective in protecting healthcare personnel working in COVID-19-related departments. While the level of S-IgG antibodies was maintained for 6 months after the second vaccination, nAb levels waned over this 6-month period, indicating the need for a booster vaccination in some healthcare workers 6 months after full vaccination.

To tackle this challenge we developed an age-structured deterministic model in which vaccines are deployed during the pandemic to individuals who do not show symptoms. The model allows for flexible and dynamic prioritization strategies with shifts between target groups. We find a strong interaction between social distancing and vaccination in their effect on the proportion of hospitalizations. In particular, prioritizing vaccines to elderly (60+) before adults (20-59) is more effective when social distancing is applied to adults or uniformly. In addition, the temporal reproductive number R(t) is only affected by vaccines when deployed at sufficiently high rates and in tandem with social distancing. Finally, the same reduction in hospitalization can be achieved via different combination of strategies, giving decision makers flexibility in choosing public health policies.

As public health, food security, and carnivore populations were imbricated, the categorical boundaries between human and animal health also began to blur.

OBJECTIVE This article aims to evaluate an employee prioritization/invitation/scheduling system, leveraging an integrated electronic health record patient portal framework for employee COVID-19 immunizations at an academic medical center. METHODS We conducted an observational cross-sectional study during January 2021 at a single urban academic center. All employees who met COVID-19 allocation vaccine criteria for phase 1a.1 to 1a.4 were included. We implemented a prioritization/invitation/scheduling framework and evaluated time from invitation to scheduling as a proxy for vaccine interest and arrival to vaccine administration to measure operational throughput. RESULTS We allotted vaccines for 13,753 employees but only 10,662 employees with an active patient portal account received an invitation. Of those with an active account, 6,483 (61%) scheduled an appointment and 6,251 (59%) were immunized in the first 7 days. About 66% of invited providers were vaccinated in the first 7 days. In contrast, only 41% of invited facility/food service employees received the first dose of the vaccine in the first 7 days (p < 0.001).

METHODS: Diagnostic performance of these new criteria for CSPH (LSM  25 kPa to rule in and Plt  150  10(9)/L + LSM  15 kPa to rule out CSPH) were retrospectively tested in an independent cohort of consecutive patients who underwent hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements and liver biopsy due to suspicion of compensated advanced chronic liver disease. Suspicion of cACLD was based on LSM  10 kPa by TE or results of liver imaging, without overt signs of CSPH. Patients with conditions known to affect results of LSM (ALT > 5  ULN, liver congestion, extrahepatic biliary obstruction, infiltrative liver neoplasms) were excluded. RESULTS: Seventy six (76) patients were included: 78.9% males, mean age 62 years, 36.8% suffered from alcoholic, 30.3% nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, 14.5% chronic viral hepatitis, 30.3% were obese, 52.6% had HVPG  10 mmHg, 56.6% had platelet count  150  10(9)/L. LSM  25 kPa had 88.9% specificity (95% CI 73.9C96.9) to rule in, whereas Plt  150 + LSM  15 kPa had 100% sensitivity (95% CI 91.1C100) to rule out CSPH. CONCLUSION: By using these simple noninvasive criteria 49/76 (64.5%) patients could be classified correctly for the presence/absence of CSPH, thus obviating the need for HVPG measurements.","output":"Validation of the New Diagnostic Criteria for Clinically Significant Portal Hypertension by Platelets and Elastography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cytokine storm is a marker of severity and severe mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Immunomodulatory treatments may reduce morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a 7-day course of methylprednisolone (MP) administered with and without tocilizumab improves outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia requiring oxygen therapy, relative to historical controls. STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD: In this randomized controlled study, patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 at Rashid Hospital, Dubai, in June 2020 were randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous MP (40 mg twice daily for 7 days) with or without a single dose of intravenous tocilizumab (400 mg). While data from the control arm, consisting of patients administered usual care, were obtained through retrospective review of their electronic medical records. The patients in the three arms were matched by disease severity and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary outcomes were day 45 all-cause mortality after randomization, rate of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), length of ICU stay, days on ventilators, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: In total, 76 patients were recruited, including 23 treated with MP, 26 with MP plus tocilizumab, and 27 historical controls. The rates of admission to the ICU and invasive mechanical ventilation were lowest in patients treated with MP alone, with the rates in this group being significantly lower than the rates in the control group (p = 0.04). Time on a ventilator was lowest in the MP group (1.09  3.68 days) and highest in the control group (7.93  14.86 days). The number of days in the ICU was significantly lower in the MP group than in the control and MP plus tocilizumab groups (p = 0.043). One patient (4.3%) in the MP group and five (18.5%) in the control arm died within 45 days. Survival was highest in patients treated with MP alone, with the addition of tocilizumab not improving survival or any of the other outcomes significantly. INTERPRETATION/CONCLUSION: In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia on oxygen support, administration of MP daily for 7 days had reduced mortality at 45 days and was associated with significantly lower ICU admission and ventilation rates compared with usual. Adding tocilizumab to MP did not improve any of the studied outcomes significantly.","output":"Intravenous Methylprednisolone with or Without Tocilizumab in Patients with Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia Requiring Oxygen Support: A Prospective Comparison"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As 2020 is over, it seems fitting to start this editorial by reflecting on what can only be described as a seismic shift in how anatomy educators and students learning anatomy have been affected by the global Covid-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the statistical associations between the statewise prevalence, mortality rate, and case fatality rate of COVID-19 in 24 regions in India (23 states and Delhi), as well as key demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related indices. METHODS: Data on disease prevalence, crude mortality, and case fatality were obtained from statistics provided by the Government of India for 24 regions, as of June 30, 2020. The relationship between these parameters and the demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related indices of the regions under study was examined using both bivariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: COVID-19 prevalence was negatively associated with male-to-female sex ratio (defined as the number of females per 1000 male population) and positively associated with the presence of an international airport in a particular state. The crude mortality rate for COVID-19 was negatively associated with sex ratio and the statewise burden of diarrheal disease, and positively associated with the statewise burden of ischemic heart disease. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the COVID-19 crude mortality rate was significantly and negatively associated with sex ratio.

However, the mechanism underlying the RES-mediated protection against myocardial infarction has not yet been revealed entirely. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of RES on cardiac function in a rat model of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the related underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: Sham (sham operation), Sham-RES, AMI (AMI induction), and AMI-RES. The rat AMI model was established by the permanent ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery method. The rats in the RES-treated groups were gavaged with RES (50 mg/kg/day) daily for 45 days after the Sham operation or AMI induction; rats in the Sham and AMI groups were gavaged with deionized water. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography. Atrial interstitial fibrosis was assessed by hematoxylin-eosin or Massons trichrome staining. Real-time PCR and western blotting analyses were performed to examine the levels of signaling pathway components. RESULTS: RES supplementation decreased the inflammatory cytokine levels, improved the cardiac function, and ameliorated atrial interstitial fibrosis in the rats with AMI. Furthermore, RES supplementation inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activity, decreased the TGF-1 production, and downregulated the p-SMAD2/SMAD2 expression in the heart. CONCLUSION: RES shows notable cardioprotective effects in a rat model of AMI; the possible mechanisms underlying these effects may involve the improvement of cardiac function and atrial interstitial fibrosis via the RES-mediated suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activity and inhibition of the TGF-1/SMAD2 signaling pathway in the heart.","output":"Resveratrol improves cardiac function and left ventricular fibrosis after myocardial infarction in rats by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activity and the TGF-1/SMAD2 signaling pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Translocation of lipopolysaccharide from gram\\\\negative bacteria into the systemic circulation results in endotoxemia.

A limited control baseline of case isolation and household member quarantining is used. We measure the impact of lockdown duration and start date on final infection attack sizes. We then apply a 3-month gradual exit strategy, immediately re-opening schools and easing workplace distancing measures, and compare this to long-term social distancing measures. Findings: At baseline, we estimated 815 400 total infections (21.6% of the population). Early lockdown at 5 weeks with no exit strategy averted 18 500 (2.27% of baseline averted), 21 300 (2.61%) and 22 400 (2.75%) infections for 6, 8 and 9-week lockdown durations.

Many managers were concerned that their engineers would not be able to work effectively from home, or lack the motivation to do so, and that they would lose control and not even notice when things go wrong. As many companies announced their post-COVID permanent remote-work or hybrid home/office policies, the question of what can be expected from software engineers who work from home becomes more and more relevant. AIMS: To understand the nature of home telework we analyze the evidence of perceived changes in productivity comparing office work before the pandemic with the work from home during the pandemic from thirteen empirical surveys of practitioners. METHOD: We analyzed data from six corporate surveys conducted in four Scandinavian companies combined with the results of seven published surveys studying the perceived changes in productivity in industrial settings. In addition, we sought explanations for the variation in perceived productivity among the engineers from the studied companies through the qualitative analysis of open-ended questions and interviews. RESULTS: : Combined results of 7686 data points suggest that though on average perceived productivity has not changed significantly, there are developers who report being more productive, and developers being less productive when working from home. Positively affected individuals in some surveys form large groups of respondents (up to 50%) and mention benefiting from a better organization of work, increased flexibility and focus. Yet, there are equally large groups of negatively affected respondents (up to 51%) who complain about the challenges related to remote teamwork and collaboration, as well as emotional issues, distractions and poor home office environment and equipment. Finally, positive trends are found in longitudinal surveys, i.e., developers productivity in the later months of the pandemic show better results than those in the earlier months. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that behind the average no change lays a large variation of experiences, which means that the work from home might not be for everyone. Yet, a longitudinal analysis of the surveys is encouraging, as it shows that the more pessimistic results might be influenced by the initial experiences of an unprecedented crisis. At the end, we put forward the lessons learned during the pandemic that can inspire the new post-pandemic work policies.","output":"Changes in perceived productivity of software engineers during COVID-19 pandemic: The voice of evidence()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: High\\\\dose, high\\\\volume steroid nasal irrigations (NSI) have been incorporated into the medical management of recalcitrant CRS, primarily following surgical intervention. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of NSI as a preoperative management and to identify the percentage of patients who ultimately underwent ESS for recalcitrant CRS despite being on NSI. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients presenting with CRS who underwent a trial of NSI for at least six weeks. Pre\\\\irrigation and post\\\\irrigation outcomes measured included Lund\\\\Mackay scores (LMS), SNOT\\\\22 scores, and whether or not the patient underwent ESS. RESULTS: Of the 90 patients who underwent NSI, 32 patients underwent ESS, while 58 patients had a significant enough improvement in symptoms to avoid ESS. The likelihood of decision for surgery did not differ between the mometasone and budesonide groups (p=0.3094), comorbid asthma status (p=0.3585), smoking status (p=0.2256), polyp status (p=0.7288), or history of prior ESS (p=0.5803). SNOT scores significantly improvement following NSI in the group of patients that did not go on to ESS (p<0.0001) and in the group that did (p<0.0001). LMS also improved following NSI, but this was only statistically significant in the patients that ultimately went on to ESS (p=0.0102). CONCLUSIONS: After a trial of NSI, 64.4% of patients with CRS no longer met candidacy for ESS and had a significant improvement in SNOT\\\\22 scores. This supports the use of nasal steroid irrigations in the medical management of CRS with and without surgical intervention and with and without nasal polyposis.

The concept is relatively new in health policy and systems research and the existing research remains mostly theoretical. Research to date has viewed resilience as an outcome that can be measured through performance outcomes, as an ability of complex adaptive systems that is derived from dynamic behaviour and interactions, or as both. However, there is little congruence on the theory and the existing frameworks have not been widely used, which as diluted the research applications for health system resilience. A global group of health system researchers were convened in March 2021 to discuss and identify priorities for health system resilience research and implementation based on lessons from COVID-19 and other health emergencies. Five research priority areas were identified: (1) measuring and managing systems dynamic performance, (2) the linkages between societal resilience and health system resilience, (3) the effect of governance on the capacity for resilience, (4) creating legitimacy and (5) the influence of the private sector on health system resilience.

In a previous study, forensic PwS (who committed violent offenses) identified spoken-emotions and integrated the emotional information from both channels similarly to controls. However, their performance indicated larger failures of selective-attention, and lower discrimination between spoken-emotions, than controls. Given that forensic schizophrenia represents a special subgroup, the current study compared forensic and non-forensic PwS. Forty-five PwS listened to sentences conveying four basic emotions presented in semantic or prosodic channels, in different combinations. They were asked to rate how much they agreed that the sentences conveyed a predefined emotion, focusing on one channel or on the sentence as a whole. Their performance was compared to that of 21 forensic PwS (previous study). The two groups did not differ in selective-attention. However, better emotional identification and discrimination, as well as better channel integration were found for the forensic PwS. Results have several clinical implications: difficulties in spoken-emotions processing might not necessarily relate to schizophrenia; attentional deficits might not be a risk factor for aggression in schizophrenia; and forensic schizophrenia might have unique characteristics as related to spoken-emotions processing (motivation, stimulation).","output":"Processing of Spoken Emotions in Schizophrenia: Forensic and Non-forensic Patients Differ in Emotional Identification and Integration but Not in Selective Attention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study focuses on evaluating the different policies of controlling the outbreak of COVID-19 in mainland China and in some European countries.

The data cover the date when the epidemic situation is reported and the data showed that the epidemic situation is almost under control in China. The mathematical model mainly simulates the active cases and the deaths during the outbreak of COVID-19. Then apply the mathematical model to simulate the epidemic situations in Italy and Spain, which are suffering the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe. The determination of the parameters for the 2 European countries is based on the data supplied by Worldometers. By comparing the difference of the parameters based on the same mathematical model, it is possible to evaluate the different policies in different countries.

The current study assessed the concentration of the metals in water samples of the largest brackish water lagoon of Asia;the Chilika lagoon in the state of Odisha, India between pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 lockdown scenarios. Monthly water samples (n=30 stations) from 0.3 m depth were collected from three sectors of the lagoon seasonally;pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon. In addition to various physical parameters [pH, salinity, alkalinity, (DO) dissolved oxygen, (TDS) total dissolved solids, and (EC) electrical conductivity] the collected water samples were analysed for 18 trace metals (Al, As, Ba, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sr, Th, Tl, U, V). Most of the physical parameters showed a significant variation between pre-and post-COVID-19 scenarios, except for pH and DO. The concentration of five metals (Be, Cd, Co, Ni, and Pb) remained below detection limits in all water samples. The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the concentration of the metal in the water samples was noticed along with the three sectors of the lagoon. However, eight metals (Al, As, Cr, Fe, Mn, Th, U, and V) were significantly different between the COVID-19 scenarios and the remaining five metals were not statistically significant. The mean concentration of Al, As, Fe, Th, and V were higher in the pre-COVID-19 scenarios, whereas only Cr and Mn were higher in the post-COVID-19 scenarios. The mean concentration of U was similar among both COVID-19 scenarios, even though there were seasonal and sectoral differences. The seasonal influence of riverine influx was more evident on metal concentration during the monsoon season, whereas the difference between sectors was more prominent during the post-monsoon season. An increased number of correlations between physical parameters and metal concentration were observed in the post-monsoon season and post-COVID-19 scenario. This study provides evidence that the imposition of COVID-19 lockdown reduced metal influx in the water column and improved the water quality of the Chilika lagoon.

Findings showed that healthcare workers expressed deep concerns for family members and apprehension at a national level. Respondents noted that they were coping well with the crisis while expressing negative perceptions of how the crisis was managed. A regression model showed that the low self-assessment of medical staff of coping with the crisis, deep concerns at the organizational level, negative perceptions of crisis management, and providing care for COVID-19 patients were predictors of burnout.

Here we report the first identified infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; aetiology of COVID-19) among recent international arrivals to Sudan and their contacts. METHODS: Suspected cases were identified clinically and/or epidemiologically. Samples from suspected cases and their contacts were tested in the National Influenza Centre following World Health Organization protocols. Two real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect and confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Seven cases of COVID-19, including two deaths, were confirmed in Sudan between 27 February and 30 March 2020. Suspected cases were identified and tested. As of 30 March, no local transmission was yet reported in the country. Fifty-nine percent of the suspected cases were international travellers coming from areas with current COVID-19 epidemics. Cough and fever were the major symptoms, presented by 65% and 60% of the suspected cases, respectively. By early April, an additional seven cases were confirmed through limited contact tracing that identified the first locally acquired infections in recent contact with imported cases. CONCLUSIONS: The high mortality rate of COVID-19 cases in Sudan might be due to limitations in test and trace and case management services.

An exaggerated host inflammatory response, described as a cytokine storm, has been linked to play a major role in these complications. Colchicine and other pharmaceutical agents have been proposed to counter the cytokine storm and improve outcomes. In this exploratory review, we utilized a PubMed and Cochrane Database search aiming to identify the biochemical characteristics of the cytokine storm as well as to identify the potential effect of colchicine on these inflammatory biomarkers. The research yielded 30 reports describing the characteristics of the cytokine storm and 44 reports describing the effect of colchicine on various inflammatory biomarkers. According to our research, colchicine may be an agent of interest in the treatment of COVID-19 via its anti-inflammatory properties.

In terms of confirmed deaths per million inhabitants, as of October 22, Ecuador ranks fourth in the Americas and ninth worldwide according to data from the World Health Organization. In this report, we estimate excess deaths due to any cause in Ecuador since the start of the lockdown measures on March 17, 2020 until October 22, 2020. METHODS: Estimates of excess deaths were calculated as the difference between the number of observed deaths from all causes and estimates of expected deaths from all causes. Expected deaths were estimated for the period March 17-October 22, 2020 from forecasts of an ARIMA model of order (3,0,1) with drift which was applied to daily mortality data for the period from January 1, 2014 to March 16, 2020. RESULTS: The number of all-cause excess deaths in Ecuador was estimated to be 36,922 (95% bootstrap confidence interval: 32,314-42,696) during the study period. The peak in all-cause excess mortality in Ecuador may have occurred on April 4, 2020, with 909 excess deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the real impact of the pandemic in Ecuador was much worse than that indicated by reports from national institutions. Estimates of excess mortality might provide a better approximation of the true COVID-19 death toll. These estimates might capture not only deaths directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic but also deaths from other diseases that resulted from indirect effects of the pandemic.","output":"Measuring the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Ecuador using preliminary estimates of excess mortality, March 17-October 22, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene and medical staff protection.

In this sense, identifying specificities of each location is essential to minimize the damage caused by the disease. Therefore, the aim of this research was to assess the vulnerability of the 853 municipalities in the second most populous state in Brazil, Minas Gerais (MG), in order to direct public policies. Then, an epidemiological study was carried out based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) using indicators with some relation to the process of illness and death caused by COVID-19. The indicators were selected by a literature review and categorized into: demographic, social, economic, health infrastructure, population at risk and epidemiological. The variables were collected in Brazilian government databases at the municipal level and evaluated according to MCDA, through the Program to Support Decision Making based on indicators (PRADIN). Based on this approach, the study performed simulations by category of indicators and a general simulation that allowed to divide the municipalities into groups of 1 to 5, with 1 being the least vulnerable and 5 being the most vulnerable. The groupings of municipalities were exposed in their respective mesoregions of MG in a thematic map, using the software Tabwin 32. The results revealed that the mesoregion of Norte de Minas stands out with more than 40% of its municipalities belonging to group 5, according to economic, social and health infrastructure indicators. Similarly, the Jequitinhonha mesoregion exhibited almost 60% of the municipalities in this group for economic and health infrastructure indicators. For demographic and epidemiological criteria, the Metropolitana de Belo Horizonte mesoregion is the most vulnerable, with 42.9% and 26.7% of the municipalities in group 5, respectively. Considering the presence of a population at risk, Zona da Mata reported 42.3% of the municipalities in the most vulnerable group. In the joint analysis of data, the Jequitinhonha, Vale do Mucuri and Vale do Rio Doce mesoregions were the most vulnerable in the state of MG.

Due to heterogeneity between studies, a narrative synthesis was undertaken. RESULTS In total, 1462 abstracts from the database search and three abstracts from grey literature sources were identified. Following screening, 12 studies were included in the review. Five broad categories of intervention were identified: dental education, motivational interviewing, dental checklist, dietary change and incentives.

Of these, 45 patients underwent RPLTG and 45 patients underwent conventional laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (CLATG). Short-term outcomes were compared to evaluate the feasibility of RPLTG for gastric cancer. RESULTS There were several significant differences between the RPLTG and CLATG groups in short-term outcomes: the mean total operation durations were significantly longer in the RPLTG group (319.0 min) than in the CLATG group (259.0 min). However, the mean volume of blood loss, the degree of lymph node dissection, and the number of dissected lymph nodes did not differ between the two groups.

People that become severely immunocompromised may experience JCPyV reactivation, which can cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a neurodegenerative disease. Due to a lack of therapeutic options, PML results in fatality or significant debilitation among affected individuals. Cellular internalization of JCPyV is mediated by serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine subfamily 2 receptors (5-HT2Rs) via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The JCPyV entry process requires the clathrin-scaffolding proteins -arrestin, adaptor protein 2 (AP2), and dynamin. Further, a -arrestin interacting domain, the Ala-Ser-Lys (ASK) motif, within the C-terminus of 5-HT2AR is important for JCPyV internalization and infection. Interestingly, 5-HT2R subtypes A, B, and C equally support JCPyV entry and infection, and all subtypes contain an ASK motif, suggesting a conserved mechanism for viral entry. However, the role of the 5-HT2R ASK motifs and the activation of -arrestin-associated proteins during internalization has not been fully elucidated. Through mutagenesis, the ASK motifs within 5-HT2BR and 5-HT2CR were identified as critical for JCPyV internalization and infectivity. Further, utilizing biochemical pulldown techniques, mutagenesis of the ASK motifs in 5-HT2BR and 5-HT2CR resulted in reduced -arrestin binding. Utilizing small-molecule chemical inhibitors and RNA interference, G-protein receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) was determined to be required for JCPyV internalization and infection by mediating interactions between -arrestin and the ASK motif of 5-HT2Rs. These findings demonstrate that GRK2 and -arrestin interactions with 5-HT2Rs are critical for JCPyV entry by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and resultant infection.IMPORTANCE As intracellular parasites, viruses require a host cell to replicate and cause disease. Therefore, virus-host interactions contribute to viral pathogenesis. JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) infects most of the population, establishing a lifelong asymptomatic infection within the kidney. Under conditions of severe immunosuppression JCPyV may spread to the central nervous system, causing the fatal demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Individuals living with HIV or undergoing immunomodulatory therapies are at risk for developing PML. The mechanisms of how JCPyV uses specific receptors on the surface of host cells to initiate internalization and infection is a poorly understood process. We have further identified cellular proteins involved in JCPyV internalization and infection and elucidated their specific interactions that are responsible for activation of receptors. Collectively, these findings illuminate how viruses usurp cellular receptors during infection, contributing to current development efforts for therapeutic options for the treatment or prevention of PML.","output":"GRK2 mediates -arrestin interactions with 5-HT2 receptors for JC polyomavirus endocytosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Little is known about how asymptomatic testing as a method to control transmission of COVID-19 can be implemented, and the prevalence of asymptomatic infection within university populations.

METHODS: Using a representative, randomly drawn sample from the complete Danish adult population interviewed in March 2 to April 13, 2020 (n = 2836) and again in July 2020 (n = 1526, 54% retention rate), we study how the imposed lockdown announced March 11 following the onset of the first Danish wave of COVID-19 infections affected mental wellbeing. We use the World Health Organization Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) to capture risk for stress/depression (WHO-5 < 50) and functional impairment (WSAS > 10). Using covariate adjusted ordinary least squares linear probability models and exploiting variation in the timing of responses occurring just before and just after the introduction of lockdown, we compare respondents before lockdown to respondents that answered during lockdown, as well as to answers in re-interviews in July. RESULTS: In our fully controlled models, we find reduced depressive symptoms among adults immediately after the shutdown, concentrated in adults with children living at home (-.089, p < .01 (from pre lockdown baseline .273)). Measures of functional impairment also declined immediately after the March shutdown among adults with children living at home (-.066, p < .05 (from pre lockdown baseline .150)).

A clinical phenotype characterized by older age, a higher burden of comorbidities, and severe COVID-19 respiratory symptoms, was associated with the highest in-hospital mortality (58.6%) and a 3x higher risk of death than the rest of the cohort (OR 3.52, 95%CI 1.53-8.09, P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Stroke is relatively frequent among COVID-19 patients and has devastating consequences across all ages. The interplay of older age, comorbidities, and severity of COVID-19 respiratory symptoms is associated with an extremely elevated mortality.","output":"Stroke Risk, phenotypes, and death in COVID-19: Systematic review and newly reported cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Cardiac involvement with COVID-19 infection has become evident by elevated troponin, cardiac arrhythmias, ST segment elevation, myocarditis, fulminant heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. We aimed to describe the association of COVID-19 and T-wave inversion (TWI) in a large case series. METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective study of confirmed COVID-19 cases with at least one electrocardiogram (ECG) in a large hospital in New York City (March 23, 2020CApril 23, 2020). Patients with new TWI or pseudonormalization were further analyzed. Mortality and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation were the main outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 3225 patients were screened; 195 (6%) were selected for further analysis: 181 with TWI and 14 with T-wave pseudonormalization. Mean age was 66  7 years; 51% were male. TWI were more commonly noted in the lateral (71%), followed by anterior (64%), inferior (57%), and septal (26%) leads. A total of 44 patients (23%) had elevated troponin. A total of 50 patients died (26%). Mortality rates of 35%, and 52% were observed in patients with diffuse TWI, and elevated troponin, respectively. Mortality rate of 80% was observed in patients with both elevated troponin and diffuse TWI. Additionally, 30% of the entire cohort and 58% of patients with elevated troponin required invasive mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that new TWI is a relatively common finding in COVID-19 patients. Importantly, our findings suggest that new TWI or T-wave pseudonormalization, particularly with elevated troponin, was associated with higher rates of mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Adults with VI (best-corrected visual acuity <20/60 in the better-seeing eye), HI (ICD-10 codes), and age- and sex-matched controls (n=375) were recruited from the University of Michigan. The 34-item Coronavirus Disability Survey was administered. Chi-squared and logistic regression were used to compare survey responses between groups. RESULTS: All groups reported high levels of disruption of daily life with 80% reporting \\"a fair amount\\" or \\"a lot\\" of disruption (VI:76%, HI:83%, CT: 82%, p=0.33). Participants with VI had greater difficulty with day-to-day activities and were more likely to cite the following reasons: caregiver was worried about COVID-19 (ORVI=7.2, [95% CI 3.5-14.4], p<.001) and decreased availability of public transportation (ORVI=5.0, [95% CI 1.5-15.6], p=.006). Those with VI, but not HI, showed a trend toward increased difficulty accessing medical care (ORVI=2.0, [95% CI 0.99-4.0], p=.052) and they began relying more on others for day-to-day assistance (ORVI=3.1, [95% CI 1.6-5.7], p<.001). Overall, 30% reported difficulty obtaining trusted information about the pandemic. Those with VI reported more difficulty seeing or hearing trusted information (ORVI=6.1, [95% CI 1.6-22.1], p=.006). Employed participants with HI were more likely to report a reduction in wages (ORHI=2.5, [95% CI 1.2-5.3], p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with VI have experienced increased disruption and challenges in daily activities related to the pandemic. People with SI may benefit from targeted policy approaches to the current pandemic and future stressors. Minimal differences in some survey measures may be due to the large impact of the pandemic on the population as a whole.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 and Pandemic Mitigation Measures on Persons with Sensory Impairment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that lacks globally accessible effective antivirals or extensively available vaccines.

Cases underwent blood culture and induced sputum culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A subset had pleural fluid and lung aspirates collected for culture and polymerase chain reaction. Primary analyses included participants with negative or unknown HIV status (HIV?) and cases with abnormal chest radiographs (CXR+). Cases and controls were compared using logistic regression adjusting for age. Etiologic fractions were calculated by a Bayesian nested partially latent class analysis, the PERCH integrated analysis.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection highlighted the risk of rushing the publication of unvalidated findings, leading to damaging scientific miscommunication in the most extreme scenarios. Several high-profile preprints, later found to be deeply flawed, have indeed exacerbated widespread skepticism about the risks of the COVID-19 disease - at great cost to public health.

The COVID-19 pandemic has distorted many informal caregivers' roles, which require serious adjustment for reducing caregiving stress and burden. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has created challenging situations in caregiving spaces, which have the tendency to cause informal caregivers to abuse older adults. However, research on elder abuse and mistreatment, up to this point, remains underexplored in Africa. We, therefore, call for a deeper research and interrogation on the pathways and dynamics of violence and abuse against older adults in Africa. We also raise awareness of increased risks of domestic elder abuse and neglect during COVID-19 to stimulate the interest of social welfare institutions in understanding this phenomenon and its prevalence in Africa. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic should serve as an avenue for governments, social welfare institutions, public health authorities, civil society and traditional leaders in African countries to develop a comprehensive programme and create public awareness to protect older adults against abuse, violence and neglect.

While the abolition of taxes on private wealth during the 1990s and 2000s is recognized as an important institutional driver behind this development, comparatively little is known about the justification of tax cuts for the wealthy in advanced democracies. This paper investigates how the abolishment of the personal net wealth tax in Germany, a country with high levels of wealth inequality, has been debated and justified in parliament over a period of 20 years. Using a mixed methods approach that combines computational social science methods and a qualitative analysis, we examine how Germanys two major parties, the Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Social Democrats (SPD), have variously construed the meaning and purpose of the wealth tax and justified their support for or opposition to it. While the Social Democrats debate the wealth tax primarily from a social justice perspective, the Christian Democrats rely on an efficiency frame that invokes biological metaphors, enabling them to narrate the wealth tax as a threat to the social body. Paradoxically, then, by arguing that the tax is poison to the economy, conservative discourse succeeds in linking opposition to the wealth tax to a principle of social unity. On these grounds, we suggest that future research should scrutinize how the interrelation between political discourse and institutional architectures has facilitated the rise of wealth inequality in recent decades.","output":"Poison to the Economy: (Un-)Taxing the Wealthy in the German Federal Parliament from 1996 to 2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Governments have adopted strict home quarantine measures during the COVID-19 pandemic A monotonous, barren, and under-stimulating environment can cause state boredom, and people often deal with boredom via novelty-seeking behavior Novelty-seeking behavior can be divided into \\"novelty input\\" and \\"novelty output \\" The former refers to obtaining novel information such as browsing the Web;the latter refers to engaging in creative behavior such as literary creation This study explores the relationship between two types of novelty-seeking behavior and individual state boredom during home quarantine, along with the moderation effect of trait creativity The study sample consists of 582 Chinese college students who were quarantined at home during the COVID-19 pandemic Participants completed the Multidimensional State Boredom Scale, the Williams Creativity Aptitude Test, and self-compiled questionnaires of novelty input and novelty output The results show that there is no significant relationship between novelty input or novelty output and boredom during the COVID-19 quarantine Trait creativity is found to negatively moderate the relationship between the two means of novelty seeking and boredom Specifically, novelty output negatively predicts the state boredom of individuals with high creativity, while novelty input positively predicts the state boredom of individuals with low creativity Our findings suggest that different novelty-seeking behaviors may have different effects on the boredom level of individuals with high versus low creativity during quarantine During a quarantine period, individuals should avoid excessively engaging in novelty input behaviors aimed at escaping boring situations","output":"The Effect of \\"Novelty Input\\" and \\"Novelty Output\\" on Boredom During Home Quarantine in the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Moderating Effects of Trait Creativity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of and factors associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia.

However, confirmation on the most favorable source of MSCs remains uncertain to clinicians. The lack of knowledge in the current cellular treatment is uncertain in terms of how beneficial MSCs are in the long-term or short-term (resolution of pain) and improved quality of life. Whether MSCs treatments have any superiority, exists due to sources of MSCs utilized in their potential to objectively regenerate the cartilage at the target area. Many questions on source and condition remain unanswered. Hence, in this review, we discuss the lineage differentiation potentials of various sources of MSCs used in the management of knee osteoarthritis and emphasize the role of tissue engineering in cartilage regeneration.","output":"Lineage Differentiation Potential of Different Sources of Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Osteoarthritis Knee"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has presented multiple challenges to global healthcare services, dictating changes in almost every aspect of daily medical practice.

PURPOSE: To describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a pharmacy clinical decision support tool designed to increase naloxone coprescription among people at risk for opioid overdose in a large healthcare system. SUMMARY: The Military Health System Opioid Registry and underlying presentation layer were used to develop a clinical decision support capability to improve naloxone coprescription at the pharmacy point of care. Pharmacy personnel use a patient identification card barcode scanner or manually enter a patient's identification number to quickly visualize information on a patient's risk for opioid overdose and medical history related to pain and, when appropriate, receive a recommendation to coprescribe naloxone. The tool was made available to military treatment facility pharmacy locations. An interactive dashboard was developed to support monitoring, utilization, and impact on naloxone coprescription to patients at risk for opioid overdose. CONCLUSION: Initial implementation of the naloxone tool was slow from a lack of end-user awareness. Efforts to increase utilization were, in part, successful owing to a number of enterprise-wide educational initiatives. In early 2020, the naloxone tool was used in 15% of all opioid prescriptions dispensed at a military pharmacy. Data indicate that the frequency of naloxone coprescription to patients at risk for opioid overdose was significantly higher when the naloxone tool was used than when the tool was not used.","output":"Development, implementation, and evaluation of a clinical decision support tool to improve naloxone coprescription within military health system pharmacies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper investigates the impact of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on the crash risk of US stock market during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The PEAK PlasmaBlade is a monopolar electrosurgical device that uses pulsed radiofrequency energy to generate a plasma-mediated discharge along an insulated electrode, creating a cutting edge while the blade stays near body temperature. The aim of this study is to compare the histological samples, cardiac computed-tomography of graft patency, and clinical outcomes of patients after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting with preparation of the internal thoracic arteries by a conventional electrosurgical device and the PlasmaBlade. METHODS In twenty subjects one internal thoracic artery was prepared with PlasmaBlade and the other artery with a conventional electrosurgical device. Histological samples were evaluated for three factors for potential graft failure: endothelial damage, integrity of the vessel wall and adventitial hemorrhage. Five samples per artery were evaluated by a novel scoring method based on the exposed circumference of the histological sample (\\"0\\": 0%, \\"1\\": 1-25%, \\"2\\": 26-50%, \\"3\\": 51-75%, \\"4\\": 76% of the circumference). The Wilcoxon signed ranks test for mean scores within subjects was performed. Six-month-follow up by cardiac computed tomography for evaluation of graft patency was completed in 16 patients. RESULTS Histological results demonstrated significantly less endothelial damage after PlasmaBlade (83% vs 60%, absolute: 75/90 vs. 53/89 samples with score \\"0-1\\", p = 0.04). PlasmaBlade samples demonstrated a tendency to better wall integrity (72% vs. 54%, absolute: 64/89 vs. 47/87 samples with score \\"0-1\\", p = 0.32). There were no differences in endothelial bleeding (PlasmaBlade 46% vs. electrosurgery 53%, absolute: 41/88 vs. 48/90 samples with score \\"0-1\\", p = 0.63). Computed tomography confirmed non-inferiority of the PlasmaBlade to conventional electrosurgery with a patency rate of 94%. CONCLUSION Histologically, internal thoracic arteries harvested with PlasmaBlade demonstrate a more intact endothelial layer and a tendency to better wall integrity. Computed tomography of graft patency speaks for non-inferiority to conventional electrosurgery. PlasmaBlade may be preferable to conventional electrosurgery, if further follow-up confirms patency of internal thoracic arteries.

Multiple studies show that ASE plays a role in hereditary diseases by modulating penetrance or phenotype severity. However, genome diagnostics is based on DNA sequencing and therefore neglects gene expression regulation such as ASE. To take advantage of ASE in absence of RNA sequencing, it must be predicted using only DNA variation. We have constructed ASE models from BIOS (n = 3432) and GTEx (n = 369) that predict ASE using DNA features. These models are highly reproducible and comprise many different feature types, highlighting the complex regulation that underlies ASE. We applied the BIOS-trained model to population variants in three genes in which ASE plays a clinically relevant role: BRCA2, RET and NF1. This resulted in predicted ASE effects for 27 variants, of which 10 were known pathogenic variants. We demonstrated that ASE can be predicted from DNA features using machine learning. Future efforts may improve sensitivity and translate these models into a new type of genome diagnostic tool that prioritizes candidate pathogenic variants or regulators thereof for follow-up validation by RNA sequencing.

Objective: We aimed to examine changes in estimated sleep duration in 5 major metropolitan areas before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study using estimated sleep duration data obtained from a smartphone app. The data were obtained from regular users of the smartphone app before and after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. We compared within-subject estimated sleep duration before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using generalized linear mixed models. Results: Among the 2,871,037 observations, 957,022 (33.3%) were from users in London;549,151 (19.1%) were from users in Los Angeles;846,527 (29.5%) were from users in New York City;251,113 (8.7%) were from users in Seoul;and 267,224 (9.3%) were from users in Stockholm. The average age of the users in the sample was 35 years (SE 11 years). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, people residing in Seoul had the shortest estimated sleep duration (mean 6 hours 28 minutes, SE 11.6 minutes) and those residing in Stockholm had the longest estimated sleep duration (mean 7 hours 34 minutes, SE 9.9 minutes). The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a 13.7 minute increase in estimated sleep duration when comparing March 2019 and March 2020 (95% CI 13.1-14.3, P<.001) and an increase of 22.3 minutes when comparing April 2019 and April 2020 (95% CI 21.5-23.1, P<.001). Conclusions: The average estimated sleep duration increased sharply in the months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding suggests that the implementation of COVID-19 mitigation strategies has provided people worldwide with increased opportunities to sleep, which may enhance the response of the immune system to viral pathogens.

Our results show that the transplant net benefit is closely related to the decrease in the number of organs, but it is also higher in T2 HCC patients than in non-HCC patients with the same model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores. Our model supports liver transplantation for T2 HCC with the highest net benefit also during crises such as COVID-19. ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic caused temporary drops in the supply of organs for transplantation, leading to renewed debate about whether T2 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients should receive priority during these times. The aim of this study was to provide a quantitative model to aid decision-making in liver transplantation for T2 HCC. We proposed a novel ethical framework where the individual transplant benefit for a T2 HCC patient should outweigh the harm to others on the waiting list, determining a net benefit, to define appropriate organ allocation. This ethical framework was then translated into a quantitative Markov model including Italian averages for waiting list characteristics, donor resources, mortality, and transplant rates obtained from a national prospective database (n = 8567 patients). The net benefit of transplantation in a T2 HCC patient in a usual situation varied from 0 life months with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of 15, to 34 life months with a MELD score of 40, while it progressively decreased with acute organ shortage during a pandemic (i.e., with a 50% decrease in organs, the net benefit varied from 0 life months with MELD 30, to 12 life months with MELD 40). Our study supports the continuation of transplantation for T2 HCC patients during crises such as COVID-19; however, the focus needs to be on those T2 HCC patients with the highest net survival benefit.","output":"Liver Transplantation for T2 Hepatocellular Carcinoma during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Novel Model Balancing Individual Benefit against Healthcare Resources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since 2013, the usage of preprints as a means of sharing research in biology has rapidly grown, in particular via the preprint server bioRxiv. Recent studies have found that journal articles that were previously posted to bioRxiv received a higher number of citations or mentions/shares on other online platforms compared to articles in the same journals that were not posted. However, the exact causal mechanism for this effect has not been established, and may in part be related to authors biases in the selection of articles that are chosen to be posted as preprints. We aimed to investigate this mechanism by conducting a mixed-methods survey of 1,444 authors of bioRxiv preprints, to investigate the reasons that they post or do not post certain articles as preprints, and to make comparisons between articles they choose to post and not post as preprints. We find that authors are most strongly motivated to post preprints to increase awareness of their work and increase the speed of its dissemination; conversely, the strongest reasons for not posting preprints centre around a lack of awareness of preprints and reluctance to publicly post work that has not undergone a peer review process. We additionally find weak evidence that authors preferentially select their highest quality, most novel or most significant research to post as preprints, however, authors retain an expectation that articles they post as preprints will receive more citations or be shared more widely online than articles not posted.","output":"Motivations, concerns and selection biases when posting preprints: a survey of bioRxiv authors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26), a type II transmembrane ectopeptidase, is the receptor for the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS emerged in 2012 and has a high mortality associated with severe lung disease. A lack of autopsy studies from MERS fatalities has hindered understanding of MERS-CoV pathogenesis. We investigated the spatial and cellular localization of DPP4 to evaluate an association MERS clinical disease. DPP4 was rarely detected in the surface epithelium from nasal cavity to conducting airways with a slightly increased incidence in distal airways. DPP4 was also found in a subset of mononuclear leukocytes and in serous cells of submucosal glands. In the parenchyma, DPP4 was found principally in type I and II cells and alveolar macrophages and was also detected in vascular endothelium (eg, lymphatics) and pleural mesothelia. Patients with chronic lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis, exhibited increased DPP4 immunostaining in alveolar epithelia (type I and II cells) and alveolar macrophages with similar trends in reactive mesothelia. This finding suggests that preexisting pulmonary disease could increase MERS-CoV receptor abundance and predispose individuals to MERS morbidity and mortality, which is consistent with current clinical observations.

Methods The Thrombectomy In TANdem Lesions (TITAN) collaboration pooled individual data of prospectively collected thrombectomy international databases for all consecutive anterior circulation tandem patients who underwent emergent thrombectomy. The co-primary outcome measures were rates of successful reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b/3) and time from groin puncture to successful reperfusion. Results In total, 289 patients with tandem atherosclerotic etiology were included in the analysis (182 Neck-First and 107 Head-First patients). Except for differences in the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS; median 8 [range 7-10] Neck-First vs. 7 [range 6-8] Head-First; p < 0.001) and cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) lesion severity (complete occlusion in 35% of the Neck-First vs. 57% of the Head-First patients; p < 0.001), patient characteristics were well balanced. After adjustments, there was no difference in successful reperfusion rates between the study groups (odds ratio associated with Neck-First: 1.18 [95% confidence interval, 0.60-2.17]). The time to successful reperfusion from groin puncture was significantly shorter in the Head-First group after adjustments (median 56 min [range 39-90] vs. 70 [range 50-102]; p = 0.001). No significant differences in the rates of full reperfusion, symptomatic hemorrhage, 90-day independence, or mortality were observed. Sensitivity analysis excluding patients with complete cervical ICA occlusion yielded similar results.

This virus is a new isolate of coronavirus, and the current infection crisis has surpassed the SARS and MERS epidemics that occurred in 2002 and 2013, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 has currently infected more than 142,000 people, causing 5,000 deaths and spreading across more than 130 countries worldwide. The spreading capacity of the virus clearly demonstrates the potential threat of respiratory viruses to human health, thereby reiterating to the governments around the world that preventive health policies and scientific research are pivotal to overcoming the crisis. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes flu-like symptoms in most cases. However, approximately 15% of the patients need hospitalization, and 5% require assisted ventilation, depending on the cohorts studied.

In fact, the death rate in this group may be up to 10-12%. Interestingly, children are somehow less susceptible and are not considered as a risk group. Therefore, in this review, we discuss some possible molecular and cellular mechanisms by virtue of which the elderly subjects may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19. Toward this, we raise two main points, i) increased ACE-2 expression in pulmonary and heart tissues in users of chronic angiotensin 1 receptor (AT1R) blockers; and ii) antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) after previous exposure to other circulating coronaviruses.

The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and other recent geographically- confined viral outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola, dengue, zika and ever-recurring seasonal influenza), also with devastating tolls at sanitary and socio-economic levels, are sobering reminders in this respect. Among the respective pathogenic agents, Zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted by Aedes mosquito vectors and causing the eponymous fever, is particularly insidious in that infection during pregnancy results in complications such as foetal loss, preterm birth or irreversible brain abnormalities, including microcephaly. So far, there is no effective remedy for ZIKV infection, mainly due to the limited ability of antiviral drugs to cross bloodCplacental and/or bloodCbrain barriers (BPB and BBB, respectively). Despite its restricted permeability, the BBB is penetrable by a variety of molecules, mainly peptide-based, and named BBB peptide shuttles (BBBpS), able to ferry various payloads (e.g., drugs, antibodies, etc.) into the brain. Recently, we have described peptideCporphyrin conjugates (PPCs) as successful BBBpS-associated drug leads for HIV, an enveloped virus in which group ZIKV also belongs. Herein, we report on several brain-directed, low-toxicity PPCs capable of targeting ZIKV.

A total of 140 patients with only hypertension and 98 patients with hypertension and comorbidities were recruited, and the changes inblood pressure andlaboratory data were assessed after 6 months. Analyses performed with generalized estimating equations showed that patients who had not forgotten to take medication had a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate. Moreover, patients who did not change their medication time arbitrarily had lower low- density lipoprotein levels. Furthermore, patients who did not stop or interrupt their medication arbitrarily had lower diastolic blood pressuresand low-density lipoprotein levels.

A narrative review was carried out to support a protocol for treating ECC with efficacious and safe (in terms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission) procedures. Protocol involves criteria for patients' selection remotely (telemedicine), and well-detailed criteria/equipment and hygiene procedures to combat against SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Moreover, the protocol proposes innovative caries treatments, named Minimally Invasive Treatments (MITs), well known in pedodontics for their high level of children's acceptance during dental care. MITs allow for caries removal (particularly in primary teeth) without any high-speed rotating instrument cooled with nebulized air-water spray (with high risk of virus environmental diffusion), usually adopted during traditional treatments. For evaluating MITs effectiveness in caries management, only Systematic Review and Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were included in our study, without any risk of bias assessment.

In addition to the accuracy requirement, early warning systems must make the predictions early enough to give physicians enough time to intervene. Interpretability is also one of the challenges when building such systems since being able to justify the reasoning behind model decisions is desirable in clinical practice. In this work, we built an interpretable model for the early prediction of various adverse clinical events indicative of clinical deterioration. The model is evaluated on two datasets and four clinical events. The first dataset is collected in a predominantly COVID-19 positive population at Stony Brook Hospital. The second dataset is the MIMIC III dataset. The model was trained to provide early warning scores for ventilation, ICU transfer, and mortality prediction tasks on the Stony Brook Hospital dataset and to predict mortality and the need for vasopressors on the MIMIC III dataset. Our model first separates each feature into multiple ranges and then uses logistic regression with lasso penalization to select the subset of ranges for each feature. The model training is completely automated and doesn't require expert knowledge like other early warning scores. We compare our model to the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and quick SOFA (qSOFA), commonly used in hospitals. We show that our model outperforms these models in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) while having a similar or better median detection time on all clinical events, even when using fewer features. Unlike MEWS and qSOFA, our model can be entirely automated without requiring any manually recorded features.

Numerous studies have focused on leadership styles, particularly charismatic leadership, as an antecedent to organizational achievements. However, most researchers neglected to consider the followers' perception of their leader's performance. Understanding and accommodating the needs of the followers is essential to the leader's success. The current study investigates the influence of charismatic leaders on dispersed teams in non-vocational educational institutions in Lebanon. This quantitative study utilized two structured questionnaires to investigate the charismatic leadership during the COVID-19 crisis from the perspective of educators who work in virtual teams. Five hypotheses on the effect of crisis-bound charismatic leadership on distant educational teams were tested. The relation between the number of years of experience and charisma was not explored since the majority of respondents fell in the category of five years or more at the institution. A total of seventy-seven respondents completed the survey online. Statistical analysis, using the software SPSS-23, showed that neither gender nor level of education affected the followers' perception of charismatic leadership during crises. Nonetheless, the study findings showed a strong positive correlation between charismatic leadership and the ability to lead in a crisis, concluding that charismatic leaders emerge in times of stress.

It has several significant advantages over the tension-free open repair now in use. In this report we summarize our laparoscopic hernia repair results and recommendations. METHODS The transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) procedures for groin hernias performed between January 2003 and January 2008 at a single center were analyzed retrospectively. Individual surgeon performances were compared to determine whether the rates of complications were related to the level of surgeon experience. RESULTS A total of 312 TAPP procedures were reviewed, and 284 (91%) of the patients were followed retrospectively. There were 266 (85.25%) males and 46 (14.75%) females. The average age was 57.4 years. The mean length of hospital stay was 2.1 days. The mean duration of surgery was 35 min. Six (1.92%) intraoperative and seven (2.24%) postoperative complications were noted. Two recurrences occurred (0.70%). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic TAPP hernia repair has proven to be an efficient method for the treatment of groin hernias at our institution. Most patients can be treated as day-cases, namely they are hospitalized for 1 day, and they demonstrate a low recurrence rate (0.70%). Such low morbidity makes TAPP an attractive method for the routine treatment of groin hernias.","output":"Laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal approach for inguinal hernia repair: a five-year experience at a single center."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has increased contractual concerns under contingencies for public- private partnership (P3) projects.

The model consists of a domain-specific lexicon developed based on 21 US transportation P3 concession agreements and a set of matching rules to identify target sentences which fall into five classes, namely remedy entitlement, remedy obligation, liability waiver, mitigation, and termination. This automatic process can reduce the time and cost of the contract review process and help identify issues that the contracting parties should consider going forward in drafting new contracts or in amending existing contracts to avoid potential disputes, in response to consequences of contingencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Identifying Contingency Liability from P3 Contracts Using Rule-Based NLP"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The media coverage on the COVID-19 pandemic has caused emotional distress among people.

Strict adherence to preventive measures reduces the risk of VAP. The objective of this paper is to review what has come forward in recent years in the nonpharmacological prevention of VAP. RECENT FINDINGS It seems advantageous to implement care bundles rather than single prevention measures. A solid basis of knowledge seems necessary to facilitate implementation and maintain a high adherence level. Continuous educational efforts have a beneficial effect on attitude toward VAP. Intermittent subglottic secretions drainage, continuous lateral rotation therapy, and polyurethane cuffed endotracheal tubes decrease the risk of pneumonia. In an in-vitro setting, an endotracheal tube with a taper-shaped cuff appears to better prevent fluid leakage compared to cylindrical polyurethane or polyvinylchloride cuffed tubes. Cuff pressure control by means of an automatic device and multimodality chest physiotherapy need further investigation, as do some aspects of oral hygiene. SUMMARY New devices and strategies have been developed to prevent VAP. Some of these are promising but need further study. In addition, more attention is being given to factors that might facilitate the implementation process and the challenge of achieving high adherence rates.","output":"What is new in the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to the postponement of low-acuity surgical procedures in an effort to conserve resources and ensure patient safety. This study aimed to characterize patient-reported concerns about undergoing surgical procedures during the pandemic. METHODS: We administered a cross-sectional survey to patients who had their general and plastic surgical procedures postponed at the onset of the pandemic, asking about barriers to accessing surgical care. Questions addressed dependent care, transportation, employment and insurance status, as well as perceptions of and concerns about COVID-19. Mixed methods and inductive thematic analyses were conducted. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-five patients were interviewed. We identified the following patient concerns: contracting COVID-19 in the hospital (46%), being alone during hospitalization (40%), facing financial stressors (29%), organizing transportation (28%), experiencing changes to health insurance coverage (25%), and arranging care for dependents (18%). Nonwhite participants were 5 and 2.5 times more likely to have concerns about childcare and transportation, respectively. Perceptions of decreased hospital safety and the consequences of possible COVID-19 infection led to delay in rescheduling. Education about safety measures and communication about scheduling partially mitigated concerns about COVID-19. However, uncertainty about timeline for rescheduling and resolution of the pandemic contributed to ongoing concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Providing effective surgical care during this unprecedented time requires both awareness of societal shifts impacting surgical patients and system-level change to address new barriers to care. Eliciting patients' perspectives, adapting processes to address potential barriers, and effectively educating patients about institutional measures to minimize in-hospital transmission of COVID-19 should be integrated into surgical care.","output":"Patient Perceptions on Barriers and Facilitators to Accessing Low-acuity Surgery During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has catapulted the world into a marked health crisis, with over 29 million cases and >930,000 deaths. To better detect affected individuals at an early stage and stop disease progression to an advanced stage, several studies have been conducted to identify the clinical, biological, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19. This study aimed to enrich the literature by critically analyzing the clinical and biological characteristics of 134 patients from the North African Mediterranean region, including numerous genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors that may influence disease evolution. This single-center retrospective study included all patients older than 18 years confirmed to have COVID-19 and hospitalized at the Cheikh Khalifa University Hospital affiliated with Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences, Casablanca, Morocco. Clinical, demographic, and biological data were analyzed in a cohort of severe and non-severe patients. Univariate analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of severity. There were 134 patients: the median age was 53 years, and 54.5% were male. Of these, 89 had mild to moderate disease; 45 had severe to critical disease, of which 14 died and 31 survived. Advanced age, presence of comorbidities, male sex, and infection in ethnic or family groups were risk factors for progression to severe disease. The presence of abnormalities in the following parameters were strongly associated with progression to severe disease: white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), and alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) during both admission and hospitalization.

To ascertain and rank the risk of VOCs and VOIs, we analyzed their ability to escape from vaccine-induced antibodies. The variants showed differential reductions in neutralization and replication titers by post-vaccination sera. Although the Omicron variant showed the most escape from neutralization, sera collected after a third dose of vaccine (booster sera) retained moderate neutralizing activity against that variant.

At the convergence between lab-on-chip and cell biology, BoC couples in vitro three-dimensional brain-like systems to an engineered microfluidics platform designed to provide an in vivo-like extrinsic microenvironment with the aim of replicating tissue- or organ-level physiological functions. BoC therefore offers the advantage of an in vitro reproduction of brain structures that is more faithful to the native correlate than what is obtained with conventional cell culture techniques. As brain function ultimately results in the generation of electrical signals, electrophysiology techniques are paramount for studying brain activity in health and disease. However, as BoC is still in its infancy, the availability of combined BoCCelectrophysiology platforms is still limited. Here, we summarize the available biological substrates for BoC, starting with a historical perspective. We then describe the available tools enabling BoC electrophysiology studies, detailing their fabrication process and technical features, along with their advantages and limitations. We discuss the current and future applications of BoC electrophysiology, also expanding to complementary approaches. We conclude with an evaluation of the potential translational applications and prospective technology developments.","output":"Electrophysiology Read-Out Tools for Brain-on-Chip Biotechnology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Pharmacologic immunosuppression and incomplete immune reconstitution after allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) may impair a patient's ability to mount an immune response to vaccines, including currently available COVID-19 vaccines. Since immunocompromised patients are susceptible to severe COVID-19 and likely to respond poorly to vaccination, we sought to characterize SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses after vaccination in alloSCT patients to determine predictors of serologic response, which may inform timing of vaccine administration. Methods This retrospective analysis included adult patients who underwent alloSCT at the University of Pennsylvania between 1/1/2019 and 1/1/2021. Chart review identified patients who had received COVID-19 vaccines and had post-vaccination antibody titers drawn by July 2021 as part of routine care (n=63). Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain were detected using an assay developed at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Variables analyzed include interval between transplant date and initial vaccination, active GVHD, concurrent immunosuppressive therapy, absolute CD4 count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm3 peri-vaccination, and total IgG greater than or equal to 400 mg/dL peri-vaccination. Immunosuppressive therapy was defined as tacrolimus, rituximab, ruxolitinib, prednisone 10 mg daily or greater, or extracorporeal photopheresis. Predictors of positive antibody response were assessed using a multivariate, binary logistic regression. Results Median transplant to vaccine interval was 458 days (range 125 to 813) for the 63 vaccinated patients with serologies available. GVHD was present in 23/63 (37%), and 19/63 (30%) were receiving immunosuppressive therapies at the time of vaccination. CD4 count greater than 200 cells/mm3 was observed in 49 patients (78%), and total IgG greater than 400 mg/dL was observed in 51 patients (81%). In total, 50/63 patients (79%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Positive serologies were observed in 41/49 (84%) with CD4 counts greater than 200 cells/mm3, compared to 9/14 (64%) with CD4 less than 200 cells/mm3. Our model found that peri-vaccination CD4 count greater than 200 cells/mm3 was a significant predictor of positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG serologies in this population (OR 2.14, 97.5% CI = 0.7 to 3.8, p= 0.005). Transplant to vaccine interval, total IgG levels, GVHD status, and immunosuppressive therapies were not significant predictors of serologic response. As of July 2021 no patients had developed COVID-19 after vaccination, regardless of serologic response. Conclusions This retrospective observational study demonstrates that the majority of alloSCT patients vaccinated against COVID-19 within 2 years of transplant, including those with active GVHD and on immunosuppressive therapies, can mount serologic responses. CD4 count greater than 200 cells/mm3 is a significant predictor of positive serologic response, though even among patients with CD4 counts under 200 cells/mm3 over 60% developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies.

METHODS A single colostrum sample was collected, by complete udder evacuation, from each of 20 cows from 29 dairy herds in the Waikato region of New Zealand during the 2016 spring calving period. Vaccination pre-partum with a calf diarrhoea vaccine was used in 15 herds. Each colostrum sample was tested using a digital Brix refractometer. The body condition score of each cow was recorded at the time of sample collection and farmers provided records of clinical mastitis and facial eczema from the previous 12 months, as well as the age and breed of cows. Associations between cow-level variables in non-vaccinated herds and Brix were examined using a multivariable linear mixed model and estimated marginal means obtained for different categories. RESULTS Mean Brix of 281 samples from cows in non-vaccinated herds was 18.7 (SD 0.26)%; 63/281 (22.4%) samples had Brix 22% and 152/281 (54.1%) had Brix 18%. Mean Brix of colostrum samples from cows aged 6 years (20.2 (95% CI=19.1-21.2)%) was higher than for samples from 2-year-old cows (18.6 (95% CI=17.3-19.9)%) (p=0.005). Colostrum that was collected at the first milking on the day of calving had higher Brix (20.0 (95% CI=19.1-20.9)%) than colostrum collected from cows that calved the previous day (17.5 (95% CI=16.5-18.4)%) (p<0.001). Mean Brix of colostrum samples from cows which produced 8 L (18.2 (95% CI=17.1-19.2)%) tended to be lower than from cows which produced <8 L first-milking colostrum (19.1 (95% CI=18.3-20.0)%) (p=0.08). Among vaccinating herds, 9/15 (60%) had 60% colostrum samples with Brix 18% compared with 4/14 (29%) of non-vaccinating herds (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Colostrum quality, as measured by Brix, was associated with the total volume of first-milking colostrum, interval from calving to colostrum collection and cow age. Vaccination against calf diarrhoea was associated with a higher proportion of colostrum samples with adequate Brix. Careful selection of colostrum donor cows should ensure newborn calves are fed adequate quality colostrum which should be beneficial in preventing failure of passive transfer of IgG. Testing of colostrum from individual cows with a Brix refractometer is advocated for the selection of colostrum for feeding newborn calves.","output":"Factors associated with colostrum quality in individual cows from dairy herds in the Waikato region of New Zealand."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: A high burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, increasing elderly population, immunosenescence, and emerging drug resistance emphasize the need for robust adult immunization in India. While immunization guidelines from various societies exist, there is inadequate implementation of the same. AIM: We undertook this narrative review of the adult vaccination ecosystem in India to (i) gain insights into existing adult vaccination practices, (ii) identify barriers to adult vaccination and possible solutions, and (iii) improve collaboration between various stakeholders to help establish adult vaccination centers in the country. RESULTS: Besides the high cost and lack of insurance coverage, the lack of adult vaccination centers contributes to the low coverage of adult immunization. DISCUSSION: These challenges can be addressed through multiple approaches including community awareness and immunization programs, setting up mobile vaccination vans, patient/consumer education, and adequate training of healthcare providers. Successful implementation of these strategies requires active collaboration between the government, hospitals, different stakeholders, and policymakers.","output":"Developing Adult Vaccination Ecosystem in India: Current Perspective and the Way Forward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Presently, the world is under the toll of pandemic coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 Lack of effective and safe therapeutics has stressed the scientific community for developing novel therapeutics capable of alleviating and stopping this pandemic Within the presented study, molecular docking, ADME properties and all-atom molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, along with two standard antiviral agents (lopinavir and benzopurpurin-4B), were applied to investigate 15 scalaranes sesterterpenes natural compounds, purified from the Red Sea marine sponge Hyrtios&nbsp;erectus, as potential COVID-19 dual-target inhibitors Following multi-step docking within COVID-19 main protease and Nsp15 endoribonuclease cavities, nine promising drug-like compounds exhibited higher docking scores as well as better interactions with the targets crucial residues than those of reference ligands Compounds 2, 6, 11, and 15, were predicted to simultaneously subdue the activity of the two COVID-19 targets Dynamics behavior of the best-docked molecules, compounds 15 and 6, within COVID-19 target pockets showed substantial stability of ligand-protein complexes as presented via several MD simulation parameters Furthermore, calculated free-binding energies from MD simulation illustrated significant ligands binding affinity towards respective target pockets All provided findings supported the utility of scalarane-based sesterterpenes, particularly compounds 15 and 6, as promising lead candidates guiding the development of effective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2","output":"Molecular Docking and Dynamics Simulation Study of Hyrtios erectus Isolated Scalarane Sesterterpenes as Potential SARS-CoV-2 Dual Target Inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by massive cytokine release and T cell loss.

These findings suggest that the enzyme is monomeric in form in human seminal plasma. The enzyme hydrolyzed several amino acid 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (MCA) substrates. The order of K(cat;)/K(m) values of AAP at optimal pH (pH 7.5) was Ala- >Lys-Ala-  Met- > Leu- > Phe- > Arg-  Arg-Arg- > Lys- > Gly-MCAs. AAP was potently inhibited by bestatin, leuhis-tin, actinonin, amastatin, and 1,10-phenanthroline. These findings suggest that AAP is an aminopeptidase. We determined that the amino acid sequence of the first 22 residues of the enzyme was Ser(1)-Thr-Thr-Pro-Ser(5)-Ala-Ser-Ala-Thr-Thr(10)-Asn-Pro-Ala-Ser-Ala(15)-Thr-Thr-Leu-Asp-Gln(20)-Ser-Lys-.

With increasing secularism, these relationships are less entwined. Nonetheless, as nurses typically encounter patients at critical life events, such as receiving bad news or dying, nurses frequently understand the need and requirement for both spiritual support and religious for patients and families during these times. Yet there are uncertainties, and nurses can feel ill-equipped to deal with patients spiritual needs. Little education or preparation is provided to these nurses, and they often report a lack of confidence within this area. The development of this confidence and the required competencies is important, especially so with increasingly multicultural societies with diverse spiritual and religious needs.

Endocrine evaluation and management are an essential part of perioperative care. However, the details of endocrine assessment and care are not universally agreed upon. METHODS: To build consensus on the endocrine evaluation and management of adults undergoing TSS, a Delphi process was used. Thirty-five statements were developed by the Pituitary Societys Education Committee. Fifty-five pituitary endocrinologists, all members of the Pituitary Society, were invited to participate in two Delphi rounds and rate their extent of agreement with statements pertaining to perioperative endocrine evaluation and management, using a Likert-type scale. Anonymized data on the proportion of panelists agreeing with each item were summarized. A list of items that achieved consensus, based on predefined criteria, was tabulated. RESULTS: Strong consensus ( 80% of panelists rating their agreement as 6C7 on a scale from 1 to 7) was achieved for 68.6% (24/35) items. If less strict agreement criteria were applied (ratings 5C7 on the Likert-type scale), consensus was achieved for 88% (31/35) items.

Patients with medical comorbidities are more likely to be infected and have a worse prognosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of anxiety due to COVID-19 pandemic in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) who used immunosuppressive drugs during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify the risk and protective factors that cause anxiety. Methods: : A total of 145 patients with RMDs aged 18 years who used regular immunosuppressive drugs and 95 healthy controls were included in the study. An anonymous survey comprising questions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic was used, and the Beck anxiety inventory (BAI) was used to measure the anxiety levels of participants. Additional information was collected such as demographic data, current RMDs, immunosuppressive drugs used, information and concerns about COVID-19, and the source of information about COVID-19. Results: : About 42.1% patients reported that the epidemic caused concern due to the drug they were using, and 33.8% rated their concerns as moderate and severe. The BAI scores of patients and healthy controls were 4 (0-52) and 3 (0-18) respectively. According to the BAI scores, 16.5% patients had moderate to severe anxiety symptoms;and comparison of the groups showed that the anxiety level of the patient group was significantly higher (38.6% vs. 18.9%, p=0.001).

Summary: In this review article, we present the available evidence regarding the impact of inflammation on platelet activation in atherosclerosis. Key messages: In the context of a dysfunctional vascular endothelium, structural alterations by means of endothelial glycocalyx thinning or functional modifications through impaired NO bioavailability and increased levels of von Willebrand factor result in platelet activation. Moreover, neutrophil-derived mediators, as well as neutrophil extracellular traps formation, have been implicated in the process of platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte aggregation. The role of pro-inflammatory cytokines is also critical since their receptors are also situated in platelets while TNF- has also been found to induce inflammatory, metabolic, and bone marrow changes. Additionally, important progress has been made towards novel concepts of the interaction between inflammation and platelet activation, such as the toll-like receptors, myeloperoxidase, and platelet factor-4. The accumulating evidence is especially important in the era of the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic, characterized by an excessive inflammatory burden leading to thrombotic complications, partially mediated by platelet activation.

Different fatality rates among countries are probably due to non-standardized records being carried out by local health authorities. The Spanish case-fatality rate is 11.22%, far higher than those reported in Asia or by other European countries. A multicentre retrospective study of demographic, clinical, laboratory and immunological features of 584 Spanish COVID-19 hospitalized patients and their outcomes was performed. The use of renin-angiotensin system blockers was also analysed as a risk factor. Results: In this study, 27.4% of cases presented a mild course, 42.1% a moderate one and for 30.5% of cases, the course was severe. Ages ranged from 18 to 98 (average 63). Almost 60 % (59.8%) of patients were male. Interleukin 6 was higher as severity increased. On the other hand, CD8 lymphocyte count was significantly lower as severity grew and subpopulations CD4, CD8, CD19, and NK showed concordant lowering trends. Severity-related natural killer percent descents were evidenced just within aged cases. A significant severity-related decrease of CD4 lymphocytes was found in males. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was associated with a better prognosis. The angiotensin II receptor blocker use was associated with a more severe course. Conclusions: Age and age-related comorbidities, such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension or diabetes, determined more frequent severe forms of the disease in this study than in previous literature cohorts. Our cases are older than those so far reported and the clinical course of the disease is found to be impaired by age. Immunosenescence might be therefore a suitable explanation for the hampering of immune system effectors. The adaptive immunity would become exhausted and a strong but ineffective and almost deleterious innate response would account for COVID-19 severity. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors used by hypertensive patients have a protective effect in regards to COVID-19 severity in our series.

We sought to identify antiviral targets through genome-wide characterization of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that are crucial for viral pathogenesis and that cause harmful cytopathic effects. All twenty-nine viral proteins were tested in a fission yeast cell-based system using inducible gene expression. Twelve proteins including eight non-structural proteins (NSP1, NSP3, NSP4, NSP5, NSP6, NSP13, NSP14 and NSP15) and four accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a and ORF7b) were identified that altered cellular proliferation and integrity, and induced cell death. Cell death correlated with the activation of cellular oxidative stress. Of the twelve proteins, ORF3a was chosen for further study in mammalian cells. In human pulmonary and kidney epithelial cells, ORF3a induced cellular oxidative stress associated with apoptosis and necrosis, and caused activation of pro-inflammatory response with production of the cytokines TNF-, IL-6, and IFN-{beta}1, possibly through the activation of NF-{kappa}B. To further characterize the mechanism, we tested a natural ORF3a Beta variant, Q57H, and a mutant with deletion of the highly conserved residue, {Delta}G188. Compared to wild type ORF3a, the {Delta}G188 variant yielded more robust activation of cellular oxidative stress, cell death, and innate immune response. Since cellular oxidative stress and inflammation contribute to cell death and tissue damage linked to the severity of COVID-19, our findings suggest that ORF3a is a promising, novel therapeutic target against COVID-19. SignificanceThe ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has claimed over 5 million lives with more than 250 million people infected world-wide. While vaccines are effective, the emergence of new viral variants could jeopardize vaccine protection. Antiviral drugs provide an alternative to battle against COVID-19. Our goal was to identify viral therapeutic targets that can be used in antiviral drug discovery. Utilizing a genome-wide functional analysis in a fission yeast cell-based system, we identified twelve viral candidates, including ORF3a, which cause cellular oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis and necrosis that contribute to COVID-19.

Permissive hypercapnia did not decrease periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), ROP, hydrocephalus or air leaks.

Using siRNA and shRNA approaches, we show that TFG is required for virus-induced TBK1 activation resulting in C-terminal IRF3 phosphorylation and dimerization. We further show that the ability of the TRAF3-TFG complex to engage mTOR following SeV infection allows TBK1 to phosphorylate mTOR on serine 2159, a post-translational modification shown to promote mTORC1 signaling. We demonstrate that the activation of mTORC1 signaling during SeV infection plays a positive role in the expression of Viperin, IRF7 and IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) proteins, and that depleting TFG resulted in a compromised antiviral state.

The present study is aimed at assessment of bioactive antiviral phytochemicals as potential SARS-COV-2 M(pro) inhibitors, using ensemble docking, molecular dynamics and MM-PBSA calculations. Ensemble docking studies were performed with Autodock vina program. The top 5 compounds having highest binding free energy were subjected to 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations with Gromacs. The resulting trajectories of converged period of MD were further exploited in MM-PBSA calculations to derive accurate estimates of binding free energies. The MD results were analysed with respect to RMSD, RMSF and hydrogen bond formation and occupancy parameters. The drugs remdesivir and nelfinavir were used as standard drugs for comparative studies. In the docking studies five phytochemicals, dalpanitin, amentoflavone, naringin, hinokiflavone, and rutin were found having lowest binding free energies (< ? 10 kcal mol(?1)) which is lower than standard drugs.

Also, the super-resolution methods based on feature space optimization usually have artifacts or structural deformation in the generated image.

Finally, we combine contextual loss and L1 loss in the gradient map branch to optimize the quality of visual perception and design the information entropy contrast-aware channel attention to give different weights to the feature map.

However, clinical trials based on its oral administration have failed to provide significant effect on cardiac functionality.

Herein, we loaded CoQ10 in high bioavailable nano-emulsions (NEs) coated with chitosan or chitosan and hyaluronic acid in order to improve its performance. Methods: We tested cardioprotective and hepatoprotective effects of CoQ10-loaded nano-carriers against Doxorubicin and Trastuzumab toxicities in cardiomyocytes and liver cells through analysis of cell viability, lipid peroxidation, expression of leukotrienes, p65/NF-kB and pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in anticancer-induced cardio and hepatotoxicity. Results: Nano-carriers showed high stability and loading ability and increased cell viability both in hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes during anticancer treatments. We observed that these effects are mediated by the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and reduction of the inflammation.

The activation of JNK under hypoxic conditions was dependent on overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in cardiomyocytes, and mitochondrial division was identified as the upstream inducer of mtROS overproduction. Silencing mitochondrial division activators, such as B cell receptor associated protein 31 (BAP31) and mitochondrial fission 1 (Fis1), repressed mitochondrial division, thereby inhibiting mtROS overproduction and preventing JNK-induced cardiomyocyte death under hypoxic conditions. These data revealed that a novel death-inducing mechanism involving the BAP31/Fis1/mtROS/JNK axis promotes hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte damage.

A higher rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury and heart failure was observed in the older group as compared with younger and middle-aged groups, particularly those oldest-old patients had more multi-organ damage. Older patients with COVID-19 were more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury in cases with preexistenting cardiovascular diseases, while there was no difference among the three groups when patients had no history of cardiovascular diseases. Older patients presented more severe with the mortality of 18.6%, which was higher than that in younger and middle-aged patients (P < 0.05). Multivariable analysis showed that age, lymphopenia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury, heart failure and skeletal muscle injury were associated with death in older patients, while glucocorticoids might be harmful. CONCLUSIONS: Older patients, especially the oldest-old patients were more likely to exhibit significant systemic inflammation, pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ damage and a higher mortality. Advanced age, lymphopenia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury, heart failure and skeletal muscle injury were independent predictors of death in older patients with COVID-19 and glucocorticoids should be carefully administered in older patients.","output":"Clinical characteristics and manifestations in older patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: HSV-2 infection has increased significantly in recent years, which is closely associated with cervical cancer and HIV infection. The lack of success in vaccine development and the emergence of drug resistance to commonly used drugs emphasize the urgent need for alternative antivirals against HSV-2 infection. Arbidol (ARB) has been demonstrated to be a broad spectrum antiviral drug that exhibits immunomodulatory properties that affect the HSV-2 life cycle. This study investigated the efficacy and mechanism of ARB against HSV-2 in vivo and in vitro to further explore the clinical application of ARB. METHODS: The efficacy of ARB on HSV-2 infection in vitro was examined by CPE and MTT assays. A vaginitis model was established to monitor changes in histopathology and inflammatory cytokine (IL-2, IL-4, TNF- and TGF-) expression by H&E staining and ELISA, respectively, and the efficacy of ARB was evaluated accordingly. Furthermore, flow cytometry was used to determine the ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cells in the peripheral blood of the vaginitis animals. Considering the balance of efficacy and pharmacokinetics, ARB ointment was strictly prepared to observe formulation efficacy differences compared to the oral dosing form. RESULTS: The results showed that, in vitro, the TC(50) and IC(50) of ARB were 32.32 g/mL and 4.77 g/mL (SI = 6.82), respectively, indicating that ARB presents effective activity against HSV-2 in a dose-dependent manner. The results of the time-course assay suggested that 25 g/mL ARB affected the late stage of HSV-2 replication. However, ARB did not inhibit viral attachment or cell penetration. The in vivo results showed that ARB ointment can improve the survival rate, prolong the survival time and reduce the reproductive tract injury in mice infected with HSV-2, regulate cytokine expression; and balance the CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte ratio in the peripheral blood to participate in the regulation of immune response. CONCLUSION: ARB showed anti-HSV-2 activity in vitro in a dose-dependent manner and played a role in inhibiting the late replication cycle of the virus. The vaginitis model was successfully established, according to immunomodulation outcomes, responded better to ARB in ointment form than in oral form.","output":"The antiviral activity of arbidol hydrochloride against herpes simplex virus type II (HSV-2) in a mouse model of vaginitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mosquito coils are commonly burnt in indoor environments to drive away mosquitoes which are vectors for malaria parasites. The levels of carbon monoxide (CO) emitted and human health implications during smoldering of 5 different brands of mosquito coils commonly used in Nigeria were investigated in 4 microenvironments of different sizes. The experiments were done by taking a scenario of a sleeping arrangement and the farthest distance between the coil burning and an arbitrary bed position in 4 different bedrooms of different sizes in poor ventilation condition of closed doors and windows. With monitoring device, ALTAIR 5X portable gas analyzer, at the position of the bed, measurements were taking at 2 minutes interval from start to the end of burning of each coil. The emission profile was determined by making concentration-time plots of CO emission to determine its levels from the burning of each brand of the mosquito coils in each microenvironment. From the emission profile, coils A, C, and D showed that CO levels exceeded Nigeria's Federal Ministry of Environment (FMEnv) and the World Health Organization (WHO) statutory limit of 9.0 ppm for indoor environments in each of the microenvironments between 3 and 7 hours after the burning commenced. It was concluded that the CO concentrations from smoldering mosquito coils is a function of the size of the microenvironment in which it is used.

The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R(0), of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R(0). Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern. The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403C540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18C25) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average. We estimated the R(0) of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49C2.63).

Based on these effects, the present study investigated the protective role of MH in a mouse model of LPS-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The results demonstrated that administration of LPS (5 mg/kg intranasally) markedly increased the neutrophil/macrophage numbers and levels of inflammatory molecules (TNF-, IL-6, IL-1 and reactive oxygen species) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of mice. On histological examination, the presence of inflammatory cells was observed in the lungs of mice administered LPS. LPS also notably upregulated the secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and protein content in BALF as well as expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in the lungs of mice; it also caused activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-B signaling. However, MH treatment significantly suppressed LPS-induced upregulation of inflammatory cell recruitment, inflammatory molecule levels and p38MAPK/NF-B activation, and also led to upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression in the lungs of mice. In addition, the ability of MH to induce HO-1 expression was confirmed in RAW264.7 macrophages. Taken together, the findings of the present study indicated that MH may exert protective effects against airway inflammation in ARDS mice by inhibiting inflammatory cell recruitment and the production of inflammatory molecules.","output":"Methyl p-hydroxycinnamate exerts anti-inflammatory effects in mouse models of lipopolysaccharide-induced ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: A decline in suspected acute stroke (Wcode strokeW) presentations in the United States (US) during the first COVID surge has been previously reported. While state emergency declarations may have contributed to the decline and rebound of weekly code stroke activations in our region, the exact temporal relationship of those declarations relative to weekly code stroke volumes is unclear. Methods: We conducted an interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) to identify the impact of the first reported COVID case in North Carolina (NC) and subsequent statewide executive orders (SEOs) on weekly code stroke activation trends across our regional stroke network's 20 facilities during a 33- week period (December 8, 2019 to July 25, 2020). We included the following time epochs: the first reported COVID case in NC, the NC SEO prohibiting mass gatherings and closing public schools, the stay-at-home NC SEO, and the NC phase 1 and phase 2 reentry orders, which eased restrictions. Results: Utilizing our integrated healthcare network's code stroke registry, we evaluated 3740 code stroke activations over a 33-week period. We performed two ITSA considering different starting points for the first intervention-one defined as the first COVID case and the other the first SEO. For both models the end of the first-time interval ended with the second SEO. Most of the downward trend in code stroke activation volume was temporally after the first COVID case (p=0.0029), not after the first SEO. After the second SEO, which increased social restrictions, there was a significant increased trend in code stroke activation volume (p=0.0047), while the phase 1 and 2 reopening SEOs were not associated with a significant increase in weekly code stroke activations. Conclusion: Our data indicate that in our region, the decreased trend in code stroke activations preceded the first SEO and started temporally after the first reported COVID case in NC. The overall decrease in code stroke volume was not significantly associated with increasing statewide restrictions and lessening of those restrictions was not significantly associated with a rebounding trend.

Modeling such diseases can be extremely valuable in predicting their effects. Although classic statistical modeling may provide adequate models, it may also fail to understand the datas intricacy. An automatic COVID-19 detection system based on computed tomography (CT) scan or X-ray images is effective, but a robust system design is challenging. In this study, we propose an intelligent healthcare system that integrates IoT-cloud technologies. This architecture uses smart connectivity sensors and deep learning (DL) for intelligent decision-making from the perspective of the smart city. The intelligent system tracks the status of patients in real time and delivers reliable, timely, and high-quality healthcare facilities at a low cost. COVID-19 detection experiments are performed using DL to test the viability of the proposed system. We use a sensor for recording, transferring, and tracking healthcare data. CT scan images from patients are sent to the cloud by IoT sensors, where the cognitive module is stored. The system decides the patient status by examining the images of the CT scan. The DL cognitive module makes the real-time decision on the possible course of action. When information is conveyed to a cognitive module, we use a state-of-the-art classification algorithm based on DL, i.e., ResNet50, to detect and classify whether the patients are normal or infected by COVID-19. We validate the proposed systems robustness and effectiveness using two benchmark publicly available datasets (Covid-Chestxray dataset and Chex-Pert dataset). At first, a dataset of 6000 images is prepared from the above two datasets. The proposed system was trained on the collection of images from 80% of the datasets and tested with 20% of the data. Cross-validation is performed using a tenfold cross-validation technique for performance evaluation. The results indicate that the proposed system gives an accuracy of 98.6%, a sensitivity of 97.3%, a specificity of 98.2%, and an F1-score of 97.87%. Results clearly show that the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-score of our proposed method are high. The comparison shows that the proposed system performs better than the existing state-of-the-art systems. The proposed system will be helpful in medical diagnosis research and healthcare systems.

Therefore, we aimed to develop a highly sensitive metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) assay capable of evaluating the pulmonary microbiome and identifying diverse pathogens in the lungs of immunocompromised children. METHODS: We collected 41 lower respiratory specimens from 34 immunocompromised children undergoing evaluation for pulmonary disease at 3 childrens hospitals from 2014C2016. Samples underwent mechanical homogenization, parallel RNA/DNA extraction, and metagenomic sequencing. Sequencing reads were aligned to the National Center for Biotechnology Information nucleotide reference database to determine taxonomic identities. Statistical outliers were determined based on abundance within each sample and relative to other samples in the cohort. RESULTS: We identified a rich cross-domain pulmonary microbiome that contained bacteria, fungi, RNA viruses, and DNA viruses in each patient. Potentially pathogenic bacteria were ubiquitous among samples but could be distinguished as possible causes of disease by parsing for outlier organisms. Samples with bacterial outliers had significantly depressed alpha-diversity (median, 0.61; interquartile range [IQR], 0.33C0.72 vs median, 0.96; IQR, 0.94C0.96; P < .001). Potential pathogens were detected in half of samples previously negative by clinical diagnostics, demonstrating increased sensitivity for missed pulmonary pathogens (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: An optimized mNGS assay for pulmonary microbes demonstrates significant inoculation of the lower airways of immunocompromised children with diverse bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

Many biomarkers have been suggested using large observational datasets but sample timing is crucial to ensure prognostic relevance. The DISCOVER study prospectively recruited patients with COVID-19 admitted to a UK hospital and analysed a panel of putative prognostic biomarkers on the admission blood sample to identify markers of poor outcome. Methods: Consecutive patients admitted to hospital with proven or clinicoradiological suspected COVID-19 were recruited. Admission bloods were extracted from the clinical laboratory. A panel of biomarkers (IL-6, suPAR, KL-6, Troponin, Ferritin, LDH, BNP, Procalcitonin) were performed in addition to routinely performed markers (CRP, neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio). Age, NEWS score and CURB-65 were included as comparators. All biomarkers were tested in logistic regression against a composite outcome of non-invasive ventilation, intensive care admission, or death, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) figures calculated. Results: 155 patients had 28-day outcomes at the time of analysis. CRP (AUC 0.51 ,CI:0.40-0.62), lymphocyte count (AUC 0.62 ,CI:0.51-0.72), and other routine markers did not predict the primary outcome. IL-6 (AUC: 0.78,0.65-0.89) and suPAR (AUC 0.77 ,CI: 0.66-0.85) showed some promise, but simple clinical features alone such as NEWS score (AUC: 0.74 ,0.64-0.83) or age (AUC: 0.70 ,0.61-0.78) performed nearly as well. Discussion: Admission blood biomarkers have only moderate predictive value for predicting COVID-19 outcomes, while simple clinical features such as age and NEWS score outperform many biomarkers. IL-6 and suPAR had the best performance, and further studies should validate these biomarkers in a prospective fashion.","output":"Blood parameters measured on admission as predictors of outcome for COVID-19; a prospective UK cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The molecular composition and binding epitopes of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that circulate in blood plasma following SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown.

Based on the critical role of None Structural Proteins (NSP), NSP3, NSP4, and NSP6 in COVID-19, this study attempts to investigate the superior natural selection mutations and Epistasis among these none structural proteins. Methods: Approximately 6.5 million SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences of each NSP3, NSP4, and NSP6 nonstructural protein were analyzed from January 2020 to January 2022. Python programming language was utilized to preprocess and apply inclusion criteria on the FASTA file to prepare a list of suitable samples. NSP3, NSP4, and NSP6 were aligned to the reference sequence to compare and identify mutation patterns categorized based on frequency, geographical zone distribution, and date. To discover epistasis situations, linear regression between mutation frequency and date among candidate genes was performed to determine correlations. Results: The rate of NSP3, NSP4, and NSP6 mutations in divided geographical areas was different. Based on continental studies, P1228L (54.48%), P1469S (54.41%), and A488S (53.86%) mutations in NSP3, T492I (54.84%), and V167L (52.81%) in NSP4 and T77A (69.85%) mutation in NSP6 increased over time, especially in recent months. For NSP3, Europe had the highest P1228L, P1469S, and A488S mutations. For NSP4, Oceania had the highest T492I and V167L mutations, and for NSP6, Europe had the highest T77A mutation. Hot spot regions for NSP3, NSP4, and NSP6 were 1358 to 1552 AA, 150 to 200 AA, and 58 to 87 AA, respectively. Our results showed a significant correlation and co-occurrence between NSP3, NSP4, and NSP6 mutations. Conclusion: We conclude that the effect of mutations on virus stability and replication can be predicted by examining the amino acid changes of P1228L, P1469S, A488S, T492I, V167L and T77A mutations. Also, these mutations can possibly be effective on the function of proteins and their targets in the host cell.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May-August 2020 among diagnosed patients of chronic diseases residing in a COVID-19 hotspot of urban Jodhpur, Rajasthan, and availing health services from primary care facility. Telephonic interviews of participants were conducted to determine their health literacy using HLS-EU-Q47 questionnaire, adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviour as per World Health Organization recommendations, and compliance to prescribed pharmacological and physical activity recommendations for chronic disease. RESULTS: All the 605 diagnosed patients of chronic diseases availing services from primary care facility were contacted for the study, yielding response rate of 68% with 412 agreeing to participate. Insufficient health literacy was observed for 65.8% participants. Only about half of participants had scored above median for COVID-19 awareness (55.1%) and preventive behavior (45.1%).

Methods : This is a retrospective, multicentre study where data of all RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients was accessed from Electronic Health Records (EHR) of a network of 10 hospitals across 5 North Indian states, admitted during the period from March 2020 to July 2021. Results : Of 19852 RT-PCR positive SARS-CO2 patients admitted during the study period, 1940 (9.8%) patients developed SIs. Patients with SIs were 8 years older on average (median age 62.6 years versus 54.3 years; P<0.001) than those without SIs. The risk of SIs was significantly (p < 0.001) associated with age, severity of disease at admission, diabetes, ICU admission, and ventilator use. The most common site of infection was urinary tract infection (UTI) (41.7%), followed by blood stream infection (BSI) (30.8%), sputum/BAL/ET fluid (24.8%), and the least was pus/wound discharge (2.6%). Gram negative bacilli (GNB) were the commonest organisms (63.2%), followed by Gram positive cocci (GPC) (19.6%) and fungus (17.3%). Most of the patients with SIs were on multiple antimicrobials C the most used were the BL-BLI for GNBs (76.9%) followed by carbapenems (57.7%), cephalosporins (53.9%) and antibiotics carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (47.1%). The usage of empirical antibiotics for GPCs was in 58.9% and of antifungals in 56.9% of cases, and substantially more than the results obtained by culture. The average stay in hospital for patients with SIs was almost twice than those without SIs (median 13 days versus 7 days). The overall mortality in the group with SIs (40.3%) was more than 8 times of that in those without SIs (4.6%). Only 1.2% of SI patients with mild COVID-19 at presentation died, while 17.5% of those with moderate disease and 58.5% of those with severe COVID-19 died (P< 0.001). The mortality was the highest in those with BSI (49.8%), closely followed by those with HAP (47.9%), and then UTI and SSTI (29.4% each). The mortality in diabetic patients with SIs was 45.2% while in non-diabetics it was 34.3% (p < 0.001). Conclusions : Secondary bacterial and fungal infections complicate the course of COVID-19 hospitalised patients. These patients tend to have a much longer stay in hospital, higher requirement for oxygen and ICU care, and significantly high mortality. The group most vulnerable to this complication are those with more severe COVID-19 illness, elderly, and diabetic patients.

In this work, ruthenium oxide modified boron-doped hierarchically porous reduced graphene aerogels (RuO2-B-HRG) are prepared by a sol-gel and subsequent low temperature annealing method and used as oxygen electrodes. The RuO2 nanoparticles (5-10 nm) are uniformly anchored in the three-dimensional B-HRG continuous electric network. The RuO2-B-HRG aerogel possesses a large specific surface area (287.211 m2 g-1) and numerous mesopores and micropores. The pores facilitate electrolyte impregnation and oxygen diffusion, and they provide greatly increased accommodation space for the discharge products. Electrochemical tests show that the RuO2-B-HRG/KB enables the electrode overpotential to decrease, and the rate capability and the cycling stability are enhanced compared with pure HRG. The enhanced performance is ascribed to the bifunctional catalytic activity of RuO2-B-HRG and its unique three-dimensional porous architecture. The method is proved to be an effective strategy to combine porous carbon materials and nanoscale catalysts as electrodes for Li-O2 batteries.","output":"Ruthenium oxide modified hierarchically porous boron-doped graphene aerogels as oxygen electrodes for lithium-oxygen batteries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study was carried out in six degraded areas of Brachiaria at the Nova Alta Paulista Region, west of S?o Paulo State, with the objective of evaluate the pastures at different periods of the year.

Data were collected from a convenience sample of Black medical students via an anonymous electronic questionnaire (n = 733) in year 2020. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Depression and Anxiety forms were used to measure depression and anxiety symptoms. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the association between discrimination, peer connectedness, and mental health symptoms (Mplus 7.3). The majority of the participants were female (80%), approximately 40% were third or fourth year medical school students, and 13% had a clinical diagnosis of depression/anxiety before medical school. About half of the students reported being watched more closely than their classmates, and 66% reported feeling the need to work twice as hard as others to get the same treatment or evaluation. The majority of students reported that their peers were supportive of their academic success (60.7%), and 53% reported that students often or always invited them to social outings. The mean T-score for depressive symptoms was 53.6 (SD = 7.8), and the mean T-score for anxiety symptoms was 58.6 (SD = 8.4). Overall, findings indicated a high prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among Black medical students, and increased discrimination was associated with more mental health symptoms among males. Additionally, increased peer connectedness was associated with fewer symptoms of anxiety among males and females and fewer depressive symptoms among females. Addressing discrimination among medical students may improve mental health among Black medical students.

METHODS: A cross-sectional, online survey was distributed to parents of youth with type 1 diabetes 19 years of age in a large, academic diabetes center. Questions encompassed perceived changes in management behaviors and plans for return to school. Subgroup analysis compared parent responses by child's age, reported stressors, and socioeconomic markers. RESULTS: Parents reported a worsening in their child's diabetes health behaviors during school closures compared to what they perceived during a regular school day before the pandemic. More than half of parents reported feeling that their child was unable to maintain a normal routine, with particular implications for snacking between meals, daily physical activity, and sleep habits. Families with adolescents or those experiencing multiple pandemic-related stressors reported greater challenges. In open-ended responses, families highlighted difficulty in balancing school, work, and diabetes care and expressed concerns about the mental health repercussions of school closures for their children. Nearly half of parents reported being at least moderately worried about return to school, whereas only a minority reported seeking guidance from their diabetes provider. CONCLUSIONS: Parent-reported disruptions of school-day routines frequently had adverse consequences for diabetes management in this population. These findings highlight the importance of a school-day routine for children with type 1 diabetes; during closures, families may benefit from mitigating strategies to maintain effective habits.","output":"Implications of the School Day on Health Behaviors for Children With Type 1 Diabetes: A Survey of Parent Perspectives During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We introduce a minimalist outbreak forecasting model that combines data-driven parameter estimation with variational data assimilation By focusing on the fundamental components of nonlinear disease transmission and representing data in a domain where model stochasticity simplifies into a process with independent increments, we design an approach that only requires four parameters to be estimated We illustrate this novel methodology on COVID-19 forecasts Results include case count and deaths predictions for the US and all of its 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico The method is computationally efficient and is not disease- or location-specific It may therefore be applied to other outbreaks or other countries, provided case counts and/or deaths data are available","output":"EpiCovDA: a mechanistic COVID-19 forecasting model with data assimilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 juvenile dermatomyositis (anti-MDA5 JDM) is associated with high risk of developing rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD).

However, little is known about the experiences of municipal health-care professionals using welfare technology in palliative home care. The aim of this study was to explore municipal health-care professionals experiences regarding the significant challenges, facilitators, and assessments associated with implementing a technological solution named remote home care in palliative home care for patients with cancer. METHODS: A qualitative, descriptive, exploratory design was used. Data were collected through focus-group interviews and individual semi-structured interviews with interdisciplinary health-care professionals who had experience using remote home care in clinical encounters with cancer patients who were in the palliative phase and living at home. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: 1) shifting from objective measures to assessing priorities for patients, 2) lack of experience and personal distress regarding cancer inhibits professional care, and 3) prominent organizational challenges undermine the premise of remote home care. CONCLUSION: The results showed that shifting from a disease-focused to a person-centered approach enables health-care professionals to assess patients personal priorities. However, health-care professionals uncertainty and lack of knowledge and experience, along with organizational issues concerning information-sharing, represent great challenges that have the potential to inhibit professional care.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene IFITM3 have been associated with susceptibility and severity of influenza or other viral infections. We aimed to analyze the role of SNPs in the gene IFITM3 in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We performed genotyping of the SNPs rs12252 and rs34481144 in the gene IFITM3 in 239 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 253 SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. We analyzed the association of the SNPs with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients did not differ regarding demographics. Neither IFITM3 rs12252 nor rs34481144 polymorphisms were related to SARS-CoV-2 infection risk or severity of COVID-19. Interestingly, we observed the putative deleterious rs12252 CC genotype only in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (N = 2). Also, we found a non-significant higher frequency of rs34481144 A-allele carriers in the patients with 'serious' COVID-19.

Young children (aged <5 years) seem to be less affected by this coronavirus disease (COVID-19) compared to adults, although there is very little information on the circulation of this new virus among children in Italy. We retrospectively tested nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 in samples collected in young children between November, 2019 and March, 2020 in the context of the RSV ComNet study. Methods: Two networks of primary care pediatricians in Lazio (Central Italy) and Puglia (Southern Italy) collected nasopharyngeal swabs from children, aged <5 years, presenting with symptoms for an acute respiratory infection (ARI). The RSV ComNet study is a multicenter study implemented to estimate the burden of RSV in young children (aged <5 years) in the community. Swabs were sent to a central reference laboratory and tested for 14 respiratory viruses through RT-PCR. All collected samples were retrospectively tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR (Istituto Superiore di Sanit protocol). Results: A total of 293 children with ARI were identified in the two participating networks. The highest number of cases were recruited in weeks 51/2019 and 3/2020. The majority of patients (57%) came from the Lazio region. All of the 293 samples tested negative for SARS-Cov2. Rhinovirus was the most frequently detected virus (44%), followed by RSV (41%) and influenza viruses (14%). Conclusions: Our study shows that in Lazio (a region of intermediate SARS-COV-2 incidence) and Puglia (a region of low incidence), the SARS-Cov2 virus did not circulate in a sample of ARI pediatric cases consulting primary care pediatricians between November 2019 and March 2020.","output":"Sars-Cov2 Not Detected in a Pediatric Population With Acute Respiratory Infection in Primary Care in Central and Southern Italy From November 2019 to Early March 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has turned into a pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of COVID-19 among youth soccer athletes and the risk mitigation practices utilized by youth soccer organizations. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. PARTICIPANTS: Youth soccer club directors throughout the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surveys were completed in late August 2020 regarding phase of return to soccer (individual only, group non-contact, group contact), date of reinitiation, number of players, cases of COVID-19, and risk reduction procedures being implemented. Case and incidence rates were compared to national pediatric data and county data from the prior 10 weeks. A negative binomial regression model was developed to predict club COVID-19 cases with local incidence rate and phase of return as covariates and the log of club player-days as an offset. RESULTS: 124 respondents had reinitiated soccer, representing 91,007 players with a median duration of 73 days (IQR: 53-83 days) since restarting. Of the 119 that had progressed to group activities, 218 cases of COVID-19 were reported among 85,861 players. Youth soccer players had a lower case rate and incidence rate than children in the US (254 v. 477 cases per 100,000; incidence rate ratio [IRR]=0.511, 95% CI = [0.40-0.57], p<0.001) and the general population from the counties where data was available (268 v. 864 cases per 100,000; IRR=0.202 [0.19-0.21], p<0.001).

As a huge source and destination of health tourism, little is understood about the volume, characteristics, motivations, and preferences of health travelers in China. This study provides details of Chinas health tourism reality and consumer demand of Chinese residents who did or will travel for health. METHODS: We established a questionnaire through literature analysis and a focus group, then collected 695 responses based on an online random sampling design. Finally, 629 questionnaires (effective recovery rate was 90%) were analyzed with statistical description, binary logistic regression, and word frequency analysis to draw the reality of health tourism, explore the influential factors, and sort out suggestions. RESULTS: In this study, 387 respondents knew of health tourism (61.53%), 446 reported interest (70.9%), and 234 had traveled for health reasons before (37.2%), with 329 occurring within China (91.4%). The top three reasons for health tourism were decompression and relaxation (116, 20%), physical examination (82, 14.1%), and health care (73, 12.6%). High costs (372, 16.3%), little disposable time (309, 13.5%), and lack of reliable professional institutions (289, 12.6%) were the main potential barriers for consumers. Professional level and quality of the institution, personal privacy, and service personnels attitude were the most important concerns for consumers when arranging health travel.

Modelling approaches can sometimes fail to predict disease spread, which may partly be due to the number of unknown sources of variation in host behaviour. The European badger is a wildlife reservoir for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Britain and Ireland, and individual behaviour has been demonstrated to be an important factor in the spread of bTB among badgers and to cattle. Radio-telemetry devices were deployed on 40 badgers from eight groups to investigate patterns of den (sett) use in a high-density population, where each group had one or two main and three to eight outlier setts in their territory. Badgers were located at their setts for 28 days per season for 1 year to investigate how patterns differed between individuals. Denning behaviour may have a strong influence on contact patterns and the transmission of disease. We found significant heterogeneity, influenced by season, sex and age. Also, when controlling for these, bTB infection status interacting with season was highly correlated with sett use. Test-positive badgers spent more time away from their main sett than those that tested negative. We speculate that wider-ranging behaviour of test-positive animals may result in them contacting sources of infection more frequently and/or that their behaviour may be influenced by their disease status. Measures to control infectious diseases might be improved by targeting functional groups, specific areas or times of year that may contribute disproportionately to disease spread.

RECENT FINDINGS: Most HF readmissions may be prevented if clinical parameters are strictly controlled via telemedical monitoring. Predictive algorithms for patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (e.g., Triage-HF Plus by Medtronic or HeartLogic by Boston Scientific) were developed to identify patients at significantly increased risk of HF events. However, randomized control trial-based data are heterogeneous regarding the advantages of telemedical monitoring in HF patients. The likelihood of adverse clinical outcomes increases when pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) rises, usually days to weeks before clinical manifestations of HF. A wireless monitoring system (CardioMEMS?) detecting changes in PAP was proposed for HF patients. CardioMEMS? transmits data to the healthcare provider and allows to institute timely intensification of HF therapies. CardioMEMS?-guided pharmacotherapy reduced a risk of HF-related hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.72; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60C0C0.85; p < 0.01).

The study also explored the effects of urban vibrancy on the urban eco-environment by interpreting PM 2.5 and land surface temperature using big and dynamic data, such as those from mobile and social network data. Thereafter, spatial modelling was performed to investigate the influence of urban vibrancy on air pollution and temperature with inverted and extracted remote sensing data. This process identified spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation. The majority of the dimensions, such as density, accessibility, liveability, and diversity, are negatively correlated with PM 2.5, thereby indicating that the advancement of urban vibrancy in these dimensions potentially improves air quality. Conversely, improved accessibility increases the surface temperature in most of the districts, and large-scale infrastructure construction generally contributes to the increase. Diversity and human activity appear to have a cooling effect.

Currently there are no drugs to treat RV infections. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is an FDA-approved drug for parasitic infections, and has been recently shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activities. Here we found that empiric 2-month therapy with oral NTZ was associated in the decline/elimination of RV antigen from lesions in a PID patient with RV positive granulomas, while peginterferon treatment had no effect. In addition, we characterized the effects of NTZ on cell culture models of persistent RV infection. NTZ significantly inhibited RV replication in a primary culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and Vero and A549 epithelial cell lines in a dose dependent manner with an average 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.35 g/ml (1.1 M). RV strains representing currently circulating genotypes were inhibited to a similar extent.

All hospital patients are at risk of nosocomial viral infections, but vulnerable groups such as older adults, children and immuno-compromised/-suppressed patients are at particular risk of severe outcomes including prolonged hospitalization or death. These pathogens could transmit through direct or indirect physical contact, droplets or aerosols, with increasing evidence suggesting the importance of aerosol transmission in nosocomial infections of respiratory and enteric viruses. Factors affecting the propensity to transmit and the severity of disease transmitted via the aerosol route include the biological characteristics affecting infectivity of the viruses and susceptibility of the host, the physical properties of aerosol particles, and the environmental stresses that alter these properties such as temperature and humidity. Non-specific systematic and individual-based interventions designed to mitigate the aerosol route are available although empirical evidence of their effectiveness in controlling transmission of respiratory and enteric viruses in healthcare settings are sparse. The relative importance of aerosol transmission in healthcare setting is still an on-going debate, with particular challenge being the recovery of infectious viral bioaerosols from real-life settings and the difficulty in delineating transmission events that may also be a result of other modes of transmission. For the prevention and control of nosocomial infections via the aerosol route, more research is needed on identifying settings, medical procedures or equipment that may be associated with an increased risk of aerosol transmission, including defining which procedures are aerosol-generating; and on the effectiveness of systematic interventions on aerosol transmission of respiratory and enteric viruses in healthcare settings.","output":"Role of viral bioaerosols in nosocomial infections and measures for prevention and control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article focuses on the life-threatening genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF) and how managing the condition could be challenging in time of the coronavirus pandemic Topics covered include the range of treatments for CF, how screening for CF is conducted, and ongoing research and further advances in CF treatment","output":"Clear Way Forward"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Morality plays an important role in social well-being, but people's moral perception is not stable and changes over time.

In the case of Yunani medicine, its pre-Islamic origins are identified together with the impact of anti-colonialism and the potential role of clerics in wishing to distance medical care from Galenic concepts. In the case of Hijama, the absence of effective training and regulation and its promotion as a \\"lost sunna\\" are discussed alongside claims for miraculous cures. The movement of Ruqyah away from Qur'anic recitation in support of the sick towards a popularised approach to dealing with magic and possession is considered, together with consequential adverse publicity in the media. The consequences of a failure to adopt training practices for Yunani medicine, as recommended by the WHO, are identified.

OBJECTIVE To determine if child maltreatment reporting and substantiation differ between periods when schools are routinely closed compared to in session. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING Child maltreatment reporting and substantiation among all U.S. States and the District of Columbia from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2017. METHODS Two-week intervals during periods of routine school closure (early January, June through mid-August, late November, and late December) were compared to all other 2-week intervals. Negative binomial generalized estimating equations compared rates of reporting and substantiation, resulting in incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS Compared to when school was in session, reporting was 16.0% (IRR 0.84 [95% CI: 0.83, 0.85]) lower during school closures and substantiations were 12.3% (IRR 0.88 [95% CI: 0.86, 0.89]) lower. The largest reductions in reporting were observed among education personnel (-42.1%; IRR 0.58 [95% CI: 0.54, 0.62]), children aged 5-17 years (-18.6%; IRR 0.81 [95% CI: 0.80, 0.83), and for physical abuse (-19.6%; IRR 0.80 [95% CI: 0.79, 0.82]). Reductions during closure periods were not matched by increases during two-week intervals immediately following closure periods. CONCLUSIONS Results suggest that the detection of child maltreatment may be diminished during periods of routine school closure. Findings may inform prevention planning and risk-benefit analyses for future school closures. Further study should disentangle the issue of decreased detection versus decreased prevalence of maltreatment during school closures.","output":"Association of routine school closures with child maltreatment reporting and substantiation in the United States; 2010-2017."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, objective physical tests and subjective questionnaire surveys were used to study an office building in Beijing during the operation of the fresh air system in the summer before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The aim of this study was to identify stressors and burnout among frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan and Shanghai and to explore perceived effective morale support strategies. Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in March 2020 among 110 nurses from Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai, who were deployed at COVID-19 units in Wuhan and Shanghai. A COVID-19 questionnaire was adapted from the previous developed psychological impacts of SARS questionnaire and included stressors (31 items), coping strategies (17 items), and effective support measures (16 items). Burnout was measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results: Totally, 107 (97%) nurses responded. Participants mean age was 30.28 years and 90.7% were females. Homesickness was most frequently reported as a stressor (96.3%). Seven of the 17 items related to coping strategies were undertaken by all participants. Burnout was observed in the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization subscales, with 78.5 and 92.5% of participants presenting mild levels of burnout, respectively. However, 52 (48.6%) participants experienced a severe lack of personal accomplishment. Participants with longer working hours in COVID-19 quarantine units presented higher emotional exhaustion (OR = 2.72, 95% CI 0.02C5.42; p = 0.049) and depersonalization (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.10C2.19; p = 0.033).

Among these are the simplicity of administration, the capacity to induce mucosal and systemic immunity, and the advantage of permitting genetic manipulation for optimal antigen presentation. In this study, the benefit of having a heterologous antigen expressed on the surface of a live vector rather than intracellularly was evaluated. Accordingly, the immune response of mice immunized with a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strain expressing the Escherichia coli 987P fimbrial antigen on its surface (Fas(+)) was compared with the expression in the periplasmic compartment (Fas(-)). Orally immunized BALB/c mice showed that 987P fimbriated Salmonella serovar Typhimurium CS3263 (aroA asd) with pCS151 (fas(+) asd(+)) elicited a significantly higher level of 987P-specific systemic immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA than serovar Typhimurium CS3263 with pCS152 (fasD mutant, asd(+)) expressing 987P periplasmic antigen. Further studies were aimed at determining whether the 987P fimbriae expressed by serovar Typhimurium chi4550 (cya crp asd) could be used as carriers of foreign epitopes. For this, the vaccine strain was genetically engineered to express chimeric fimbriae carrying the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) C (379-388) and A (521-531) epitopes of the spike protein inserted into the 987P major fimbrial subunit FasA. BALB/c mice administered orally serovar Typhimurium chi4550 expressing the chimeric fimbriae from the tet promoter in pCS154 (fas(+) asd(+)) produced systemic antibodies against both fimbria and the TGEV C epitope but not against the TGEV A epitope. To improve the immunogenicity of the chimeric fimbriae, the in vivo inducible nirB promoter was inserted into pCS154, upstream of the fas genes, to create pCS155. In comparison with the previously used vaccine, BALB/c mice immunized orally with serovar Typhimurium chi4550/pCS155 demonstrated significantly higher levels of serum IgG and mucosal IgA against 987P fimbria. Moreover, mucosal IgA against the TGEV C epitope was only detected with serovar Typhimurium chi4550/pCS155. The induced antibodies also recognized the epitopes in the context of the full-length TGEV spike protein. Hence, immune responses to heterologous chimeric fimbriae on Salmonella vaccine vectors can be optimized by using promoters known to be activated in vivo.","output":"Mucosal and systemic immune responses to chimeric fimbriae expressed by Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine strains."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for 6 months with maternal active antiretroviral therapy (ART) to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. However, EBF in low resource settings remains low. We explored perspectives of EBF by HIV-infected mothers and health care workers in Busia County with a high prevalence of HIV to understand factors influencing the practice. METHODS: A mixed methods cross-sectional survey using concurrent quantitative and qualitative data collection methods was conducted at PMTCT clinics. Data on socio-demography, young infant feeding practices, maternal and infant health was collected between February 2013 and August 2015 from 371 purposively sampled HIV-infected mother-infant dyads using a semi-structured questionnaire. Focus group discussions with mothers, in-depth interviews and passive observation of health care workers during interaction with mothers were conducted. Significance of difference between mothers practicing EBF or not was tested by Chi-square and Fishers exact tests setting significance level at 5%. Qualitative data was coded and content analyzed to generate themes. RESULTS: Three hundred and forty-nine (94%) mothers practiced EBF. Maternal comprehension of EBF to PMTCT of HIV influenced choice and practice of EBF (P value = 0.019 and < 0.001 respectively). Health care workers emphasized adherence to ART and offered nutritional supplementation during EBF. Health care workers nutritional counseling in the context of maternal HIV was poor. Mentor mothers shared their experiences with mothers and offered live case demonstrations of their successfully EBF, healthy and HIV-uninfected children. The main threats to EBF were teenage motherhood, low maternal education and working during EBF. CONCLUSIONS: EBF among HIV-infected mothers in Busia County, Kenya was high. Health education and counselling by health care workers, maternal comprehension of ART adherence to PMTCT of HIV, nutritional supplementation and mentor mothers peer counseling using live case demonstrations of HIV-uninfected EBF children promoted and sustained practice of EBF for 6 months.

Particularly, this should be achieved by providing more or less automated decision recommendations to the treating physician. However, some hopes placed in ML for healthcare seem to be disappointed, at least in part, by a lack of transparency or traceability. Skepticism exists primarily in the fact that the physician, as the person responsible for diagnosis, therapy, and care, has no or insufficient insight into how such recommendations are reached. The following paper aims to make understandable the specificity of the deliberative model of a physician-patient relationship that has been achieved over decades. By outlining the (social-)epistemic and inherently normative relationship between physicians and patients, I want to show how this relationship might be altered by non-traceable ML recommendations.

In this meta-analysis, we collected studies from PubMed, Wed of Science and CNKI (Chinese) to July 25, which reported COVID-19 patients with and without cardio-cerebrovascular disease as well as their severity and mortality. The random-effect model meta-analysis was used to analyze them and get overall odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs. Funnel plots and the Beggs and Eggers test were used to assess publication bias. Thirty-one studies with 23,632 patients were finally included in the meta-analysis. The results showed an OR of 3.004 (95% CI = 2.097C4.303) for COVID-19 severity and an OR of 5.587 (95% CI = 2.810C11.112) for COVID-19 mortality.

DESIGN: Quantitative analysis of resident-level assessment data. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Long-stay residents living in Connecticut nursing homes. METHODS: We used Minimum Data Set assessments to measure nursing home resident outcomes observed in each week between March and July 2020 for long-stay residents (eg, those in the nursing home for at least 100 days) who lived in a nursing home at the beginning of the pandemic. We compared outcomes to those observed at the beginning of the pandemic, controlling for both resident characteristics and patterns for outcomes observed in 2017-2019. RESULTS: We found that nursing home resident outcomes worsened on a broad array of measures. The prevalence of depressive symptoms increased by 6 percentage points relative to before the pandemic in the beginning of March-representing a 15% increase. The share of residents with unplanned substantial weight loss also increased by 6 percentage points relative to the beginning of March-representing a 150% increase. We also found significant increases in episodes of incontinence (4 percentage points) and significant reductions in cognitive functioning. Our findings suggest that loneliness and isolation play an important role. Though unplanned substantial weight loss was greatest for those who contracted COVID-19 (about 10% of residents observed in each week), residents who did not contract COVID-19 also physically deteriorated (about 7.5% of residents in each week). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These analyses show that the pandemic had substantial impacts on nursing home residents beyond what can be quantified by cases and deaths, adversely affecting the physical and emotional well-being of residents.

Since the 1980s, carrageenan has been shown to prevent infections due to several viruses in cell cultures, including rhinoviruses which cause the common cold. In animal studies it prevented mortality caused by influenza A. Carrageenan is generally regarded as safe by the FDA. This individual patient data meta-analysis examined the datasets of two randomized placebo-controlled trials which investigated the effect of carrageenan separately on children and adults. In both trials, iota-carrageenan was administered nasally 3 times per day for 7 days for patients with the common cold and follow-up lasted for 21 days. Nasal carrageenan increased the recovery rate from all colds by 54% (95% CI 15% to 105%;P = 0.003). The increase in recovery rate was 140% in coronavirus infections, 119% in influenza A infections, and 70% in rhinovirus infections. We used quantile regression to calculate the effect of carrageenan on colds of differing lengths, by dividing the distribution into 5 quintiles. The mean duration of colds in the placebo groups of the first four quintiles were 4.0, 6.8, 8.8 and 13.7 days, respectively. The fifth quintile contained patients with censored data. The 13.7-day colds were shortened by 3.8 days (28% reduction), and 8.8-day colds by 1.3 days (15% reduction). Carrageenan had no meaningful effect on shorter colds. In the placebo group, 21 patients had colds that lasted over 20 days, compared with 6 patients in the carrageenan group. This corresponds to a 71% (P = 0.003) reduction in the risk of longer colds. Finally, in the placebo group, 37 patients had recurring cold symptoms after first being cured, compared with 16 in the carrageenan group. This corresponds to a 56% (P = 0.002) reduction in the risk of recurring symptoms. Given that carrageenan has an effect on diverse virus groups, and its demonstrated effects on two old coronaviruses, it seems plausible that nasal carrageenan may also have an effect on the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

RESULTS: A 15% sustained catch-up rate outside stay-at-home orders (compared to what would be expected via natality information) is necessary to achieve projected vaccination coverage similar to previous years. Permanent decreases in vaccine administration could lead to projected vaccination coverage levels below 80%.

Comorbidity with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is highly prevalent. Pharmacological treatment for ADHD symptoms has been shown to be effective. However, the prevailing perception is that children with ADHD and concomitant ASD symptoms report poorer efficacy and more side effects. This has been supported by studies on this population, but prospective studies directly comparing children with ADHD and different levels of ASD symptoms are lacking. We aimed to assess if children with ADHD and concomitant ASD symptoms differ regarding effects and side-effects of pharmacological ADHD treatment compared to children with ADHD without ASD traits. This is to our knowledge the second study to directly compare the effect of ADHD medication between ADHD patients with different levels of ASD symptoms. METHODS: In a non-randomized, observational, prospective cohort study, 323 patients aged 6 to 17 years who were diagnosed with ADHD and starting pharmacological treatment were divided into two groups: one with high level of ASD symptoms (ASD group, N=71) and one with low level of ASD symptoms (non-ASD group, N = 252). Treatment outcome was measured as ADHD symptoms, and evaluated using the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Teacher and Parent ADHD rating scale-version IV (SNAP-IV). Side-effects were evaluated using the Pediatric Side Effects Checklist (P-SEC), at 3 months follow-up. RESULTS: From baseline to 3 months, there was no significant difference in neither treatment effect nor number of clinically significant adverse events experienced between the ASD group and the non-ASD group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results did not implicate that ADHD patients with concomitant ASD symptoms have decreased treatment effect of ADHD medication than patients with ADHD without concomitant ASD symptoms. Neither did the results support that ADHD patients with ASD symptoms experienced significantly more side-effects than ADHD patients without ASD symptoms. Although, we did not analyze different medications separately, this is in line with the only previous study directly comparing methylphenidate treatment in children with or without ASD.

In addition, for companies of this size, auditing the entire \\"universe\\" of individual entities on an annual basis is generally prohibitive due to sheer volume. A risk assessment approach that enables efficient, temporal, and targeted PV audits is not currently available. METHODS: In this project, we developed a statistical model to enable holistic and efficient risk assessment of certain aspects of the PV system. We used findings from a curated data set from Roche operational and quality assurance PV data, covering a span of over 8 years (2011-2019) and we modeled the risk with a logistic regression on quality PV risk indicators defined as data stream statistics over sliding windows. RESULTS: We produced a model for each PV impact factor (e.g. 'Compliance to Individual Case Safety Report') for which we had enough features. For PV impact factors where modeling was not feasible, we used descriptive statistics. All the outputs were consolidated and displayed in a QA dashboard built on Spotfire?.

Currently, one of the promising antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 is remdesivir. For a final decision on the inclusion of this drug in the international recommendations for the treatment of COVID-19, further studies are needed to evaluate its effectiveness and safety in patients with COVID-19. The aim of the study is to study the clinical efficacy of remdesivir in the comprehensive therapy of patients with moderate severity of COVID-19. Materials and methods of research. In the study data was analyzed from 80 medical records of an inpatient patient with a moderate form of COVID-19. The work was carried out in accordance with the task of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Kazakhstan as part of a clinical study which is an open retrospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of remdesivir in the comprehensive treatment of patients with COVID-19. The experimental group (the main group) consisted of 40 patients with a moderate form of COVID-19 were prescribed remdesivir at a dose of 200 mg IV on 1st day, then 100 mg IV daily, for a total of 5-7 days in addition to standard therapy. The comparison group (control group) consisted of 40 patients who received pathogenetic and symptomatic therapy without remdesivir in accordance with the clinical protocol. Statistical processing of the obtained data was carried out by methods of descriptive statistics, using a comparative analysis by the T-test Student method, frequency analysis, Chi-square calculations with the IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 and Jamovi programs. Results and discussion. The study showed that an early start of antiviral therapy with Remdesivir compared to standard therapy without an antiviral drug in patients with a moderate form of COVID-19 is associated with a statistically significant clinical improvement and a large percentage of virus elimination from the upper respiratory tract proved by molecular genetic study. In the group of patients receiving remdesivir, complete remission of the disease with normalization of body temperature and no complaints for 7 days of hospitalization was significantly more often than in the comparison group. Antiviral therapy with the remdesivir was prescribed to patients with concomitant pathology (diabetes mellitus, obesity, arterial hypertension), which is a risk factor for a severe, unfavorable course of the disease. There were no cases of deterioration of the patient's condition due to the progression of the infectious process during the use of remdesivir. Whereas in the control group, 10% of patients had progression of the disease with the development of complications. All these patients had risk factors for the development of severe COVID-19. Conclusion. The results obtained showed that the remdesivir is an effective antiviral drug in the comprehensive treatment of COVID-19 coronavirus infection of moderate severity. Early administration of the drug in patients with a moderate form of the disease can prevent the progression of the disease to a more severe condition and the development of complications that require additional medical interventions. This drug can be used in patients with concomitant pathologies that are risk factors for a severe, unfavorable course of coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Clinical efficacy of the antiviral drug remdesivir in the comprehensive treatment of patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study reports on the prevalence and risk factors of chronic HBV among health care workers (HCWs) in a rural secondary hospital in Sierra Leone.

The exponential community spread of disease limited the time for development and training. METHODS: The goals of our workflow and process development were to maximize safety for staff and patients, minimize the risk of contamination, and reduce the waste of unused supplies and materials. We used a cyclical improvement system and the plus/delta debriefing method to rapidly develop workflows consisting of sequential checklists and procedure-specific packs. RESULTS: We designed independent workflows for labor analgesia, neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery, conversion of labor analgesia to cesarean anesthesia, and general anesthesia. In addition, we created procedure-specific material packs to optimize supplies and prevent wastage. Finally, we generated sequential checklists to allow staff to perform standard operating procedures without extensive training. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these workflows and tools allowed our staff to urgently care for patients in high-risk situations without prior experience. Over time, we refined the workflows using a cyclical improvement system. We present our checklists and workflows as well as the system we used for their development, so that others may use them to their benefit.","output":"Adaptation of an Obstetric Anesthesia Service for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Pandemic: Description of Checklists, Workflows, and Development Tools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Positive-strand RNA viruses have been the etiological agents in several major disease outbreaks over the last few decades. Examples of this include flaviviruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus, which cause millions of yearly infections around the globe, and coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, the source of the current pandemic. The severity of outbreaks caused by these viruses stresses the importance of research aimed at determining methods to limit virus spread and to curb disease severity. Such studies require molecular tools to decipher virus-host interactions and to develop effective treatments. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a reporter system that can be used to visualize and identify cells infected with dengue virus or SARS-CoV-2. This system is based on viral protease activity that mediates cleavage and nuclear translocation of an engineered fluorescent protein stably expressed in cells. We show the suitability of this system for live cell imaging, for visualization of single infected cells, and for screening and testing of antiviral compounds. With the integrated modular building blocks, this system is easy to manipulate and can be adapted to any virus encoding a protease, thus offering a high degree of flexibility. IMPORTANCE Reporter systems are useful tools for fast and quantitative visualization of virus-infected cells within a host cell population. Here, we describe a reporter system that takes advantage of virus-encoded proteases expressed in infected cells to cleave an ER-anchored fluorescent protein fused to a nuclear localization sequence. Upon cleavage, the GFP moiety translocates to the nucleus, allowing for rapid detection of the infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate reliable reporting activity for two major human pathogens from the Flaviviridae and the Coronaviridae families: dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2. We apply this reporter system to live cell imaging and use it for proof-of-concept to validate antiviral activity of a nucleoside analogue. This reporter system is not only an invaluable tool for the characterization of viral replication, but also for the discovery and development of antivirals that are urgently needed to halt the spread of these viruses.","output":"A Versatile Reporter System To Monitor Virus-Infected Cells and Its Application to Dengue Virus and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 or Covid-19 outbreak is currently affecting almost all of the world with a total of 503,203 people infected or confirmed positive, and 22,340 of them died as of March 26, 2020 [1].

It was compared the results of structural equation models (SEM) with models based on qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to analyze the possible influence of these variables on levels of anxiety-depression in adolescents with and without CD. The sample consisted of 681 adolescents, between 12 and 16 years old (M = 13.94, SD = 1.32). 61.50% were girls and 13.40% (n = 222) presented a CD (mainly pneumo-allergic and endocrine). They were evaluated by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Self-esteem Questionnaire, the Emotional Competences Questionnaire and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. The results obtained by SEM show that low self-esteem, problems with peers and low emotional competencies predict anxiety in 41% of the variance and depression in 72%. The results obtained by QCA show that the different combinations of these variables explain between 24 and 61% of low levels of anxiety and depression and 47C55% of high levels.

In the present study, we examined the provision of stroke care in Kobe City during the COVID-19 epidemic, where some major stroke centers ceased to provide emergency care. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. The Kobe Stroke Network surveyed the number of stroke patients admitted to all primary stroke centers (PSCs) in the city between March 1 and May 23, 2020, and between March 3 and May 25, 2019. In addition, online meetings between all PSC directors were held regularly to share information. The survey items included emergency response system characteristics, number of patients with stroke hospitalized within 7 days of onset, administered treatment types (IV rt-PA, mechanical thrombectomy, surgery, and endovascular therapy), and stroke patients with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: During the period of interest in 2020, the number of stroke patients hospitalized across 13 PSCs was 813, which was 15.5% lower than that during the same period of 2019 (pa?=a?0.285). The number of patients admitted with cerebral infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage decreased by 15.4% (pa?=a?0.245), 16.1% (p = 0.659), and 14.0% (pa?=a?0.715), respectively. However, the rates of mechanical thrombectomy and surgery for intracerebral hemorrhage were slightly increased by 12.1% (pa?=a?0.754) and 5.0% (pa?=a?0.538), respectively. PSCs that ceased to provide emergency care reported a decrease in the number of stroke cases of 65.7% compared with the same period in 2019, while other PSCs reported an increase of 0.8%. No case of a patient with stroke and confirmed COVID-19 was reported during the study period.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of pregnant patients who tested positive for SARS CoV-2 infection at any point in pregnancy and collected paired maternal and cord blood samples at the time of delivery. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assays were performed to measure maternal plasma and cord blood concentrations and neutralizing potency of immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, and IgM antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Differences in concentrations according to symptomatic compared with asymptomatic infection and time from positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result to delivery were analyzed using nonparametric tests of significance. The ratio of cord to maternal antiCreceptor-binding domain IgG titers was analyzed to assess transplacental transfer efficiency. RESULTS: Thirty-two paired samples were analyzed. Detectable antiCreceptor-binding domain IgG was detected in 100% (n=32) of maternal and 91% (n=29) of cord blood samples. Functional neutralizing antibody was present in 94% (n=30) of the maternal and 25% (n=8) of cord blood samples. Symptomatic infection was associated with a significant difference in median (interquartile range) maternal antiCreceptor-binding domain IgG titers compared with asymptomatic infection (log 3.2 [3.5C2.4] vs log 2.7 [2.9C1.4], P=.03). Median (interquartile range) maternal antiCreceptor-binding domain IgG titers were not significantly higher in patients who delivered more than 14 days after a positive PCR test result compared with those who delivered within 14 days (log 3.3 [3.5C2.4] vs log 2.67 [2.8C1.6], P=.05). Median (range) cord/maternal antibody ratio was 0.81 (0.67C0.88). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate robust maternal neutralizing and antiCreceptor-binding domain IgG response after SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet a lower-than-expected efficiency of transplacental antibody transfer and a significant reduction in neutralization between maternal blood and cord blood.

For this reason, several intracellular factors, including the redox state, might directly or indirectly affect the progression and outcome of viral infection. In physiological conditions, the redox balance between oxidant and antioxidant species is maintained by enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems, and it finely regulates several cell functions. Different viruses break this equilibrium and induce an oxidative stress that in turn facilitates specific steps of the virus lifecycle and activates an inflammatory response. In this context, many studies highlighted the importance of redox-sensitive pathways as novel cell-based targets for therapies aimed at blocking both viral replication and virus-induced inflammation. In the review, we discuss the most recent findings in this field. In particular, we describe the effects of natural or synthetic redox-modulating molecules in inhibiting DNA or RNA virus replication as well as inflammatory pathways.

We conducted an interview study with nine well-established implementation researchers affiliated with universities in Austria, Germany, or Switzerland. The interviews were held via Zoom or phone in November and December 2020, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. Barriers that relate to characteristics of the discipline were difficulties in building a common understanding of the field and the complexity of implementation research projects. Although supportive scientific networks were important facilitators, interviewees mentioned challenges in connecting with likeminded researchers. A further barrier was the lack of opportunities for education and training in implementation science, especially in the German language. Also, participants reported a missing readiness in academia for establishing implementation science that should be addressed by advocacy of the discipline toward academic decision makers. Moreover, since most national funding agencies prioritize basic research over applied research, some interviewees named flexibility in handling research funds as a facilitator for implementation research. The results inform an agenda for promoting implementation science in German-speaking countries and can be beneficial to other countries that are currently advancing their implementation research capacity and infrastructure.

Trained immunity is defined by the immunological memory developed in innate immune cells after a primary non-specific stimulus that, in turn, promotes a heightened inflammatory response upon a secondary challenge. The most characteristic changes associated to this process involve the rewiring of cell metabolism and epigenetic reprogramming. Under physiological conditions, the role of trained immune cells ensures a prompt response. This action is limited by effective resolution of inflammation and tissue repair in order to restore homeostasis. However, unrestrained activation of innate immune cells contributes to the development of chronic inflammation and tissue destruction through the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, proteases and growth factors. Therefore, interventions aimed at reversing the changes induced by trained immunity provide potential therapeutic approaches to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We review cellular approaches that target metabolism and the epigenetic reprogramming of dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, and other trained cells in the context of autoimmune inflammatory diseases.","output":"Therapies Targeting Trained Immune Cells in Inflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Through their support of local agriculture, relationships, and healthy diets, farmers markets can contribute to a sustainable food system. Markets like the Yellowknife Farmers Market (YKFM) are social spaces that support local food, yet the COVID-19 pandemic has forced changes to their current model. We explore the potential of online marketplaces to contribute to a resilient, sustainable food system through a case study of the YKFM. METHODS: In 2019, a collaborative mixed-method evaluation was initiated by the YKFM and university partners in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. The evaluation included an in-person Rapid Market Assessment dot survey and questionnaire of market patrons from two YKFM dates prior to the pandemic. Due to COVID-19, a vendor survey and interviews were deferred. Data collected from the two patron surveys, alongside researcher observations, available literature, public announcements, and informal email and phone discussions, inform the discussion. RESULTS: For the patron surveys, 59 dot survey and 31 questionnaire participants were recruited. The top motivators for attendance were eating dinner, atmosphere, and supporting local businesses, and most patrons attended as couples and spent over half of their time talking to others. The YKFM did not move online; instead, they proposed and implemented a \\"Shop, don't stop\\" market. Informal conversations suggested the small scale of the market and technology challenges were perceived barriers to moving online. The physically-distanced market was well-attended and featured in local media. CONCLUSIONS: NWT food strategies rely on farmers markets to nurture a local food system. Data suggest a potential incongruence between an online model and important market characteristics such as the event-like atmosphere. Available literature suggests online markets can support local food by facilitating purchasing and knowledge-sharing, yet they do not replicate the open-air or social experience. The decision not to move online for the YKFM reflects market patron characteristics and current food context in Yellowknife and the NWT. While online adaptation does not fit into the YKFM plan today, online markets may prove useful as a complementary strategy for future emerging stressors to enhance the resiliency of local systems.","output":"Virtual barriers: unpacking the sustainability implications of online food spaces and the Yellowknife Farmers Market's response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite a plethora of research into Aboriginal employment and recruitment, the extent and nature of the retention of frontline Aboriginal people in health, ageing, and disability workforces are currently unknown. In this application, frontline service delivery is defined as Aboriginal people who are paid employees in the health, ageing, and disability service sectors in roles that involve direct client, participant, or patient contact. There is a need to identify the factors that inhibit (push) and promote (pull) staff retention or departure of this workforce from the sectors. This study will provide additional insight about this topic. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project is to uncover the factors that influence the retention of frontline Aboriginal workers in the health, ageing, and disability workforces in New South Wales (NSW) who do not have university qualifications. The aim of the proposed project aims to discover the push and pull factors for the retention of the frontline Aboriginal workforce in the health, ageing, and disability sectors in NSW in relation to their role, employment, and community and design evidence-based strategies for retaining the Aboriginal frontline workforce in the health, ageing, and disability sectors in NSW. METHODS: The proposed research will use a mixed methods approach, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data via surveys and interviews to capture and represent the voices and perspectives of Aboriginal people in a way that the participants chose. RESULTS: Indigenous research methodologies are a growing field in Aboriginal health research in Australia. A key strength of this study is that it is led by Aboriginal scholars and Aboriginal controlled organizations that apply an Indigenous methodological framework throughout the research process. CONCLUSIONS: This study uses a mixed methods design. The survey and interview questions and model were developed in partnership with Aboriginal health, ageing, and disability service workers rather than relying only on research publications on the workforce, government policies, and human resources strategies. This design places a strong emphasis on generalizable findings together with an inductive approach that explores employers and workers' lived experience of the Aboriginal health workforce in NSW. Excluding workers who have graduated from university places a strong focus on the workforce who have obtained either school or Technical and Further Education or registered training organizations qualifications. Data collection was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and results will include the unique experiences of Aboriginal workers and employers delivering services in an extremely challenging organizational, community, and personal context.

If immunity wanes, we find that COVID-19 likely becomes endemic and that social-distancing is here to stay until the discovery of a vaccine or cure. But waning immunity does not necessarily change optimal actions on the onset of the pandemic. Decentralized equilibria are virtually independent of waning immunity until close to peak infections. For centralized equilibria, the relevance of waning immunity decreases in the probability of finding a vaccine or cure, the costs of infection (e.g., infection-fatality rate), and the presence of other NPIs that lower contagion (e.g., quarantining and mask use). In simulations calibrated to July 2020, our model suggests that waning immunity is virtually unimportant for centralized equilibria until at least 2021.

Recent studies on many COVID-19 patients in Italy and the United Kingdom found increasing anosmia and ageusia among the COVID-19-infected patients.

A proline residue located at the central FP region has often been suggested to have a distinctive role in this fusion event. The spike glycoprotein from strain RSA59 (PP) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) contains two central, consecutive prolines in the FP. Here, we report that deletion of one of these proline residues, resulting in RSA59 (P), significantly affected neural cell syncytia formation and viral titers postinfection in vitro Transcranial inoculation of C57Bl/6 mice with RSA59 (PP) or RSA59 (P) yielded similar degrees of necrotizing hepatitis and meningitis, but only RSA59 (PP) produced widespread encephalitis that extended deeply into the brain parenchyma. By day 6 postinfection, both virus variants were mostly cleared from the brain. Interestingly, inoculation with the RSA59 (P)-carrying MHV significantly reduced demyelination at the chronic stage. We also found that the presence of two consecutive prolines in FP promotes a more ordered, compact, and rigid structure in the spike protein. These effects on FP structure were due to proline's unique stereochemical properties intrinsic to its secondary amino acid structure, revealed by molecular dynamics and NMR experiments. We therefore propose that the differences in the severity of encephalitis and demyelination between RSA59 (PP) and RSA59 (P) arise from the presence or absence, respectively, of the two consecutive prolines in FP.

In this regard, this work suggests an environmentally benign disposal process, simultaneously achieving the production of valuable fuels from the face mask. To this end, CO 2-assisted thermo-chemical process was conducted. The first part of this work determined the major chemical constituents of a disposable mask: polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon, and Fe. In the second part, pyrolysis study was employed to produce syngas and C 1-2hydrocarbons (HCs) from the disposable mask. To enhance syngas and C 1-2HCs formations, multi-stage pyrolysis was used for more CCC and CCH bonds scissions of the disposable mask. Catalytic pyrolysis over Ni/SiO 2further expedited H 2and CH 4formations due to its capability for dehydrogenation.

It has been demonstrated that herds can remain free from these infections for several years also in high prevalence areas. Organically managed (OM) dairy herds have been shown to have lower seroprevalence of both viruses compared to conventionally managed (CM) herds. The objective of this study was to challenge the hypothesis of a lower occurrence of BRSV and BoCV in OM compared to CM dairy herds. In November 2011, May 2012 and May 2013 milk samples from four homebred primiparous cows were collected in 75 to 65 OM and 69 to 62 CM herds. The antibody status regarding BRSV and BoCV was analysed with commercial indirect ELISAs. Herds were classified as positive if at least one individual sample was positive. RESULTS: The prevalence of positive herds ranged from 73.4% to 82.3% for BRSV and from 76.8% to 85.3% for BoCV among OM and CM herds, over the three sampling occasions. There was no statistically significant difference between OM and CM herds at any sampling occasion. The incidence risk of newly infected herds did not differ statistically between OM and CM herds at any sampling occasion, neither for BRSV nor for BoCV. The incidence of herds turning sero-negative between samplings corresponded to the incidence of newly infected. Bulk tank milk (BTM) samples were also sampled in the herds and analysed. Several herds were negative on individual samples but positive in BTM. Herd-level data on production, health and reproduction were retrieved from V?XA Sweden and the study herds were representative of the source population. CONCLUSION: There was no difference in prevalence of or incidence risk for BRSV or BoCV between Swedish OM and CM herds. Because the incidence of herds becoming seropositive was balanced by herds becoming seronegative it should be possible to lower the prevalence of these two infections among Swedish dairy cattle herds if biosecurity is improved.

The WHO recommended social distancing and human-to-human contact was discouraged to control the transmission. It has put many countries in a state of lockdown and sporting events (including the 2020 Olympics) have been affected. Participation in sports and exercise, typically regarded as healthy activities, were also debated. The local professional football leagues, governed by the Hong Kong Football Association, ultimately postponed all matches after much deliberation on the transmission risk for the spectators and on-field players. Large spectating crowds are well-known to be infectious hazards, but the infection risk for on-field players is less recognized. Aside from watching professionals exercise, many people opted to hike in the countryside during the weekends to avoid city crowds. This led to a widespread discussion on the issue of wearing a facemask during outdoor activities. Methods: A small sample of video footage of professional football players were analysed to track each players' time of close body contact and frequency of infection-risky behaviours to investigate the risk of virus transmission during football games.To investigate the physiological effect of wearing a facemask during exercise, we conducted a controlled laboratory, within-subject, repeated measures study of 23 healthy volunteers of various sporting backgrounds. They underwent graded treadmill walking at 4a?km per hour for 6a?min with and without wearing a surgical mask in a randomized order with sufficient resting time in between trials. The heart rate and the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded. Results: In a 90a?min match, the average duration of close contact between professional football players was 19a?min and each player performed an average of 52 episodes of infection-risky behaviours. The heart rate and RPE of subjects wearing a facemask was 128 beats per minute and 12.7 respectively. In those without a facemask, the results were a heart rate of 124 beats per minute and a RPE of 10.8. Conclusion: This suggests that the infection risk was high for the players, even without spectators. The laboratory study to investigate the physiological effect of wearing a facemask found that it significantly elevated heart rate and perceived exertion. Those participating in exercise need to be aware that facemasks increase the physiological burden of the body, especially in those with multiple underlying comorbidities. Elite athletes, especially those training for the upcoming Olympics, need to balance and reschedule their training regime to balance the risk of deconditioning versus the risk of infection.

Most clinical development of adenovirus vectors now uses simian adenoviruses or rare human serotypes, whereas reported manufacturing processes mainly use serotypes such as AdHu5 which are of questionable relevance for clinical vaccine development. Many clinically relevant vaccine transgenes interfere with adenovirus replication, whereas most reported process development uses selected antigens or even model transgenes such as fluorescent proteins which cause little such interference. Processes are typically developed for a single adenovirus serotype C transgene combination, requiring extensive further optimization for each new vaccine. There is a need for rapid production platforms for small GMP batches of non-replicating adenovirus vectors for early-phase vaccine trials, particularly in preparation for response to emerging pathogen outbreaks. Such platforms must be robust to variation in the transgene, and ideally also capable of producing adenoviruses of more than one serotype. It is also highly desirable for such processes to be readily implemented in new facilities using commercially available single-use materials, avoiding the need for development of bespoke tools or cleaning validation, and for them to be readily scalable for later-stage studies. Here we report the development of such a process, using single-use stirred-tank bioreactors, a transgene-repressing HEK293 cell C promoter combination, and fully single-use filtration and ion exchange components. We demonstrate applicability of the process to candidate vaccines against rabies, malaria and Rift Valley fever, each based on a different adenovirus serotype. We compare performance of a range of commercially available ion exchange media, including what we believe to be the first published use of a novel media for adenovirus purification (NatriFlo? HD-Q, Merck). We demonstrate the need for minimal process individualization for each vaccine, and that the product fulfils regulatory quality expectations. Cell-specific yields are at the upper end of those previously reported in the literature, and volumetric yields are in the range 1  10(13) C 5  10(13) purified virus particles per litre of culture, such that a 2C4 L process is comfortably adequate to produce vaccine for early-phase trials. The process is readily transferable to any GMP facility with the capability for mammalian cell culture and aseptic filling of sterile products.","output":"Simian adenovirus vector production for early-phase clinical trials: A simple method applicable to multiple serotypes and using entirely disposable product-contact components"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The National Mental Health Survey of India reported a higher prevalence and treatment gap of psychiatric disorders among the general population.

Previous research on the effects of display inauthenticity on customers reveals considerable heterogeneity. Attempts to resolve this have largely been limited to stable and dispositional factors, which often escape managerial control. The present research investigates the impacts of display inauthenticity, choice restrictions, and their interaction on service performance. Choice restrictions may buffer inauthenticity effects as demonstrated by results from three factorial experiments in different contexts (e.g., restrictions of service provider choice in predelivery in Study 1 and in-store choice restrictions during service delivery in Studies 2 and 3). Frontline employees display inauthenticity negatively affects service performance only if customers are subjected to low but not high choice restrictions. The interaction effect is explained by customers interdependent self-construal and is generalizable to actual spending behaviors. Our findings inform managers about the interplay of increasingly common inauthenticity and choice restrictions due to market shocks such as COVID-19 and provide insights into managerial interventions that can be used to mitigate the effects of inauthenticity on customers. ? 2022 The Authors.

PHC includes public health and first-contact primary care (PC). Internationally, the spread of COVID-19 and mortality rates vary widely. The authors hypothesised that countries perceived to have strong PHC have lower COVID-19 mortality rates. AIM: To compare perceptions of PC experts on PC system strength, pandemic preparedness, and response with COVID-19 mortality rates in countries globally. DESIGN & SETTING: A convenience sample of international PHC experts (clinicians, researchers, and policymakers) completed an online survey (in English or Spanish) on country-level PC attributes and pandemic responses. METHOD: Analyses of perceived PC strength, pandemic plan use, border controls, movement restriction, and testing against COVID-19 mortality were undertaken for 38 countries with &#8805;5 responses. RESULTS: In total, 1035 responses were received from 111 countries, with 1 to 163 responders per country. The 38 countries with &#8805;5 responses were included in the analyses. All world regions and economic tiers were represented. No correlation was found between PC strength and mortality. Country-level mortality negatively correlated with perceived stringent border control, movement restriction, and testing regimes. CONCLUSION: Countries perceived by expert participants as having a prepared pandemic plan and a strong PC system did not necessarily experience lower COVID-19 mortality rates. What appears to make a difference to containment is if and when the plan is implemented, and how PHC is mobilised to respond. Many factors contribute to spread and outcomes. Important responses are first to limit COVID-19 entry across borders, then to mobilise PHC, integrating the public health and PC sectors to mitigate spread and reduce burden on hospitals through hygiene, physical distancing, testing, triaging, and contract-tracing measures.","output":"Relationship between the perceived strength of countries' primary care system and COVID-19 mortality: an international survey study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article describes the process of aggregation of media-based data about the coronavirus pandemic in the Olomouc region, the Czech Republic Originally non-spatially located news from different sources and various platforms (government, social media, news portals) were automatically aggregated into a centralized database The application COVID-map is an interactive web map solution which visualizes records from the database in a spatial way The COVID-map has been developed within the Ad hoc online hackathon as an academic project at the Department of Geoinformatics, Palacky University Olomouc, Czech Republic Alongside spatially localized data, the map application collects statistical data from official sources e g , from the governmental crisis management office The impact of the application was immediate Within a few days after the launch, tens of thousands users per day visited the COVID-map It has been published by regional and national media The COVID-map solution could be considered as a suitable implementation of the correctly used cartographical method for the example of the coronavirus pandemic","output":"Non-Spatial Data towards Spatially Located News about COVID-19: A Semi-Automated Aggregator of Pandemic Data from (Social) Media within the Olomouc Region, Czechia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The correlation between maternal serum antibodies in beef calves at 2 days old and protection against diarrhea induced by natural bovine rotavirus (BRV) infection was examined.

METHODS: Participants within the Pain Registry for Epidemiological, Clinical, and Interventional Studies and Innovation were eligible if they provided encounter data in the 3 months immediately before and after the national emergency proclamation date (NEPD). RESULTS: The mean age of the 528 study participants was 53.9 years and 74.1% were women. Utilization of exercise therapy, massage therapy, and spinal manipulation decreased during the pandemic. Increasing age was associated with decreased utilization of all nonpharmacological treatments except exercise therapy, and with increased opioid use during the pandemic. African American participants reported decreased utilization of yoga and spinal manipulation during the pandemic. Overall, mean change scores for pain intensity and disability before and after the NEPD were not significant. However, African American participants consistently reported worse pain intensity and disability outcomes during the pandemic. Marginally worse outcomes were observed less consistently for pain intensity with increasing age and for disability among women. DISCUSSION: Social distancing during the pandemic impacted the uptake of recommended nonpharmacological treatments for chronic low back pain that require visiting community-based facilities or interacting closely with providers.

METHODS: We searched for systematic reviews, cohorts, case series, case reports, editor letters, and venous thromboembolism COVID-19 patients abstracts following PRISMA and PROSPERO statements. We analyzed therapeutic approaches and clinical outcomes of venous thromboembolism COVID-19 patients. Inclusion: COVID-19 patients with venous thromboembolism confirmed by an imaging method (venous doppler ultrasound, ventilation-perfusion lung scan, computed tomography pulmonary angiogram, pulmonary angiography). We assessed and reported the original Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index for each pulmonary embolism patient. In addition, we defined major bleedings according to the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria. RESULTS: We performed a systematic review from August 9 to August 30, 2020. We collected 1,535 papers from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Wiley, and Opengrey. We extracted data from 89 studies that describe 143 patients. Unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparin was used as parenteral anticoagulation in 85/143 (59%) cases. The Food and Drug Administration-approved alteplase regimen guided the advanced treatment in 39/143 (27%) patients. The mortality was high (21.6%, CI 95% 15.2-29.3). The incidence of major bleeding complications was 1 (0.9%) in the survival group and 1 (3.2%) in the death group.

METHODS: We used 2 years of linked survey data from 20,485 grade 9C11 students who participated in wave 6 (2017/18) and 7 (2018/19) of the COMPASS study. Mental health outcomes included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder7 item (GAD-7) scale and the 10-item Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale Revised (CESD-10-R). Social health encompassed students perceived relationships with friends, family, teachers, and within schools. Multilevel, prospective, linear models regressed mental health (at wave 7) on social health (at wave 6) and weight perception (at wave 6) while controlling for weight status, ethnicity, and grade (at wave 6). Interaction terms were used to test social health factors as moderators in the association between weight perception and mental health. RESULTS: Overweight perceptions were associated with higher anxiety and depression scores among youth; this was more pronounced among females. Social health was associated with lower anxiety and depression scores. Among females only, an overweight perception had the highest predicted scores for significant depressive symptoms. Among males only, underweight perceptions were associated with higher anxiety scores. No social health factors had moderating effects in females, and only two interactions were significant among males: feeling safe at school had protective associations with anxiety scores among those with underweight perceptions while those with overweight perceptions had higher depression scores when they reported rewarding social relationships. CONCLUSION: Overweight perceptions in all youth, and underweight perceptions in males, predicted anxiety and depression symptoms 1 year later. The role of social health should not be discounted as a means of preventing anxiety and depression in youth, although this study suggests it is not sufficient to protect against adverse associations with overweight perceptions for all youth, and underweight perceptions for males.

Health care systems, especially in rural regions in India, face substantial challenges to address these gaps in care, and innovative strategies are needed. METHODS We hypothesise that an intervention involving an anti-stigma campaign and a mobile-technology-based electronic decision support system will result in reduced stigma and improved mental health for adults at high risk of common mental disorders. It will be implemented as a parallel-group cluster randomised, controlled trial in 44 primary health centre clusters servicing 133 villages in rural Andhra Pradesh and Haryana. Adults aged  18 years will be screened for depression, anxiety and suicide based on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorders (GAD-7) scores. Two evaluation cohorts will be derived-a high-risk cohort with elevated PHQ-9, GAD-7 or suicide risk and a non-high-risk cohort comprising an equal number of people not at elevated risk based on these scores. Outcome analyses will be conducted blinded to intervention allocation. EXPECTED OUTCOMES The primary study outcome is the difference in mean behaviour scores at 12 months in the combined 'high-risk' and 'non-high-risk' cohort and the mean difference in PHQ-9 scores at 12 months in the 'high-risk' cohort. Secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety remission rates in the high-risk cohort at 6 and 12 months, the proportion of high-risk individuals who have visited a doctor at least once in the previous 12 months, and change from baseline in mean stigma, mental health knowledge and attitude scores in the combined non-high-risk and high-risk cohort. Trial outcomes will be accompanied by detailed economic and process evaluations. SIGNIFICANCE The findings are likely to inform policy on a low-cost scalable solution to destigmatise common mental disorders and reduce the treatment gap for under-served populations in low-and middle-income country settings.

Today, as the spread of COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating, it is evident that the risks to health in urban environments need to be readdressed, as the cities that cater to contemporary lifestyle needs, demonstrate immense liability to the virus spread. Imposed change in living dynamics, the growing demand for the use of public spaces, and the relationship between public spaces and disease transmission, are only some of the most vigorously debated topics of today, raising numerous questions about the future of the city. Within this academic framework, the paper examines existing inventory of public spaces in Sarajevo aiming to address the possibility of the city to transit towards a wider and more homogeneous supply of public space. Through cartographic representation the research produces maps - an atlas of the main categories of public spaces such as parks, gardens, plazas and pedestrian areas. The results provide an insight into the assessment of vulnerability and risk in Sarajevo in terms of public areas availability and propose specific spatial interventions that could provide a more adequate response for the changing social behavior during and after COVID-19 pandemic. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Envisioning Sarajevo as Pandemic-Resilient City: A Case Study on Public Spaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Influenza virus infection is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular events, especially in populations with pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Considering that influenza is vaccine preventable, international guidelines recommend high-risk populations with CVD receive an influenza vaccine every year. However, there are various classifications of recommendations and levels of evidence. Previous systematic reviews concluded uncertain evidence on influenza vaccine efficacy for preventing cardiovascular events in the general population or in populations with pre-existing CVD. Limited safety data of influenza vaccines were reported for populations with pre-existing CVD. Randomised controlled trials with larger sample sizes relative to previous studies are emerging, the findings of these trials are likely to be highly influential on summary efficacy estimates. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We aim to perform a living systematic review and a prospective meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of influenza vaccines compared with no vaccines or placebo for preventing mortality or CVD events in the general population and in populations with pre-existing CVD. Any types of randomised controlled trial and observational study meeting the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome and Study design criteria for the research question will be selected for inclusion. The living systematic review status will be maintained for 3 years with an update for every 6 months. Mainstream medical literature databases will be independently searched by two authors with predefined strategies. Two authors will perform the risk of bias assessment with consensus. Narrative synthesis and meta-analyses will be performed to summarise the results. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Formal ethical review is not required as this study does not involve primary data collection. We will publish results of the living systematic review and prospective meta-analysis in a peer-reviewed journal. Findings will also be presented at relevant meetings.

We define it as the systematic comparative genomics and aim to develop the methodology. RESULTS: First, we create a method, GenomeFingerprinter, to unambiguously produce a set of three-dimensional coordinates from a sequence, followed by one three-dimensional plot and six two-dimensional trajectory projections, to illustrate the genome fingerprint of a given genome sequence. Second, we develop a set of concepts and tools, and thereby establish a method called the universal genome fingerprint analysis (UGFA). Particularly, we define the total genetic component configuration (TGCC) (including chromosome, plasmid, and phage) for describing a strain as a systematic unit, the universal genome fingerprint map (UGFM) of TGCC for differentiating strains as a universal system, and the systematic comparative genomics (SCG) for comparing a set of genomes crossing genetic components and biological categories. Third, we construct a method of quantitative analysis to compare two genomes by using the outcome dataset of genome fingerprint analysis. Specifically, we define the geometric center and its geometric mean for a given genome fingerprint map, followed by the Euclidean distance, the differentiate rate, and the weighted differentiate rate to quantitatively describe the difference between two genomes of comparison. Moreover, we demonstrate the applications through case studies on various genome sequences, giving tremendous insights into the critical issues in microbial genomics and taxonomy. CONCLUSIONS: We have created a method, GenomeFingerprinter, for rapidly computing, geometrically visualizing, intuitively comparing a set of genomes at genome fingerprint level, and hence established a method called the universal genome fingerprint analysis, as well as developed a method of quantitative analysis of the outcome dataset.

We examined whether serum matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) is useful for diagnosis of BA in Japanese infants, and whether serum MMP-7 concentrations before and after Kasai portoenterostomy (KP) predicted LT within a year. METHODS Subjects under 6 months old at 8 pediatric centers in Japan were enrolled retrospectively, including patients with cholestasis and normal controls (NC) without liver disease. Patients with cholestasis were divided into groups representing BA vs. cholestasis from other causes (non-BA). Serum samples were collected from patients with BA at diagnosis and 1 and 4 weeks after KP, as well as from non-BA and NC. RESULTS Serum MMP-7 concentrations were significantly higher in BA at diagnosis (median, 89.1 ng/mL) than in non-BA (11.0; P<0.001) or NC (10.3; P<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of MMP-7 for BA vs. non-BA yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.99 (95% confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.00). An optimal cut-off value of 18.6 ng/mL for serum MMP-7 in diagnosing BA demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 90%, respectively. Serum MMP-7 before and 1 week and 4 weeks after KP did not differ significantly between BA requiring only KP and BA requiring LT after KP. CONCLUSION Serum MMP-7 is a useful marker for diagnosis of BA in Japanese infants, but it could not predict LT within a year. This article is protected by copyright.

A fusion chain sustained by elastic collisions between the alpha particles and fuel ions, this way scattered to suprathermal energies, has been proposed as a possible route to overcome this limitation.

However, incorporating technology is meaningful only if the resulting strategy is usable and useful. Hence, we must systematically assess technological strategies' usability and usefulness before employing them. Our objective was therefore to adapt the effort-vs-impact assessment (commonly used in systems science and operations planning) to decision-making for technological implementation strategies. The approach includes three components C assessing the effort needed to make a technological implementation strategy usable, assessing its impact (i.e., usefulness regarding performance/efficiency/quality), and deciding whether/how to use it. The approach generates a two-by-two effort-vs-impact chart that categorizes the strategy by effort (little/much) and impact (small/large), which serves as a guide for deciding whether/how to use the strategy. We provide a case study of applying this approach to design a package of technological strategies for implementing a 5 A's tobacco cessation intervention at a Federally Qualified Health Center. The effort-vs-impact chart guides stakeholder-involved decision-making around considered technologies. Specification of less technological alternatives helps tailor each technological strategy within the package (minimizing the effort needed to make the strategy usable while maximizing its usefulness), aligning to organizational priorities and clinical tasks. Our three-component approach enables methodical and documentable assessments of whether/how to use a technological implementation strategy, building on stakeholder-involved perceptions of its usability and usefulness. As technology advances, results of effort-vs-impact assessments will likely also change. Thus, even for a single technological implementation strategy, the three-component approach can be repeatedly applied to guide implementation in dynamic contexts.","output":"Systematic Decision-Making for Using Technological Strategies to Implement Evidence-Based Interventions: An Illustrated Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the last months of the coronavirus pandemic, with all those public restrictions and health interventions, the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) appears now to have been raised in some countries around the world.

METHODS This was a global, multicentre and observational cohort study of MBS performed between May 01, 2020, and October 10,2020, in 68 centres from 24 countries. Data collection included in-hospital and 30-day COVID-19 and surgery-specific morbidity/mortality. RESULTS One hundred and seventy adolescent patients (mean age: 17.75  1.30 years), mostly females (n = 122, 71.8%), underwent MBS during the study period. The mean pre-operative weight and body mass index were 122.16  15.92 kg and 43.7  7.11 kg/m2 , respectively. Although majority of patients had pre-operative testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (n = 146; 85.9%), only 42.4% (n = 72) of the patients were asked to self-isolate pre-operatively. Two patients developed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection post-operatively (1.2%). The overall complication rate was 5.3% (n = 9). There was no mortality in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS MBS in adolescents with obesity is safe during the COVID-19 pandemic when performed within the context of local precautionary procedures (such as pre-operative testing). The 30-day morbidity rates were similar to those reported pre-pandemic.

The most common fecal characteristics on admission were watery stool (64%) and mushy stool (28%). For the defecation frequency, 37% of the cases defecated over three times a day. The median time from illness onset to diarrhea was 3.0 days (IQR 0.0-5.0) and the median duration of diarrhea was 5.0 days (IQR 2.0-9.3). CONCLUSION: Clinicians are required to promptly identify the patients with initial diarrhea symptoms and pay adequate attention to the nutrient requirements of the patients with diarrhea during hospitalization. Standardized management is also recommended for the discharge of the patients to avoid potential fecal-oral transmission.","output":"Clinical characteristics of diarrhea in 90 cases with COVID-19: a descriptive study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To analyze the microbiota of the physiotherapist's work environment to understand the existing potential risks and to adopt appropriate preventive measures.

Switching monopolar RFA (SW-RFA) enlarges the ablative volume to better cover larger tumors. This study aims to compare the long-term outcomes of medium-sized HCC treated by either SW-RFA or single-monopolar RFA (S-RFA). METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 139 cases (147 medium-size HCC) between 2008 and 2014. Under propensity score matching, a total of 43 paired patients with medium-size HCC and balanced clinical variables treated by either SW-RFA or S-RFA were selected for comparison. RESULTS SW-RFA showed a higher rate of achieving an adequate safety margin (p = 0.002). After a mean follow-up period of 40.4 months, SW-RFA produced significantly lower global RFA failure rates (p < 0.001) and better overall survival (p = 0.005) compared to S-RFA. SW-RFA was independently associated with a decreased risk of global RFA failure (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.136, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.030-0.607, p = 0.009) and improved overall survival (HR: 0.337, 95% CI: 0.152-0.747, p = 0.007). By last follow-up, the SW-RFA group maintained a superior tumor-free rate (p = 0.010) and fewer progressions to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C (p = 0.011). Major complication rates were comparable in both groups (SW-RFA: 2.3% vs. S-RFA: 4.7%, p = 1.000). CONCLUSIONS The switching multi-monopolar ablation technique could be beneficial for patients with medium-sized HCCs given sustained control of larger tumors with better overall survival. KEY POINTS ? Switching monopolar ablation could provide a sustained local tumor control and better overall survival than single-monopolar ablation for the medium-sized hepatocellular carcinoma. ? Compared to single-monopolar ablation, switching monopolar ablation could create a larger homogeneous coagulation volume by using a shorter total ablation time to achieve a higher rate of adequate safety margin for a medium-sized HCC. ? Patients with medium-sized HCC can be maintained at a higher rate of tumor-free status and at a lower risk of progression into BCLC stage C in the follow-up period after ablation by switching monopolar than by single-monopolar ablation.","output":"Switching monopolar radiofrequency ablation improves long-term outcomes of medium-sized hepatocellular carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this descriptive study is to highlight the issues related to the mental health of employees during COVID-19.

Recently, the dysregulation of alternative splicing (AS) in the brain has been found to significantly influence the progression of MS. Moreover, previous studies demonstrate that many MS-related variants in the genome act as the important regulation factors of AS events and contribute to the pathogenesis of MS. However, by far, no genome-wide research about the effect of genomic variants on AS events in MS has been reported. Here, we first implemented a strategy to obtain genomic variant genotype and AS isoform average percentage spliced-in values from RNA-seq data of 142 individuals (51 MS patients and 91 controls). Then, combing the two sets of data, we performed a cis-splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) analysis to identify the cis-acting loci and the affected differential AS events in MS and further explored the characteristics of these cis-sQTLs. Finally, the weighted gene coexpression network and gene set enrichment analyses were used to investigate gene interaction pattern and functions of the affected AS events in MS. In total, we identified 5835 variants affecting 672 differential AS events. The cis-sQTLs tend to be distributed in proximity of the gene transcription initiation site, and the intronic variants of them are more capable of regulating AS events. The retained intron AS events are more susceptible to influence of genome variants, and their functions are involved in protein kinase and phosphorylation modification. In summary, these findings provide an insight into the mechanism of MS.","output":"Genome-wide Identification and Analysis of Splicing QTLs in Multiple Sclerosis by RNA-Seq Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Primary objective: to evaluate the efficacy of melatonin as a prophylactic treatment on prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

It is important to assess how different patient groups respond to stress related to the pandemic, and what additional factors influence it, including family-related stress, migration background, and sex. We conducted a survey in a sample of 294 psychiatric patients in a large outpatient clinic in Berlin, measuring level of distress in relation to COVID-19 lockdown as well as family-related distress. We also measured potential influencing factors such as media consumption and medical support. In the migration background group, we found that women had more lockdown related psychological distress than men. This was not apparent in those patients with a German background. We found that females were more strongly affected by family-related distress, particularly those with a migration background. People with PTSD were most strongly affected by family-related distress, whereas people with psychotic disorders and addiction reported the least distress. There were no effects of media consumption. There were no differences in ability to abide by the lockdown related restrictions across diagnoses. Our results support earlier findings on differential vulnerability of diagnostic groups to these stressors.

We aimed to developed and validate a deep learning algorithm using EHR structured data to identify patients at risk for ARDS or in-hospital mortality in pre-COVID and COVID-19 inpatient population. Method: The initial cohort consisted of adult ICU patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) from 2017 to 2018 at 3 hospitals at Montefiore Medical Center. Independently trained physician reviewed all chest x-rays in patients with PaO2/FiO2 ratio  300 to determine ARDS as per Berlin criteria. We used 66 discrete EHR variables to generate 135 features based on variable types. We longitudinally sampled hourly and missing data were forwardly imputed. We trained a preliminary Long Short-Term Memory network to determine the probability of ARDS or in-hospital mortality in the 2017-2018 cohort. Using active learning process, we applied this preliminary model to additional MV patients admitted between 2016-2017 and 2018-2019 to expand the sample size with additional ARDS and non-ARDS patients. The expanded pre-COVID cohort (2016-2019) was split into training and validation cohort (80 and 20%). A new and final LSTM model were trained on the pre-COVID training cohort. Validations were performed on the pre-COVID validation cohort and a population of mechanically ventilated and non-ventilated COVID-19 patients between March-April 2020. Result: The pre-COVID cohort included 3905 MV patients in the ICU from final 2016-2019. 1646 (42.4%) had ARDS and 1033 (26.5%) died during hospitalization. COVID-19 cohort included 5672 patients and 907 (16%) died. 803 (14.2%) were mechanically ventilated including 583 ARDS patients(10.3% of COVID cohort and 72.6% of MV COVID patients) and 418 (52.1%) who died (Table 1). The model ROC was 0.78 for pre-COVID validation cohort. At model cutoff 0.90, the sensitivity was 86% and specificity was 57% (Table 1) In the COVID-19 cohort, the ROC was 0.83 (sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 84%). On the COVID-19 +MV sub-cohort, the model ROC was 0.70 and accurately diagnosed 91.6% of ARDS or death. The model was able to identify ARDS or death close to the time of intubation and ARDS label time in both pre-COVID and COVID-19 cohort (Table 1). Conclusion: Our LSTM algorithm accurately and timely identified the probability ARDS or in-hospital in mechanically ventilated patients. When we applied the model to a larger cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 which had a higher prevalence of ARDS, the sensitivity, and positive predictive value remains high but specificity is much lower among MV patients.","output":"Deep learning algorithm identifies risk of ARDS or in-hospital mortality in mechanically ventilated patients and validation on COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe BSG-BASL decompensated cirrhosis care bundle seeks to optimise patient management during the first 24 hours of presentation. The pandemic has impacted on junior doctors hepatology training, by reducing access to face-to-face teaching. We sought to redress this by assessing how a remote education programme could affect bundle implementation and awareness, shortly after the UK s first COVID-19 wave.MethodsA retrospective snapshot case-note audit was undertaken for 4 weeks (August 2020) at Bristol Royal Infirmary (BRI). Decompensated cirrhosis admissions were identified from coding and bundle usage and compliance with ascitic tap guidance were quantified. An online survey was conducted of BRI junior doctors (medical) to assess knowledge of the bundle and awareness of appropriate ascitic fluid tests. Subsequent quality improvement interventions were developed, with repeat audits in May-June 2021.ResultsThe baseline audit identified appropriate bundle completion in 50% (n=8/16) decompensated cirrhosis patients, none by foundation doctors, with 2 by hepatology consultants. Ascitic tap was attempted in only 50% of patients with detectable ascites (4/8), with recommended tests requested in 2 of 3 successful taps.The online survey (40 participants 42% response) revealed good knowledge of when to use the bundle (85%) and how to access it (90%). For patients with new ascites, 46% of participants identified appropriate tests, however 39/40 also selected unnecessary options. Knowledge was poorer for patients with known ascites;20% selected correct investigations and no participants knew the exact combination to request. Procedural skills varied, 49% of participants had performed an ascitic tap unsupervised, but 33% had never attempted one.After these audits, remote teaching sessions and posters were used to improve prompting of bundle completion;paper copies were distributed to admission areas. Re-audit (May 2020) identified 15 hepatic decompensation admissions, of whom 53% (n=8) had a completed bundle. 9 ascitic taps were attempted in 13 patients with ascites (69%);correct investigations were requested in 5 of 7 taps (71%). At a repeat online survey (32% response rate) 10% (3/30) selected only the necessary investigations for new ascites and 13% (4/30) for recurrent ascites. This indicates that knowledge has not significantly improved.ConclusionThere remained low usage of the BSG-BASL decompensated cirrhosis bundle despite an education campaign. Ascitic tap performance improved but test requesting remained suboptimal.

One pathway through which both experience of and worries about adversity may impact health is through effects on sleep. METHODS: We used data from 46,284 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study assessed weekly from 01/04/2020-12/05/2020 to study the association between adversities and sleep quality. We studied six categories of adversity including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety. We used random-effect within-between models to account for all time-invariant confounders. RESULTS: Both the total number of adversity experiences and total number of adversity worries were associated with lower quality sleep. Each additional experience was associated with a 1.16 (95% CI = 1.10, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep while each additional worry was associated with a 1.20 (95% CI = 1.17, 1.22) times higher odds of poor quality sleep. When considering specific experiences and worries, all worries and experiences were significantly related to poorer quality sleep except experiences relating to employment and finances. Having a larger social network offered some buffering effects on associations but there was limited further evidence of moderation by other social or psychiatric factors. CONCLUSION: Poor sleep may be a mechanism by which COVID-19 adversities are affecting mental health.

Yet, little is known regarding international variation in critical care services. We sought to understand differences in critical care delivery by comparing data on the distribution of services in eight countries. DESIGN Retrospective review of existing national administrative data. We identified sources of data in each country to provide information on acute care hospitals and beds, intensive care units and beds, intensive care admissions, and definitions of intensive care beds. Data were all referenced and from as close to 2005 as possible. SETTING United States, France, United Kingdom, Canada, Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, and Spain. PATIENTS Not available. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS No standard definition existed for acute care hospital or intensive care unit beds across countries. Hospital beds varied three-fold from 221/100,000 population in the United States to 593/100,000 in Germany. Adult intensive care unit beds also ranged seven-fold from 3.3/100,000 population in the United Kingdom to 24.0/100,000 in Germany. Volume of intensive care unit admissions per year varied ten-fold from 216/100,000 population in the United Kingdom to 2353/100,000 in Germany. The ratio of intensive care unit beds to hospital beds was highly correlated across all countries except the United States (r = .90). There was minimal correlation between the number of intensive care unit beds per capita and health care spending per capita (r = .45), but high inverse correlation between intensive care unit beds and hospital mortality for intensive care unit patients across countries (r = -.82). CONCLUSIONS Absolute critical care services vary dramatically between countries with wide differences in both numbers of beds and volume of admissions. The number of intensive care unit beds per capita is not strongly correlated with overall health expenditure, but does correlate strongly with mortality.

For highly impulsive individuals, dealing with these situations may be harder, as they tend to deliberate less about the consequences of their behaviors. In this study, we investigate the relationship between impulsivity and delay discounting on the one hand and compliance with COVID-19 restrictions on the other hand. We distinguish between compliance with social distancing measures and compliance with hygiene measures. Regression analyses of an international sample of 6759 students from seven European countries reveal that the self-reported personality construct of impulsivity is negatively related to both types of compliance behavior. However, and unexpectedly, we also find a weak positive association between the discount rateas measured by a behavioral taskand compliance.

To date, no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of this disease in clinic. Herein, therapeutic antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from hyperimmune equine plasma. First, a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) was obtained in gram-level quantities through high-cell density fermentation of Chinese hamster ovary cells. Then, the binding of the RBD to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, was verified by several biochemical methods. The efficacy of the RBD in triggering antibody response in vivo was subsequently tested in both mice and equines, and the results showed that the RBD triggered high-titer neutralizing antibody production in vivo. Immunoglobulin F(ab')2 fragments were prepared from equine antisera via removal of the Fc region from the immunoglobulins. Finally, a neutralization test with live virus demonstrated that RBD-specific F(ab')2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of 0.07 g/ml and an EC80 of 0.18 g/ml, showing a potent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2.

Otorhinolaryngologists deal intimately with pathologies of the head and neck region and upper respiratory tract and have been reported as a vulnerable group of healthcare workers who may be more susceptible to COVID-19 nosocomial infection. METHODS: In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the adaptations of Singapores largest tertiary Otorhinolaryngology department during the COVID-19 outbreak. This was undertaken via an evidence-based approach. The relevant medical literature and evidence underlying our adaptations are highlighted. RESULTS: A four-pronged strategy including (1) personnel segregation, (2) triaging and decantment, (3) use of personal protective equipment and (4) changes in clinical practice was employed. The strategy was bolstered by drawing upon a collective learnt experience from the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. CONCLUSION: A rigorous framework which can preserve operationality while navigating the heightened risks during this outbreak is critical for every Otorhinolaryngology department.

Through specificity and sensitivity tests, a real-time fluorescence-based recombinase-aided amplification (RF-RAA) method for detecting ILTV was established. The results showed that the method was specific and could be used to accurately detect ILTV, and there was no cross-reaction with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), avian influenza virus (AIV), or infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Real-time fluorescence-based recombinase-aided amplification had high sensitivity, and the lowest detectable limit (LDL) for ILTV could reach 10 copies/L, 1,000 times more sensitive than conventional PCR (104 copies/L), to rival that of real-time fluorescence-based quantitative PCR (RFQ-PCR) (10 copies/L). This method and RFQ-PCR were used to detect 96 samples of chicken throat swabs with ILT initially diagnosed in clinic from the north of China, and the coincidence rate of the 2 methods was 100%. The RF-RAA reaction required only 20-30 minutes to completing, and its sensitivity was much higher than that of conventional PCR. Real-time fluorescence-based recombinase-aided amplification is similar to RFQ-PCR and has the advantages of specificity, sensitivity, and high efficiency, so it is suitable for early clinical detection and epidemiological investigation of ILTV.","output":"Research Note: Rapid detection of avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus with real-time fluorescence-based recombinase-aided amplification."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Clinch Token Transfer Test (C3t) is a bi-manual coin transfer task that incorporates cognitive tasks to add complexity. This study explored the concurrent and convergent validity of the C3t as a simple, objective assessment of impairment that is reflective of disease severity in Huntingtons, that is not reliant on clinical expertise for administration. METHODS: One-hundred-and-five participants presenting with pre-manifest (n = 16) or manifest (TFC-Stage-1 n = 39; TFC-Stage-2 n = 43; TFC-Stage-3 n = 7) Huntingtons disease completed the Unified Huntingtons Disease Rating Scale and the C3t at baseline. Of these, thirty-three were followed up after 12 months. Regression was used to estimate baseline individual and composite clinical scores (including cognitive, motor, and functional ability) using baseline C3t scores. Correlations between C3t and clinical scores were assessed using Spearmans R and visually inspected in relation to disease severity using scatterplots. Effect size over 12 months provided an indication of longitudinal behaviour of the C3t in relation to clinical measures. RESULTS: Baseline C3t scores predicted baseline clinical scores to within 9C13% accuracy, being associated with individual and composite clinical scores. Changes in C3t scores over 12 months were small ([Formula: see text]  0.15) and mirrored the change in clinical scores. CONCLUSION: The C3t demonstrates promise as a simple, easy to administer, objective outcome measure capable of predicting impairment that is reflective of Huntingtons disease severity and offers a viable solution to support remote clinical monitoring. It may also offer utility as a screening tool for recruitment to clinical trials given preliminary indications of association with the prognostic index normed for Huntingtons disease.

However, its adoption in low- and middle-income countries is still at an infantile stage. The use of e-learning may help to overcome some of the barriers to access to quality education and provide flexible, low-cost, user-centred, and easily updated learning. To address the need for research education during the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed and implemented an e-learning course for students enrolled in higher diploma courses at the Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC). In this paper, we report our experience teaching the online research course in resource-constrained settings to enable other medical educators, students and institutions in similar settings to understand the most appropriate approaches to incorporating e-learning interventions. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study that reviewed the experiences of learners and lecturers on a research course at Kenya Medical Training College. All higher diploma students admitted to the college in the 2020/21 academic year were invited to take part in the study. We also included all lecturers that were involved in the coordination and facilitation of the course. We analysed qualitative and quantitative data that were collected from the e-learning platform, an online course-evaluation form and reports from course lecturers. RESULTS: We enrolled 933 students on the online research course. These students had joined 44 higher diploma courses in 11 campuses of the college. The students struggled to complete synchronous e-learning activities on the e-learning platform. Only 53 and 45% of the students were able to complete the pretest and the posttest, respectively. Four themes were identified through a thematic analysis of qualitative data (1) Students gained research competencies (2) Students appreciated the use of diverse e-learning technologies (3) Students felt overwhelmed by the research course (4) Technological challenges reduce the effectiveness of online learning. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that e-learning can be used to teach complex courses, such as research in resource-constrained settings. However, faculty should include more asynchronous e-learning activities to enhance teaching and learning and improve student experiences.","output":"E-learning in medical education during COVID-19 pandemic: experiences of a research course at Kenya Medical Training College"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE.

TLR4 is an innate immune receptor on the cell surface that recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including viral proteins and triggers the production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines to combat infection. It is expressed on both immune cells and tissue-resident cells. ACE2, the reported entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is only present on ~1-2% of the cells in the lungs or has a low pulmonary expression, and recently, the spike protein has been proposed to have the strongest protein-protein interaction with TLR4. Here, we review and connect evidence for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 having direct and indirect binding to TLR4, together with other viral precedents, which when combined shed light on the COVID-19 pathophysiological puzzle. We propose a model in which the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binds TLR4 and activates TLR4 signalling to increase cell surface expression of ACE2 facilitating entry. SARS-CoV-2 also destroys the type II alveolar cells that secrete pulmonary surfactants, which normally decrease the air/tissue surface tension and block TLR4 in the lungs thus promoting ARDS and inflammation. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-induced myocarditis and multiple-organ injury may be due to TLR4 activation, aberrant TLR4 signalling, and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, TLR4 contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and its overactivation causes a prolonged or excessive innate immune response. TLR4 appears to be a promising therapeutic target in COVID-19, and since TLR4 antagonists have been previously trialled in sepsis and in other antiviral contexts, we propose the clinical trial testing of TLR4 antagonists in the treatment of severe COVID-19. Also, ongoing clinical trials of pulmonary surfactants in COVID-19 hold promise since they also block TLR4.","output":"COVID-19 and Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4): SARS-CoV-2 May Bind and Activate TLR4 to Increase ACE2 Expression, Facilitating Entry and Causing Hyperinflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this review was to propose multi-pronged resumption strategies for lacrimal practice in an effort to plan a sustainable recommencement of elective surgeries after we emerge from the peak of COVID-19 pandemic.

Through the sequence of no dysplasia to low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD), eventually early cancer (EC) may develop. The risk of neoplastic progression is relatively low, 0.5-0.9 % per patient per year. However, once diagnosed, esophageal adenocarcinoma is often irresectable, and 5-year survival is only 15 %. Therefore, non-dysplastic BE patients are kept under endoscopic surveillance to detect early neoplasia in a curable stage. In case of LGD confirmed by an expert pathologist, risk of neoplastic progression is high. In these confirmed LGD patients, prophylactic ablation using radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the Barrett's segment has proven to significantly reduce risk of neoplastic progression. Once patients are diagnosed with HGD or EC, they have a clear indication for endoscopic treatment. The cornerstone for endoscopic management of early Barrett's neoplasia is endoscopic resection of mucosal abnormalities. Endoscopic resection (ER) provides a large tissue specimen for accurate histological evaluation to select those patients for further endoscopic management, who have neoplasia limited to the mucosa, well to moderately differentiated and without lymph-vascular invasion.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the Korean nationwide population-based COVID-19 dataset for participants who underwent real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays for COVID-19 between January 1 and June 4, 2020. A 1a:a3 ratio propensity score matching and binary logistic regression analysis were performed to investigate the association between AD and the susceptibility or severe complications (i.e., mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, or death) of COVID-19. RESULTS: Among 195,643 study participants, 5,725 participants had AD and 7,334 participants were diagnosed with COVID-19. The prevalence of participants testing positive for COVID-19 did not differ according to the presence of AD (pa=a0.234).

Interleukin 10 is a cytokine with controversial roles in CD8(+) T cellCmediated anti-tumor immunity. We therefore examined the interleukin 10 expression and consumption in CD8(+) T cells harvested from the peripheral blood and resected tumors of gastric cancer patients of stages IICIV. We found that the gastric cancer patients presented significantly elevated frequencies of interleukin 10Cexpressing cells in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells compared to healthy controls. But distinctive from the interleukin 10Cexpressing CD4(+) T cells, which increased in frequency in advanced cancer, the interleukin 10Cexpressing CD8(+) T cells did not increase with cancer stage in the peripheral blood and actually decreased with cancer stage in resected tumor. Interleukin 10 and interleukin 10 receptor expression was also enriched in interferon gammaCexpressing activated CD8(+) T cells. Compared to interleukin 10Cnonexpressing CD8(+) T cells, interleukin 10 receptorCexpressing CD8(+) T cells secreted significantly elevated interferon gamma levels. Treatment of anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated, purified CD8(+) T cells with interleukin 10 alone could significantly enhance CD8(+) T cell survival, an effect dependent on interleukin 10 receptor expression. Interleukin 10 also increased CD8(+) T cell proliferation synergistically with interferon gamma but not alone.

To do this, we examined oscillatory responses in the electroencephalogram (EEG) to TMS over primary motor cortex. In particular, we contrasted responses to real TMS with those to sham TMS in order to dissociate the contributions of direct (transcranial) activation and indirect activation (via auditory/sensory input) of the brain. We first showed that real single pulse TMS elicited a brief (a200 ms) increase in sensorimotor beta power whose frequency closely matched that of each individual's post-movement beta rebound (PMBR, a18 Hz). Sham TMS triggered minimal oscillatory activity. Together this implies that real TMS interacts with endogenous oscillations via direct brain activation. We then showed that although trains of real rhythmic TMS delivered at each individuals PMBR frequency produced a brief increase in beta power at the same frequency, real arrhythmic TMS also elicited an equivalent increase in beta. The implication is that the oscillatory response is independent of the rhythm of stimulation. By contrast, sham stimulation elicited minimal activity in the beta band, and the responses to rhythmic and arrhythmic sham TMS were broadly similar, showing that sham rhythmic stimulation did not produce entrainment via sensory rhythms. Together, the data demonstrate that the beta oscillatory response of M1 to real TMS predominantly reflects direct activation of the underlying cortex. However, the data do not support the notion of rhythmic TMS enhancing oscillatory activity via entrainment-like mechanisms, at least within the constraints of the current experimental set-up.","output":"Motor cortex oscillates at its intrinsic post-movement beta rhythm following real (but not sham) single pulse, rhythmic and arrhythmic transcranial magnetic stimulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ebola hemorrhagic fever is caused by the Ebola filovirus (EBOV), which is one of the most aggressive infectious agents known worldwide.

RESULTS: Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in scFv format specific for the EBOV VP35 were isolated from the ETH-2 library of human recombinant antibodies by phage display technology. Five different clones were identified by sequencing, produced in E.coli and expressed in CHO mammalian cells to be characterized in vitro. All the selected scFvs were able to react with recombinant VP35 protein in ELISA, one of the scFvs being also able to react in Western Blot assay (WB). In addition, all scFvs were expressed in cell cytoplasm as intrabodies; a luciferase reporter gene inhibition assay performed in A549 cells showed that two of the scFvs can significantly hamper the inhibition of the IFN--induced RIG-I signaling cascade mediated by EBOV VP35. CONCLUSION: Five antibodies in scFv format recognize an active form of EBOV VP35 in ELISA, while one antibody also recognizes VP35 in WB. Two of these scFvs were also able to interfere with the intracellular activity of VP35 in a cell system in vitro. These findings suggest that such antibodies in scFv format might be employed to develop therapeutic molecules able to hamper EBOV infections.","output":"Intracellular human antibody fragments recognizing the VP35 protein of Zaire Ebola filovirus inhibit the protein activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. In addition to pneumonia, other COVID-19-associated symptoms have been reported, including loss of smell (anosmia). However, the connection between infection with coronavirus and anosmia remains enigmatic. It has been reported that defects in olfactory cilia lead to anosmia. In this Viewpoint, we summarize transmission electron microscopic studies of cilia in virus-infected cells. In the human nasal epithelium, coronavirus infects the ciliated cells and causes deciliation. Research has shown that viruses such as influenza and Sendai attach to the ciliary membrane. The Sendai virus enters cilia by fusing its viral membrane with the ciliary membrane. A recent study on SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions revealed that the viral nonstructural protein Nsp13 interacts with the centrosome components, providing a potential molecular link. The mucociliary escalator removes inhaled pathogenic particles and functions as the first line of protection mechanism against viral infection in the human airway.

CASE REPORT: A 58-year-old patient presented to our clinic with a complaint of acute abdominal pain. His CT examination revealed thrombosis in SMV, congestion in the mesenteric venous structures, contamination in the mesentery and thickening and dilatation of the jejunal loops due to ischemia. The patient had a history of acute COVID-19 infection. He had typical COVID-19 pneumonia findings (peripheral ground-glass opacities in both lung parenchyma predominantly in the lower lobe) on the thorax CT at that time. He was followed up with anticoagulant therapy. During his follow-up, a thoracic and abdominal CT was performed due to recurrent acute abdominal findings. On thorax CT, there was a web-like filling defect consistent with pulmonary embolism, traction bronchiectasis consistent with late findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, and poorly circumscribed subpleural ground glass opacities. On abdominal CT, in addition to mesenteric ischemia findings, loss of wall integrity was observed in the jejunal loops due to perforation, and collection areas containing air consistent with an abscess. He was treated with small bowel resection and abscess drainage. CONCLUSION: Patients with acute COVID-19 infection should be followed up for the early diagnosis of serious symptoms that may develop due to post-COVID-19 syndrome, and contrast-enhanced CT should be the imaging method of choice to detect possible mesenteric vascular thrombosis in patients with acute abdominal symptoms.","output":"A Case of Intestinal Perforation Associated with Mesenteric Thrombosis due to Post-COVID-19 Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many scholars have expressed fears that the 2019 coronavirus pandemic may exacerbate gender inequalities Indeed, studies have suggested that women, and mothers in particular, have been particularly affected by reducing their participation in the paid labor market to meet increased caregiving needs What is less clear is whether the pandemic has also shifted attitudes about mothers and fathers roles We collected data on gendered parenting attitudes both before and during the pandemic and report shifts in attitudes in this data visualization Consistent with fears of exacerbated gender inequality, we find a shift toward more conventional gender parenting attitudes We also find an increase in the importance placed on mothers and fathers earning money and a decrease in the role mothers and fathers play in child development, both of which may be due to the pandemics effects on the economy and schooling ?

PATIENTS AND METHODS The transperitoneal surgical technique included division of the parenchyma with a sealing device (LigaSure?; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) and amputation of the ureter as low as possible. A follow-up study was performed. Patients' records were analyzed retrospectively for operative details and postoperative complications. Long-term outcome was assessed during follow-up visits and a final telephone interview. Outcome was compared between two groups: Group 1 (G1), age at surgery<12 months; Group 2 (G2), age at surgery >12 months. RESULTS Between July 2004 and September 2012, in total, 22 laparoscopic heminephrectomies (20 upper poles and 2 lower poles) were performed in 20 patients (G1, 12 cases; G2, 10 cases). A mean (range) age at surgery was 7.1 (3-11) months in G1 and 49.4 (15-128) months in G2. Mean (range) operative time was 152 (81-220) min in G1 and 197 (90-265) min in G2 (P=.06).

Within the last century, four global pandemics have resulted from the introduction of novel IAVs into humans, with components of each originating from avian viruses. IAVs infect many avian species wherein they maintain a diverse natural reservoir, posing a risk to humans through the occasional emergence of novel strains with enhanced zoonotic potential. One natural barrier for transmission of avian IAVs into humans is the specificity of the receptor-binding protein, hemagglutinin (HA), which recognizes sialic-acid-containing glycans on host cells. HAs from human IAVs exhibit human-type receptor specificity, binding exclusively to glycans on cells lining the human airway where terminal sialic acids are attached in the 2-6 configuration (NeuAc2-6Gal). In contrast, HAs from avian viruses exhibit specificity for avian-type 2-3-linked (NeuAc2-3Gal) receptors and thus require adaptive mutations to bind human-type receptors. Since all human IAV pandemics can be traced to avian origins, there remains ever-present concern over emerging IAVs with human-adaptive potential that might lead to the next pandemic. This concern has been brought into focus through emergence of SARS-CoV-2, aligning both scientific and public attention to the threat of novel respiratory viruses from animal sources. In this review, we summarize receptor-binding adaptations underlying the emergence of all prior IAV pandemics in humans, maintenance and evolution of human-type receptor specificity in subsequent seasonal IAVs, and potential for future human-type receptor adaptation in novel avian HAs.","output":"Adaptation of influenza viruses to human airway receptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a systematic review of nanostructured organic materials, including synthesis methods, functionalization, and applications.

Theoretical and experimental vibrational investigations provide evidence of the molecular structure describing the interaction between both components, showing that the allowed amount of carbon nanotubes and their dispersion states differ across polymers. Moreover, the nature of the solvent used in the preparation has a significant impact on the dispersion process. The integration of these materials in photovoltaic applications is discussed, where the impact of nanoparticles is evidenced through the correlation between experimental analyses and theoretical approaches based on density functional theory. Alterations in optical properties, evaluated from the absorption and luminescence process, are coherent with the solar spectrum, and a good distribution of donor/acceptor interpenetration was observed. In all cases, it was demonstrated that the performance improvement is physically related to the charge transfer from the organic matrix to the nanoparticles.","output":"Polymer/Carbon Nanotube Based Nanocomposites for Photovoltaic Application: Functionalization, Structural, and Optical Properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Imported COVID-19 cases, if unchecked, can jeopardize the effort of domestic containment. We aim to find out what sustainable border control options for different entities (e.g., countries, states) exist during the reopening phases, given their own choice of domestic control measures. METHODS: We propose a SUIHR model, which has built-in imported risk and (1-tier) contact tracing to study the cross-border spreading and control of COVID-19. Under plausible parameter assumptions, we examine the effectiveness of border control policies, in combination with internal measures, to confine the virus and avoid reverting back to more restrictive life styles again. RESULTS: When the basic reproduction number R0 of COVID-19 exceeds 2.5, even 100% effective contact tracing alone is not enough to contain the spreading. For an entity that has completely eliminated the virus domestically, and resumes \\"normal\\", without mandatory institutional quarantine, even very strict border control measures combined with effective contact tracing can only delay another outbreak by 6 months. For entities employing a confining domestic control policy, non-increasing net imported cases is sufficient to remain open. CONCLUSIONS: Extremely strict border control in entities, where domestic spreading is currently eliminated (e.g., China), is justifiable. However such harsh measure are not necessary for other places. Entities successfully confining the virus by internal measures can open up to similar entities without additional border controls so long as the imported risk stays non-increasing. Opening the borders to entities lacking sufficient internal control of the virus should be exercised in combination with pre-departure screening and tests upon arrival.","output":"Sustainable border control policy in the COVID-19 pandemic: A math modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, named COVID-19, has been spread around the world at a high transmission rate.

Thrombotic complications are markers of severe COVID-19 and are associated with multiple organ failure and increased mortality. The application of unfractionated and/or low-molecular-weight heparins as anticoagulant medications, significantly reduced the severity of the disease and COVID-19-induced mortality, since heparin is a multifunctional agent. The goal of this review is to summarize the literature data on the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and to characterize the properties of heparin, which allow inhibiting these mechanisms at any stage of pathogenesis.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received &#8805;1 dose of HCQ at two New York City hospitals. We measured incident Grade 3 or 4 blood count and liver test abnormalities, ventricular arrhythmias, and vomiting and diarrhea within 10 days after HCQ initiation, and the proportion of patients who completed HCQ therapy. We also describe changes in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment hypoxia scores between baseline and day 10 after HCQ initiation and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: None of the 153 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received HCQ developed a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Incident blood count and liver test abnormalities occurred in <15% of patients and incident vomiting or diarrhea was rare. Eighty-nine percent of patients completed their HCQ course and three patients discontinued therapy because of QT prolongation.

It has precipitated business and school closures along with the implementation of physical distancing measures, which culminated in a Shelter in-Place Order (SIPO) issued for a major urban area county in March 2020. The objective of this study was to determine the effect on access to healthcare by patients of different socioeconomic status by examining differences in ED volume by zip code stratified by the SocioNeeds Index. Methods: This retrospective chart review examines whether there was a quantitative change in patient visits to an urban, tertiary county hospital ED from 2019-2020 by zip codes. The inclusion criterion was any ED visits from a county resident, and the exclusion criterion was any blank, alphanumeric, or PO box zip codes including zip codes located outside of Dallas County. We mapped daily patient visits by zip code for four phases: Phase 1 was the 3 months preceding the first COVID-19 cases announcement in Dallas, Phase 2 began with the first COVID case, Phase 3 encompassed when the SIPO was in effect for Dallas County, and Phase 4 included the three months following the expiration of the SIPO. The SocioNeeds Index rates each zip code by socioeconomic status, specific to this county. We compared this data to records over the same time period from the previous year to control for seasonal variation in the absence of a pandemic. Results: There were 275,756 ED patient visits included in this study. The results indicate a statistically significant decrease in ED visits occurred in all zip codes during the pandemic: 24% between Phase 1 and 4 (p<0.0001) in 2020. Additionally, there was a decrease in visits after the first case in Dallas: Phase 2 (-14%, p<0.0001), Phase 3 (-41%, p<0.0001) and Phase 4 (-25%, p<0.0001) when compared to 2019 but an increase in visits (36%, p<0.0001) in 2020 once the SIPO expired. Zip codes with highest need based on poverty, income, unemployment, occupation, education and language (weighted to correlate with preventable hospitalization and premature death rates) were found to have greater reductions in visits whereas zip codes which with the lowest needs saw a 15% increase in visits during the SIPO. The geographic distribution of visits indicate that most zip codes saw a reduction in visits over Phases 2 and 3 (especially zip codes further from the ED) and an increase in visits during Phase 4 but never recovered to pre-pandemic values. Conclusion: Overall, a significant decrease in ED visits per zip code was observed relative to a non-pandemic year in most zip codes except those with the highest socioeconomic status, suggesting that the virus and SIPO deterred patients disproportionately from the higher needs communities from accessing healthcare. These results could have implications for future pandemic public health messaging and targeted outreach to communities with barriers to healthcare access.

Confidence in telehealth competencies was rated \\"moderate\\" to \\"very,\\" but was most pronounced for the technical aspects of telehealth, rather than safety engagement with a patient. Although authors found no significant difference in cohort-level performance in total scores and history-taking between the OSCEs, physical examination and communication scores differed between the two assessments. Discussion: It was feasible to adapt a standardized OSCE to a telehealth format when in-person clinical skills assessment was impossible. Students rated this necessary innovation positively, and it adequately assessed foundational clinical skills performance. Conclusion: Given future competency needs in telehealth, we suggest several education and training priorities.","output":"Assessing Clinical Skills Via Telehealth Objective Standardized Clinical Examination: Feasibility, Acceptability, Comparability, and Educational Value."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nearly 257 million individuals have contracted hepatitis B infection around the world. However, only 10% of them know about their illness. Mother to child transmission, nosocomial spread, and sexual transmission are the major etiological factors. Finding the missing millions is a global issue. Hepatitis B care is more difficult compared to hepatitis C as not all patients require treatment and the selection of patients is not straightforward. To eliminate hepatitis B infection, the program should screen pregnant women and start antiviral therapy from the 28th week of pregnancy if hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA 200,000 IU/mL or hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) reactive. Prevention of perinatal infection, birth dose and neonatal vaccination, post-vaccination monitoring of high-risk groups, catch-up vaccination, and registration of the carriers should be an integral part of the program. Continuum of care is important when planning the elimination program from addressing the risk factors, testing, and referral for treatment. The program should integrate test and treat hepatitis services with existing local health care services. There is a need to create the right environment, raise awareness, remove stigma, and increase screening of those at risk and manage those who require treatment. A national policy should be prepared for capacity building, fund allocation, and implementation strategies. Micro-elimination strategies should boost national elimination effects. Guidelines to diagnose and treat patients with hepatitis B should be simplified.

Although reducing SFA intake is a public health strategy for CVD prevention, the role of body fat distribution on the relationship between SFA and LDL-C is unclear. Therefore, our objective was to investigate whether the association between dietary SFAs and LDL-C concentrations is related to body composition. METHODS: In the BODYCON (impact of physiological and lifestyle factors on body composition) study, 409 adults [mean age 42  16 years and median BMI of 23.5 (21.5-25.9) kg/m2] underwent a measure of body composition by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, assessment of habitual dietary intake using a 4-day weighed food diary and physical activity level using a tri-axial accelerometer. Blood pressure was measured, and a fasting blood sample was collected to determine cardiometabolic disease risk markers. Correlations between body composition, circulating risk markers and dietary macronutrients were assessed prior to multivariate regression analysis. The effect of increasing intakes of dietary SFA on outcome measures was assessed using ANCOVA after adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass was moderately positively correlated with total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure and HOMA-IR (rs = 0.25-0.44, p < 0.01). In multiple regression analysis, 18.3% of the variability in LDL-C was explained by SFA intake [% total energy (TE)], abdominal VAT mass, carbohydrate%TE and fat%TE intakes. When data were stratified according to increasing SFA%TE intakes, fasting TC, LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were higher in Q4 compared with Q2 (p  0.03). SBP was higher in Q4 versus Q3 (p = 0.01). Android lean mass was also higher in Q3 versus Q1 (p = 0.02). Other anthropometric and CVD risk markers were not different across quartile groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although dietary SFA was found to explain 9% of the variability in LDL-C, stratification of data according to quartiles of SFA intake did not reveal a dose-dependent relationship with LDL-C concentration. Furthermore, this association appeared to be independent of abdominal obesity in this cohort. Clinical Trail registration: Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02658539.

on public health and socio-economic matters The magnitude of COVID-19 has undoubtedly affected every aspect of daily life and highlighted the need for increased preparedness, coordination, and monitoring Amongst all social groups, the elderly is by far the most affected age group in morbidity and mortality [1] Approximately 1 3 million individuals live in 15,600 nursing home facilities in the United States [2] In fact, the beginning of COVID-19 may be marked by the 25 deaths in a single King County facility in Washington state Nursing homes have faced the rapid spread of COVID-19 among residents and staff and have been at the center of the public health emergency during the pandemic Factors that contribute to this rapid spread include crowding, sharing of bathroom facilities, and gathering in common areas that are not set up for infection control Nursing homes, in particular, provide ideal environments for devastating infections to spread Nursing homes, in particular, have essentially been in complete lockdown, not unlike inmates, who both deeply lack social interaction and are currently unable to exist outside the walls of their respective institutions Those who do not have close family or friends, and rely on the support of voluntary services or social workers, could be at additional risk [6] To lessen the chance of infection among older people in nursing homes, more local authorities are banning visitors to nursing homes and long-term care facilities Furthermore, restrictions on group activities such as playing board games, watching TV in a common space, and engaging in art therapy, may harm residents mental and physical well-being [8] Nursing home residents are already susceptible to loneliness, and the lack of social interaction due to decreased visitation from family and friends further compounds the traumatization of COVID-19 on daily living Methods METHODS: This is a descriptive study over a period of 1 month conducted among nursing home staff in Lubbock, TX during the COVID-19 pandemic Agreeable nursing home staff will have access to a survey (Qualtrics) accessing various aspects relating to the consequences of COVID-19 The survey will be open for a period of 1 month until which the participants will have the opportunity to complete the survey Data from the surveys will then be collected and analyzed The survey consists of a self-developed questionnaire along with the validated Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) The scale which was originally developed in 1983 by author Sheldon Cohen is one of the most widely used tools to measure the perception of stress It has been used in studies assessing the stressfulness of situations and is widely available in the public domain [12] Type of study: Descriptive mixed method

of color, creed, age or sex 3 Staff in direct contact with patients (Nursing and Physicians) Exclusion criteria: 1 Ancillary staff not involved in direct patient care 2 Staff who refuse to give voluntary consent to participate in survey Design: This will be a descriptive, mixed method triangulation design studyutilizing an online, self-administered survey tool created using Qualtrics platform An information sheet explaining the research project will be given to the nursing home staff It will include: participation is completely voluntary, that participation will not affect their employment in anyway, and their employer will not have access to the results It will also explain that by submitting an anonymous survey they are agreeing to take part in the research study The survey questions will gauge mental health impact on staff and their perspectives on the impact on patients and their own mental health The survey will contain a mix of 10 close- and open-ended questions

We aimed to quantify the effect of the pandemic on diabetes diagnosis/management, using glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) as surrogate, across six UK centres. METHODS: Using routinely collected laboratory data, we estimated the number of missed HbA1c tests for diagnostic/screening/management purposes during the COVID-19 impact period (CIP; 23 March 2020 to 30 September 2020). We examined potential impact in terms of: (1) diabetes control in people with diabetes and (2) detection of new diabetes and prediabetes cases. RESULTS: In April 2020, HbA1c test numbers fell by ~80%. Overall, across six centres, 369 871 tests were missed during the 6.28 months of the CIP, equivalent to >6.6 million tests nationwide. We identified 79 131 missed monitoring tests in people with diabetes. In those 28 564 people with suboptimal control, this delayed monitoring was associated with a 2C3 mmol/mol HbA1c increase. Overall, 149 455 screening and 141 285 diagnostic tests were also missed. Across the UK, our findings equate to 1.41 million missed/delayed diabetes monitoring tests (including 0.51 million in people with suboptimal control), 2.67 million screening tests in high-risk groups (0.48 million within the prediabetes range) and 2.52 million tests for diagnosis (0.21 million in the pre-diabetes range; ~70 000 in the diabetes range). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate the widespread collateral impact of implementing measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in people with, or being investigated for, diabetes. For people with diabetes, missed tests will result in further deterioration in diabetes control, especially in those whose HbA1c levels are already high.","output":"Assessment of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK HbA1c testing: implications for diabetes management and diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Yemen has been left in shambles and almost destroyed by its devastating civil war, and is now having to deal with the spread of coronavirus.

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of sotrovimab in preventing progression of mild to moderate COVID-19 to severe disease. Design: Randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study. Setting: 57 centers in 5 countries. Participants: Nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic, mild to moderate COVID-19 and at least 1 risk factor for disease progression. Intervention: Patients were randomized (1:1) to an intravenous infusion of sotrovimab 500 mg or placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with COVID-19 progression, defined as all-cause hospitalization longer than 24 hours for acute illness management or death through day 29. Key secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with COVID-19 progression, defined as emergency room visit, hospitalization of any duration, or death, and proportion of patients developing severe/critical respiratory COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. Results: Among 1057 patients randomized (sotrovimab, 528; placebo, 529), all-cause hospitalization longer than 24 hours or death was significantly reduced with sotrovimab (6/528 [1%]) vs placebo (30/529 [6%]) by 79% (95% CI, 50% to 91%; P<.001). Secondary outcome results further demonstrated the effect of sotrovimab in reducing emergency room visits, hospitalization of any duration, or death, which was reduced by 66% (95% CI, 37% to 81%; P<.001), and severe/critical respiratory COVID-19, which was reduced by 74% (95% CI, 41% to 88%; P=.002). No patients receiving sotrovimab required high-flow oxygen, oxygen via nonrebreather mask, or mechanical ventilation compared with 14 patients receiving placebo. The proportion of patients reporting adverse events was similar between treatment groups; sotrovimab was well tolerated, and no safety concerns were identified. Conclusions and Relevance: Among nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, a single 500-mg intravenous dose of sotrovimab prevented progression of COVID-19, with a reduction in hospitalization and need for supplemental oxygen.

METHODS The aim of this study was to examine the evolving changes in the technique, outcome, and new strategies in management of postoperative leaks after MIE was performed at a single institution over a two-decade period. A retrospective chart review of 75 MIE operations was performed between November 2011 and September 2018 and this was compared to the initial series of 104 MIE operations performed by the same group between 1998 and 2007. Operative technique, outcomes, and management strategies of leaks were compared. RESULTS There were 65 males (86.7%) with an average age of 61 years. The laparoscopic/thoracoscopic Ivor Lewis esophagectomy became the preferred MIE approach (49% of cases in the initial vs. 95% in the current series). Compared to the initial case series, there was no significant difference in median length of stay (8 vs. 8 days), major complications (12.5% vs. 14.7%, p = 0.68), incidence of leak (9.6% vs. 10.6%, p = 0.82), anastomotic stricture (26% vs. 32.0%, p = 0.38), or in-hospital mortality (2.9% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.47). Management of esophageal leaks has changed from primarily thoracotomy  diversion initially (50% of leak cases) to endoscopic stenting  laparoscopy/thoracoscopy currently (87.5% of leak cases). CONCLUSION In a single-institutional series of MIE over two decades, there was a shift toward a preference for the laparoscopic/thoracoscopic Ivor Lewis approach with similar outcomes.

The transcriptome and corresponding clinicopathological data of HCC patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, respectively. Molecular patterns of ferroptosis were explored using consensus clustering analysis and ferroptosis-related molecular patterns in the individual patients were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA). The ability of ferroptosis-related patterns to predict the biological status and survival outcomes of HCC patients was investigated. Based on the expression of FRGs, three molecular patterns related to ferroptosis were identified. Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) showed that the molecular patterns associated with the worst prognosis were significantly correlated with high infiltration of immunosuppressive cells in the TME. Besides, we identified three ferroptosis gene clusters underlying the different biological features of the three ferroptosis patterns. Patients in the high-risk group had a worse biological status and survival outcomes than those in the low-risk group.

Notably, there is a renewed interest in the role of local food systems from policy, academic, and third sector actors, who see those systems as a source of ?bounce-back? resilience, supporting existing structures, but also as sources of ?bounce forward? transformative resilience. Both perspectives move debates around local food systems beyond the dominant focus on social exclusion (defensive localism). The capacity of the local food sector to provide either form of resilience depends on the resilience of the local food actors themselves, which has been little investigated to date. This paper addresses this important gap in scholarship through an investigation of the ?bounce-back? and the ?bounce-forward? resilience of local food actors in the UK during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We advance resilience scholarship by developing an analytical framework which combines attention to resilience characteristics (?what is there?) and to the systemic forces which enable and constrain their development (?how things work?). Attention to social capital, we argue, is crucial to understanding transformative resilience. We present rich qualitative data to illustrate the multi-faceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on local food system actors in the UK. This is complimented with a review of relevant policy and third sector publications which contextualise local food system efforts. We conclude that while strong bonding and bridging capitals support the local food sector?s persistence and adaptability, a lack of linking social capital, most visible as a ?middle class image problem?, is preventing it from achieving a transformative role. We argue that the local food sector needs to form alliances which would move it beyond a single issue topic, and articulate local food as part of place-centred community resilience strategies that foster social capacities.","output":"Resilience and transformation: lessons from the UK local food sector in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) has already devastated the world, and the economy becomes the most critical challenge for any country worldwide.

MethodsA population-based cohort of individuals aged 15 years or over was randomly selected from the national tax register to collect socio-economic data, migration history, and living conditions in May and November 2020. Home self-sampling on dried blood was proposed to a 10% random subsample in May and to all in November. A positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG result against the virus spike protein (ELISA-S) was the primary outcome. The design, including sampling and post-stratification weights, was taken into account in univariate and multivariate analyses. ResultsOf the 134,391 participants in May, 107,759 completed the second questionnaire in November, and respectively 12,114 and 63,524 were tested. The national ELISA-S seroprevalence was 4.5% [95%CI: 4.0%-5.1%] in May and 6.2% [5.9%-6.6%] in November. It increased markedly in 18-24-year-old population from 4.8% to 10.0%, and among second-generation immigrants from outside Europe from 5.9% to 14.4%. This group remained strongly associated with seropositivity in November, after controlling for any contextual or individual variables, with an adjusted OR of 2.1 [1.7-2.7], compared to the majority population. In both periods, seroprevalence remained higher in healthcare professions than in other occupations. ConclusionThe risk of Covid-19 infection increased among young people and second-generation migrants between the first and second epidemic waves, in a context of less strict social restrictions, which seems to have reinforced territorialized socialization among peers.","output":"Trends in social exposure to SARS-Cov-2 in France.

AIM: The aim of this survey was to evaluate changes in eating habits and other lifestyle behaviours (i.e., exercise and smoking) of people of almost all ages, who live in Greece, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web-based survey using conventional sampling was conducted from during December 2020, in Greece. A total of 2258 individuals, aged 17 years and older voluntarily participated (912 (40%) men). RESULTS: 89 (3.94%) of the participants reported that they had, or currently have been diagnosed with COVID-19. Moreover, 36.4% of the participants reported that they have changed their dietary habits during the pandemic towards a healthier diet - those participants had median age of 35 years, were of both sexes, 17% had co-morbidities and 69% with higher education level; moreover, 19% of those participants have started or increased the frequency of receiving dietary supplements that enhance the immune system, 34% of the participants reported that they gained weight during the pandemic period, whereas 19.8% reported that they have lost weight, and 37% of the participants reported that they have started or increased, as compared to the pre-pandemic time, their frequency of physical activities. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19_pandemic seems to have forced people to discover again habits and traditions towards a more natural and healthier way of living. Long-term consequences and the evolution of these lifestyle changes after the COVID-19 pandemic have to be evaluated relevant to their implications in public health.","output":"How will the way we live look different in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic?

Based on the highest amount of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted by human fibroblasts grown on n-BG coatings (0-1.245 mg/cm(2)), decellularized trabecular bone samples (porosity: 43-81%) were coated with n-BG particles. Grown on n-BG particles at a coating density of 0.263 mg/cm(2), human fibroblasts produced 4.3 times more VEGF than on uncoated controls. After 8 weeks of implantation in Sprague-Dawley rats, both uncoated and n-BG-coated samples were well infiltrated with newly formed tissue (47-48%) and blood vessels (3-4%). No significant differences were found in cellularization and vascularization between uncoated bone scaffolds and n-BG-coated scaffolds. This finding indicates that the decellularized bone itself may exhibit growth-promoting properties induced by the highly interconnected pore microarchitecture and/or proteins left behind on decellularized scaffolds. Even if we did not find proangiogenic effects in n-BG-coated bone scaffolds, a bioactive coating is considered to be beneficial to impart osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties to decellularized bone. n-BG-coated bone grafts have thus high clinical potential for the regeneration of complex tissue defects given their ability for recellularization and neovascularization.","output":"Neocellularization and neovascularization of nanosized bioactive glass-coated decellularized trabecular bone scaffolds."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Molecular docking and Targeted Molecular Dynamics Simulations were conducted to elucidate binding properties of SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (nspl) onto the human ribosomal 40S complex.

Recently, cryo-electron microscope structure of both 40S and 80S ribosome purified in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nspl revealed the presence of the C-terminal region of nspl in the mRNA binding site of the 40S ribosome.

Finally, we have established the interaction and stability of this final bound state of the full nspl and 40S. The observation that C-terminal region of nspl folds into a helix-turn-helix structure to occupy the mRNA binding site in the 40S ribosome enables further inquiry into the understanding of the entire nspl structure bound to the 40S ribosome to reveal relative positioning of the two termini when nspl is bound to ribosome. ? 2021 ACM.","output":"Computational modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 binding to human ribosomal 40S complex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose After heart transplantation (HTX), regular physical activity (PA) is crucial to counteract transplant-related alterations and improve functional performance. Not much is known about the long-term implementation of PA and potential problems that may occur. The potential influence of COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. Methods Online questionnaire survey: 158 patients (5314 yrs, 65% male, 87 yrs after HTX) were included. Recruitment was carried out via HTX outpatient departments, transplant sport associations, self-aid groups and social media. The questionnaire included 77 to 138 items divided into 6 categories and 3 time points (pre heart failure, after HTX before COVID-19, after HTX during COVID-19). The survey was approved by the local ethics committee. Results 88% reported regular PA after HTX (before COVID-19) and 75% had taken up PA within the first year. Patients stated higher level of PA after HTX, compared to the pre heart failure period (p<0.05). Patients who completed cardiac rehabilitation (70%), started leisure-time PA significantly earlier (p<0.05) and with higher frequency (p<0.05). Figure 1 shows the most important motifs/barriers for regular PA and changes over the reported period. Satisfaction with sports facilities was moderate and 39% complained about the need for improvement (e.g. exercise education). 61% performed exercise training without a professional supervision. Exercise monitoring was mostly done using heart rate respond (52%), but frequently no monitoring was used (32%). During COVID-19, patients were more dissatisfied with their level of regular PA (p<0.01) or physical condition (p<0.05) and emphasized the beneficial effect of PA on their mental balance. Conclusion After HTX, most patients try to integrate regular PA in their leisure-time behavior, but complain about a lack of detailed exercise education and appropriate sports facilities.

Evidence suggests that courts in both periods relied on proportionality and equality to resolve disputes between government bans on worship services and conscientious objectors. However, the experience of multiple local governments in 1918 and other nations in 2020 models a better way.

AIMS: To identify factors associated with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in individuals with pre-existing mental illness. METHOD: Participants (N = 2869, 78% women, ages 18C94 years) from a UK cohort (the National Centre for Mental Health) with a history of mental illness completed a cross-sectional online survey in June to August 2020. Mental health assessments were the GAD-7 (anxiety), PHQ-9 (depression) and WHO-5 (well-being) questionnaires, and a self-report question on whether their mental health had changed during the pandemic. Regressions examined associations between mental health outcomes and hypothesised risk factors. Secondary analyses examined associations between specific mental health diagnoses and mental health. RESULTS: A total of 60% of participants reported that mental health had worsened during the pandemic. Younger age, difficulty accessing mental health services, low income, income affected by COVID-19, worry about COVID-19, reduced sleep and increased alcohol/drug use were associated with increased depression and anxiety symptoms and reduced well-being. Feeling socially supported by friends/family/services was associated with better mental health and well-being. Participants with a history of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or eating disorder were more likely to report that mental health had worsened during the pandemic than individuals without a history of these diagnoses.

In this study, the authors aimed to study the impact of transient and persistent acute kidney injury (pAKI) on in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Department of Medicine of the Centro Hospitalar Universitario Lisboa Norte, Lisbon, Portugal, between March 2020 and August 2020. A multivariate analysis was performed to predict AKI development and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of 544 patients with COVID-19, 330 developed AKI: 166 persistent AKI (pAKI), 164 with transient AKI. AKI patients were older, had more previous comorbidities, had higher need to be medicated with RAAS inhibitors, had higher baseline serum creatine (SCr) (1.60 mg/dL vs 0.87 mg/dL), higher NL ratio, and more severe acidemia on hospital admission, and more frequently required admission in intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor use. Patients with persistent AKI had higher SCr level (1.71 mg/dL vs 1.25 mg/dL) on hospital admission. In-hospital mortality was 14.0% and it was higher in AKI patients (18.5% vs 7.0%). CKD and serum ferritin were independent predictors of AKI. AKI did not predict mortality, but pAKI was an independent predictor of mortality, as was age and lactate level.

Limited clinical information is available on AXL expression, marker of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, in mCRC. METHODS: AXL was retrospectively assessed by immunohistochemistry in 307 patients. RAS wild-type (WT) patients (N = 136) received first-line anti-EGFR-based therapy; RAS mutant patients (N = 171) received anti-angiogenic-based regimens. Preclinical experiments were performed using human RAS WT CRC cell lines and xenograft models. AXL RNA levels were assessed in a cohort of patients with available samples at baseline and at progression to anti-EGFR treatment and in the GSE5851 dataset. RESULTS: AXL was expressed in 55/307 tumour tissues, correlating with worse survival in the overall population (AXL-positive, 23.7 months; AXL-negative, 30.8 months; HR, 1.455, P = 0.032) and in RAS WT patients (AXL-positive, 23.0 months; AXL-negative, 35.8 months; HR,1.780, P = 0.032). Progression-free survival (PFS) in the RAS WT cohort was shorter in the AXL-positive cohort (6.2 months versus 12.1 months; HR, 1.796, P = 0.013). Three-dimensional cultures obtained from a patient following anti-EGFR therapy resulted AXL-positive, showing resistance to anti-EGFR drugs and sensitivity to AXL inhibition. AXL transfection in CRC cell lines induced AXL overexpression and resistance to the EGFR blockade. At progression to cetuximab, 2/10 SW48-tumour xenograft mice showed AXL expression. Consistently, AXL RNA levels increased in 5/7 patients following anti-EGFR therapy. Moreover, in the GSE5851 dataset higher AXL RNA levels correlated with worse PFS with cetuximab in KRAS-exon2 WT chemorefractory patients.

Yet the full extent to which the population has been in contact with either virus or vaccine remains elusive, particularly on a regional level, because (a) infection counts suffer from under-reporting, and (b) the overlap between the vaccinated and recovered subpopulations is unknown. Since previous infection, vaccination, or especially a combination of both reduce the risk of severe disease, a high share of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 immunity lowers the probability of severe outbreaks that could potentially overburden the public health system once again, given that emerging variants do not escape this reduction in susceptibility. Here, we estimate the share of immunologically naive individuals by age group for each of the 16 German federal states by integrating an infectious disease model based on weekly incidences of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the national surveillance system and vaccine uptake, as well as assumptions regarding under-ascertainment. We estimate a median share of 7.0% of individuals in the German population have neither been in contact with vaccine nor any variant as of March 31, 2022 (quartile range [3.6%-9.8%]).

Approach and Results: Post-mortem lung (6 cases of COVID-19 group; 10 cases of H1N1 group and 11 cases of Control group) and myocardial samples (2 cases of COVID-19 and one control) were analyzed by conventional immunohistochemistry by using antibodies to identify molecules involving with endothelial activation (CD163, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha), Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1)) and pyroptosis (Caspase-1).

The largest predictor of safety behavior change was age; participants older than 55 were more likely to adopt recommended safety behaviors. Although knowledge and perception among the general public was reasonable, more encouragement from government via health education programs is needed to maintain appropriate behaviors.","output":"MAROCOVID: Snapshot Monitoring of Knowledge and Perceptions of Safety Behaviors during the COVID-19 Outbreak in Morocco"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients collectively made Long Covid C and cognate term long-haul Covid C in the first months of the pandemic.

To compare patient attendance in an interdisciplinary pain program (IPP) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. 2. To describe programmatic changes in response to patient needs during the pandemic. Design Cohort comparison of IPP attendance rates before versus during the pandemic. Setting Outpatient IPP (consisting of physical therapy [PT], cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], and medication management [MM]) within an academic medical center. Participants Adults diagnosed with chronic pain (N=259) who attended  1 IPP session between March 2017 and February 2020. Interventions Before COVID-19, PT, CBT, and MM delivered in-person. During COVID-19, PT and MM delivered remotely and in person; CBT delivered via telehealth to individuals and groups to allow social distance and respond to facial affect. Main Outcome Measures Objective 1. Patient attendance = attending  6 days of PT or CBT (individual and/or group). Results Objective 1. Before COVID-19, IPP attendance (from 3/20/2017 to 3/4/2020) was 76%. Since COVID-19 and through 2/2021, attendance was 65%. Objective 2: During COVID-19, PT included both telehealth and masked, in-person sessions. CBT was delivered through telehealth. IPP psychologist's role grew to promote evidence-based nonpharmacologic intervention for COVID-19 and reduce vaccination hesitation. Conclusions Overall, IPP clinicians and staff maintained safe access to interdisciplinary care for adults with chronic pain. Despite the global pandemic 65% of the patients completed the IPP. The 11% reduction in attendance may reflect increased biopsychosocial burdens experienced by patients with chronic pain during COVID-19. As chronic pain affects more Americans than diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined, future studies are needed to identify the barriers to attendance among patients before and after COVID-19. Determining how to best reduce the risk of attrition will assist patients in benefiting fully from IPP treatment.

To ensure the success of any telemedicine program, there is a need to understand the patients satisfaction and their preferences. This review aims to collate and provide evidence related to practices that may influence the performance of telemedicine for patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We searched three electronic databases for studies examining patients satisfaction and preferences for using telemedicine in type 2 diabetes. An evaluation matrix was developed to collect the data from the included articles. A total of 20 articles were identified and data on the key outcomes identified were narratively synthesized. RESULTS: Patients were generally satisfied with the use of telemedicine for management of type 2 diabetes. Users reported that telemedicine was beneficial as it provided constant monitoring, improved access to healthcare providers, and reduced waiting time. When adopting a telemedicine platform, most patients expressed preference for mobile health (mHealth) as the telemedicine modality, especially if it has been endorsed by their physician. To improve usability and sustainability, patients suggested that modules related to diabetes education be enhanced, together with sufficient technical and physician support when adopting telemedicine. Patients also expressed the importance of having a sufficiently flexible platform that could be adapted to their needs. CONCLUSION: Personalized telemedicine strategies coupled with appropriate physician endorsement greatly influences a patients decision to undertake telemedicine. Future work should focus on improving telemedicine infrastructure and increasing physicians involvement, especially during the implementation phase.","output":"Patient Preference and Satisfaction with the Use of Telemedicine for Glycemic Control in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) remain the gold standard for evaluating treatment efficacy. However, observational studies, including non-randomized cohort studies, as well as small RCTs have gained increasing attention especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic where critical evaluation of limited therapeutic options are sought to improve patient care while awaiting results for subsequent RCTs. As the authors have previously discussed, RCTs and observational studies are complementary approaches which often appear synergistic with one another. While not all real-world studies are the same, the results of observational studies are notoriously subject to both known and unknown confounding factors. The utilization of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma is a timely illustration of evaluating the efficacy and safety of a COVID-19 therapy given the dangerous and often lethal effects of the virus and the limited approved therapeutic options for the disease. While awaiting the results of large RCTS of convalescent plasma, serval observational cohorts and small RCTs have attempted to assess the efficacy and safety of this approach with very mixed results. Among the likely reasons for this failure to provide a definitive answer concerning the value of convalescent plasma are the many limitations inherent to addressing treatment efficacy in non-randomized studies. While such studies are often able to capture information on large numbers of individuals rapidly, it is important to understand that although larger numbers may enhance the precision of estimates provided, larger numbers, in and of themselves, do not increase the accuracy of estimates due to patient selection and other biases. At the same time, both observational studies and small RCTS are at risk for publication bias due to investigator, reviewer and editorial bias toward positive studies. In this commentary we discuss the advantages and limitations of these methodologic approaches when addressing urgently needed evidence on the effectiveness and safety of therapies in a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Opportunities and Challenges of Observational Studies and Randomized Controlled Trials for Evaluating the Therapeutic Efficacy of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a growing pandemic with an increasing death toll that has been linked to various comorbidities as well as racial disparity. However, the specific characteristics of these at-risk populations are still not known and approaches to lower mortality are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective electronic health record data analysis of 25,326 subjects tested for COVID-19 between 2/25/20 and 6/22/20 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, a tertiary health care center in the racially diverse Southern U.S. The primary outcome was mortality in COVID-19-positive subjects and the association with subject characteristics and comorbidities was analyzed using simple and multiple linear logistic regression. RESULTS: The odds ratio of contracting COVID-19 was disproportionately high in Blacks/African-Americans (OR 2.6; 95%CI 2.19-3.10; p<0.0001) and in subjects with obesity (OR 1.93; 95%CI 1.64-2.28; p<0.0001), hypertension (OR 2.46; 95%CI 2.07-2.93; p<0.0001), and diabetes (OR 2.11; 95%CI 1.78-2.48; p<0.0001). Diabetes was also associated with a dramatic increase in mortality (OR 3.62; 95%CI 2.11-6.2; p<0.0001) and emerged as an independent risk factor in this diverse population even after correcting for age, race, sex, obesity and hypertension. Interestingly, we found that metformin treatment was independently associated with a significant reduction in mortality in subjects with diabetes and COVID-19 (OR 0.33; 95%CI 0.13-0.84; p=0.0210). CONCLUSION: Thus, these results suggest that while diabetes is an independent risk factor for COVID-19-related mortality, this risk is dramatically reduced in subjects taking metformin, raising the possibility that metformin may provide a protective approach in this high risk population.","output":"METFORMIN USE IS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED MORTALITY IN A DIVERSE POPULATION WITH COVID-19 AND DIABETES"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Om ons heen bevinden zich een groot aantal apparaten met daarin een laser, zonder dat we dat door hebben.

Eight (8) of these patients reported with a recent history of foreign travel and one (1) with no history of foreign travel. We performed high throughput sequencing for 9 samples following the determination of high concentration of viral RNA. In addition, we estimated the potential impact that long distance transportation of samples to testing centres may have on sequencing outcomes. Here, two samples that were closest in terms of viral RNA concentration but transported from sites which are over 400km apart were assessed. All sequences were compared to previous sequences from Ghana and representative sequences from regions where our patients had previously travelled. Complete genomes were obtained for three (3) sequences and with another near complete genome with a coverage of 95.6%. Sequences with coverage in excess of 80% were found to belong to three lineages namely A, B.1 and B.2. Our sequences clustered in two different clades with the majority falling within a clade composed of sequences from sub-Saharan Africa. Less RNA fragmentation was seen in sample KATH23 which was collected 9km compared with sample TTH6 which was collected and transported over a distance of 400km to the testing site. The clustering of several sequences from sub-Saharan Africa suggests regional circulation of the viruses in the subregion.

Yet, there is limited information on the status of prenatal care in women with high-risk pregnancies. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of women with high-risk pregnancies who were receiving prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The present qualitative study was conducted on mothers with high-risk pregnancies from September 2020 to March 2021. Purposeful sampling continued until achieving data saturation. Ghaem, Ommolbanin, and Imam Reza in Mashhad, Iran served as the research environment. Face-to-face and semi-structured interviews were effective data collection methods. Each interview lasted between 20 to 45 min (on average 30). The total number of participants was 31. Data analysis was carried out simultaneously with data collection using the qualitative content analysis method developed by Granheim and Landman (2004). RESULTS: Following the reduction and analysis of data from women in high-risk pregnancies, as well as their perceptions and experiences with health services during the COVID-19 pandemic, eight subcategories and three main categories were identified, including 1) Negative psychology responses, 2) Adoption behavior, and 3) Adjustment of health services in mutual protection. Fear, anxiety, stress, feelings of loneliness, sadness, depression, guilt, doubt and conflict in receiving services were examples of negative psychological responses. The adaptive behaviors category reflected the behaviors of women with high-risk pregnancies in the context of the COVID COVID-19 pandemic. The Adjustment of health services in mutual protection indicated that health workers took preventive and protective measures against COVID-19, which, in addition to protecting themselves and their clients against COVID-19, gave women a sense of security. CONCLUSION: Receiving prenatal care during the COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges for women with high-risk pregnancies, negatively impacting their psychological state and health-seeking behavior.

The protocol for this systematic review is registered at the PROSPERO database (CRD42020197938). The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-Bias tool and relevant data were extracted though a customized data collection form, independently, by two authors. The IRR of AE was estimated using a random-effect model meta-analysis and heterogeneity was evaluated by T2 and I2. Subgroup analysis was performed, and publication bias was assessed by funnel-plot. RESULTS Forty-six RCTs met our eligibility criteria and were included in our analysis (23132 patients). There was not a single death attributed to chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine use in the included RCTs. The IRR of general AE during antimalarial use was 1.15 [CI 95% 1.01-1.31].

METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLCCMS) and network pharmacology analysis were performed to identify the active ingredients and potential targets of BSTJF. Moreover, PCOS model rats were used to validate the role of BSTJF in reproduction and progeny neural development and to confirm the network pharmacological targets. RESULTS: A total of 91 constituents were characterized from BSTJF. The 20 most significant KEGG pathways and the high-frequency genes of these pathways were predicted to be putative targets of these molecules. The rat experiment showed that the downregulation of FOS protein expression in the ovarian granulosa cells of the PCOS group was reversed by BSTJF. The target residence time of the 5-week-old female offspring of the BSTJF group was higher than that of the PCOS group in the water maze experiment. Compared to the PCOS group, the changes in dendritic spine density, ultrastructure of neurons and synapses, and Gabrb1 and Grin2b protein expression levels in the hippocampus of female offspring were partially reversed in the BSTJF group.

Ride-hailing, bike-sharing, e-scooters, and other types of shared mobility continue to grow worldwide. Among these services is microtransit, a new transport mode that extends transit coverage within a region. Mobile devices enable microtransit services, aggregating riders and using real-time routing algorithms to group customers traveling in similar directions. Meanwhile, the newly emerged coronavirus, COVID-19, has radically reshaped the ridership behavior of all transit services, including microtransit. While existing research evaluates the performance of microtransit pilot programs before the pandemic, there is no information concerning the spatio-temporal pattern of microtransit activities under the impact of COVID-19. The purpose of this paper is to apply eigendecomposition and k-clique percolation methods to uncover the spatio-temporal patterns of microtransit trips. Further, we used these approaches to identify underlying communities using data from a pilot program in Salt Lake City, Utah. The resulting research offers insight into how COVID-19 altered travel behavior. Specifically, eigendecomposition delineated the homogeneity and heterogeneity of travel patterns across temporal dimensions. We identified first mile/last mile trips as a major source of variance in both pre- and post-COVID periods and that transit-dependent users prove to be inelastic despite the threat of COVID-19. The k-clique percolation method detected possible community formations and tracked how these communities evolved during the pandemic. In addition, we systematically analyzed overlapping communities and the network structure around shared nodes by using a clustering coefficient. The workflow developed in this research broadly is generalizable and valuable for understanding the unique spatio-temporal patterns of microtransit.

Estimating the magnitude of pathogen-pathogen interactions from clinical specimens is challenging because sampling from symptomatic individuals can create biased estimates. METHODS: We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study using samples collected by the Seattle Flu Study between 11 November 2018 and 20 August 2021. Samples that tested positive via RT-qPCR for at least one of 17 potential respiratory pathogens were included in this study. Semi-quantitative cycle threshold (Ct) values were used to measure pathogen load. Differences in pathogen load between monoinfected and coinfected samples were assessed using linear regression adjusting for age, season, and recruitment channel. RESULTS: 21,686 samples were positive for at least one potential pathogen. Most prevalent were rhinovirus (335%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPn, 290%), SARS-CoV-2 (13.8%) and influenza A/H1N1 (96%). 140 potential pathogen pairs were included for analysis, and 56 (40%) pairs yielded significant Ct differences (p < 0.01) between monoinfected and co-infected samples. We observed no virus-virus pairs showing evidence of significant facilitating interactions, and found significant viral load decrease among 37 of 108 (34%) assessed pairs. Samples positive with SPn and a virus were consistently associated with increased SPn load. CONCLUSIONS: Viral load data can be used to overcome sampling bias in studies of pathogen-pathogen interactions. When applied to respiratory pathogens, we found evidence of viral-SPn facilitation and several examples of viral-viral interference.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in the number of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in intensive care units worldwide. When the lungs are damaged, coagulation disorders are mediated by tissue factor (TF) - factor VIIa (F VIIa), and inhibition of this pathway completely eliminates intrapulmonary fibrin deposition. A tissue factor pathway inhibitor TFPI also contributes to pulmonary coagulationdisturbance in ARDS. Pulmonary coagulationdisturbance caused by pneumonia can worsen the damage to the lungs and thus contribute to the progression of the disease. Cytokines are the main linking factors between inflammation and changes in blood clotting and fibrinolysis. The sources of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs are probably alveolar macrophages. The activation of alveolar macrophages occurs through the nuclear factor kappa-bi (NF-&#954;B), which controls thetranscription of the expression of immune response genes, cell apoptosis, which leads to the development of inflammation and autoimmune diseases as a result of direct stimulation of TF activation. Conversely,coagulation itself can affect bronchoalveolar inflammation. Coagulation leads to the formation of proteases that interact with specific cellular receptors, activating intracellular signaling pathways. The use of anticoagulant therapy, which also has an anti-inflammatory effect, perhaps one of the therapeutic targets for coronavirus infection.The difficulty here is that it seems appropriate to study anticoagulant interventions' influence on clinically significant cardio-respiratory parameters.","output":"Role of lungs in the hemostasis system (review of literature)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Industry 4.0 is expected to impart profound changes to the configuration of manufacturing companies with regards to what their value proposition will be and how their production network, supplier base and customer interfaces will develop. The literature on the topic is still fragmented; the features of the emerging paradigm appear to be a contested territory among different academic disciplines. This study assumes a value chain perspective to analyze the evolutionary trajectories of manufacturing companies. We developed a Delphi-based scenario analysis involving 76 experts from academia and practice. The results highlight the most common expectations as well as controversial issues in terms of emerging business models, size, barriers to entry, vertical integration, rent distribution, and geographical location of activities. Eight scenarios provide a concise outlook on the range of possible futures. These scenarios are based on four main drivers which stem from the experts comments: demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products. Researchers can derive from our study a series of hypotheses and opportunities for future research on Industry 4.0.

We considered four effects: $K-$corrections, time-dilation, the apparent change of host dust extinction due to non-comoving reference frames, and the change of observed color due to redshift. Extinction-dependent $K-$corrections were computed using stellar atmosphere models applicable to giant stars for $0.005<z<0.03$ in HST, JWST, and 2MASS filters. The optical-NIR Wesenheit function advantageously combines filters with oppositely signed $K-$corrections and avoids complications due to host extinction. For TRGB stars, the JWST/NIRCAM F277W filter combines insensitivity to reddening with $K-$corrections $<1$% at Coma cluster distances. Missing corrections for host extinction due to circumgalactic or circumstellar material are discussed as potential systematics for TRGB distances although their impacts are insufficient to explain differences between $H_0$ based on Cepheid or TRGB supernova calibrations. All stellar standard candles require relativistic corrections to achieve an unbiased 1% $H_0$ measurement in the future.

However, conventional learning (CL) has cost, time, and space constraints. This study aimed to evaluate whether laypersons who completed instructor-led distance learning (DL) acquired a level of CPR skill comparable to that achieved via CL training. METHODS: This randomized controlled study recruited students from 28 Korean high schools who were randomized to complete instructor-led DL or CL training. The CL training involved classroom-based face-to-face training, whereas the instructor-led DL training was provided online using a videoconferencing system. RESULTS: The study enrolled 62 students who were randomized to the CL group (31 participants) or the DL group (31 participants). Relative to the CL group, the DL group achieved remarkably similar results in terms of most CPR variables. In addition, the DL group had a significant improvement in the mean compression depth (before: 46 mm [interquartile range: 37-52 mm] vs. after: 49 mm [interquartile range: 46-54 mm], p<0.001).

METHODS: Human conjunctiva and primary pterygium tissues were collected from pterygium patients who underwent surgery. The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes was determined in human primary conjunctival and pterygium cells, human ocular and other tissue cell lines, mesenchymal stem cells as well as mouse ocular and other tissues by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and SYBR green PCR. RESULTS: RT-PCR analysis showed consistent expression by 2 ACE2 gene primers in 2 out of 3 human conjunctival cells and pterygium cell lines. Expression by 2 TMPRSS2 gene primers could only be found in 1 out of 3 pterygium cell lines, but not in any conjunctival cells. Compared with the lung A549 cells, similar expression was noted in conjunctival and pterygium cells. In addition, mouse cornea had comparable expression of Tmprss2 gene and lower but prominent Ace2 gene expression compared with the lung tissue. CONCLUSION: Considering the necessity of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection, our results suggest that conjunctiva would be less likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, whereas pterygium possesses some possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with disordered inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that reduced plasma RNLS levels could be a marker of COVID-19 disease severity. Methods: Plasma was collected from 51 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 15 uninfected non-hospitalized controls. Plasma RNLS and cytokine levels were measured and sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from chart review. Data were analyzed using nonparametric analyses and Kaplan Meir curve log rank analysis. Results: Plasma RNLs levels were negatively correlated with inflammatory markers, including IL-1b, IL-6, and TNFa (p = 0.04, p = 0.03, p = 0.01, respectively). Patients with COVID-19 disease had lower levels of RNLS than controls. Lower levels of RNLS were associated with more severe disease among COVID-19 patients. Low RNLS was also associated with worse survival among COVID-19 patients (HR = 4.54; 95% CI: 1.06-19.43; p = 0.005). Conclusion: Low plasma RNLS levels are associated with severe COVID-19 disease and may be a useful additional biomarker when identifying patients with severe COVID-19 disease.

New geochronologic studies have further constrained the ages of the fossil-bearing beds, and recent investigations on Early Cretaceous tectonic settings have provided much new information for understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of the biota and dispersal pattern of its members. Notably, the occurrence of the Jehol Biota coincides with the initial and peak stages of the North China craton destruction in the Early Cretaceous, and thus the biotic evolution is related to the North China craton destruction. However, it remains largely unknown how the tectonic activities impacted the development of the Jehol Biota in northeast China and other contemporaneous biotas in neighboring areas in East and Central Asia. It is proposed that the Early Cretaceous rift basins migrated eastward in the northern margin of the North China craton and the Great Xing'an Range, and the migration is regarded to have resulted from eastward retreat of the subducting paleo-Pacific plate. The diachronous development of the rift basins led to the lateral variations of stratigraphic sequences and depositional environments, which in turn influenced the spatiotemporal evolution of the Jehol Biota. This study represents an effort to explore the linkage between terrestrial biota evolution and regional tectonics and how plate tectonics constrained the evolution of a terrestrial biota through various surface geological processes.","output":"Spatiotemporal evolution of the Jehol Biota: Responses to the North China craton destruction in the Early Cretaceous."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with high incidence of venous and arterial thromboembolic events.

Despite this, the worldwide mortality rate from asthma has been noted to be low at an average of 2.0 per 100,000 people in developed countries such as the United States. Risk factors for fatal asthma attacks that have been described include excessive use of short acting beta-agonists, errors in clinical judgement, poor compliance, psychosocial disorders, use of three or more groups of asthma medication and indicators of asthma severity. AIM We aim to study the incidence of asthma deaths occurring in the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital in Singapore. METHODS Of the total number of patients at the Department of Emergency Medicine in Singapore General Hospital from January 1999 to June 2005, eight fatalities were attributed to exacerbation of bronchial asthma.

We aimed to determine the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on outcome of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and to compare the performance of different prognostic models for predicting mortality. PATIENTS: We performed a prospective cohort study including 2211 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from April 15, 2020 through October 1, 2020 in 38 Hospitals from 11 Latin American countries. We registered clinical and laboratory parameters of patients with and without cirrhosis. All patients were followed until discharge or death. We evaluated the prognostic performance of different scoring systems to predict mortality in patients with cirrhosis using ROC curves. RESULTS: Overall, 4.6%(CI 3.7-5.6) subjects had cirrhosis (n = 96). Baseline Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class was assessed: CTP-A (23%), CTP-B (45%) and CTP-C (32%); median MELD-Na score was 19 (IQR 14-25). Mortality was 47% in patients with cirrhosis and 16% in patients without cirrhosis (P < .0001). Cirrhosis was independently associated with death [OR 3.1(CI 1.9-4.8); P < .0001], adjusted by age, gender, and body mass index >30. The areas under the ROC curves for performance evaluation in predicting 28-days mortality for Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C), North American Consortium for the Study of End-Stage Liver Disease (NACSELD), CTP score and MELD-Na were 0.85, 0.75, 0.69, 0.67; respectively (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with elevated mortality in patients with cirrhosis.

In many cases this includes seeing patients through electronic means such as telehealth or telephone rather than seeing them in person. Asthma exacerbations cannot always be treated in this way. Problem: Current emergency unit asthma guidelines recommend bronchodilators be administered by metered dose inhaler (MDI) and spacer for mild-moderate asthma and include it as a choice even in severe asthma, but many emergency units continue to prefer nebulised therapy for patients who urgently require beta-agonists. The utilization of nebulised therapy potentially increases the risk of aerosolization of the coronavirus. Since nosocomial transmission of respiratory pathogens is a major threat in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, use of nebulised therapy is of even greater concern due to the potential increased risk of infection spread to nearby patients and health-care workers. Practical implications: We propose a risk stratification plan that aims to avoid nebulised therapy, when possible, by providing an algorithm to help better delineate those who require nebulised therapy. Protocols that include strategies to allow flexibility in using MDIs rather than nebulisers in all but the most severe patients should help mitigate this risk of aerosolised infection transmission to patients and health care providers. Furthermore, expedient treatment of patients with high dose MDI therapy augmented with more rapid initiation of systemic therapy may help ensure patients are less likely to deteriorate to the stage where nebulisers are required.","output":"Acute asthma management during SARS-CoV2-pandemic 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma represents a significant proportion of global surgical disease burden, disproportionally affecting low- and middle-income countries where care is often delayed. We investigated risk factors for delays to care for patients with CMF trauma presenting to the highest-volume trauma hospital in Rwanda and the impact on complication rates. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective cohort study comprised all patients with CMF trauma presenting to the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali, Rwanda, between June 1 and October 1, 2020. SETTING: Urban referral center in resource-limited setting. METHODS: Epidemiologic data were collected, and logistic regression analysis was undertaken to explore risk factors for delays in care and complications. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (94.4% men) met criteria for inclusion. The mean age was 30 years. A majority of patients presented from a rural setting (n = 34, 63%); the most common cause of trauma was motor vehicle accident (n = 18, 33%); and the most common injury was mandibular fracture (n = 28, 35%). An overall 78% of patients had delayed treatment of the fracture after arrival to the hospital, and 81% of these patients experienced a complication (n = 34, P = .03). Delay in treatment was associated with 4-times greater likelihood of complication (odds ratio, 4.25 [95% CI, 1.08-16.70]; P = .038). CONCLUSION: Delay in treatment of CMF traumatic injuries correlates with higher rates of complications. Delays most commonly resulted from a lack of surgeon and/or operating room availability or were related to transfers from rural districts. Expansion of the CMF trauma surgical workforce, increased operative capacity, and coordinated transfer care efforts may improve trauma care.","output":"Effect of Delay of Care for Patients with Craniomaxillofacial Trauma in Rwanda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many reports showed a dramatic decrease in the levels of physical activity during the current pandemic of SARS-COV-2.

The near total shutdown of rail, road, and air traffic as well as total closure of most of the business establishments and IT industry, especially during the first phase of the LD, is found to dramatically reduce black carbon (BC) abundance. Within one week of the first week of the LD phase 1 (LD1), the ambient BC concentration at the urban centre came down to levels comparable to those reported for remote rural locations, primarily due to &gt;60% reduction in BC from fossil fuel (BCff) emissions. On the other hand, BC from biomass burning (BCwb) did not show any conspicuous impact. Consequently, the fraction of BCwb to BC more than doubled and the spectral absorption coefficient increased from ~1.15 to ~1.4. The single scattering albedo increased from its prevailing mean value 0.66 before LD to 0.74 during LD1 and then gradually decreased to 0.68 with increasing relaxations on vehicular traffic. The results reveal the unequivocal role of vehicular emissions in impacting the aerosol loading and their optical properties over Bengaluru. The study also shows how the environment responded to the gradual relaxations in the subsequent phases of LD. It is interesting to note that a few spells of strong rainfall towards the fourth phase of the LD impacted the aerosols non-selectively leading to sharp decrease in all the quantities. However, owing to the non-selective nature of the washout this large reduction in loading did not impact the single scattering albedo, unlike the case with the LD.","output":"Impact of lockdown-related reduction in anthropogenic emissions on aerosol characteristics in the megacity, Bengaluru.

METHODS: An online survey was distributed through social media (8(th) April 2020, onwards). Fortnightly follow up surveys were emailed to participants. The primary outcome measure was weekly unit consumption and data was collected on a range of potentially related factors: demographics, factors relating to COVID-19 (e.g., health, work status), drinking motives, context of drinking, drinking intentions, mood, depression and anxiety. FINDINGS: A total of 539 self-selected participants completed the baseline survey, with 186 completing at least 3 follow up surveys for multilevel modelling analysis. Personal coping motives, anxiety, drinking at home alone, and drinking at home with others were positively associated with alcohol consumption during lockdown. The following baseline measures also predicted increased consumption: male gender, lower education, and higher AUDIT scores (based on behavior prior to lockdown). Findings were consistent when utilizing an inverse probability weight to account for predictors of attrition (female, younger age, higher baseline AUDIT scores). CONCLUSIONS: Those already drinking at hazardous levels were more likely to increase their consumption, as were those who were drinking to cope.

While a few studies in the literature discuss the choice of delivery in remote areas of minority ethnic groups; our work aims to identify factors that indicated their delivery place, at home or in the health facilities. METHODS: A community-based qualitative study was conducted between February and March 2020. Three types of interviews were implemented, In-depth interviews with 16 women of eight rural villages who delivered in the last 12 months in Xepon District, Savannakhet Province, Lao PDR. Also, three focus group discussions (FGDs) with nine HCPs and key-informant interviews of ten VHVs were managed. Factors affecting the choice of the delivery place were categorized according to the social-ecological model. RESULTS: Our sample included five Tri women and two Mangkong women in the HD group, while the FD group included three Tri women, two Mangkong women, one Phoutai woman, two Laolung women and one Vietnamese. Our investigation inside the targeted minority showed that both positive perceptions of home delivery (HD) and low-risk perception minorities were the main reasons for the choice of HD, on the individual level. On the other hand, fear of complication, the experience of stillbirth, and prolonged labour pain during HD were reasons for facility-based delivery (FD). Notably, the women in our minority reported no link between their preference and their language, while the HCPs dated the low knowledge to the language barrier. On the interpersonal level, the FD women had better communication with their families, and better preparation for delivery compared to the HD group. The FD family prepared cash and transportation using their social network. At the community level, the trend of the delivery place had shifted from HD to FD. Improved accessibility and increased knowledge through community health education were the factors of the trend. At the societal (national policy) level, the free delivery policy and limitation of HCPs assisted childbirth only in health facilities were the factors of increasing FD, while the absence of other incentives like transportation and food allowance was the factor of remaining of HD. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the main findings of this study, we urge the enhancement of family communication on birth preparedness and birthplace. Furthermore, our findings support the need to educate mothers, especially those of younger ages, about their best options regarding the place of delivery. We propose implementing secondary services of HD to minimize the emergency risks of HD.

The neurodevelopmental defects associated with ZikV infections early in pregnancy are well documented, however the potential defects associated with infections in late pregnancy and perinatal period are less well characterized. Further, the long-term sequelae of these infections are not fully understood. Immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice infected at one day old (P1), which neurodevelopmentally model late pregnancy in humans, develop a transient neurological syndrome including unsteady gait, kinetic tremors, severe ataxia and seizures 10-15 days post-infection (dpi) but symptoms subside after a week, and most animals survive. Despite apparent recovery, MRI of convalescent mice shows reduced cerebellar volume that correlates with altered coordination and motor function as well as hyperactivity and impulsivity. Persistent mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes including Cd80, Il-1, and Ifn- together with Cd3, Cd8 and perforin (PrfA), suggested the persistence of a low-grade inflammatory process. Further, the brain parenchyma of convalescent mice harbor multiple small foci with viral antigen, active apoptotic processes in neurons, and cellular infiltrates, surrounded by activated astrocytes and microglia as late as 1-year post-infection. Detection of negative-sense strand viral RNA and replication of virus derived from these convalescent mice by blinded passage in Vero cells confirmed that low levels of live ZikV persist in CNS of convalescent mice life-long. Our studies establish that Zika can establish reservoirs in CNS and suggest that anti-viral treatment that clears virus from the CNS as well as long-term neurological and behavioral monitoring may be needed for patients known to be exposed to ZikV at an early age.

Using a non-lethal neonatal mouse model, we examine host-pathogen interactions, anatomical changes and behavioral patterns by following survivors of the acute infection for over 1 year. We discover that infectious Zika virus has the potential to remain in the CNS for life, lodged within small foci surrounded by gliosis and infiltrating immune cells that may act to limit the viral spread, but also interfere with healing and contribute to life-long neuropathic and behavioral sequelae. These results suggest that anti-viral treatment and long-term neurological and behavioral monitoring may be indicated for patients known to have been exposed to Zika virus, regardless of neurodevelopmental disease severity.","output":"Life-long persistence of infectious Zika virus: inflammation and behavioral sequela"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Respiratory tract infection is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization among adults, and recent evidence suggests that many of these illnesses are associated with viruses. Although bacterial infection is known to complicate viral infections, the frequency and impact of mixed viral-bacterial infections has not been well studied. Methods. Adults hospitalized with respiratory illness during 3 winters underwent comprehensive viral and bacterial testing. This assessment was augmented by measuring the serum level of procalcitonin (PCT) as a marker of bacterial infection. Mixed viral-bacterial infection was defined as a positive viral test result plus a positive bacterial assay result or a serum PCT level of  0.25 ng/mL on admission or day 2 of hospitalization. Results. Of 842 hospitalizations (771 patients) evaluated, 348 (41%) had evidence of viral infection. A total of 212 hospitalizations (61%) involved patients with viral infection alone. Of the remaining 136 hospitalizations (39%) involving viral infection, results of bacterial tests were positive in 64 (18%), and PCT analysis identified bacterial infection in an additional 72 (21%). Subjects hospitalized with mixed viral-bacterial infections were older and more commonly received a diagnosis of pneumonia. Over 90% of hospitalizations in both groups involved subjects who received antibiotics.

The virus may remain dormant in the central nervous system but then becomes activated in adulthood. All existing models of MS are characterized by inflammation or demyelination that follows days after virus infection or antigen inoculation. While investigating the role of CD4+ T cell responses following Theiler's virus infection in mice deficient in STAT4 or STAT6, we discovered a model in which virus infection was followed by demyelination after a very prolonged incubation period. STAT4-/- mice were resistant to demyelination for 180 days after infection, but developed severe demyelination after this time point. Inflammatory cells and up-regulation of Class I and Class II MHC antigens characterized these lesions. Virus antigen was partially controlled during the early chronic phase of the infection even though viral RNA levels remained high throughout infection. Demyelination correlated with the appearance of virus antigen expression. Bone marrow reconstitution experiments indicated that the mechanism of the late onset demyelination was the result of the STAT4-/- immune system. Thus, virus infection of STAT4-/- mice results in a model that may allow for dissection of the immune events predisposing to late-onset demyelination in MS.","output":"STAT4- and STAT6-signaling molecules in a murine model of multiple sclerosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December 2019, reports from China of the incidence of pneumonia with unknown etiology were sent to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Setting: The study was conducted at our Outpatient Neurorehabilitation Service. Subjects: All rehabilitation professionals, adult patients, and children's caregivers who accepted telerehabilitation were recruited. Interventions: Participants had to respond to the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 and to a purpose-built questionnaire on their perception and satisfaction of the service provided. Main Measures: Data were analyzed by qualitative statistics and logistic regression models. Results: All 144 caregivers, 25 adult patients, and 50 professionals reported a medium-high level of perception and a high level of satisfaction. Results showed a correlation among caregivers of children aged 0C3 and feeling overwhelmed with remote care (OR = 3.27), a low perception of telerehabilitation for enhancing goals (OR = 6.51), and a high perception of feeling helped in organizing daily activity (OR = 2.96). For caregivers of children aged over 6 years, changes in the therapy plan were related to a low perception of feeling in line with the in-person therapy (OR = 2.61 and OR = 9.61) and a low satisfaction (OR = 5.54 and OR = 4.97). Changes in therapy were related to concern (OR = 4.20). Caregivers under 40 and professionals showed a high probability to perceive telerehabilitation as supportive (OR = 2.27 and OR = 5.68).

Results: Multivariate logistic regression showed that chest tightness, lymphocyte count, and {gamma}-glutamyl transpeptidase were the independent predictors for severe COVID-19. The T cell, CD4+ T cell and B cell counts in severe patients were significantly lower than that in mild patients (p = 0.004, 0.003 and 0.046, respectively). Only the T cell count was gradually decreased with the increase of infiltrated quadrants of lesions in computed tomography (CT) (p = 0.043).

Parosmias are the main qualitative dysosmia associated with olfaction recovery. No treatment is, to date, significantly efficient on PPVOD except olfactory training (OT). The main objective of this work was to evaluate OT efficiency on post-COVID-19 PPVOD. Methods - Consecutive patients consulting to the ENT department with post-COVID-19 PPVOD were included after mainly clinical examination, the complete Sniffin Stick Test (TDI), the short version of the Questionnaire of olfactory disorders and the SF-36. Patients were trained to practice a self-olfactory training (professional manufactured olfactory training kit) twice a day for 6 months before coming back and undergo the same complete evaluation. Results - Forty-three patients were included and performed 3,5 months of OT in average. There was a significant improvement in the mean TDI score increasing from 24,7 (+/-8,9) before the OT to 30,9 (+/- 9,8) (p<0,001). Parosmias increased significantly from 8 (18,6%) to 27 (62.8%) (p<0,001).

Accumulating evidence indicates that a profound disturbance of endothelial homeostasis contributes to these conditions. Furthermore, the pulmonary infiltration and edema, and later pulmonary fibrosis, in patients with COVID-19 is promoted by endothelial alterations including the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules and chemokines, increased intercellular permeability, and endothelial-to-mesenchyme transitions. The cognitive disturbance occurring in this disease may also be due in part to an impairment of the blood-brain barrier. Venous thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism are most likely associated with an endothelial defect caused by circulating inflammatory cytokines and/or direct endothelial invasion by the virus.

METHODS: This analysis combined HCV-related laboratory data and patient characteristics from two, large US laboratory datasets that included individuals tested for HCV antibody (Ab) and HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load between January 2015 and December 2019. A decline in sequential HCV RNA viral loads was used to impute HCV treatment. Machine-learning algorithms were used to identify cured patients. The actual number of individuals with HCV Ab screening, and the number and percentage of persons who were HCV RNA-positive and treated, were calculated. RESULTS: The number of persons in Florida diagnosed as HCV RNA-positive was 31,659 in 2019. The number of individuals HCV Ab screened in 2019 was 1,024,379, an increase of 82.5% from 2015.

The LCA results show that the stretchable cardiac monitoring device has better environmental performance in all eighteen impact categories. This research also shows that the manufacturing process of stretchable electronics has lower environmental impacts than those for rigid electronics. The main reasons for the improved environmental performance of stretchable electronics are lower consumption of raw material as well as decreased energy consumption during manufacturing.

Background: All healthcare staff use full PPE in the care of COVID-19 patients. There are problems, such as excessive sweating, which have not been quantified thus far. Methods: A descriptive pilot design was used in a simulated high-fidelity setting. There was paired activity, with mildCmoderate physical activity, between 45 and 60 min continuously, with the COVID-19 PPE. Sixteen intensive care nurses were selected. The beforeCafter differential of weight, thirst, weight use of the PPE, body temperature, thermal body image, general and facial warmth sensation, and perspiration sensation were measured. Results: All subjects lost weight in the form of sweat with both PPEs during the simulation scenario, with a mean of 200 g (0.28% of initial weight), and increased thirst sensation. Body thermal image increased by 0.54 C in people using the full COVID-19 PPE.

Globally understanding the humoral immunity in asymptomatic carriers will provide scientific knowledge for developing serological tests, improving early identification, and implementing more rational control strategies against the pandemic. MEASURE: Utilizing both NAT and commercial kits for serum IgM and IgG antibodies, we extensively screened 11 766 epidemiologically suspected individuals on enrollment and 63 asymptomatic individuals were detected and recruited. Sixty-three healthy individuals and 51 mild patients without any preexisting conditions were set as controls. Serum IgM and IgG profiles were further probed using a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray, and neutralizing antibody was detected by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay system. The dynamics of antibodies were analyzed with exposure time or symptoms onset. RESULTS: A combination test of NAT and serological testing for IgM antibody discovered 55.5% of the total of 63 asymptomatic infections, which significantly raises the detection sensitivity when compared with the NAT alone (19%). Serum proteome microarray analysis demonstrated that asymptomatics mainly produced IgM and IgG antibodies against S1 and N proteins out of 20 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Different from strong and persistent N-specific antibodies, S1-specific IgM responses, which evolved in asymptomatic individuals as early as the seventh day after exposure, peaked on days from 17 days to 25 days, and then disappeared in two months, might be used as an early diagnostic biomarker. 11.8% (6/51) mild patients and 38.1% (24/63) asymptomatic individuals did not produce neutralizing antibody. In particular, neutralizing antibody in asymptomatics gradually vanished in two months. CONCLUSION: Our findings might have important implications for the definition of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections, diagnosis, serological survey, public health, and immunization strategies.","output":"Antibody dynamics to SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic COVID-19 infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We have summarized the incidence, anticoagulation panels, laboratory characteristics, and mortality of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: After systematically searching PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 retrospective, 6 prospective observational, and 2 cross-sectional studies was performed according to the guidelines of the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) statement. RESULTS: Overall, 4382 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included. Men accounted for significantly more patients than did women (odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-2.02; P < .001). The total incidence of VTE among the patients with COVID-19 was 28.3% (95% CI, 21.6%-35.4%), with an incidence of 38.0% (95% CI, 29.1%-47.4%) and 17.2% (95% CI, 11.4%-23.8%) among those with severe and general COVID-19, respectively. The total incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities was 18.3% (95% CI, 10.8%-27.2%). The incidence of DVT was 22.1% (95% CI, 11.0%-35.5%) and 12.8% (95% CI, 5.0%-23.3%) in those with severe and general COVID-19, respectively. The total incidence of pulmonary embolism was 17.6% (95% CI, 12.3%-23.5%), with a rate of 21.7% (95% CI, 14.8%-29.3%) in severe cases and 12.5% (95% CI, 6.1%-23.5%) in general cases. When COVID-19 severity was unclassified, the mortality for the patients with VTE was not significantly greater (25.2%; 95% CI, 12.2%-40.5%) than that for those without VTE (10.2%; 95% CI, 3.4%-19.5%; OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.46-7.64; P = .377). However, among the patients with severe COVID-19, those who had developed VTE had significantly greater mortality compared with those without VTE (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.15-3.53; P = .014). The patients with COVID-19 and VTE had significantly higher D-dimer levels than did similar patients without VTE in multiple studies. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of VTE, DVT, and pulmonary embolism has been substantial among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially among those with severe COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 and VTE had significantly greater mortality compared with similar patients without VTE. An increased D-dimer level might be an indicator of the occurrence of VTE in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Incidence, prognosis, and laboratory indicators of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are completely dependent on their host cells for the successful production of progeny viruses.

Restoring patient trust in a medical setting in Poland appears to be significantly affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient trust improves results from medical treatment, raises perception of healthcare performance, and smoothens the overall functionality of healthcare systems. METHODS: In order to study trust volatility, patients took part in a three-stage experiment designed via: (1) measured level of trust, (2) randomly dividing participants into two groupscontrol (i.e., re-examination of level of trust) and experimental (i.e., being exposed to a piece of certain manipulative information), and (3) checking whether observational changes were permanent. RESULTS: Results indicate that in the experimental group the increase of trust was noticed in the payer (27.7%, p < 0.001), hospitals (10.9%, p = 0.011), and physicians (decrease of 9.2%, p = 0.036).

Using an online survey, we sampled 7770 individuals across 10 US states from December 4C18, 2020, about 8C22 days post-Thanksgiving. Participants were asked about Thanksgiving, COVID-19 symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 testing and positivity in the prior 2 weeks. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 symptoms in the weeks following Thanksgiving. An activity score measured the total number of non-essential activities an individual participated in the prior 2 weeks. The probability of community transmission was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. While 47.2% had Thanksgiving at home with household members, 26.9% had guests and 25.9% traveled. There was a statistically significant interaction between how people spent Thanksgiving, the frequency of activities, and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in the prior 2 weeks (p < 0.05). Those who had guests for Thanksgiving or traveled were only more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 if they also had high activity (e.g., participated in > one non-essential activity/day in the prior 2 weeks). Had individuals limited the number and frequency of activities post-Thanksgiving, cases in surveyed individuals would be reduced by > 50%. As travel continues to increase and the more contagious Delta variant starts to dominate transmission, it is critical to promote how to gather in a low-risk manner (e.g., minimize other non-essential activities) to mitigate the need for nationwide shelter-at-home orders.","output":"Holiday gatherings, mobility and SARS-CoV-2 transmission: results from 10 US states following Thanksgiving"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Purpose Black physicians remain disproportionately underrepresented in certain medical specialties, yet comprehensive assessments in Radiation Oncology (RO) are lacking. Our purpose was to report current and historical representation trends for Black physicians in the US RO workforce. Methods Public registries were used to assess significant differences in 2016 representation for US vs RO Black academic full-time faculty, residents, and applicants. Historical changes from 1970-2016 were reported descriptively. Linear regression was used to assess significant changes for Black residents and faculty from 1995-2016. Results In 2016, Blacks represented 3.2% vs 1.5% (P<0.001), 5.6% vs 3.2% (P=0.005), and 6.5% vs 5.4% (P=0.352), of US vs RO faculty, residents, and applicants, respectively. While RO residents nearly doubled from 374 (1974) to 720 (2016), Black residents peaked at 31 in 1984 (5.9%; 31/522) and fell to 23 (3.2%; 23/720) in 2016 across 91 accredited programs; Black US GME trainees nearly doubled over the same time period: 3,506 (1984) to 6,905 (2016). Between 1995-2016, Black US resident representation significantly increased 0.03%/yr, but decreased significantly in RO -0.20%/yr before 2006 and did not change significantly thereafter. Over the same time period, Black US faculty representation significantly increased 0.02%/yr, while Black RO faculty significantly increased 0.07%/yr before 2006, then decreased significantly -0.16%/yr thereafter. The number of Black RO faculty peaked at 37 in 2006 (3.1%; 37/1203) and was 27 (1.5%; 27/1769) in 2016, despite the nearly 1.5-fold increase in the number of both RO faculty and Black US faculty overall (4,169 in 2006 and 6,047 in 2016) during that time period.

As the liver is a major target organ of Lassa virus, gene expression in Lassa virus-infected HuH-7 cells, a differentiated human hepatoma cell line, was studied. Cellular mRNA levels were measured at the late phase of acute infection, when virtually all cells expressed large amounts of nucleoprotein, and virus RNA concentration had reached>10(8) copies (ml supernatant)-1. Two types of transcription array were used: cDNA-based macroarrays with a set of 3500 genes (Atlas Human 1.2 arrays; Clontech) and oligonucleotide-based microarrays covering 18,400 transcripts (Human Genome U133A array; Affymetrix). Data analysis was based on statistical frameworks controlling the false-discovery rate. Atlas array data were considered relevant if they could be verified by U133A array or real-time RT-PCR. According to these criteria, there was no evidence for true changes in gene expression. Considering the precision of the U133A array and the number of replicates tested, potential expression changes due to Lassa virus infection are probably smaller than twofold. To substantiate the array data, beta interferon (IFN-beta) gene expression was studied longitudinally in Lassa virus-infected HuH-7 and FRhK-4 cells by using real-time RT-PCR. IFN-beta mRNA levels increased only twofold upon Lassa virus infection, although there was no evidence that the virus inhibited poly(I:C)-induced IFN-beta gene expression.

According to different treatment regimens, patients were divided into conventional treatment group (conventional antivirus, anti-infection and symptomatic support treatments), Xuebijing group (Xuebijing was applied to patients with elevated inflammatory cytokines) and combination group (Xuebijing combined with human immunoglobulin, human immunoglobulin was applied to patients with low immunity indicated by monitoring results of lymphocytes and their subsets). The improvement of blood routine examination, blood gas analysis, myocardial enzyme spectrum, liver and kidney function, lymphocytes and their subsets and cytokines as well as severity score in three groups before and after treatment were observed. Kaplan-Meier method was used to draw the 28-day survival curve of each group, and the cumulative survival rate among the groups was compared.

In this article, six recent advances in exposure characterization by sampling and analysis are reviewed as tools in the occupational exposure assessment of aerosols. Three advances discussed in detail are (1) recognition and inclusion of sampler wall deposits; (2) development of a new sampling and analytical procedure for respirable crystalline silica that allows non-destructive field analysis at the end of the sampling period; and (3) development of a new sampler to collect the portion of sub-300 nm aerodynamic diameter particles that would deposit in human airways. Three additional developments are described briefly: (4) a size-selective aerosol sampler that allows the collection of multiple physiologically-relevant size fractions; (5) a miniaturized pump and versatile sampling head to meet multiple size-selective sampling criteria; and (6) a novel method of sampling bioaerosols including viruses while maintaining viability. These recent developments are placed in the context of the historical evolution in sampling and analytical developments from 1900 to the present day. While these are not the only advances in exposure characterization, or exposure assessment techniques, they provide an illustration of how technological advances are adding more tools to our toolkit. The review concludes with a number of recommended areas for future research, including expansion of real-time and end-of-shift on-site measurement, development of samplers that operate at higher flow-rates to ensure measurement at lowered limit values, and development of procedures that accurately distinguish aerosol and vapor phases of semi-volatile substances.","output":"Recent Advances in Occupational Exposure Assessment of Aerosols"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People across the globe are facing increasingly complex public health emergencies that are responsible for the loss of life, economic and social problems with unprecedented damage and costs.

This decade started with one of the most significant pandemics in the history of man-kindCOVID-19. Hence, the problems of resilient health and healthcare systems have become urgent. Especially since SARS-CoV-2 may cause long-term health threats and recurrent crises. It is very important to have a common language. So far, definitions and concepts of health and healthcare resilience differ substantially and are seldom clearly defined.

However, there are few data on the applicability of this therapeutic approach in actual clinical practice in a primary care (PC) setting. The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy in fibromyalgia (FM) of an intervention based on PNE and exercise compared to treatment as usual (TAU). METHODS: Pragmatic nonrandomised controlled trial set in 5 healthcare centres and one physiotherapy centre in PC. Fifty-three women with FM (2010 American College of Rheumatology Diagnostic Criteria for Fibromyalgia) were studied, 35 in the intervention group (IG) and 18 in the control group (CG). The women in the IG were interviewed individually and then received 6 weekly sessions plus one review session (1 month later): those in the CG received their TAU. The subject assignation to the CG or the IG was determined according to their availability to attend the sessions. They all filled in several questionnaires (prior to and 1 year after the intervention) to evaluate the impact of FM in their daily lives, catastrophism, anxiety and depression, severity and impact of pain in daily personal performance and functional capacity. RESULTS: The reductions (improvements) in the scores of all tests (baseline-final) were greater in the IG (p < 0.05) when adjusted for age and baseline values, with moderate or high effect size. After 1 year, 20% (CI ? 1 to 42%) more women in the IG, compared to the CG, had a FIQ score < 39 (mild functional impairment). 17/38 (49%) women in the IG no longer met FM criteria at the end of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: An intervention based on PNE and exercise in patients with FM is feasible and seems effective in PC.

The nature of health research prioritization is context-specific, and there is an obligation to effectively allocate resources to initiatives that will achieve the greatest impact, which is discussed in this paper. Methods: The best practice for health research prioritization depends on the existing needs and context. The e-Delphi technique was conducted via an online self-administered questionnaire that covered health research topics, topics related to Vision 2030, as well as collaborative research. Criteria used for scoring the selected topics were: appropriateness, relevance, feasibility, urgency, collaboration and impact of research outcome. Research domains were prioritized by ranking the weighted mean aggregate score and all topics of the top five ranked domains, along with the aggregate scores of the answers of those in leadership positions were pooled together, validated, verified, summarized, refined and then classified into themes. Results: The participants included those from a full range of health specialties and subspecialties (46.5% physicians, 39% health specialists, 10% pharmacists and 3.6% dentists), and the study achieved balanced regional participation and covered a wide spectrum of qualification and professional levels. In total there were 2252 participants and 98% belonged to MoH. Of those from the MoH, 134 were leaders (85 Headquarters policy makers and 49 regional decision makers), while the rest were made up from individuals from 16 Health Affairs Directorates spanning 75 hospitals and specialized health centers, 24 primary health care centers , 2 healthcare clusters, in addition to five medical cities. Community involvement was represented by 26 organizations. Approximately half of stakeholders contributed to scientific research, while 24% had previous publications, and only 6% had a direct influence in health policymaking. The study deliverables were listed into three agendas: 1. Health System Research Priority Themes : Service Delivery, Workforce, Information Systems, Access to Essential Medicines, Financing, Governance & Leadership and Disaster Response. 2. Diseases and Health Problems Themes: Non-Communicable and Communicable Diseases, Trauma, Public Health, Dental Health, Environmental Health, Pilgrims Health, Womens Health, Child & Geriatric Health, Biomedical Technology, Radiology and Physical Technology. 3.

The authors highlight the importance of the societal consequences of the outbreak and changes in the world of work to manage occupational health. The key points identified - such as individual socio-economic factors, psychological effects and occupations with highest risk of contamination - modify return-to-work approaches. It is estimated that around 800 million people of working age worldwide were living with disabilities before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In early January 2021, the cumulative COVID-19 hospitalisation rate reached 207.4/100 000 (18-49-year-olds) and 505.7/100 000 (50-64-year-olds), respectively, in the United States (3). In France, the hospitalisation rate was 411.5/100 000 across all ages (4). A recent cohort study of working-age men who were hospitalised for COVID-19 highlighted the long-term health consequences of such a disease (5). The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic creates new challenges for occupational health, shifting attention away from return-to-work after health problems to resuming work during an outbreak, dealing with lockdown, and taking special account of workers with vulnerabilities (6, 7). We recommend considering three different aspects of occupational medicine during a pandemic. Firstly, for most workers at high-risk of severe COVID-19, the issues of work disability and resuming work had never occurred before the epidemic. Recommendations such as physical and social distancing and wearing a facemask are highly advisable to protect against infection but may not be enough to enable some individuals to resume work. Therefore, decision-making requires individual comprehensive assessments of the underlying medical condition, the SARS-CoV-2 contamination risk associated with either regular work or teleworking, and vaccination opportunities. The second situation concerns workers who have suffered from COVID-19. Preliminary studies suggest that long recovery duration is related to high severity (7), but this is still a matter of debate for patients suffering from \\"long COVID-19\\" (5, 8, 9), a condition for which the long-term effects remain unknown. Any long-running recovery must be considered to be a potential sign of long COVID-19. These long-lasting syndromes occur among patients with severe symptoms but have also been reported independently of acute phase severity, hospitalisation and receiving medical oxygen (8, 9). Researchers worldwide are currently investigating such syndromes. Strategies promoting return to work for these workers will need to be implemented and could be similar to programmes developed for other chronic conditions. Moreover, numerous more serious sequelae following critical illness suggest the need for enhanced support by rehabilitation and occupational health specialists. Finally, the consequences of the epidemic must be evaluated over time for people who suffered from functional limitations before COVID-19 as their physical and mental condition may be modified by the epidemic and, specifically, the consequences of lockdown (10). In all of these situations, medical, social, financial and working contexts are key elements. In addition to a medical assessment, the use of scales such as the Work Ability Index (WAI) (11) or the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) (12) can help perform long-term follow-up and provide information about work capacity and workload. It also gives a \\"back to basics\\" perspective, urging politicians to move towards a \`decent-work-for-all\` policy, as advocated by the United Nation\`s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, which the WHO has endorsed (13).

Aim of this study is to perform mid-2020 altmetric analysis of top-100 articles about COVID-19 that provoked the most online attention. Methods: Altmetric Explorer search was performed in June 3th,2020. After ranked by altmetric attention score (AAS: an automatically calculated weighted count of all of the attention a research output has received in social media), articles that are not related by COVID-19 were excluded and the first-100 COVID-19-related articles were analyzed. Variables evaluated were (I) AAS, (II) dimensions-badge (interactive visualizations that showcase the citation data origins for individual publications), (III) month of publication, (IV) distribution of web-sources, (V) demographic-breakdown type distributions of citations, (VI) geographic-breakdown type distributions of citations, (VII) level-of-evidence (decided using SIGN-Criteria) (VIII) Q-categories of scientific journals, and (IX) h-index. Descriptive and correlational statistics were performed. Kruskal-Wallis test was used for AAS and dimensions-badge value comparisons while post-hoc analyses were performed by Dunn test. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to detect linear relationship between numerical variables. Analyses were performed by SPSS23.0 and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Most (74%) of the disseminated articles were published in Q1-journals while evidence levels were mostly level-3/level-4. Content of the first 3 articles was about the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions, origin of COVID-19 and chloroquine usage, respectively. There was no significant difference between AAS in different months (p=0.673) but dimensions-badges in January were significantly higher (p<0.05). There was a weak positive correlation between AAS and dimensionsbadge (r=0.250;p=0.017). Conclusion: Dimensions-badge and AAS results revealed that academia discussed COVID-19 much more in the first-month of pandemic, but then interests continued parallelly in academia and other social media platforms, including public. Academicians have discussed experiences of large-patient series but public preferred what is potentially protective or risky for them.

Methods I estimated growth rates and doubling times across a 22-week period of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic using hospital admissions incidence data collected through the US CDC COVID-NET surveillance program which operates in 98 U.S. counties located in 13 states. I cross validated the growth measures using mortality incidence data for the same regions and time periods. Results Between March 1 and August 8, 2020, two distinct waves of epidemic activity occurred. During the first wave in the COVID-NET monitoring regions, the harmonic mean of the maximum weekly growth rate was 534% (Median: 575; Range: 250 to 2250) and this maximum occurred in the second or third week of March in different regions. The harmonic mean of the minimum doubling time occurred with maximum growth rate and was 0.35 weeks (Median 0.36 weeks; Range: 0.22 to 0.55 weeks). The harmonic mean of the maximum incidence rate during the first wave of the epidemic was 8.5 hospital admissions per 100,000 people per week (Median: 9.2, Range: 4 to 40.5) and the peak of epidemic infection transmission associated with this maximum occurred on or before March 27, 2020 in eight of the 13 regions. Dividing the 22-week observed period into four intervals, the harmonic mean of the weekly hospitalization incidence rate was highest during the second interval (4.6 hospitalizations per week per 100,000), then fell during the third and fourth intervals. Growth rates declined from 101 percent per week in the first interval to 2.5 percent per week in the last. Doubling time have lengthened from 3/5th of a week in the first interval to 12.5 weeks in the last. Period by period, the cumulative incidence has grown primarily in a linear mode. The mean cumulative incidence of hospitalizations on Aug 8th, 2020 in the COVID-NET regions is 96 hospitalizations per 100,000. Regions which experienced the highest maximum weekly incidence rates or greatest cumulative incidence rates in the first wave, generally, but not uniformly, observed the lower incidence rates in the second wave. Growth measures calculated based on mortality incidence data corroborate these findings. Conclusions Declining epidemic growth rates of SARS-COV-2 infection appeared in early March in the first observations of nationwide hospital admissions surveillance program in multiple U.S. regions. A sizable fraction of the U.S. population may have been infected in a cryptic February epidemic acceleration phase.

SHIRI will describe the frequency of influenza virus infections among HCP, identify predictors of vaccine acceptance, examine how repeated influenza vaccination may modify immunogenicity, and evaluate influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing influenza illness and missed work. METHODS: Cohort enrollment began in October, 2016; a second year of the study and a second wave of cohort enrollment began in June 2017. The study will run for at least 3 years and will follow approximately 2000 HCP (who are both employees and members of Clalit Health Services [CHS]) with routine direct patient contact. Eligible HCP are recruited using a stratified sampling strategy. After informed consent, participants complete a brief enrollment survey with questions about occupational responsibilities and knowledge, attitudes, and practices about influenza vaccines. Blood samples are collected at enrollment and at the end of influenza season; HCP who choose to be vaccinated contribute additional blood one month after vaccination. During the influenza season, participants receive twice-weekly short message service (SMS) messages asking them if they have acute respiratory illness or febrile illness (ARFI) symptoms. Ill participants receive follow-up SMS messages to confirm illness symptoms and duration and are asked to self-collect a nasal swab. Information on socio-economic characteristics, current and past medical conditions, medical care utilization and vaccination history is extracted from the CHS database. Information about missed work due to illness is obtained by self-report and from employee records. Respiratory specimens from self-collected nasal swabs are tested for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and coronaviruses using validated multiplex quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. The hemagglutination inhibition assay will be used to detect the presence of neutralizing influenza antibodies in serum. DISCUSSION: SHIRI will expand our knowledge of the burden of respiratory viral infections among HCP and the effectiveness of current and repeated annual influenza vaccination in preventing influenza illness, medical utilization, and missed workdays among HCP who are in direct contact with patients.

Involvement of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in susceptibility to infection and pathogenesis by SARS-CoV-2 is currently an actively pursued research area. An increased susceptibility to infection in individuals with DM, HT and CVD together with higher levels of circulating ACE2 in these settings presents a scenario where interaction with soluble ACE2 may result in disseminated virus-receptor complexes that could enhance virus acquisition and pathogenesis. Thus, understanding the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain-ACE2 interaction, both membrane bound and in the cell free context may contribute to elucidating the role of co-morbidities in increased susceptibility to infection and pathogenesis. Both Azithromycin and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have shown efficacy in mitigating viral carriage in infected individuals. Furthermore, each of these compounds generate active metabolites which in turn may also modulate virus-receptor interaction and thus influence clinical outcomes. In this study, we model the structural interaction of S1 with both full-length and soluble ACE2. Additionally, therapeutic drugs and their active metabolites were docked with soluble ACE2 protein. Our results show that S1 from either of the reported Indian sequences can bind both full-length and soluble ACE2, albeit with varying affinity that can be attributed to a reported substitution in the RBD. Furthermore, both Azythromycin and HCQ together with their active metabolites can allosterically affect, to a range of extents, binding of S1 to ACE2.","output":"Modelling and docking of Indian SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 1 with ACE2: implications for co-morbidity and therapeutic intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Despite availability of reliable guidelines development methods, the risk of producing less reliable documents may be higher when the guidelines are developed rapidly. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess quality of guidelines on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), developed in the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic and assess if recommendations for pharmacotherapy were supported by evidence. METHODS: We performed the search for documents, that considered antiviral therapies and contained a recommendations for clinicians. The quality of the guidelines was assessed using the AGREE II-Global Rating Scale Instrument and series of additional criteria. RESULTS: The analysis included 40 publications. The median of quality of documents assessed with the AGREE II-GRS tool was 2.0 (interquartile range 1.5-2.5). Most documents did not fulfill the rigour of guideline development quality criteria. The AGREE II-GRS scores did not differ significantly across the type of the document, issuing institution and the mode of publication. 75% of documents provided recommendations for the use of antiviral medications despite apparent lack of sufficient evidence supporting such treatments. Of the included documents, 75% were not updated within the 2 months after the publication of the first randomized controlled trial on COVID-19 antiviral therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Most guidelines or guidance documents published during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic were of poor quality, contained recommendations for the use of antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection despite only very low quality of evidence available, and were not updated on a regular basis.","output":"Quality and methodology of clinical practice guidelines on antiviral pharmacotherapy for COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although antibody levels progressively decrease following SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immune memory persists for months. Thus, individuals who naturally contracted SARS-CoV-2 are expected to develop a more rapid and sustained response to COVID-19 vaccines than na?ve individuals. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of the antibody response to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in six healthcare workers who contracted SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020, in comparison to nine control subjects without a previous infection. The vaccine was well tolerated by both groups, with no significant difference in the frequency of vaccine-associated side effects, with the exception of local pain, which was more common in previously infected subjects. Overall, the titers of neutralizing antibodies were markedly higher in response to the vaccine than after natural infection. In all subjects with pre-existing immunity, a rapid increase in anti-spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibody titers was observed one week after the first dose, which seemed to act as a booster. Notably, in previously infected individuals, neutralizing antibody titers 7 days after the first vaccine dose were not significantly different from those observed in na?ve subjects 7 days after the second vaccine dose. These results suggest that, in previously infected people, a single dose of the vaccine might be sufficient to induce an effective response.","output":"Antibody Response to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine in Subjects with Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mechanical ventilation as a resource is limited and may lead to poor outcomes in at\\\\risk populations.

Colonoscopy is regarded as the gold standard examination for detecting and eradicating neoplastic lesion.

First, approximately one-fourth of colorectal neoplasms are missed on a single colonoscopy. Second, it is still difficult for non-experts to perform adequately regarding optical biopsy. Third, recording of some quality indicators (e.g. cecal intubation, bowel preparation, and withdrawal speed) which are related to adenoma detection rate, is sometimes incomplete.

The physical material obstructs the coronary microcirculation, whereas the soluble substances induce endothelial dysfunction and facilitate vasoconstriction. Coronary microvascular obstruction and dysfunction result in patchy microinfarcts accompanied by an inflammatory reaction, both of which contribute to progressive myocardial contractile dysfunction. In clinical studies, the benefit of protection devices to retrieve atherothrombotic debris during percutaneous coronary interventions has been modest, and the treatment of microembolization has mostly relied on antiplatelet and vasodilator agents. The past 25 years have witnessed a relative proportional increase in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in the presentation of acute coronary syndromes. An associated increase in the incidence of plaque erosion rather than rupture has also been recognized as a key mechanism in the past decade. We propose that coronary microembolization is a decisive link between plaque erosion at the culprit lesion and the manifestation of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Methods: A review of the current literature has been carried out up to May 20th 2020 according to the PRISMA guidelines. All case series and reports of adult neurological manifestations associated to SARS-CoV-2 published in English were considered. Review and fundamental research studies on Coronaviruses neuroinvasive potential were analyzed to support pathogenic hypothesis and possible underlying mechanisms. Clinical patterns were subdivided into three groups according to putative underlying mechanisms: direct invasion of central or peripheral nervous system, systemic disorders leading to acute CNS injuries and post-infectious neurological syndromes (PINS). Results: Sixteen case series and 26 case reports for a total of 903 patients were identified presenting with neurological involvement during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Despite the existence of established waste management strategies, targets set for the collection of recyclable waste have not been met. This study introduces solutions to the problems and challenges faced by the waste management sector in Hoi An city and other developing countries. This study aimed to i) optimize the map of the recovery recycling stations in an urban community, ii) develop an effective solid waste collection system, and iii) provide management tools to enhance recycling activities, contributing to improving waste management in Hoi An city. METHODS: The RRSs were integrated into a solid waste collection system in the urban communities of Hoi An City, were conducted through location-allocation analysis in a geographic information system environment. Routing problems of carts were solved in the combination of the rescheduling of existing solid waste collection activities in the study site. The economic evaluation by scenarios was also calculated for ten years to assess the feasibility of scenarios. FINDINGS: Thirty-four locations were identified and optimized to accommodate the RRSs and new collection routes. The distances travelled and working time increased in proportion to the increase in waste separation effectiveness. Waste separation is vital to the effectiveness of the new solid waste collection system. The optimal solid waste practice model (in scenarios 2 and 4) revealed the positive results in improving the solid waste collection system, operating economy, and local adaptation.

METHODOLOGY We evaluated the correlations of relevant routine laboratory test results with disease severity in COVID-19 patients admitted to our infectious diseases clinic. Patients were divided into severe and non-severe disease groups based on clinical findings, oxygen saturation levels in the arterial blood, biochemical test results, and radiological findings. Differences in the findings between the two disease severity groups were examined to determine potential biomarkers. RESULTS Median age and the CRP and LDH levels in the severe disease group were statistically significantly higher compared to the nonsevere group (p < 0.0001). No other parameters statistically significant differences have been observed between the two groups (P > 0.05).

The lncRNA LOC441461 was downregulated in TNM stage IV GC. The downregulation of LOC441461 promoted the proliferation, cell cycle progression, and metastasis of GC cells in vitro. We confirmed, with predictable targets, that LOC441461 interacts with transcription factors and promotes tumor progression. Our study suggests LOC441461 as a potential biomarker, which could also lead to a therapeutic target in patients with advanced TNM stage gastric cancer. ABSTRACT: Gastric cancer is a common tumor, with a high mortality rate. The severity of gastric cancer is assessed by TNM staging. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a role in cancer treatment; investigating the clinical significance of novel biomarkers associated with TNM staging, such as lncRNAs, is important. In this study, we investigated the association between the expression of the lncRNA LOC441461 and gastric cancer stage. LOC441461 expression was lower in stage IV than in stages I, II, and III. The depletion of LOC441461 promoted cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, cell motility, and invasiveness. LOC441461 downregulation increased the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, as indicated by increased TRAIL signaling and decreased RUNX1 interactions. The interaction of the transcription factors RELA, IRF1, ESR1, AR, POU5F1, TRIM28, and GATA1 with LOC441461 affected the degree of the malignancy of gastric cancer by modulating gene transcription.

Tachycardia is an important indicator of certain complications, such as anastomotic leak and hemorrhage. Our aim was to examine the relationship between tachycardia following sleeve gastrectomy and the appearance of associated complications. METHODS Patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy over a 2-year period were included in the study. Participants were divided into two groups: the first included patients who suffered from postoperative tachycardia and the second patients with normal postoperative heart rates. Complications in both groups were examined. Other parameters that predict the onset of complications were also reviewed. RESULTS A total of 457 patients were included. Postoperative tachycardia was measured in 181 (39.6%) patients; 17 (3.7%) suffered from bleeding and 4 (1%) from staple line leakage. Postoperative bleeding was more common among patients with tachycardia than among those without (14 (7.7%) vs. 3 (1.1%), respectively). Patients in the tachycardia group had more staple line leakages than those in the normal heart rate group (3 (2%) vs. 1 (0%), respectively); tachycardia was also attributed to postoperative pain or other minor complications in 160 (88%) patients.

Suspension of all elective surgical procedures and delays in processing of unemployment claims resulted in many Kentucky health care personnel abruptly experiencing financial uncertainty. We explored the experience of abrupt food insecurity in households with at least 1 unemployed health care provider and identified strategies used to provide nutrition for household members during the pandemic. The Theory of Planned Behavior's perceived behavioral control construct was used to guide analysis. In November 2020, virtual semi-structured interviews via Microsoft Teams or telephone were conducted with nurses and nurse practitioners (n = 8) who were recruited via print advertisement in the state board of nursing's quarterly publication. Inclusion criteria included unemployment specifically in response to COVID pandemic restrictions on hospital procedures during March-June of 2020. Each interview lasted 45-60 minutes and participants received reimbursement for their time. NVivo software was used to analyze themes. Two qualitative nurse researchers used the Spiegelberg 3-step process of intuiting, analyzing, and describing. Food security strategies that emerged from the interviews included stockpiling, reprioritization of household budget items, food preservation, changes in cooking techniques, shared responsibility for meals, creative employment opportunities, and the purchase/preparation of calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods. Abrupt unemployment of U.S. health care personnel, whose employment is usually less sensitive to supply-demand fluctuations, and the projected post-pandemic rise in food costs necessitate preparation for future shifts in employment status. Adaptive strategies used to enhance food security in these individuals have the potential for both positive and negative impact on health outcomes. While health care personnel reported some responses as beneficial to health, the perceived need to purchase and prepare calorie-dense foods reflects the fear of food insecurity. Most food security interventional programs target households with lower incomes and/or those receiving supplemental food assistance. The strategies implemented by these health care providers can inform existing and new food security programs. None.

In many European cities, diverse and rapidly changing experimental forms (e.g. urban living laboratories, pilots, trials, experimental districts) are becoming commonplace, addressing ambitious goals for smartness, circularity, and liveability. Academically, there is a growing concern for moving beyond the focus on individual experiments and the insistence on upscaling their primary transformation mechanism. However, the phenomena of projectification C whereby project-based forms of organising have become ubiquitous, shaping expectations about experimentation C is increasingly perceived as a barrier. Nevertheless, how specifically experimentation and projectification intersect remains unclear. Our theoretical perspective examines how the widespread tendency towards projectification shapes urban experimentation and the potential implications for urban transformations. It problematises the current wave of experimentation and how it contributes to the projectification of urban change processes. We present three steps to redress this issue and indicate directions for future research.","output":"Experimentation or projectification of urban change?

Clinical and real-world studies of DRF have demonstrated improved gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability and low (< 1%) GI-related treatment discontinuation versus dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and high rates of treatment adherence. Our aim was to conduct a concept elicitation study to identify treatment-related concepts most meaningful to patients and to evaluate how these concepts shape the patient perspective of DRF. METHODS: In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with patients from October to December 2020. US adults who had been prescribed DRF through routine clinical care and had taken DRF for  3 weeks in the past 6 months were eligible to participate. Semi-structured interviews explored patient perceptions on treatment selection and impact. RESULTS: Seventeen patients participated in the study. Mean (SD) age was 49.3 (12.0) years. Sixteen patients reported prior disease-modifying therapy, while 10 (58.8%) had prior DMF. DRF treatment duration ranged from ~ 6 weeks to 10 months. Four key concepts emerged: (1) overall wellness and quality of life, (2) ease of administration, (3) minimal and manageable side effects, and (4) patient optimism due to MS treatments. Mode of administration (82.4%), no/mild side effects (70.6%), convenience over injectable/infusion medications (58.8%), and effectiveness (64.7%) were cited as positive aspects of DRF treatment. Frequent dosing (52.9%) and food requirements (41.2%) were cited as negative attributes; however, 94.1% had no dietary changes since starting treatment. CONCLUSION: The patient perspective is a key aspect when considering a disease-modifying therapy for MS, given the multitude of options currently available. Overall wellness, ease of administration, and minimal and manageable side effects were DRF-related concepts most meaningful to patients on therapy. Acknowledging these patient perceptions in shared decision-making may lead to greater patient adherence and optimal treatment outcomes.

The pandemic has influenced all forms of daily life, including educational institutions. Therefore, this cross-sectional survey was conducted to understand knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to COVID-19 among the students of the University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore. The data was collected using an online self-directed questionnaire. The survey form includes six items about sociodemographic characteristics, 14 knowledge-based questions, seven questions on attitude, and eight questions on practices. The sample number was calculated using the Raosoft sample size calculator. A total number of 3,854 students, including 1,823 men and 2,031 women, were engaged in this survey, having student representation from all the provinces in the country. The data were analyzed using a chi-square test. A total of 97% of the students knew that the etiological agent of COVID-19 is a virus and that it is a disease of the respiratory system (94%). Many students kept visiting their relatives during the lockdown (45%), and their relatives kept visiting them at home (59%). The responses from the students varied a lot on specific questions about the transmission of the virus. Women tended to have less information regarding precautionary travel measures (p < 0.01), but supplemental knowledge of prevention of disease transmission from positive patients (p < 0.01). Conclusively, the majority of the university students surveyed had imperative knowledge, a good attitude, and active practice in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, the KAP scores have varied by demography, gender, and the number of family members.

Further, it requires sufficient discussions among related parties because the purpose of telemedicine is diagnosis and treatment, and the participation of medical specialists is essential. Based on the characteristics of the healthcare structure of Korea, which has a low proportion of public healthcare and most patients are taken care of by a few large tertiary care hospitals, the fundamental issues need to be discussed. METHODS: A comparison was conducted with overseas cases to discuss the prerequisites for the effective implementation of telemedicine in South Korea under the current situation. We also examined the structural characteristics of the Korean medical community. RESULTS: The current paper recommends that an in-depth analysis and studies are conducted on the following aspects: a search for telemedicine services focused on public healthcare, a search of services for illnesses that impose high levels of burden on households, and the development and implementation of a telemedicine system for follow-up management at primary and secondary care hospitals after the patient undergoes surgery or treatment at tertiary care hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: As the technology develops, the focus should also be on factors such as safety, usefulness, availability, and how the functions will be realized in order to enable user communication. A clear system should be established to regulate and manage the lack of sufficient discussions. In addition, seeking projects and systems that reflect the characteristics of each country will facilitate the efficient implementation of telemedicine.","output":"Prerequisites for Effective Implementation of Telemedicine: Focusing on Current Situations in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A sample blood test has recently become an important tool to help identify false-positive/false-negative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests. Importantly, this is mainly because it is an inexpensive and handy option to detect the potential COVID-19 patients. However, this test should be conducted by certified laboratories, expensive equipment, and trained personnel, and 3C4 h are needed to deliver results. Furthermore, it has relatively large false-negative rates around 15%C20%. Consequently, an alternative and more accessible solution, quicker and less costly, is needed. This article introduces flexible and unsupervised data-driven approaches to detect the COVID-19 infection based on blood test samples. In other words, we address the problem of COVID-19 infection detection using a blood test as an anomaly detection problem through an unsupervised deep hybrid model. Essentially, we amalgamate the features extraction capability of the variational autoencoder (VAE) and the detection sensitivity of the one-class support vector machine (1SVM) algorithm. Two sets of routine blood tests samples from the Albert Einstein Hospital, S ao Paulo, Brazil, and the San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy, are used to assess the performance of the investigated deep learning models. Here, missing values have been imputed based on a random forest regressor. Compared to generative adversarial networks (GANs), deep belief network (DBN), and restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM)-based 1SVM, the traditional VAE, GAN, DBN, and RBM with softmax layer as discriminator layer, and the standalone 1SVM, the proposed VAE-based 1SVM detector offers superior discrimination performance of potential COVID-19 infections. Results also revealed that the deep learning-driven 1SVM detection approaches provide promising detection performance compared to the conventional deep learning models.","output":"Deep Generative Learning-Based 1-SVM Detectors for Unsupervised COVID-19 Infection Detection Using Blood Tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Numerous molecular-based tests were applied for the laboratory-based diagnosis of viruses. In this cross-sectional case control study, in addition to bacteria, we aimed to determine respiratory viruses using, for the first time in our country, the Reverse Transcription PCR DNA Microarray method, and we also aimed to evaluate its diagnostic performance. METHODS Respiratory viruses were investigated from nasopharyngeal swabs of 76 patients diagnosed with atypical pneumonia and 64 healthy controls using the CLART Pneumovir (Genomica, Spain) kit and from 10 mL blood samples of the same subjects. M. pneumoniae IgM was detected by ELISA and L. pneumophila IgM and C. pneumoniae IgM by indirect immunofluorescence. Person's chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Our results showed that the specificity (100%) and the positive predictive value (100%) of the CLART Pneumovir kit were high, but its sensitivity (53%), its negative predictive value (64%), and its kappa value (50%) were low. Parainfluenza Virus type 3 and M. pneumoniae were found alone or together as the most common microorganisms while no cases of human bocavirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, or coronavirus were detected.

Digital ad venues therefore need to identify ads as having political content in order to police whether or not they have appropriate disclosures. However, an algorithmic approach to the categorization may hit difficulties in times of rapid change and if there is not a consensus on what a political ad actually is. We collect data on European and American ads published in the Facebook Ad Library and show that algorithmic determination of what constitutes an issue of national importance resulted in COVID-19-related ads to be disqualified because they do not have an appropriate disclaimer. Our results show that ads run by governmental organizations to inform the population about COVID-19 are more likely to be banned by Facebook's algorithm than ads run by non-governmental organizations. We suggest that this implies that governmental organizations failed to recognize that COVID-19 was a matter of national significance and that ads referring to COVID-19 required a disclaimer. We show that this primarily affects European governmental organizations' ads. It seems that Facebook's policy related to \\"{Social Issues, Elections or Politics}'' ads is based on US political broadcasting and political advertising rules which are less familiar to European organizations.

METHODS: The data of 452 patients over 65 years old with femoral neck fracture or intertrochanteric fracture treated with hip arthroplasty or proximal femoral intramedullary nailing from June 2012 to June 2017 were analyzed, including 168 males and 284 females, the age ranged from 65 to 97(75.57.5) years. There were 191 cases of femoral neck fracture and 261 cases of femoral intertrochanteric fracture. According to whether there was a fracture in the healthy hip after operation, the patients were divided into fracture group and no fracture group. The gender, age, body mass index, fracture type, initial treatment method, bone mineral density, bed time, medical compliance, postoperative short-term delirium, whether there were medical diseases before injury and Harris score of hip joint in the final follow-up were recorded. Univariate Logistic regression analysis was used to screen out the risk factors of healthy side fracture after operation, and then statistically significant risk factors were included in multi factor Logistic regression analysis to screen out the independent risk factors of healthy side fracture after operation of hip fracture in the elderly. RESULTS: Among them, 42 of the 452 patients had hip fractures on the healthy side with an incidence of 9.3%. The average interval between the two fractures was (2.92.1) years. Univariate Logistic regression analysis showed that there were significant differences in age, bone mineral density, medical compliance, short-term postoperative deliriun, pre-injury complicated with medical diseases and Harris score of hip joint in the final follow-up (P<0.05). Multivariate Logistic analysis showed that age(OR=4.227), bone mineral density(OR=4.313), combined with medical diseases (OR=5.616) and low hip Harris score at the final follow-up (OR=3.891) were independent risk factors for healthy side fractures after hip fracture surgery in elderly(P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The age, bone mineral density, combined with medical diseases and low Harris score of hip joint in the final follow-up are the main risk factors of healthy side fracture after hip fracture in the elderly.

We studied Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-antibody seroprevalence in a community sample drawn from Santa Clara County. METHODS: On 3 and 4 April 2020, we tested 3328 county residents for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a rapid lateral-flow assay (Premier Biotech). Participants were recruited using advertisements that were targeted to reach county residents that matched the county population by gender, race/ethnicity and zip code of residence. We estimate weights to match our sample to the county by zip, age, sex and race/ethnicity. We report the weighted and unweighted prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We adjust for test-performance characteristics by combining data from 18 independent test-kit assessments: 14 for specificity and 4 for sensitivity. RESULTS: The raw prevalence of antibodies in our sample was 1.5% [exact binomial 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1C2.0%]. Test-performance specificity in our data was 99.5% (95% CI 99.2C99.7%) and sensitivity was 82.8% (95% CI 76.0C88.4%). The unweighted prevalence adjusted for test-performance characteristics was 1.2% (95% CI 0.7C1.8%). After weighting for population demographics, the prevalence was 2.8% (95% CI 1.3C4.2%), using bootstrap to estimate confidence bounds. These prevalence point estimates imply that 53 000 [95% CI 26 000 to 82 000 using weighted prevalence; 23 000 (95% CI 14 000C35 000) using unweighted prevalence] people were infected in Santa Clara County by late Marchmany more than the 1200 confirmed cases at the time. CONCLUSION: The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Santa Clara County implies that COVID-19 was likely more widespread than indicated by the number of cases in late March, 2020.

There have been a variety of guidelines and precautions developed to help mitigate this risk. While many reviews have focused on the personal protective equipment (PPE) and preparation guidelines for surgery in the COVID-19 era, none have focused on the more creative and unusual solutions designed to limit viral transmission. This review aims to fill that need. Data Sources: PubMed, Ovid/Medline, and Scopus. Methods: A comprehensive review of literature was performed on September 28, 2020 using PubMed, Ovid/Medline, and Scopus databases. All English-language studies were included if they proposed or assessed novel interventions developed for Otolaryngology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Results: A total of 41 papers met inclusion criteria and were organized into 5 categories ('General Recommendations for Otolaryngologic Surgery', 'Equipment Shortage Solutions', 'Airway Procedures', 'Nasal Endoscopy and Skull Base Procedures', and 'Otologic Procedures'). Articles were summarized, highlighting the innovations created and evaluated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Creative solutions such as application of topical viricidal agents, make-shift mask filters, three-dimensional (3-D) printable adapters for headlights, aerosol containing separation boxes, and a variety of new draping techniques have been developed to limit the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Conclusions: Persistent risk of COVID-19 exposure remains high. Thus, there is an increased need for solutions that mitigate the risk of viral transmission during office procedures and surgeries, especially given that most COVID-19 positive patients present asymptomatically. This review examines and organizes creative solutions that have been proposed and utilized in the otolaryngology.

We hypothesized that MSCs overexpressing ACE2 is more effective in ameliorating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory injury in mammary epithelial cells compared to MSCs alone. The results showed that MSC-ACE2 inhibited the LPS induction by upregulation of TNF-, IL-I, IL-6, and iNOS mRNA expression levels in EpH4-Ev cells compared with MSCs. Furthermore, results showed that both MSC and MSC-ACE2 were significantly activated IL-10/STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway as well as inhibited TLR4/NF-B and MAPK signaling pathways, but MSC-ACE2 had more significant effects. Meanwhile, MSC-ACE2 promoted the expression of proliferation-associated proteins and inhibited the expression of the apoptosis-associated proteins in EpH4-Ev cells. In addition, MSC and MSC-ACE2 reversed the LPS-induced downregulation expression levels of the tight junction proteins in mammary epithelial cells, indicating that both MSC as well as MSC-ACE2 could promote blood-milk barrier repair, and MSC-ACE2 was more effective. These results suggested that MSCs overexpressing ACE2 were more anti-inflammatory as well as anti-injurious action into LPS-induced inflammatory injury in the EpH4-Ev cells. Thus, MSCs overexpressing ACE2 is expected to serve as a potential strategy for mastitis treatment.","output":"Mesenchymal Stem Cells Overexpressing ACE2 Favorably Ameliorate LPS-Induced Inflammatory Injury in Mammary Epithelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This commentary amplifies the rising spate of human rights violations as laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa It notes that while governments in the region have declared restrictions on social gathering, in a bid to upend the deadly contagion, rights violations of vulnerable groups by law enforcement officials are on the increase It argues that the underlying rationale for such flagrant abuse of power stems from the dearth of a rights-based approach to police-public relations, indifference of political actors, and a grossly inadequate public health and social care infrastructures for undervalued and powerless groups Policy implications are laid out while suggestions are offered to social work professionals given their longstanding commitment to national security and development (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved","output":"COVID-19 palaver: Ending rights violations of vulnerable groups in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clusterin (CLU) is an evolutionary conserved molecular chaperone present in different human tissues and fluids and established to be a significant cancer regulator.

This Position Statement from the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) is an attempt to homogenize recommendations and, hence, patient management according to the best scientific evidence and other considerations (e.g. health policy). A Working Group developed consensus statements, using the existing national guidelines as a starting point and considering new evidence in the literature. The Position Statement wishes to contribute to a more cost-effective approach to the care of patients with BE by reducing the number of surveillance endoscopies for patients with a low risk of malignant progression and centralizing care in expert centers for those with high progression rates.Main statements MS1 The diagnosis of BE is made if the distal esophagus is lined with columnar epithelium with a minimum length of 1 cm (tongues or circular) containing specialized intestinal metaplasia at histopathological examination. MS2 The ESGE recommends varying surveillance intervals for different BE lengths. For patients with an irregular Z-line/columnar-lined esophagus of < 1 cm, no routine biopsies or endoscopic surveillance is advised. For BE  1 cm and < 3 cm, BE surveillance should be repeated every 5 years. For BE  3 cm and < 10 cm, the interval for endoscopic surveillance should be 3 years. Patients with BE with a maximum extent  10 cm should be referred to a BE expert center for surveillance endoscopies. Patients with limited life expectancy and advanced age should be discharged from endoscopic surveillance. MS3 The diagnosis of any degree of dysplasia (including \\"indefinite for dysplasia\\") in BE requires confirmation by an expert gastrointestinal pathologist. MS4 Patients with visible lesions in BE diagnosed as dysplasia or early cancer should be referred to a BE expert center. All visible abnormalities, regardless of the degree of dysplasia, should be removed by means of endoscopic resection techniques in order to obtain optimal histopathological staging MS5 All patients with a BE  10 cm, a confirmed diagnosis of low grade dysplasia, high grade dysplasia (HGD), or early cancer should be referred to a BE expert center for surveillance and/or treatment. BE expert centers should meet the following criteria: annual case load of 10 new patients undergoing endoscopic treatment for HGD or early carcinoma per BE expert endoscopist; endoscopic and histological care provided by endoscopists and pathologists who have followed additional training; at least 30 supervised endoscopic resection and 30 endoscopic ablation procedures to acquire competence in technical skills, management pathways, and complications; multidisciplinary meetings with gastroenterologists, surgeons, oncologists, and pathologists to discuss patients with Barrett's neoplasia; access to experienced esophageal surgery; and all BE patients registered prospectively in a database.","output":"Endoscopic management of Barrett's esophagus: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Position Statement."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late 2019, COVID-19, a severe respiratory disease, emerged, and since then, the world has been facing a deadly pandemic caused by it. This ongoing pandemic has had a significant effect on different aspects of societies. The uncertainty around the number of daily cases made it difficult for decision-makers to control the outbreak. Deep Learning models have proved that they can come in handy in many real-world problems such as healthcare ones. However, they require a lot of data to learn the features properly and output an acceptable solution. Since COVID-19 has been a lately emerged disease, there was not much data available, especially in the first stage of the pandemic, and this shortage of data makes it challenging to design an optimized model. To overcome these problems, we first introduce a new dataset with augmented features and then forecast COVID-19 cases with a new approach, using an evolutionary neural architecture search with Binary Bat Algorithm (BBA) to generate an optimized deep recurrent network. Finally, to show our approach's effectiveness, we conducted a comparative study on Iran's COVID-19 daily cases.

Data collected were on socio-demographics, academic environment, COVID19 concerns, tobacco smoking, binge drinking, cannabis use, and physical activity in the periods before and during COVID-19 lockdown. The survey was completed by 3671 university students (mean age 20.9  2.47 years, 72.9% female). Significantly favorable changes between the periods before and during COVID-19 were reported for tobacco smoking (18.5% vs. 14.8%), binge drinking (35.9% vs. 9.3%) and cannabis use (5.6% vs. 3.2%) and unfavorable changes for moderate (79.4% vs. 67.9%) and vigorous physical activity (62.5% vs. 59.1%). After logistic regression, factors associated with unfavorable changes in tobacco smoking and with favorable changes in vigorous physical activity were the worry of not validating the academic year and stress related to changes in the mode of teaching, respectively. For each health behavior, unfavorable changes were associated with higher depression levels, and male gender. Then as a decrease, mainly in binge drinking was observed during the COVID-19 lockdown, care must be taken to prevent university students from resuming binge drinking after the end of the lockdown.

STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included in the systematic review if they reported postoperative mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection who underwent operative intervention for hip fracture. From this selection of studies, only investigations that reported postoperative mortality in a COVID-positive and a non-COVID group were included in the meta-analysis. DATA EXTRACTION: Data regarding patient demographics, age, and sex were recorded. Additional data that was extracted included study location, data collection period, length of follow-up, COVID testing methodology, COVID testing results, and number of patients who underwent operative versus nonoperative management. The primary outcome of interest was postoperative mortality. DATA SYNTHESIS: Random effects meta-analyses were performed to assess the pooled relative risk of postoperative mortality according to COVID status. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. CONCLUSIONS: The overall pooled mortality rate in the early postoperative period for hip fracture patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection was 32.6%. The relative risk for postoperative mortality in COVID-positive patients compared to non-COVID patients was 5.66 (95% CI 4.01C7.98; p < 0.001).

This model goes to the individual patient level and mimics small steps in the process of virus spread. Despite many models simulating the growth of COVID-19 cases, it is rare to see a comprehensive model that takes into account the transmissibility of variants, the prevalence of multiple variants, growth of the variants, percentage of vaccinated population, exposure rate, infection rate, silent carrier rate, secondary infection rate, mask usage, and people mobility all in one model.We begin by categorizing the in-person social interactions of an individual into three areas: household, workplace, and public places. With each interaction, the virus spreads from an infectiousperson to a healthy individual. We build the model, one level at a time, covering daily person-to-person interactions. Further, MIMANSA forms a new layer of network for every new day. These layers form a part of the virus proliferation network.MIMANSA models the virus incubation period using a Weibull distribution. Once the network starts building, the virus growth can be curtailed only through increased vaccinations or through non-pharmaceutical interventions such as mask usage, reduced mobility, and/or quarantine.MIMANSA takes the mobility data, mask usage data, variant prevalence data, and vaccination data as inputs. Despite the model being intricate, it uses only 5 parameters for training. Once the model is trained, it can be slightly adjusted by the daily environmental variable. This variable corrects for day to events as well as varying environmental conditions in a given location.We present the results of the training and validation for the USA, California, and the UK. It is seen that during the validation stage, the model accuracy is within 2%. Further, projections are made for about 3 weeks. In the end, we have presented the results of a study on the effect of vaccination on the number of COVID cases in the USA. It shows how MIMANSA can be used for studying the impact of multiple scenarios. Additionally, the model is not only useful for making predictions in the number of cases but also useful as an educational aid for explaining the proliferation network of the virus in real life. Although MIMANSA is originally developed for the SARS-CoV-2, it can be modified to study the spread of any other virus, and in any region.","output":"A Novel Systems Model to Simulate the Dynamics for the Analytical Study of the Proliferation of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is continuing to evolve around the world, generating new variants that are of concern on the basis of their potential for altered transmissibility, pathogenicity, and coverage by vaccines and therapeutic agents1-5.

METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned critically ill patients to receive BMES (Plasma-Lyte 148) or saline as fluid therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 90 days. The primary outcome was death from any cause within 90 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes were receipt of new renal-replacement therapy and the maximum increase in the creatinine level during ICU stay. RESULTS: A total of 5037 patients were recruited from 53 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand - 2515 patients were assigned to the BMES group and 2522 to the saline group. Death within 90 days after randomization occurred in 530 of 2433 patients (21.8%) in the BMES group and in 530 of 2413 patients (22.0%) in the saline group, for a difference of -0.15 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -3.60 to 3.30; P = 0.90). New renal-replacement therapy was initiated in 306 of 2403 patients (12.7%) in the BMES group and in 310 of 2394 patients (12.9%) in the saline group, for a difference of -0.20 percentage points (95% CI, -2.96 to 2.56). The mean (SD) maximum increase in serum creatinine level was 0.411.06 mg per deciliter (36.694.0 mol per liter) in the BMES group and 0.411.02 mg per deciliter (36.190.0 mol per liter) in the saline group, for a difference of 0.01 mg per deciliter (95% CI, -0.05 to 0.06) (0.5 mol per liter [95% CI, -4.7 to 5.7]).

While uptake has improved over recent months, hesitancy and skepticism persist, including in populations who could most benefit from vaccination such as the elderly, chronically ill or those on immunosuppressants. This survey study aims to characterize attributes that correlate and possibly determine vaccine intent or hesitancy among our IBD population. Methods: Subjects were invited to participate in a web-based survey using a patient database from an academic IBD clinic. Survey questions covered disease history, medications, changes to medications and disease management during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as social, economic, and household characteristics. Positive vaccine intent was defined as having either received a COVID-19 vaccine or planning to do so when it would become available for the participant's age group. Vaccine hesitancy was defined as not having received any portion of a COVID-19 vaccine and not intending to do so. Chi square and logistic binomial regression analysis was performed using SPSS. Results: Of 609 patients invited, 278 (45.6%) completed the survey. 234 (84.2%) had positive vaccine intent;44 (15.8%) were vaccine hesitant. Significant factors are highlighted in Table 1 and were almost exclusively socio-economic. Positive vaccine intent associated variables included college education or above (OR 2.5, p .026), annual income over $150,000 (OR 3.295, p .015), Democratic affiliation (OR 7.193, p<001), CDC information source (OR 5.749, p<.001), and receiving the flu shot in the year prior (OR 3.702, p .002).

Disease-related attributes, comorbidities, or use of immunomodulating drugs were not found to significantly associate with either positive vaccine intent or hesitancy. Discontinuation of biologics during the pandemic was associated with negative vaccine intent, but this relationship disappeared when controlling for race.

We identified surgical procedures using a previously published list of procedure codes. Procedures were stratified by urgency of surgery as defined by NHS England. We calculated the deficit of surgical activity by comparing the expected number of procedures from 2016 to 2019 with the actual number of procedures in 2020. Using a linear regression model, we calculated the expected cumulative number of cancelled procedures by December 31, 2021. RESULTS: The total number of surgical procedures carried out in England and Wales in 2020 was 3 102 674 compared with the predicted number of 4 671 338 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4 218 740C5 123 932).

High-estrogen (low progesterone) phases of the menstrual/estrus cycle were associated with increased stimulant use in preclinical studies, while there were no clinical studies examining estrogen and stimulant consumption. Consistent preclinical evidence supported progesterone use reducing stimulant consumption, which was also identified in one clinical study. The review was limited by inconsistent data reporting across studies and different protocols across preclinical laboratory paradigms. Importantly, almost all studies examined cocaine use, with impact on methamphetamine use a significant gap in the existing evidence. Given the safety and tolerability profile of progesterone, further research is urgently needed to address this gap, to explore the potential therapeutic utility of progesterone as a treatment for stimulant use disorder.","output":"A systematic review of the effect of ovarian sex hormones on stimulant use in females."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Whilst apps and e-tools have tremendous potential as low-cost, scalable mental health intervention and prevention tools, it is essential that consumers and health professionals have a means by which to evaluate their quality and safety. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to: 1) adapt the original Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) in order to be appropriate for the evaluation of both mobile phone applications as well as e-tools; 2) test the reliability of the revised scale; and 3) develop a quality assurance protocol for identifying and rating new apps and e-tools to determine appropriateness for use in clinical practice. METHODS: The MARS was adapted to include items specific to health-related apps and e-tools, such as the availability of resources, strategies for self-management, and quality information. The 41 apps and e-tools in the standard youth configuration of the InnoWell Platform, a digital tool designed to support or enhance mental health service delivery, were independently rated by two expert raters using the A-MARS. Cronbach's alpha was used to calculate the internal consistency and interclass correlation coefficients were used to calculate interrater reliability. RESULTS: The A-MARS was shown to be a reliable scale with acceptable to excellent internal consistency and moderate to excellent interrater reliability across the subscales. Given the ever-increasing number of health information technologies on the market, a protocol to identify and rate new apps and e-tools for potential clinical use is presented. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst the A-MARS is a useful tool to guide health professionals as they explore available apps and e-tools for potential clinical use, the training, time, and skill required to use it effectively may be prohibitive. As such, health professionals and services are likely to benefit from including a digital navigator as part of the care team to assist in selecting and rating apps and e-tools, increasing the usability of the data, and technology troubleshooting. When selecting, evaluating and/or recommending apps and e-tools to consumers, it is important to consider: 1) the availability of explicit strategies to set, monitor and review SMART goals; 2) the accessibility of credible, user friendly information and resources from reputable sources; 3) evidence of effectiveness; and 4) interoperability with other health information technologies.","output":"Evaluating the quality and safety of health-related apps and e-tools: Adapting the Mobile App Rating Scale and developing a quality assurance protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we aim to reveal hidden patterns and confounders associated with policy implementation and adherence by investigating the home\\\\dwelling stages from a data\\\\driven perspective via Bayesian inference with weakly informative priors and by examining how home\\\\dwelling stages in the USA varied geographically, using fine\\\\grained, spatial\\\\explicit home\\\\dwelling time records from a multi\\\\scale perspective.

METHODS: In this unmatched (1:2) case-control validation study, we used sera of 181 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and 326 controls collected before SARS-CoV-2 emergence. Diagnostic accuracy of the immunoassay was assessed against a whole spike protein-based recombinant immunofluorescence assay (rIFA) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Discrepant cases between ELISA and rIFA were further tested by pseudo-neutralization assay. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients were more likely to be male and older than controls, and 50.3% were hospitalized. ROC curve analyses indicated that IgG and IgA had high diagnostic accuracies with AUCs of 0.990 (95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]: 0.983-0.996) and 0.978 (95%CI: 0.967-0.989), respectively. IgG assays outperformed IgA assays (p=0.01). Taking an assessed 15% inter-assay imprecision into account, an optimized IgG ratio cut-off > 2.5 displayed a 100% specificity (95%CI: 99-100) and a 100% positive predictive value (95%CI: 96-100). A 0.8 cut-off displayed a 94% sensitivity (95%CI: 88-97) and a 97% negative predictive value (95%CI: 95-99). Substituting the upper threshold for the manufacturer's, improved assay performance, leaving 8.9% of IgG ratios indeterminate between 0.8-2.5. CONCLUSIONS: The Euroimmun assay displays a nearly optimal diagnostic accuracy using IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples, with no obvious gains from IgA serology. The optimized cut-offs are fit for rule-in and rule-out purposes, allowing determination of whether individuals in our study population have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or not.

METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in a representative sample after 8 weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in Belgium and the Netherlands. The survey included a series of three validated questionnaires about quality of life delayed/cancelled medical care and productivity loss using validated questionnaires. RESULTS: In total, 2099 Belgian and 2058 Dutch respondents completed the survey with a mean age of 46.4 and 42.0 years, respectively. Half of the respondents were female in both countries. A small proportion tested positive for COVID-19, 1.4% vs 4.7%, respectively. The majority of respondents with a medical condition was worried about their current health state due to the pandemic (53%) vs (63%), respectively. Respondents experienced postponed/cancelled care (26%) and were concerned about the availability of medication (32%) for both countries. Productivity losses due to the COVID-19 restrictions were calculated in absenteeism (36%) and presenteeism (30%) for Belgium, and (19%) and (35%) for the Netherlands.

ObjectiveTo systematically assess the validity of reported post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection health outcomes in children. Evidence ReviewA search on PubMed and Web of Science was conducted to identify studies published up to January 22, 2022, that reported on post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection health outcomes in children (<18 years) with follow-up of []2 months since detection of infection or []1 month since recovery from acute illness. We assessed the consideration of confounding bias and causality, and the risk of bias. Findings21 studies including 81,896 children reported up to 97 symptoms with follow-up periods of 2-11.5 months. Fifteen studies had no control group. The reported proportion of children with post-COVID syndrome was between 0% and 66.5% in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=16,986) and 2% to 53.3% in children without SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=64,910). Only 2 studies made a clear causal interpretation of an association of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the main outcome of \\"post-COVID syndrome\\" and provided recommendations regarding prevention measures. Two studies mentioned potential limitations in the conclusion of the main text but none of the 21 studies mentioned any limitations in the abstract nor made a clear statement for cautious interpretation. The validity of all 21 studies was seriously limited due to an overall critical risk of bias (critical risk for confounding bias [n=21]; serious or critical risk for selection bias [n=19]; serious risk for misclassification bias [n=3], for bias due to missing data [n=14] and for outcome measurement [n=12]; and critical risk for selective reporting bias [n=16]). Conclusions and RelevanceThe validity of reported post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection health outcomes in children is critically limited. None of the studies provided evidence with reasonable certainty on whether SARS-CoV-2 infection has an impact on post-acute health outcomes, let alone to what extent. Children and their families urgently need much more reliable and methodologically robust evidence to address their concerns and improve care.

Viral pneumonia caused by common viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses have been more common in children. However, the incidence of COVID-19 in children was significantly lower than that in adults. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations, treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 in children compared to those of other sources of viral pneumonia diagnosed during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: Children with COVID-19 and viral pneumonia admitted to 20 hospitals were enrolled in this retrospective multi-center cohort study. A total of 64 children with COVID-19 were defined as the COVID-19 cohort, of which 40 children who developed pneumonia were defined as the COVID-19 pneumonia cohort. Another 284 children with pneumonia caused by other viruses were defined as the viral pneumonia cohort. Results: Compared to the viral pneumonia cohort, children in the COVID-19 cohort were mostly exposed to family members confirmed to have COVID-19 (53/64 vs. 23/284), were of older median age (6.3 vs. 3.2 years), and had a higher proportion of ground-glass opacity (GGO) on computed tomography (18/40 vs. 0/38) (all P 0.001). Children in the COVID-19 pneumonia cohort had a lower proportion of severe cases (1/40 vs. 38/284, P =0.048), and lower cases with high fever (3/40 vs 167/284, P 0.001), requiring intensive care (1/40 vs 32/284, P 0.047) and with shorter symptomatic duration (median 5 vs 8 days, P 0.001). The proportion of cases with evaluated inflammatory indicators, biochemical indicators related to organ or tissue damage, D-dimer and secondary bacterial infection were lower in the COVID-19 pneumonia cohort than in the viral pneumonia cohort (all P 0.05). No statistical differences were found in the duration of positive PCR results from pharyngeal swabs in 25 children with COVID-19 who received antiviral drugs (lopinavir-ritonavir, ribavirin, and arbidol) as compared to duration in 39 children without antiviral therapy [median 10 vs. 9 days, P =0.885]. Conclusion: The symptoms and severity of COVID-19 pneumonia in children were no more severe than those in children with other viral pneumonias. Lopinavir-ritonavir, ribavirin and arbidol do not shorten the duration of positive PCR results from pharyngeal swabs in children with COVID-19. During the COVID-19 outbreak, attention also must be given to children with infection by other pathogens infection.","output":"Comparison of acute pneumonia caused by SARS-COV-2 and other respiratory viruses in children: a retrospective multi-center cohort study during COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: On June 2, 2021, 6 case reports of myocarditis after the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine surfaced. Each case had a cardiac MRI (CMR) study using T2 weighted and delayed gadolinium imaging. CMR was performed for post-vaccine symptoms. Although valuable, these data do not shed light on the prevalence of this post-vaccine occurrence. This study was designed to assess the prevalence of inflammatory heart disease(IHD) in a group of patients who had a CMR after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Hypothesis: Evidence of myocarditis may occur on cardiac MRI after all types of COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: From January 1 to June 8, 2021 303 patients underwent a CMR at Sharon Regional Medical Center. The date of vaccination, type of vaccine and COVID testing results and date for each of these patients were ascertained. All patients who were vaccinated prior to the CMR exam constituted the study population. IHD by CMR was defined as abnormality of 2 or more pulse sequences of the Modified Lake Louise Criteria(MLLC) of 2018: T2 STIR, Delayed enhancement after gadolinium, and prolongation of myocardial or pericardial T1 or T2 relaxation times. The number of patients with CMR evidence of IHD was tabulated for Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson&Johnson(J&J) vaccines. Results: Of 303 patients with a CMR during the study period, 77 were vaccinated prior to CMR. The mean time between vaccination and CMR was 41 days. 42 patients had a Pfizer vaccine, 30 had Moderna and 5 received J&J. 10 Pfizer receipants had IHD findings on CMR(24%), as did 7 of Moderna(23%) and 2 of J&J(40%). 13 patients had a positive COVID test prior to vaccination and IHD was present on CMR in 9 patients(69%) in this subgroup, while only 8 of 63(13%) without a positive COVID-19 test before vaccination showed evidence of IHD. Conclusions: Although retrospective, these data provide valuable information about the occurrence of IHD after COVID-19 vaccination using CMR imaging. A similar percentage of patients vaccinated with any of the 3 vaccines appear to subsequently show evidence of IHD on CMR, more so if previously COVID positive. However, evidence of IHD on post-vaccine CMR does not definitively establish causality. CMR exams before and after COVID-19 vaccination using MLLC will be required to prove a cause-effect relationship.","output":"Inflammatory heart disease after covid-19 vaccination: A preliminary cardiac mri perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetes is associated with poor clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Federal data do not distinguish transaction costs, but they do suggest that the cost of purchasing properties often accounts for 80% or less of total project costs. Through a systematic review (n = 1103 publications) and an analysis of government budgets (across n = 859 jurisdiction-years), we find limited sources with relevant cost information, none of which reports transaction costs.

Methods: We searched for GF type of foods in three different supermarkets of each chain in Mexicali Baja California and Hermosillo Sonora and corroborated the price, origin, and GF certification of each item using internet sites. We quantified the gluten in the foods using the sandwich R5-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and detected their immune-reactivity for IgA from patients with CD. Results: The study included >263 different GF-labeled foodstuffs, and 55% of them were made in Mexico. The Mexican items were principally flours, sausages, bread and bakery, milk-type products, and tortillas, while pasta, snacks, and breakfast cereals were mainly imported. The cost ratio of GF products to the conventional mean was 3.5, ranging principally from 1 to 13. The most common GF-labeled foods were flours and pasta (34), cookies and snacks (32), breakfast cereals, sausages, and milk-type products (18C20). Although 36% of the products were certified, 17.4% of the analyzed samples contained >20 mg gluten/kg, mainly the non-certified ones and those made in Mexico. IgA from patients with CD reacted in vitro against gluten proteins from the contaminated GF-labeled products. Conclusion: The accessibility of GF products in the northwestern Mexican market is wide; however, such products are expensive, and some could be risky for patients with CD because they contain gluten, which is recognized by the immune systems of these patients.","output":"Gluten-Free Labeling Is Misused Frequently in Foods Marketed in Northwestern Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During an epidemic, accurate long term forecasts are crucial for decision-makers to adopt appropriate policies and to prevent medical resources from being overwhelmed. This came to the forefront during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which there were numerous efforts to predict the number of new infections. Various classes of models were employed for forecasting including compartmental models and curve-fitting approaches. Curve fitting models often have accurate short term forecasts. Their parameters, however, can be difficult to associate with actual disease dynamics. Compartmental models take these dynamics into account, allowing for more flexible and interpretable models that facilitate qualitative comparison of scenarios. This paper proposes a method of strengthening the forecasts from compartmental models by using short term pre-dictions from a curve fitting approach as synthetic data.

Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the OI OSI and PaO2/FiO2 as risk factors for 28 days mortality of pneumonia COVID-19 patients with ARDS. In a total of 77 patients eligible for the analyses it was observed that OI was independently associated with hospital mortality (p 0.043) while OSI and PaO2/FiO2 ratio were not statistically significant. From these three variables the AUC for mortality prediction was the greatest for OI (AUC 0.935 p<0.05). In conclusion OI is the only one that is proven to be the independent predictor mortality with the highest sensitivity and specificity compared to the OSI and PaO2/FiO2 ratio for patients with pneumonia COVID-19 with ARDS.","output":"Analisis faktor risiko oxygenation index oxygen saturation index dan rasio PaO2/FiO2 sebagai prediktor mortalitas pasien pneumonia COVID-19 dengan ARDS di ruang perawatan intensif isolasi khusus RSUD Dr Soetomo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 73-year-old male patient underwent operative treatment for dislocation of multiple costochondral junctions alongside multiple bony rib fractures and a flail chest following high-energy trauma.

METHODS: We included 213 patients with a positive real time polymerase chain reaction (RT\\\\PCR) test and chest computed tomography (CT) from an out\\\\hospital facility and a hospital. We obtained information on demographics; weight; height; smoking history; diabetes; hypertension; and cardiovascular, lung, and renal disease. Two radiologists scored the CO\\\\RADs system (COVID\\\\19 Reporting and Data System) (1 = normal, 2 = inconsistent, 3C4 = indeterminate, and 5 = typical findings) and the chest CT severity index (20 of 40 was considered severe disease). They evaluated the liver\\\\to\\\\spleen ratio (CT(L/S)) and defined tomographic steatosis as a CT(L/S) index 0.9. We used descriptive statistics, (2) and t student tests, logistic regression, and reported odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Of the patients, 61% were men, with a mean age of 51.2 years, 48.3% were CO\\\\RADs 1 and 51.7% CO\\\\RADs 2C5. Severe tomographic disease was present in 103 patients (48.4%), all CO\\\\RADs 5.

Confounding by individual-level risk factors in observational studies like these is relatively well appreciated. Here, we show how geographic structure and the underlying, natural dynamics of epidemics can also induce noncausal associations. We take the approach of simulating serologic studies in the context of an uncontrolled or a controlled epidemic, under different assumptions about whether prior infection does or does not protect an individual against subsequent infection, and using various designs and analytic approaches to analyze the simulated data. We find that in studies assessing the efficacy of serostatus on future infection, comparing seropositive individuals to seronegative individuals with similar time-dependent patterns of exposure to infection, by stratifying or matching on geographic location and time of enrollment, is essential to prevent bias.","output":"Potential biases arising from epidemic dynamics in observational seroprotection studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: After the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19), pediatric involvement has been seen as case reports with various initial symptoms Case Presentation: Here, we report a 2-months old boy with severe dehydration, fever, and electrolyte imbalance with lung involvement compatible with COVID-19 in the Northeast of Iran (North Khorasan) Conclusions: Pediatric case reports in COVID-19 are limited, and it seems that the disease has a milder course compared to the adult patients, but the range of the clinical features is wide","output":"Fever and dehydration as the first COVID-19 presentation in a 2-months old boy in northeast of Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The first wave of COVID-19 infections caused disturbances in all aspects of personal and professional lives. The aim of this study was to explore the ways in which that first wave of novel coronavirus infections resulted in uncertainties, as experienced by members of the oral health care workforce in British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: This qualitative inquiry purposefully recruited frontline oral health care workers, including dentists, dental hygienists, certified dental assistants, and administrative staff, via remote semi-structured interviews between April 20 and May 4, 2020. Coding, categories, and themes were inductively assigned. RESULTS: A total of 45 interviews, lasting between 39 and 74 minutes each, were conducted involving 18 dentists (6 females), 12 dental hygienists (11 females), 6 certified dental assistants (all females), and 9 administrators/front-desk staff (7 females). Fifty-one hours of audio recordings and more than 650 single-spaced pages of transcripts were produced. Five main themes emerged pertaining to uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, patient care, personal lives and infectiousness, concern for the future, and variations among different pandemics. Certitudes were less evident, but surfaced mostly when considering a potential new normal resulting from the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Participants indicated that the uncertainties they felt were dependent upon what is known, and unknown, about the pandemic and the provision of oral health care during the first wave of infections.

However, its catalytic efficiency and effective simultaneous reduction of mixed dye is still a challenge. Here, we have tuned the physiochemical properties of the GCN and melem derivatives by facilely tuning the degree of polycondensation and examined their catalytic activity towards the removal of cationic dye individually and together in solution. Catalysts were synthesized by thermal treatment of low-cost melamine and characterized by XRD, FTIR, RAMAN, FE-SEM, EDX, UV-DRS, and PL to confirm materials' structure, phase, morphology, and optical properties. A suitable phase of the catalyst (M - 450) exhibited superior removal capacity with a high-rate constant compared to others. The results demonstrate that M - 450 has a maximum loading efficacy of 2.13 and 1.12 mg g-1 for methylene blue (MB) and Rhodamine B (RhB) dyes respectively in a single dye system. Attractively, when MB and RhB co-exist in the solution, the efficacy increased by 14% (2.44 mg g-1) and 27% (1.43 mg g-1) for MB and RhB respectively. The adsorption kinetics, stability, effect of pH and reusability of M - 450 are testified. Further, radical scavenger experiments and terephthalic acid tests were carried out to explain the reaction mechanism involved in the degradation of textile dyes.

Growth-based high-throughput screening is concomitant with drug repurposing and enables rapid identification of new therapeutic uses for investigated drugs; however, this traditional method is not compatible with microorganisms with abnormal growth patterns such as Staphylococcus aureus small-colony variants (SCV). SCV subpopulations are auxotrophic for key compounds in biosynthetic pathways, which result in low growth rate. SCV formation is also associated with reduced antibiotic susceptibility, and the SCVs ability to revert to the normal cell growth state is thought to contribute to recurrence of S. aureus infections. Thus, there is a critical need to identify antimicrobial agents that are potent against SCV in order to effectively treat chronic infections. Accordingly, here we describe adapting an adenylate kinase (AK)-based cell death reporter assay to identify members of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library that display bactericidal activity against S. aureus SCV. Four library members, daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, and sitafloxacin, exhibited potent SCV bactericidal activity against a stable S. aureus SCV. Further investigation showed that sitafloxacin was potent against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus, as well as S. aureus within an established biofilm. Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability to use the AK assay to screen small-molecule libraries for SCV bactericidal agents and highlight the therapeutic potential of sitafloxacin to be repurposed to treat chronic S. aureus infections associated with SCV and/or biofilm growth states. IMPORTANCE Conventional antibiotics fail to successfully treat chronic osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and device-related and airway infections. These recurring infections are associated with the emergence of SCV, which are recalcitrant to conventional antibiotics. Studies have investigated antibiotic therapies to treat SCV-related infections but have had little success, emphasizing the need to identify novel antimicrobial drugs. However, drug discovery is a costly and time-consuming process. An alternative strategy is drug repurposing, which could identify FDA-approved and well-characterized drugs that could have off-label utility in treating SCV. In this study, we adapted a high-throughput AK-based assay to identify 4 FDA-approved drugs, daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, and sitafloxacin, which display antimicrobial activity against S. aureus SCV, suggesting an avenue for drug repurposing in order to effectively treat SCV-related infections. Additionally, this screening paradigm can easily be adapted for other drug/chemical libraries to identify compounds bactericidal against SCV.","output":"A High-Throughput Screening Approach To Repurpose FDA-Approved Drugs for Bactericidal Applications against Staphylococcus aureus Small-Colony Variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global health crisis, yet, the immunopathological mechanisms driving the development of severe disease remain poorly defined. Here, we utilize a rhesus macaque (RM) model of SARS-CoV-2 infection to delineate perturbations in the innate immune system during acute infection using an integrated systems analysis. We found that SARS-CoV-2 initiated a rapid infiltration (two days post infection) of plasmacytoid dendritic cells into the lower airway, commensurate with IFNA production, natural killer cell activation, and induction of interferon-stimulated genes. At this early interval, we also observed a significant increase of blood CD14-CD16+ monocytes. To dissect the contribution of lung myeloid subsets to airway inflammation, we generated a novel compendium of RM-specific lung macrophage gene expression using a combination of sc-RNA-Seq data and bulk RNA-Seq of purified populations under steady state conditions. Using these tools, we generated a longitudinal sc-RNA-seq dataset of airway cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected RMs. We identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection elicited a rapid recruitment of two subsets of macrophages into the airway: a C206+MRC1-population resembling murine interstitial macrophages, and a TREM2+ population consistent with CCR2+ infiltrating monocytes, into the alveolar space. These subsets were the predominant source of inflammatory cytokines, accounting for ~75% of IL6 and TNF production, and >90% of IL10 production, whereas the contribution of CD206+MRC+ alveolar macrophages was significantly lower. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected RMs with baricitinib (Olumiant?), a novel JAK1/2 inhibitor that recently received Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, was remarkably effective in eliminating the influx of infiltrating, non-alveolar macrophages in the alveolar space, with a concomitant reduction of inflammatory cytokines. This study has delineated the major subsets of lung macrophages driving inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production within the alveolar space during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Patients diagnosed with severe or critical cases have a poor prognosis. Hence, it is crucial for us to identify potentially severe or critical cases early and give timely treatments for targeted patients. In the clinical practice of treating patients with COVID-19, we have observed that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of severe patients is higher than that in mild patients. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the predictive values of NLR on disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang databases to identify eligible studies (up to August 11, 2020). Two authors independently screened studies and extracted data. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed by Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2). RESULTS: Thirteen studies involving 1579 patients reported the predictive value of NLR on disease severity. The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and area under curve (AUC) were 0.78 (95% CI 0.70-0.84), 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.83) and 0.85 (95% CI 0.81-0.88), respectively. Ten studies involving 2967 patients reported the predictive value of NLR on mortality. The pooled SEN, SPE and AUC were 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.89), 0.83 (95% CI 0.74-0.89) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.87-0.92), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NLR has good predictive values on disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. Evaluating NLR can help clinicians identify potentially severe cases early, conduct early triage and initiate effective management in time, which may reduce the overall mortality of COVID-19.

These networks reveal how social distancing measures and the public's reaction to the incipient pandemic affected the connectivity patterns within the city. We find that as the pandemic developed there was a substantial decrease in the number of individuals with many contacts. We further study the impact of these different network topologies on the spread of COVID-19 by simulating an SEIR epidemic model over these networks, and find that the reduced connectivity greatly suppressed the epidemic. We then investigate how the epidemic responds when part of the population is vaccinated, and we compare two vaccination distribution strategies, both with and without social distancing. Our main result is that the heavy-tailed degree distribution of the contact networks causes a targeted vaccination strategy that prioritizes high-contact individuals to reduce the number of cases far more effectively than a strategy that vaccinates individuals at random. Combining both targeted vaccination and social distancing leads to the greatest reduction in cases, and we also find that the marginal benefit of a targeted strategy as compared to a random strategy exceeds the marginal benefit of social distancing for reducing the number of cases. These results have important implications for ongoing vaccine distribution efforts worldwide.","output":"Modeling the Impact of Social Distancing and Targeted Vaccination on the Spread of COVID-19 through a Real City-Scale Contact Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence, nature and risk factors for the main clinical sequelae in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors who have been discharged from the hospital for more than 3 months. METHODS: This longitudinal study was based on a telephone follow-up survey of COVID-19 patients hospitalized and discharged from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China before 1 March 2020. Demographic and clinical characteristics and self-reported clinical sequelae of the survivors were described and analysed. A cohort of volunteers who were free of COVID-19 and lived in the urban area of Wuhan during the outbreak were also selected as the comparison group. RESULTS: Among 538 survivors (293, 54.5% female), the median (interquartile range) age was 52.0 (41.0-62.0) years, and the time from discharge from hospital to first follow-up was 97.0 (95.0-102.0) days. Clinical sequelae were common, including general symptoms (n = 267, 49.6%), respiratory symptoms (n = 210, 39%), cardiovascular-related symptoms (n = 70, 13%), psychosocial symptoms (n = 122, 22.7%) and alopecia (n = 154, 28.6%). We found that physical decline/fatigue (p < 0.01), postactivity polypnoea (p= 0.04) and alopecia (p < 0.01) were more common in female than in male subjects. Dyspnoea during hospitalization was associated with subsequent physical decline/fatigue, postactivity polypnoea and resting heart rate increases but not specifically with alopecia. A history of asthma during hospitalization was associated with subsequent postactivity polypnoea sequela.

The underdeveloped medical infrastructure and inadequate healthcare staff have become a dilemma during this pandemic fostering the need for digital health system. In this paper we propose Diagnose A Disease (DAD), a novel telehealth solution in Pakistan for remote patient monitoring and disease diagnosis. The three layered hybrid architecture of DAD comprises of data collection layer, analytics engine layer and cloud storage layer. In the first module, vital physiological signs of patients are measured and recorded through a set of wearable sensors. The next module makes use of fog enabled cloud framework for resource management of worker nodes. The analytics engine module also includes a trained Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory neural network model for heart disease, blood pressure and diabetes classification. Finally, the last module makes use of the cloud service for data storage, analysis and distributed secured health data sharing among medical authorities. The telehealth solution comes with emergency notifications, standard clinical guidelines and many advanced features with fog service to reduce latency and delays that becomes crucial in healthcare applications. PureEdgeSim, a simulation toolkit for fog environments is used to evaluate the proposed DAD model in terms of latency, bandwidth usage, power consumption, execution period and accuracy. Results depict that the proposed architecture performed well in handling real time requests, resource utilization and response time for healthcare decision making which further enhances its utility in real life situations. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Diagnose a Disease: A Fog Assisted Disease Diagnosis Framework with Bidirectional LSTM"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic affected human life globally, inducing much stress on daily living (?ak?ro?lu et al. 2020). Although assessments of general mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic have been widely reported, there is not adequate research on how schizophrenia patients have been affected. According to the World Health Organization (2020), individuals with chronic diseases who do not pay attention to their personal hygiene and the rules of protection from COVID-19 have a higher risk of getting infected than the healthy individuals who observe these measures. It is well known that the risk of Covid-19 infection is raised among schizophrenia patients due to negligence on the requisite control of personal hygiene and health conditions related to smoking and diabetes ( Cohn et al., 2004;Dinan et al., 2004;Krieger et al. 2019). The cognitive impairment in this disorder which reduces the perceptions on the necessity of self protection and the awareness of the risks proposed to underlie this raised risk of COVID-19 positivity (Yao et al. 2020). These patients have difficulty in following the preventive regulations (Palomar-Ciria et al., 2020). Apart from the risk of infection, there is also the risk of pandemic related development of auditory or visual hallucinations and delusional symptoms by acute and chronic psychosis patients during and after the pandemic (Brown et al. 2020, Cowan 2020).

In contrast to other compression devices, its field of application is identical to circular staplers. Yet, limited data are available and there are no reports on the use of this compression device for anastomoses in the lower rectum and in diverted cases. METHODS Between November 2008 and March 2010 a nonrandomized prospective study of patients undergoing colorectal resection was done. RESULTS Sixty-two patients (30 female) with a median age of 67 years (range = 23-87) underwent surgery for benign (35) and malignant (27) indications;the surgery was performed laparoscopically in 53 (85.5%) cases. There were no leaks or other major complications related to the compression anastomosis. One patient died from sepsis caused by a leak of a colonic J-pouch. Three of 12 (25%) patients after (ultra-)low anterior resection experienced pain caused by the presence of the ring. Of 53 undiverted patients, rings were passed spontaneously in 52 (98.1%). No spontaneous passage occurred in patients with a stoma. Their rings were removed transanally prior to stoma closure. After a median of 6 months, endoscopic follow-up was performed in 60 patients (96.8%). Two anastomotic stenoses were detected (3.3%). CONCLUSION Construction of rectal anastomosis using this novel compression device is feasible and safe and appears to cause only few anastomotic strictures in the medium term.

However, it is also important for clinicians and epidemiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza viruses. RESEARCH QUESTION: The aim of this study was to explore the different clinical presentations between COVID-19 and influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia in patients with ARDS. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This analysis was a retrospective case-control study. Two independent cohorts of patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 (n = 73) or H1N1 (n = 75) were compared. Their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, treatments, and prognosis were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: The median age of patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of patients with H1N1, and there was a higher proportion of male subjects among the H1N1 cohort (P < .05). Patients with COVID-19 exhibited higher proportions of nonproductive coughs, fatigue, and GI symptoms than those of patients with H1N1 (P < .05). Patients with H1N1 had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores than patients with COVID-19 (P < .05). The Pao2/Fio2 of 198.5 mm Hg in the COVID-19 cohort was significantly higher than the Pao2/Fio2 of 107.0 mm Hg in the H1N1 cohort (P < .001). Ground-glass opacities was more common in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with H1N1 (P < .001). There was a greater variety of antiviral therapies administered to COVID-19 patients than to H1N1 patients. The in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 was 28.8%, whereas that of patients with H1N1 was 34.7% (P = .483). SOFA score-adjusted mortality of H1N1 patients was significantly higher than that of COVID-19 patients, with a rate ratio of 2.009 (95% CI, 1.563-2.583; P < .001). INTERPRETATION: There were many differences in clinical presentations between patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 or H1N1. Compared with H1N1 patients, patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS had lower severity of illness scores at presentation and lower SOFA score-adjusted mortality.","output":"Comparison of Hospitalized Patients With ARDS Caused by COVID-19 and H1N1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are high hopes that a development towards smarter urban environments, backed up by various big data sources, can help solve many of the challenges facing today's large cities related to providing security, mitigating environmental damages, improving services and upscaling innovative and entrepreneurial activities. This study explores the acceptance of use of mobile phone data (MPD) in different areas, and how it is related to different types of trust. Based on a representative survey of citizens in the two smart cities, Oslo and Tallinn, four similar trust cultures are located. The acceptance of use of MPD differed significantly between the trust cultures and, as expected, was significantly stronger in groups with higher levels of trust, either generally or in terms of reliance on technologies. The acceptance of use of MPD for commercial product development was low for all groups. Findings suggest that future users of MPD need to be aware of the significant scepticism toward and rejection of the use of such data in large parts of the population. Unless visions of the smart city are grounded in the needs and wants of citizens, such plans are not likely to succeed, and negative understandings and images of a panoptic state may take stronger hold.

The overall all-cause 30-day mortality rate was 0.41%, however in patients who contracted COVID-19, the mortality rate was 25.71% (n = 9); this was significantly higher for patients undergoing diabetic foot surgery (75%, n = 3 deaths). Matching for age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, and comorbidities, the odds ratio of mortality with COVID-19 infection was 11.71 (95% confidence interval 1.55 to 88.74; p = 0.017). There were no differences in surgical complications or infection rates prior to or after lockdown, and among patients with and without COVID-19 infection. After lockdown the COVID-19 infection rate was 0.15% and no patient died of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection was rare in foot and ankle patients even at the peak of lockdown. However, there was a significant mortality rate in those who contracted COVID-19. Overall surgical complications and postoperative infection rates remained unchanged during the period of this audit. Patients and treating medical personnel should be aware of the risks to enable informed decisions.

Evaluating current implementation efforts and identifying current research gaps may inform future implementation. This scoping review explores studies implementing cancer-specific exercise programs to determine their pragmatic characteristics and evaluate potential for translation into practice. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted using five databases (up to July 2020) to identify implementation studies that used qualitative or quantitative methods. Program pragmatism was evaluated using the PRECIS/RE-AIM tool. RESULTS Fourteen articles were included for review. While programs were moderately pragmatic (average: 3.4; range: 2.8-4.2), variability was observed between scoring domains. Programs scored higher (more pragmatic) in domains typical for effectiveness studies, including participant eligibility, follow-up intensity, primary trial outcome, and analysis of primary outcome. In contrast, programs scored lower (less pragmatic) in domains aligned with implementation science, including intervention flexibility, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Limited information was reported regarding program fidelity, adaptations, and maintenance/sustainability. CONCLUSION Researchers should consider the pragmatism of interventions, the nuances of program adoption and implementation at the setting level, and the transition and integration of programming into the healthcare system. Future studies may benefit from the inclusion of decision-makers and implementation experts and shifting focus towards flexible programming. PRECIS/RE-AIM may facilitate the evaluation of programs throughout the study design and implementation process. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS The implementation of pragmatic exercise programs that are both scalable and sustainable is needed so that cancer survivors can experience exercise-related benefits beyond research settings.","output":"Evaluating implementation and pragmatism of cancer-specific exercise programs: a scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Vodobatinib, a novel 3rd generation (3G) TKI effective against wild-type and mutated BCR-ABL1 with limited off-target activity, was evaluated in a Phase I multicentre dose-escalation study in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients (pts) who failed  3 TKIs or less (if not eligible for other approved 3G TKIs) (NCT02629692). The activity and safety of vodobatinib was evaluated in ponatinib treated (PT) and ponatinib na?ve (PN) chronic phase (CP)-CML subjects in an exploratory analysis. Methods: Multiple escalating doses of vodobatinib (once daily) in 28-day cycles were evaluated in a 3+3 study design. The primary objective was determination of the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) along with safety and a secondary objective was to evaluate anti-leukemic activity. Dose escalation involved dose doubling until 2 pts in a cohort experienced Grade 2 toxicity, or 1 pt experienced Grade 3 or 4 toxicity, after which dose escalation was reduced to 40% increments. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression (PD), consent withdrawal, or death. Results: As of 15 Jul 2020, 31 CP-CML pts received vodobatinib at doses of 12 to 240 mg;16 pts (9 males) in ponatinib treated (PT) cohort [7 (44%) ponatinib was the immediate prior TKI] and 15 pts (7 males) in the ponatinib na?ve (PN) cohort. The baseline demographics and disease history are represented in Table 1. Efficacy: Median duration of treatment was 17.3 (0.6-36) and 14.8 (0.5- 42) months in the Ponatinib treated and naive groups, respectively;11 pts in the PT group [2 in Deep molecular response (DMR), 3 in MMR;5 in MCyR (2 in CCyR and 3 in PCyR);1 in stable disease] and 10 pts in the PN group (2 in DMR, 4 in MMR and 3 in CCyR, 1 in stable disease) are continuing on treatment. Overall efficacy outcomes are included in Tables 2 and 3. Of 16 PT pts, 2 (13%) pts, both with double mutations, had disease progression. Of 15 PN pts, 4 (26%) pts (with baseline mutation of T315I at 48 mg, Y253H at 66 mg, F317L and E255V mutation at 174 mg) progressed. Safety: In ponatinib treated pts, the most commonly reported treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), (all grades) included nausea (4, 25%) and diarrhea (3, 25%). Other commonly reported TEAEs included thrombocytopenia (3, 19%), rash (3, 19%), non-cardiac chest pain (3, 19%), increased amylase (3, 19%), and fall (3, 19%). Grade  3 TEAEs were reported in 10 (63%) pts included 1 pt each with anemia, lymphopenia, fall, skull fracture, spinal fracture, lipase increase, fluid overload, syncope, dyspnea, and hypertension. Vodobatinib related AEs included amylase increase, lipase increase, dyspnea, fluid overload, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Grade  3 TEAEs reported in more than one pt included neutropenia (2, 13%) amylase increase (2, 13%) and thrombocytopenia (2, 13%). In PN pts, the most commonly reported TEAEs (all grades) included myalgia (5, 33%) and back pain (4, 27%). Other commonly reported TEAEs were thrombocytopenia (4, 27%), and nasopharyngitis (3, 20%).Grade  3 TEAEs were reported in 7 (47%) pts (1 pt with anemia, 1 pt with pneumonia, 1 pt with neutropenia, 1 pt with gout, hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia, 1 pt with increased liver and pancreatic enzymes and 1 pt each with dementia and amnesia. Vodobatinib related AEs included alanine aminotransferase increase, blood bilirubin increased, amnesia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. No grade  3 event was reported in more than 1 pt. Overall, three cardiovascular TEAEs were reported, in 2 pts (1 each in PT and PN), all deemed unrelated to vodobatinib. Three pts died on study: 1 due to disease progression in the PT group;1 due to pneumonia (suspected COVID-19) and 1 due to intracranial hemorrhage in the PN group. The intracranial hemorrhage event (Grade 5 AE) was considered possibly related and was confounded by disease progression to blast phase that included extra-medullary sites. At the highest dose of 240 mg, two dose limiting toxicities were reported. The next lower dose level of 204 mg was est blished as MTD with a favorable safety profile in heavily pre-treated CP-CML pts. Conclusion: Vodobatinib was evaluated over 9 escalating doses. Comparable and promising efficacy was noted in both PT (50% CCyR) and PN (67% CCyR) groups, meriting further study of vodobatinib as a potential new agent for treatment of previously treated CP-CML.

Public transportation is less accessible and walking distance of getting to public transportation is too long in some cities. Compared to other cities, Seoul has a higher satisfaction rate with public transportation. There are many cases, however, where short-distance taxis are used because walking to destinations after using public transportation is inconvenient; instead, Personal mobility (PM) devices can be used for these short-distances trip. This study aims to find the optimal PM service area using GIS(Geographic Information System)-based public transportation big data analyses. Variables were generated by collecting socio-economic factors, public transportation data, and geographic data and Extreme gradient boosting and Random forest, which are representative ensemble methods, were used for evaluation. We divided Seoul into a hexagonal grid and developed the optimal PM location service model by creating hexagonal cell data units and analyzing the areas with the models. We found that residential complexes, parks, and near subway stations (all areas with high foot traffic) are best suited for optimal placement. We also determined deployment should be in lower sloped areas.

There is sparse documentation demonstrating stepwise frameworks for the implementation of effective and efficient health facilities maintenance management tools and techniques. METHOD This study discusses the development and evaluation of the FCC Council. Clarity to the literature sources guiding the development of the FCC Council is provided, followed by the survey approach undertaken to assess Council efficacy based on participants' perceptions. Data are analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS Our study suggests routine cross-functional synchronous FCC Council meetings improve perceptions of safety and communication, encourage teamwork, and are more productive when conducted using synchronous rather than asynchronous communication. Clinician participants strongly supported the face-to-face meeting approach and considered such meetings more effective as they are perceived to maintain staff and patient safety as a constant organizational focus. CONCLUSION The FCC's perceived effectiveness toward improving healthcare facilities maintenance planning centers on engaged leadership, the inclusion of diverse subject matter experts, and structured group facilitation.

The model is calibrated with data on deaths and testing outcomes in the Unites States. It is shown that an intermediate but prolonged lockdown is socially optimal when both mortality and GDP are taken into account. This is because the government wants the economy to keep producing some output and the slack in reducing infection is picked up by social distancing agents. Social distancing best responds to the optimal government policy to keep the effective reproductive number at one and avoid multiple waves through the pandemic. Calibration shows testing to have been effective, but it could have been even more instrumental if it had been aggressively pursued from the beginning of the pandemic. Not having any lockdown or shutting down social distancing would have had extreme consequences. Greater centralized control on social activities would have mitigated further the spread of the pandemic.","output":"Behavioral epidemiology: An economic model to evaluate optimal policy in the midst of a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Even before social distancing disrupted normative expectations and prompted an immediate shift to remote doctor/patient interactions, technology companies-Amazon, Apple, and Google-were preparing to disrupt medical care through the innovative use of technology.

Family childcare homes (FCCH) care for many children of low-income and diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds who are at greater risk for poor diet quality, low PA, and obesity, but few interventions have targeted this setting. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a multicomponent intervention conducted in FCCH on the diet quality and PA of 2-5 year old children in their care. TRIAL DESIGN Cluster randomized trial. METHODS The cluster-randomized trial, Healthy Start/Comienzos Sanos (2015-2019) evaluated an 8-month nutrition and PA intervention that included four components: (1) monthly telephone calls from a support coach using brief motivational interviewing, (2) tailored reports, newsletters and videos, (3) group support meetings, and (4) active play toys. After completing baseline measurement, FCCH were randomized into intervention or comparison groups in matched pairs. Both groups received the same intervention components but on different topics (intervention: nutrition/PA vs. comparison: reading readiness/literacy). Evaluation staff were blinded to group assignment. Child primary outcome measures collected at baseline and 8-months included: 1) Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2015) scores calculated from diet observation, and 2) accelerometer measurement of PA. Process measures were collected from field data and provider surveys. Generalized Estimating Equation Models assessed changes in HEI-2015 scores and PA over time by experimental condition. RESULTS Ethnically diverse FCCH providers (n = 119) and 2-to-5-year-old children in their care (n = 377) were included in the final analysis. Process evaluation showed high participation in all intervention components except for group meetings. Compared to children in comparison group FCCH, children in intervention FCCH increased total HEI-2015 scores by 7.2 points (p < .001) including improvement in component scores for vegetables (0.84 points, p = .025) and added sugar (0.94 points, p = .025). For PA, compared to children in the comparison group, children in intervention FCCH decreased sedentary time by 5.7% (p = .021). CONCLUSIONS The multicomponent Healthy Start intervention was effective in improving diet quality and sedentary behavior of children in FCCH, which demonstrates the promise of obesity prevention interventions in this setting. Future research could include enhancing the Healthy Start intervention to strengthen the PA component, considering virtual peer support, and determining how to best translate and disseminate the intervention into FCCH nationally.

Competition in pharmaceutical R&D, and for generic entry, produces essential drugs and ensures that medications are accessible and affordable. That promise is fading. There is mounting evidence that connects high market concentration and high drug prices. Price gouging for important drugs, conspiracies to fix generic drug prices, and ever more innovative schemes by branded drug manufacturers to keep generic rivals out of the market put merger control at center stage.The AAI White Paper From Competition to Conspiracy: Accessing the Federal Trade Commissions Merger Policy in the Pharmaceutical Sector examines a major root of this problemthe Federal Trade Commissions (FTCs) policy of settling virtually all challenged horizontal pharmaceutical mergers with consent orders requiring divestitures. This stands in contrast to agency decisions to seek injunctions to stop highly concentrative, harmful mergersarguably the most effective remedy for fully restoring competition. AAIs macro-analysis of pharmaceutical mergers challenged by the FTC between 1994-2020 (to date) reveals that many drug makers engaged in serial mergers and/or repeatedly went to the till to purchase divestiture assets in other challenged mergers. Many of these firms were subsequently acquired by other pharmaceutical manufacturers, sometimes shortly after purchasing divestiture assets.The effect of the FTCs policy has been the swapping of assets within a relatively small group of large and increasingly powerful firms. Just under 20% of all unique branded and generic firms that engaged in repeated mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and/or purchases of divestiture assets account for almost 45% of pharmaceutical assets changing hands from 1994-2020. Many of the very firms that were the most active in M&A, and as purchasers of divestiture assets, appear as defendants in private, state, and federal non-merger antitrust litigations and in federal criminal indictments. These accumulating lawsuits serve as powerful evidence that something has gone awry with merger policy in the pharmaceutical sector, leading to the exercise of market power by dominant firms and oligopolies.The FTCs role in managing the allocation and ownership of important pharmaceutical assets through its extraordinary approach toward merger control has unduly involved it in shaping the industry. This resembles a form of industrial planning rather than antitrust law enforcement, which is designed to deter future anticompetitive conduct and relies on market forces to determine market structures. The FTCs policy has also deprived the antitrust community and public of important transparency. Because no challenged merger between 1994-2020 was litigated in federal court, there is no judicial record detailing how highly concentrative mergers were likely to have survived a presumption of illegality. There is thus no way to evaluate claims that pharmaceutical mergers were likely to have delivered lower prices through claimed cost savings or consumer benefits due to improved quality and innovation.This White Paper begins with background on drug pricing and competition in the pharmaceutical supply chain. It then turns to the drug mergers themselves and the asset divestitures required in FTC consent orders. Next is an assessment of private, state, and federal antitrust cases against the companies involved in M&A and as buyers of divestiture assets. It concludes with policy recommendations on reframing competition policy in the pharmaceutical sector. The FTC, which has devoted considerable resources and expertise to understanding the pharmaceutical sector, should take the lead in reforming its own policy on merger control.Competition problems in pharmaceuticals now rise to the level a public policy concern, addressable only through a coordinated policy response, of which stronger antitrust enforcement and legislative reform should be central componen s. The imperative for wholesale change in the FTCs merger policy in the pharmaceutical sector is more pressing than ever. Only robust competition among drug makers will result in the availability and affordability of drugs more generally, but also essential drug therapies and vaccines relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"From Competition to Conspiracy: Assessing the Federal Trade Commission's Merger Policy in the Pharmaceutical Sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to promote the ecological civilization construction of industries, carry out the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the five major development philosophies, including innovation, coordination, greenness, openness and sharing, it is necessary to resolutely boost green development and push forward industrial transformation and upgrading.

To potentially facilitate preparedness plans for future pandemics, we retrospectively quantitated surges in all-cause mechanical ventilator use during peak influenza for 12 consecutive years in all certified hospitals in Maryland. METHODS: Influenza testing data obtained for the Centers for Disease Control and Protection, Health and Human Services region 3, included defined peak influenza outbreak periods (PIOP), non-influenza time periods (non-ITP), and proportions of circulating influenza types for all study years. Procedure codes for mechanical ventilator use and diagnostic codes for medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI) were reviewed for every Maryland hospitalization. Daily counts of hospitalizations associated with ventilator use or MAARI during PIOP compared to non-ITP were analyzed using Poisson regression adjusted for month and year. RESULTS: Ventilator use increased during PIOP by 7% (95% CI, 5-10) over non-ITP (P < .0001) for all study years. These annual surges correlated with influenza season intensity, as measured by MAARI-related hospitalizations (correlation coefficient = 0.91, P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Surges in ventilator use were temporally associated with PIOP and were positively correlated with influenza season intensity, as measured by hospitalizations associated with acute respiratory illness.

Previous research has shown that patients usually have positive experiences of online therapy, however, with large individual differences. The aim of this study was to explore patients experiences of transition from in-person psychotherapy sessions to telepsychotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as variation in the experiences with regard to the patients personality orientation. Seven psychotherapy patients in Sweden were interviewed and the transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Additionally, the participants were asked to rate their dissatisfaction/satisfaction with the transition, how hindering/helpful the transition was, and how unsafe/safe they felt after the transition in comparison to before. Personality orientation on relatedness or self-definition was assessed applying a self-assessment instrument (Prototype Matching of Anaclitic-Introjective Personality Configuration; PMAI). The participants experienced telepsychotherapy as qualitatively different from in-person psychotherapy. They reported several essential losses: the rituals surrounding therapy sessions were lost, including the transitional time and space between their every-day life and the therapy sessions, less therapeutic work was done, the therapists could lose their therapeutic stance, the sense of rapport was impaired, and the patients felt less open and emotionally available. On the other hand, some patients could feel freer online. As six of the participants had an anaclitic personality orientation, the present study could especially contribute to the understanding of how patients with strong affiliative needs and fear of abandonment experience the transition to meeting their therapists via communication technology. The participants self-ratings showed that they were only marginally dissatisfied with the transition and experienced the transition as slightly hindering, whereas they felt rather safe after the transition, indicating low concordance between qualitative and quantitative evaluations. New studies are needed to explore the introjective patients experiences of the transition. An essential topic is also to collect evidence and to test how the impaired sense of rapport when using communication technology can be remedied by adequate, patient-tailored interventions, a topic that has to be included in psychotherapy education and training.","output":"Loss of Rituals, Boundaries, and Relationship: Patient Experiences of Transition to Telepsychotherapy Following the Onset of COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunorelevant genes are among the most probable modulators of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progression and prognosis.

Correlations of eight HLA-B alleles and polymorphisms in three cytokine genes (IL6, IL10, and IL12B) were observed and were mainly associated with DDR.

METHODS: We performed a multicenter observational study from 26 pediatric hospitals between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, including patients  18 years with dog bites, consolidating together encounters from patients with multiple encounters within 30 days as a single episode of care. We characterized diagnoses and procedures performed in these patients. We used generalized linear mixed models to identify factors associated with a composite outcome that we term clinically significant injuries (defined as admission, operating room charge, sedation, fractures/dislocations, intracranial/eye injury, skin/soft tissue infection, or in-hospital mortality). RESULTS: 68,833 episodes were included (median age 6.6 years [interquartile range 3.5C10.4 years], 55.5% male) from 67,781 patients. We identified 16,502 patients (24.0%) with clinically significant injuries, including 6653 (9.7%) admitted, 5080 (7.4%) managed in the operating room, 11,685 (17.0%) requiring sedation, 493 (0.7%) with a skull fracture, 32 (0.0%) with a fracture in the neck or trunk, 389 (0.6%) with a fracture of the upper limb, 51 (0.1%) with a fracture in the lower limb, 15 (0.0%) with dislocations, 66 (0.1%) with an intracranial injury and 164 (0.2%) with an injury to the eyeball, 3708 (5.4%) with skin/soft tissue infections, and 5 (0.0%) with in-hospital mortality. In multivariable analysis, younger age (0C4 years, 5C9 years, and 10C14 years relative to 15C18 years), weekday injuries, and an income in the second and third quartiles (relative to the lowest quartile) had higher odds of clinically significant injuries. Black patients (relative to White), Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, and private insurance status (relative to public insurance) had lower odds of clinically important injuries. When evaluating individual components within the composite outcome, most followed broader trends. CONCLUSION: Dog bites are an important mechanism of injury encountered in childrens hospitals. Using a composite outcome measure, we identified younger, White, non-Hispanic children at higher risk of clinically significant injuries. Findings with respect to race and ethnicity and dog bite injuries warrant further investigation. Results can be used to identify populations for targeted prevention efforts to reduce severe dog bite injuries.

This concept has prevailed in clinical practice for more than a century. However, a new technologic era has brought forth more diagnostic possibilities, and it has been shown that thrombotic masses in the PA could, in many cases, be found without any obvious source of emboli. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, sickle cell anemia, emergency and elective surgery, viral pneumonia, and other conditions could be complicated by PA thrombosis development without concomitant deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Different pathologies have different causes for local PA thrombotic process. As evidenced by experimental results and clinical observations, endothelial and platelet activation are the crucial mechanisms of this process. Endothelial dysfunction can impair antithrombotic function of the arterial wall through downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) or via stimulation of adhesion receptor expression. Hypoxia, proinflammatory cytokines, or genetic mutations may underlie the procoagulant phenotype of the PA endothelium. Both endotheliocytes and platelets could be activated by protease mediated receptor (PAR)- and receptors for advanced glycation end (RAGE)-dependent mechanisms. Hypoxia, in particular induced by high altitudes, could play a role in thrombotic complications as a trigger of platelet activity.

PARTICIPANTS: Patients over the age of 18 that had attended a routine clinical appointment in March, 2018. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and content of risk factor status in electronic medical records for alcohol, smoking, and physical activity. RESULTS: The prevalence of alcohol, smoking, and physical activity documentation was 86.4%, 90.4%, and 66.1%, respectively. These lifestyle risk factor statuses were most often documented in the risk factors section of the EMR (83.7% for alcohol, 88.1% for smoking, and 47.9% for physical activity).

Patients with this disease suffer from a degeneration of their cerebellar Purkinje neurons and retinal photoreceptors that result in a progressive ataxia and loss of vision. As with many neurodegenerative diseases, studies of pathogenesis have been hindered by a lack of disease-relevant models. To this end, we have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a cohort of SCA7 patients in South Africa. First, we differentiated the SCA7 affected iPSCs into neurons which showed evidence of a transcriptional phenotype affecting components of STAGA (ATXN7 and KAT2A) and the heat shock protein pathway (DNAJA1 and HSP70). We then performed electrophysiology on the SCA7 iPSC-derived neurons and found that these cells show features of functional aberrations. Lastly, we were able to differentiate the SCA7 iPSCs into retinal photoreceptors that also showed similar transcriptional aberrations to the SCA7 neurons. Our findings give technical insights on how iPSC-derived neurons and photoreceptors can be derived from SCA7 patients and demonstrate that these cells express molecular and electrophysiological differences that may be indicative of impaired neuronal health. We hope that these findings will contribute towards the ongoing efforts to establish the cell-derived models of neurodegenerative diseases that are needed to develop patient-specific treatments.","output":"Molecular and electrophysiological features of spinocerebellar ataxia type seven in induced pluripotent stem cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Structure-based drug design targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been greatly facilitated by available virus-related protein structures.

Our original ensemble docking and cooperative docking approaches, followed by a total of over 16-micorsecond molecular simulations, have identified at least 9 compounds that may generally bind to key SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Further, we found evidence that some of these compounds can simultaneously bind to the same target, potentially leading to cooperative inhibition to SARS-CoV-2 proteins like the Spike protein and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

Our systematic review conformed to PRISMA guidelines and addressed differences in clinically relevant RIC applications and outcomes between preclinical and clinical studies. We retrieved a total of 30 studies (8 human; 22 animal) that met the inclusion criteria of testing clinically relevant procedures; namely, non-invasive and per- or post-conditioning protocols. Per-conditioning was applied in 6 animal and 3 human studies, post-conditioning was applied in 16 animal and 5 human studies, and both conditioning methods were applied in 2 animal studies. Application of RIC varied between human and animal studies regarding initiation, duration, repetition, and number of limbs included. Study designs did not systematically apply blinding, randomization, or placebo controls. On only a few occasions did preclinical studies include animals with clinically relevant comorbidities. Clinical trials were challenged by not completing the intended number of RIC cycles or addressing this deficit in the data analysis.

Proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs), in concert with infiltrating macrophages, are regarded as the agents provocateurs for driving this fibrotic process. However, evidence is now emerging for a contributory role of the distal nephron. The aim of this study was to examine the potential influence of macrophages on collecting duct epithelial cells (CDECs) and their combined role in the progression of IgAN. METHODS: CDECs were cultured with macrophage-conditioned media (MCM) generated from human monocyte cell lines U937 and THP-1 stimulated with or without 100 g/mL galactose-deficient IgA1. CDECs were analysed for evidence of inflammation and fibrosis. RESULTS: Staining of IgAN biopsies for CD68+ macrophages revealed the presence of macrophages juxtaposed to collecting ducts and within their lumina. CDEC exposed to MCM from IgA1-stimulated THP-1 cells (THP-1-IgA-MCM) exhibited markedly increased expression of neutrophil-associated gelatinase (NGAL) and proinflammatory cytokinesinterleukin (IL)-1?, tumour necrosis factor-&#945;, IL-6 and IL-8 compared with MCM from non-IgA-stimulated THP-1 cells (THP-1-MCM). U937-IgA-MCM increased fibronectin levels and reduced E-cadherinmRNA expression. THP-1-IgA-MCM-derived exosomes induced similar increases in NGAL and cytokine expression while in cross-over experiments exosomes extracted from IL-1?-exposed CDEC induced IL-1? and IL-6 mRNA expression in both sets of macrophages. MiRnome analysis revealed that microRNA (miR)-146a, -155 and -200b exhibited a >2-fold increase in expression in CDEC treated with THP-1-IgA-MCM compared with THP-1-MCM. Enforced miR-146a suppression further enhanced NGAL expression, while ectopic miR-146a over-expression downregulated it. NGAL mRNA and miR-146a were upregulated in the biopsies of patients with progressive IgAN compared with non-progressive IgAN.

Adults with SCD typically have a mild to moderate COVID-19 disease course, but also a 2- to 7-fold increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization and a 1.2-fold increased risk of COVID-19-related death as compared to adults without SCD, but not compared to controls with similar comorbidities and end-organ damage. There is some evidence that persons with SCT have increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization and death although more studies with risk-stratification and properly matched controls are needed to confirm these findings. While the literature suggests that most children with SCD and COVID-19 have mild disease and low risk of death, some children with SCD, especially those with SCD-related comorbidities, are more likely to be hospitalized and require escalated care than children without SCD. However, children with SCD are less likely to experience COVID-19-related severe illness and death compared to adults with or without SCD. SCD-directed therapies such as transfusion and hydroxyurea may be associated with better COVID-19 outcomes, but prospective studies are needed for confirmation.

Using in silico methods (docking and molecular dynamics simulations), we revealed the dynamics and energetics of rutin when interacting with the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the highly hydrophilic rutin molecule can be bound inside the Mpro's pocket (active site) and possibly inhibit its biological functions. In addition, we optimized the structure of rutin and designed two more hydrophobic analogs, M1 and M2, which satisfy the rule of five for western medicines and demonstrated that they (M2 in particular) possess much stronger binding affinities to the SARS-COV-2s Mpro than rutin, due to the enhanced hydrophobic interaction as well as more hydrogen bonds.

Unfortunately, the extant literature has limited understanding of the mechanisms by which firms BDAC affects their competitive performance, especially in the context of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Using resource capability as the theoretical lens, this paper specifically examines how BDAC influences SMEs competitive performance via the mediating role of business models (BMs). Also, this study explores the moderating effect of COVID-19 on the relationship between BDAC and BMs. Supported by Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) and data from 242 SMEs in China, this study finds the mediating roles of infrastructure and value attributes of BMs in enhancing the relationship of BDAC on competitive performance. Furthermore, the improvement of financial performance comes from the matching of BDA management capability with infrastructure attributes of BMs, while the improvements in growth come from the matching of BDA management capability and BDA technology capability with value attributes of BMs. The result also confirms the positive moderating effects of COVID-19 on the relationship of BDA management capability and value attributes of BMs. This study enriches the integration of BDAC and BMs literature by showing that the match between BDAC and BMs is vital to achieve competitive performance, and it is helpful for managers to adopt an informed BDA strategy to promote widespread use of BDAs and BMs.","output":"The Source of SMEs Competitive Performance in COVID-19: Matching Big Data Analytics Capability to Business Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A qualitative study on nurses' experiences with social stigma in the context of COVID-19Aim: This study aimed to examine the social stigma experienced by healthcare workers caring for people diagnosed with COVID-19.

We aimed to explore the impact on the epidemic curve of fewer contacts when individuals reduce the time they spend on selected daily activities. Methods: We combined the large-scale empirical data of a social contact survey and a time-use survey to estimate contact matrices by age group (0-15, 16-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65+) and daily activity (work, schooling, transportation, and four leisure activities: social visits, bar/cafe/restaurant visits, park visits, and non-essential shopping). We assumed that reductions in time are proportional to reductions in contacts. The derived matrices were then applied in an age-structured dynamic-transmission model of COVID-19 to explore the effects. Findings: The relative reductions in the derived contact matrices were highest when closing schools (in ages 0-14 years), workplaces (15-64 years), and stopping social visits (65+ years). For COVID-19, the closure of workplaces, schools, and stopping social visits had the largest impact on reducing the epidemic curve and delaying its peak, while the predicted impact of fewer contacts in parks, bars/cafes/restaurants, and non-essential shopping were minimal. Interpretation: We successfully augmented contact matrices with time-use data to predict the highest impact of social distancing measures from reduced contacts when spending less time at work, school, and on social visits. Although the predicted impact from other leisure activities with potential for close physical contact were minimal, changes in mixing patterns and time-use immediately after re-allowing social activities may pose increased short-term transmission risks, especially in potentially crowded environments indoors.","output":"Augmenting contact matrices with time-use data for fine-grained intervention modelling of disease dynamics: A modelling analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19-inducing virus, SARS-CoV2, is likely to remain a threat to human health unless efficient drugs or vaccines become available. Given the extent of the current pandemic (people in over one hundred countries infected) and its disastrous effect on world economy (associated with limitations of human rights), speedy drug discovery is critical. In this situation, past investments into the development of new (animal-free) approach methods (NAM) for drug safety, efficacy, and quality evaluation can be leveraged. For this, we provide an overview of repurposing ideas to shortcut drug development times. Animal-based testing would be too lengthy, and it largely fails, when a pathogen is species-specific or if the desired drug is based on specific features of human biology. Fortunately, industry has already largely shifted to NAM, and some public funding programs have advanced the development of animal-free technologies. For instance, NAM can predict genotoxicity (a major aspect of carcinogenicity) within days, human antibodies targeting virus epitopes can be generated in molecular biology laboratories within weeks, and various human cell-based organoids are available to test virus infectivity and the biological processes controlling them. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has formed an expert group to pave the way for the use of such approaches for accelerated drug development. This situation illustrates the importance of diversification in drug discovery strategies and clearly shows the shortcomings of an approach that invests 95% of resources into a single technology (animal experimentation) in the face of challenges that require alternative approaches.","output":"Harnessing the power of novel animal-free test methods for the development of COVID-19 drugs and vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research Objective Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, certain groups are highly susceptible to life-threatening infection. In particular, people living with HIV (PLWH) are vulnerable to worsened outcomes of COVID-19. Hence, to better understand factors that increase the likelihood of death, the purpose of this work was to systematically review the literature in order to assess the risk factors for COVID-19 mortality among PLWH. Study Design This systematic review was conducted as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Global Health, and WHO Coronavirus Database. During the screening process, duplicate articles were removed;thereafter, articles were screened based on title/abstract, and then based on a full-text review. Population Studied Studies that included PLWH who died after infection of COVID-19, and had some description of the risk factors for mortality, were eligible for this review. Principal Findings Searches generated a total of 530 articles, and, after screening, 15 articles were eligible for inclusion. It was consistently found that males living with HIV have a higher risk for mortality than females. Individuals in the age range of approximately 50-65?years had amongst the highest rates of death compared to other age groups. Individuals with additional comorbidities, especially diabetes and hypertension, had an elevated risk of death. Those with a decreased CD4 count were more likely to die;rates were particularly high for those with a CD4 count of less than 200. Conclusions Among PLWH, males aged 50-65 with comorbidities appear to be at the highest risk of mortality from COVID-19. In addition, those who have had interruptions in their HIV treatment regimens are at an elevated risk. Implications for Policy or Practice Our findings highlight the need to ensure that, amidst COVID-19 prevention efforts, focus be placed particularly on males aged 50-65 living with HIV and other comorbidities. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that COVID-19 has likely led to major interruptions of HIV treatment regimens for many patients;considering that those with a lower CD4 count are at a higher risk of death, it is critical that more efforts be made to ensure that PLWH receive their HIV treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Risk Factors for COVID-19 Mortality Among People Living with HIV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Millions of people were infected with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) all over the world. Data on clinical symptoms of pediatric inpatients with COVID-19 infection were unclear. The aim of study was to investigate the clinical features of pediatric inpatients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to seek for studies providing details on pediatric inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection which were published from 1st January to 21st April 2020. Studies with more than five pediatric inpatients were included in our meta-analysis.This study was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020183550). As the results shown, fever (46%) and cough (42%) were the main clinical characters of pediatric inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the other clinical characters, such as diarrhea, vomiting, nasal congestion, and fatigue account for 10% in pediatric inpatients. The proportion of asymptomatic cases was 0.42 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27-0.59) and severe cases was 0.03 (95% CI: 0.01-0.06). For the laboratory result, leukopenia (21%) and lymphocytosis (22%) were the mainly indicators for pediatric inpatients, followed by high aspartate aminotransferase (19%), lymphopenia (16%), high alanine aminotransferase (15%), high C-reactive protein (17%), leukocytosis (13%), high D-dimer (12%) and high creatine kinase-MB (5%). Regard to chest imaging features, unilateral and bilateral accounts for 22% in pediatric inpatients, respectively.

Setting: Mayo Clinic, a large multistate integrated health care system with over 1.5 million annual patient visits that utilizes the Epic? electronic health record (EHR) system. Methods and Results: Rule-based live registries were designed in EHR system to classify patients who 1) are currently tested positive for COVID-19; 2) were tested positive but has recovered from COVID-19; 3) are suspected of COVID-19 but did not yet meet clinical diagnostic criteria,; 4) had tested negative for COVID-19; and 5) exceeded a risk score for serious complications from COVID-19. Using registries, custom dashboards and operational reports were developed to provide daily high-level summary for clinical practice use and provide up to date information used to manage individual patients impacted by COVID-19, including support of case identification, contact isolation and other care management tasks. Conclusion: we developed and implemented a systematic approach for using EHR patient registries to manage the COVID-19 pandemic that proved feasible and useful for managing a large multistate group clinical practice.

Actively calling patients to postpone appointments is a labour-intensive process. We were the first ophthalmic clinics in Hong Kong to use short message service (SMS) to dispatch messages simultaneously to a large number of patients to offer postponement of appointments. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether SMS is an effective method to reduce outpatient attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is an observational study reviewing data on SMS messages sent to all patients attending ophthalmology clinics of a tertiary eye centre in Hong Kong. All SMS were sent at least 5 days before the scheduled appointments. The text message included an enquiry hotline for postponement of appointments and offered drug refill. The study included data from February to April 2020. Two hundred patients were invited to take part in a questionnaire on satisfaction level and reason(s) for appointment rescheduling. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 17,028 SMS were sent. The overall response rate was 23.6%. 14.3% postponed their appointments. This led to an overall 13.9% reduction of clinic attendance. The overall satisfaction was high (96%). The main reason for postponing appointment was worries about infection risk (93.1%). CONCLUSION: SMS was an efficient and cost-effective flow-control method which was well accepted by patients and can reduce outpatient attendance.

Although several factors may account for this disparity, striking differences within and between populations indicate that ethnicity might impact COVID-19 clinical outcomes, reflecting the 'color of disease'. Therefore, the role of key biological variables that could interplay with viral spreading and severity indices has attracted increasing attention, particularly among non-Caucasian populations. Although the links between vitamin D status and the incidence and severity of COVID-19 remain elusive, several lines of emerging evidence suggest that vitamin D signaling, targeting several immune-mediated pathways, may offer potential benefits at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given that the vitamin D status is modulated by several intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including skin type (pigmentation), melanin polymers may also play a role in variable COVID-19 outcomes among diverse population settings. Moreover, apart from the well-known limiting effects of melanin on the endogenous production of vitamin D, the potential crosstalk between the pigmentary and immune system may also require special attention concerning the current pandemic. The present review article aimed to shed light on a range of mostly overlooked host factors, such as vitamin D status and melanin pigments, that may influence the course and outcome of COVID-19.","output":"Unraveling the roles of vitamin D status and melanin during Covid-19 (Review)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is characterised by exaggerated immune response in patients who develop severe disease.

The SIWS network is in the healthy state (also referred to as the disease-free equilibrium) if none of the individuals in the population are infected nor is the infrastructure network contaminated; otherwise, we say that the network is in the endemic state (also referred to as the endemic equilibrium). First, we establish sufficient conditions for local exponential stability and global asymptotic stability (GAS) of the healthy state. Second, we provide sufficient conditions for existence, uniqueness, and GAS of the endemic state. Building off of these results, we provide a necessary, and sufficient, condition for the healthy state to be the unique equilibrium of our model. Third, we show that the endemic equilibrium of the SIWS model is worse than that of the networked SIS model without any infrastructure network, in the sense that at least one subpopulation has strictly larger infection proportion at the endemic equilibrium in the former model than that in the latter.

Successfully overcoming these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that addresses COVID-19 transmission both within and outside the facility. Possible interventions include strategies (i) to vaccinate employees, (ii) to assure that employees practice social distancing, (iii) to assure that employees wear face coverings, (iv) to screen employees for COVID-19, (v) to assure that employees practice frequent hand washing and avoid touching their faces, (vi) to clean frequently touched surfaces, and (vii) to assure proper ventilation.

Older adults are a high-risk group for developing serious complications from COVID-19 and as a result were asked to shelter-in-place. This limitation on their activities and physical interactions may impact social isolation and loneliness. We aimed to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on social isolation and loneliness among older adults who participated in the Leveraging Exercise to Age in Place (LEAP) Study. Methods: We conducted a pre-post analysis using paired t-tests of cognitively intact, community-dwelling older adults in Los Angeles, California previously enrolled in in-person exercise classes as part of the LEAP study prior to March 19th, 2020 when California started shelter-in-place. Participants (n=59) &gt;50 years, had social connectedness, loneliness, and demographic data collected pre-and post-COVID shelter-in-place. Participants' social connectedness was measured via the 11-question Duke Social Support Index (DSSI) and loneliness via the 3-question UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA 3).

Overall, 97.3% of 357,133 death certificates with at least one other diagnosis (91.9% of all 378,048 death certificates) were noted to have a co-occurring diagnosis that was a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both. Overall, 70%-80% of death certificates had both a chain-of-event condition and a significant contributing condition or a chain-of-event condition only; this was noted for adults aged 18-84 years, both males and females, persons of all races and ethnicities, those who died in inpatient and outpatient or emergency department settings, and those whose manner of death was listed as natural. These findings support the accuracy of COVID-19 mortality surveillance in the United States using official death certificates. High-quality documentation of co-occurring diagnoses on the death certificate is essential for a comprehensive and authoritative public record. Continued messaging and training (3) for professionals who complete death certificates remains important as the pandemic progresses. Accurate mortality surveillance is critical for understanding the impact of variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and of COVID-19 vaccination and for guiding public health action.","output":"Death Certificate-Based ICD-10 Diagnosis Codes for COVID-19 Mortality Surveillance - United States, January-December 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by an invasion of the alveolar epithelial cells by coronavirus 19. The most severe outcome of the disease is the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) combined with hypoxemia and cardiovascular damage. ARDS and co-morbidities are associated with inflammatory cytokine storms, sympathetic hyperactivity, and respiratory dysfunction. Hypothesis: In the present paper, we present and justify a novel potential treatment for Covid19-originated ARDS and associated co-morbidities, based on the non-invasive stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve. Methods: Auricular vagus nerve stimulation activates the parasympathetic system including anti-inflammatory pathways (the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis) while regulating the abnormal sympatho-vagal balance and improving respiratory control. Results: Along the paper (1) we expose the role of the parasympathetic system and the vagus nerve in the control of inflammatory processes (2) we formulate our physiological and methodological hypotheses (3) we provide a large body of clinical and preclinical data that support the favorable effects of auricular vagus nerve stimulation in inflammation, sympatho-vagal balance as well as in respiratory and cardiac ailments, and (4) we list the (few) possible collateral effects of the treatment. Finally, we discuss auricular vagus nerve stimulation protective potential, especially in the elderly and co-morbid population with already reduced parasympathetic response. Conclusions: Auricular vagus nerve stimulation is a safe clinical procedure and it could be either an effective treatment for ARDS originated by Covid-19 and similar viruses or a supplementary treatment to actual ARDS therapeutic approaches.","output":"Non-invasive Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation as a Potential Treatment for Covid19-Originated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

METHODS: B6 mice were subconjunctivally injected with LiCl in contrast to appropriate control sodium chloride (NaCl), and then routinely infected with PA. Clinical score, slit-lamp photography, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and bacterial plate counts were used to determine the role of LiCl in PA keratitis. Messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels of inflammatory cytokines in PA-challenged mouse corneas and in vitro cultured macrophages and neutrophils were measured with real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Apoptosis of the infiltrating inflammatory cells in the PA-infected murine corneas was assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated uridine 5-triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling staining and propidium iodide staining associated with flow cytometry. In cultured murine macrophages and neutrophils, cell apoptosis was determined with annexin V/propidium iodide double staining associated with flow cytometry and western blot analysis for cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. RESULTS: Treatment with LiCl reduced the severity of corneal disease by reducing corneal inflammatory response and bacterial burden. Moreover, LiCl increased anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 levels, decreased proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor- levels, and enhanced apoptosis of infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils in the PA-infected mouse corneas. In vitro studies further confirmed that LiCl elevated anti-inflammatory cytokine expression but reduced proinflammatory cytokine production, as well as promoted cell apoptosis in murine macrophages and neutrophils. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a protective role of LiCl in PA keratitis. LiCl promotes host resistance against PA infection by suppressing inflammatory responses, enhancing inflammatory cell apoptosis, and promoting bacterial clearance.","output":"Lithium chloride promotes host resistance against Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sudden emergence of SARS-CoV-2 causing the global pandemic is a major public health concern. Though the virus is considered as a novel entity, it is not a completely new member. It is just a new version of previously emerged human SARS corona virus. The rapid evolving nature by changing host body environment and extreme environmental stability, collectively makes SARS-CoV-2 into an extremely virulent genetic variant. The evolution of the virus has been occurred by the continuous process of molecular genetic manipulation, through mutation, deletion and genetic recombinationevents. Different host body environment acts as the supportive system for the pathogen which creates extreme selective pressure. By the process of genetic evolution the pathogen developes new characters. Then the new version of the virus has been naturally selected by susceptible human host and adapt itself inside the host body causing deadly effect. Moreover, extreme environmental stability helps in the process of viral survival outside the host and its transmission. Thus both the host body or internal environment and the external environment performs equally as a source, responsible for shaping the genetic evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 towards theCOVID-19 disease fitness in nature in a pandemic form.","output":"Decoding the global outbreak of COVID-19: the nature is behind the scene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The speed and scope of COVID-19 took the United States by surprise.

A significant number of infectious diseases and chronic disorders are still not preventable by existing vaccination schemes; therefore, new-generation vaccines are needed. Novel technologies such as nanoparticulate systems and adjuvants can enable safe and effective vaccines for difficult target populations such as newborns, elderly, and the immune-compromised. More recently, polymer-based particles have found application as vaccine platforms and vaccine adjuvants due to their ability to prevent antigen degradation and clearance, coupled with enhanced uptake by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Polymeric nanoparticles have been applied in vaccine delivery, showing significant adjuvant effects as they can easily be taken up by APCs. In other words, polymer-based systems offer a lot of advantages, including versatility and flexibility in the design process, the ability to incorporate a range of immunomodulators/antigens, mimicking infection in different ways, and acting as a depot, thereby persisting long enough to generate adaptive immune responses.

In Barbados, there are nutrition guidelines which lack the legal mandate of a formal policy. We aim to assess the comprehensiveness of current national nutrition guidelines and to understand the factors operating in the inner and outer school setting that may influence the implementation of a mandatory school nutrition policy from the perspectives of school administrators. METHODS: A documentary analysis of existing nutritional guidelines was conducted along with qualitative semi-structured interviews in primary (elementary) and secondary (high) schools in Barbados. We purposively sampled six primary and four secondary school administrators (principals, deputy principals or senior teachers) to explore their knowledge and views on the National School Nutrition Guidelines. The deterministic implementation paradigm, Consolidated Framework for Implementation (CFIR), was used to explore the complexities within the inner and outer settings of schools. Documentary analysis used a theory-based framework informed by the Wellness School Assessment Toolschool policy analysis questionnaire. Interview transcripts were team coded using thematic analysis with constant comparison facilitated by NVIVO software version12. RESULTS: School administrators were unaware of the existing National School Nutrition Guidelines which documentary analysis found to be restrictive and weak for implementation. Administrators envisioned a government-led (outer setting), whole of society approach as the most effective strategy for the development and implementation of a proposed mandatory school nutrition policy. School administrators identified lack of financial and human resources as barriers to nutrition policy implementation. Formal and informal food vendors are institutionalized in schools and are influential determinants of the school food environment. Schools have individually reached into the outer setting to work with civil society organizations and private individuals to provide financial support and nutrition expertise to their institutions. Mass media campaigns in the outer setting may influence child and parental food choices. CONCLUSION: School administrators describe that government-led, CSO supported policy development using a whole-of-society approach has implications for improving nutrition policy implementation.

Data was extracted over a 31-day period during: (study period 1 (SP1)) COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in UK (24th March 2020-23rd April 2020) and (study period 2 (SP2)) the equivalent 2019 period (24th March 2019-23rd April 2019). RESULTS: A 53% reduction in EED attendance was noted during lockdown. The top three pathologies accounting for >30% of the caseload were trauma-related, keratitis and uveitis in SP1 in comparison to conjunctivitis, trauma-related and blepharitis in SP2. The overall number of retinal tears and retinal detachments (RD) were lower in SP1, the proportion of macula-off RD's (84.6%) was significantly (p = 0.0099) higher in SP1 (vs 42.9% in SP2). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic related lockdown has had a significant impact on the range of presenting conditions to the EED. Measures to stop spread of COVID-19 such as awareness of hand hygiene practices, social distancing measures and school closures could have an indirect role in reducing spread of infective conjunctivitis.

Interventions for the experimental site included a 5-minute informational video, placement of capnography monitors with a shortened warm-up period in all resuscitation rooms, laminated reminder cards, and feedback during staff meetings. Staff members were surveyed about knowledge before and after the intervention. Records were reviewed for documented capnography use for 3 months before and 6 months after the intervention. Change in documented use at the experimental site was compared with the control site. RESULTS At the experimental site, 118 providers participated and 190 records were reviewed; 544 records were reviewed from the control site.

Various symptoms attributed to the use of PPE are believed to be, at least in part, due to elevated carbon-dioxide (CO2) levels. We evaluated concentrations of CO2 under various PPE. METHODS: In a prospective observational study on healthy volunteers, CO2 levels were measured during regular breathing while donning 1) no mask, 2) JustAir? powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), 3) KN95 respirator, and 4) valved-respirator. Serial CO2 measurements were taken with a nasal canula at a frequency of 1-Hz for 15-min for each PPE configuration to evaluate whether National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) limits were breached. RESULTS: The study included 11 healthy volunteers, median age 32 years (range 16-54) and 6 (55%) men. Percent mean (SD) changes in CO2 values for no mask, JustAir? PAPR, KN95 respirator and valve respirator were 0.26 (0.12), 0.59 (0.097), 2.6 (0.14) and 2.4 (0.59), respectively. Use of face masks (KN95 and valved-respirator) resulted in significant increases in CO2 concentrations, which exceeded the 8-h NIOSH exposure threshold limit value-weighted average (TLV-TWA). However, the increases in CO2 concentrations did not breach short-term (15-min) limits. Importantly, these levels were considerably lower than the long-term (8-h) NIOSH limits during donning JustAir? PAPR. There was a statistically significant difference between all pairs (p < 0.0001, except KN95 and valved-respirator (p = 0.25). However, whether increase in CO2 levels are clinically significant remains debatable. CONCLUSION: Although, significant increase in CO2 concentrations are noted with routinely used face-masks, the levels still remain within the NIOSH limits for short-term use. Therefore, there should not be a concern in their regular day-to-day use for healthcare providers. The clinical implications of elevated CO2 levels with long-term use of face masks needs further studies. Use of PAPR prevents relative hypercapnoea. However, whether PAPR should be advocated for healthcare workers requiring PPE for extended hours needs to evaluated in further studies.","output":"Carbon dioxide increases with face masks but remains below short-term NIOSH limits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The triad of robust state capacity, strong social trust, and competent leadership has been proposed as essential for a successful national response to the COVID-19 crisis The flow of information among individuals and entities responsible for the response, and from them to the public, is the thread which unites and activates this triad itself Effective response depends on timely and unambiguous information being openly available to government bodies, leaders, and society alike Although Japan's pandemic experience at the time of writing has been mercifully mild, the official Japanese response has objectively been quite flawed on many counts What can be observed about the accessibility and transparency of the information concerning the pandemic that has been provided to the Japanese public?","output":"Information as the Key: Evaluating Japan's Response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in a substantial workload and stress for frontline health professionals in high-risk areas.

METHODS: Standard social network analysis methods used for exploring infectious disease transmission dynamics was employed to analyze contact tracing data of 1959 diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 patients from a large state of India. Relational network data set with diagnosed patients as \\"nodes\\" and their epidemiological contact as \\"edges\\" was created. Directed network perspective was utilized in which directionality of infection emanated from a \\"source patient\\" towards a \\"target patient\\". Network measures of \\" degree centrality\\" and \\"betweenness centrality\\" were calculated to identify influential patients in the transmission of infection. Components analysis was conducted to identify patients connected as sub- groups. Descriptive statistics was used to summarise network measures and percentile ranks were used to categorize influencers. RESULTS: Out-degree centrality measures identified that of the total 1959 patients, 11.27% (221) patients have acted as a source of infection to 40.19% (787) other patients. Among these source patients, 0.65% (12) patients had a higher out-degree centrality (> = 10) and have collectively infected 37.61% (296 of 787), secondary patients. Betweenness centrality measures highlighted that 7.50% (93) patients had a non-zero betweenness (range 0.5 to 135) and thus have bridged the transmission between other patients. Network component analysis identified nineteen connected components comprising of influential patient's which have overall accounted for 26.95% of total patients (1959) and 68.74% of epidemiological contacts in the network. CONCLUSIONS: Social network analysis method for SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing data would be of use in measuring individual patient level variations in disease transmission. The network metrics identified individual patients and patient components who have disproportionately contributed to transmission. The network measures and graphical tools could complement the existing contact tracing indicators and could help improve the contact tracing activities.","output":"Social network analysis methods for exploring SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Improved understanding of the effects of meteorological conditions on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19 disease, is needed. Here, we estimate the relationship between air temperature, specific humidity, and ultraviolet radiation and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 2669 U.S. counties with abundant reported cases from March 15 to December 31, 2020. Specifically, we quantify the associations of daily mean temperature, specific humidity, and ultraviolet radiation with daily estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number (R(t)) and calculate the fraction of R(t) attributable to these meteorological conditions. Lower air temperature (within the 20C40 C range), lower specific humidity, and lower ultraviolet radiation were significantly associated with increased R(t). The fraction of R(t) attributable to temperature, specific humidity, and ultraviolet radiation were 3.73% (95% empirical confidence interval [eCI]: 3.66C3.76%), 9.35% (95% eCI: 9.27C9.39%), and 4.44% (95% eCI: 4.38C4.47%), respectively. In total, 17.5% of R(t) was attributable to meteorological factors. The fractions attributable to meteorological factors generally were higher in northern counties than in southern counties.

It has infected more than 1.2 million people and killed more than 64,000. Frantic research is underway to find prevention and cure. Of late, Bacillus CalmetteCGurin (BCG) has been speculated as a possible protection from COVID-19. We sought to investigate the evidence behind the claim. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected regarding the total number of COVID-19 cases per million and total number of COVID-19 deaths per million in various countries. The BCG vaccination policies of these countries were also obtained. RESULTS: It was seen that the countries with no universal BCG policy had a mean 1272.9 (median 795) cases per million and 80.7 deaths (median 18) per million population. On the contrary, the countries with a universal BCG vaccination policy had a mean 131.2 (median 40) cases per million and 4 deaths (median 1) per population. The difference is highly significant (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The data strongly support the hypothesis that BCG may offer protection from COVID-19. Heterologous protection offered by BCG through production of trained immunity, epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes, non-specific activation of NK cells, and increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (particularly, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha and interleukin 1 beta) production may be the mechanism behind its cross- protection against the novel coronavirus.","output":"Does the Bacillus CalmetteCGurin vaccine provide protection from COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529 lineage) gave rise to questions, but the data on the mechanism of action at the molecular level is limited. In this study, we present the Free energy of perturbation (FEP) data about the RBD-hACE2 binding of this new variant. We identified two groups of mutations located close to the most contributing substitutions Q498R and Q493R, which altered significantly the RBD-hACE2 interactions. The Q498R, Y505H and G496S mutations, in addition to N501Y, highly increased the binding to hACE2. They enhanced the binding by 98, 14 and 13 folds, respectively, which transforms the S1-RBD to a picomolar binder. However, in contrast to the case in mice the Q493R/K mutations, in a combination with K417N and T478K, dramatically reduced the S1 RBD binding by over 100 folds. The N440K, G446S and T478K substitutions had lesser contribution. Thus, the total effect of these nine mutations located on the interaction surface of RBD-hACE2 turns out to be similar to that observed in the Alpha variant. In a special circumstances it could be further altered by the E484A and S477N mutations and even lower binding capacity is likely to be detected.

Serum samples ( n = 104) were analyzed from killer whales ( n = 10) both while clinically healthy and during periods of clinical GI disease as defined by clinical signs and fecal cytology. To characterize serum cobalamin and folate concentrations in clinically healthy animals, a mixed-model regression was used, with cobalamin and folate both significantly affected by weight (cobalamin: P < 0.0001, folate: P = 0.006) and season (cobalamin: P < 0.0001, folate: P < 0.0001).

However, SMM assessments require a complex and costly machine, which delays the ability to detect abnormalities related to SMM decline and, subsequently, reduces the effectiveness of the clinical management of older adults. PURPOSE: This study aimed to: 1) assess the correlation between upper limb loading during a seated push-up test (ULL-SPUT) and SMM (concurrent validity); 2) compare the SMM of participants who passed and failed a seated push-up test (SPUT; discriminant validity); and 3) explore the ability of a failed SPUT to identify older individuals with low SMM. METHODS: Participants (n = 40, age approximately 73 years) were cross-sectionally assessed for their SMM using a portable bioelectrical impedance analysis, and SPUTs were evaluated using digital push-up loading devices that were the size of clinical push-up boards, in three starting positions: 1) high; 2) ring, and 3) long sitting positions. RESULTS: The ULL-SPUT, especially in a ring sitting position, was significantly correlated to SMM (rs = 0.457-0.608, p < .005). The SMM and ULL-SPUT were significantly different between participants who passed and failed the SPUT (p < .05). Failure to complete the SPUT - that is, being unable to lift the body up from the floor during the test - showed an excellent ability to indicate participants with an SMM of < 28% of their body-weight (sensitivity > 83%, specificity > 82%, area under the curve = 0.93). CONCLUSIONS: The inability to lift the body up from the floor during sitting using the upper limbs can be used as a screening tool to indicate those with low SMM.

Several promising known drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease, including carfilzomib, eravacycline, valrubicin, lopinavir, and elbasvir. Carfilzomib, an approved anticancer drug acting as a proteasome inhibitor, has the best MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energy, ?13.8 kcal/mol. The second-best repurposing drug candidate, eravacycline, is synthetic halogenated tetracycline class antibiotic. Streptomycin, another antibiotic and a charged molecule, also demonstrates some inhibitory effect, even though the predicted binding free energy of the charged form (?3.8 kcal/mol) is not nearly as low as that of the neutral form (?7.9 kcal/mol). One bioactive, PubChem 23727975, has a binding free energy of ?12.9 kcal/mol. Detailed receptorCligand interactions were analyzed and hot spots for the receptorCligand binding were identified. I found that one hot spot residue, His41, is a conserved residue across many viruses including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV).

There are several molecules present in blood associated with immune cellular response, inflammation, and oxidative stress that could be used as severity markers in respiratory viral infections such as COVID-19. However, there is a lack of clinical studies evaluating the role of oxidative stress-related molecules including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) in COVID-19 pathogenesis. AIM: To evaluate the role of oxidative stress-related molecules in COVID-19. METHOD: An observational study with 93 Brazilian participants from September 2020 to April 2021, comprising 23 patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), 19 outpatients with COVID-19 with mild to moderate symptoms, 17 individuals reporting a COVID-19 history, and 34 healthy controls. Blood samples were taken from all participants and western blot assay was used to determine the RAGE, HMGB1, GFAP, and COX-2 immunocontent. RESULTS: We found that GFAP levels were higher in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 compared to outpatients (p = 0.030) and controls (p < 0.001). A significant increase in immunocontents of RAGE (p < 0.001) and HMGB1 (p < 0.001) were also found among patients admitted to the ICU compared to healthy controls, as well as an overexpression of the inducible COX-2 (p < 0.001). In addition, we found a moderate to strong correlation between RAGE, GFAP and HMGB1 proteins.

However, no comparative studies have addressed its application to gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer (AGC). We therefore aimed to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of single-port laparoscopic gastrectomy (SLG) for the treatment of AGC by comparing it with conventional multi-port laparoscopic gastrectomy (MLG). METHODS We searched the prospective gastric cancer database of our institute for patients with AGC who underwent SLG or MLG between October 2007 and December 2013. Cases of R2 resection with distant metastasis or concurrent surgery for comorbid malignant lesions were excluded. One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to reduce bias from confounding patient-related variables, and the short- and long-term outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS We identified 216 patients who underwent SLG (n = 100) or MLG (n = 116). After propensity score matching, we selected 73 pairs of patients who underwent SLG (distal gastrectomy, 49; total gastrectomy, 24) or MLG (distal gastrectomy, 45; total gastrectomy, 28). While the mean operative times were comparable between the groups, the SLG group had less blood loss, a lower postoperative morbidity, and shorter postoperative hospital stays. The 5-year survival rates were 74.2% in the SLG group and 60.2% in the MLG group (P = 0.081 by log-rank test).

The aim was to quantify the mental health burden of the most severe COVID-19 related restrictions. METHODS: A natural experiment in which differences between Australian states and territories in the severity of restrictions for pandemic control, divided the population. People in Victoria experienced the most severe, and people in all other states and territories less severe or negligible restrictions. Data were collected in national, anonymously completed, online surveys (in April and in July / August 2020) of adults in Australia. Outcomes were, in the previous fortnight, experiencing clinically significant depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire 9 score 10); or symptoms of generalised anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale 7 score 10). RESULTS: In total, 23,749 eligible respondents contributed complete data. There were no differences in the population burden of mental health problems between Victoria and the other states and territories at Survey One. By Survey Two prevalence rates of clinically significant depressive (Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 1.96; 95% CI 1.62; 2.37) and anxiety (aOR 1.87; 95%CI 1.53; 2.29) symptoms were substantially and significantly higher in Victoria than in other states and territories.

METHODS: An online population-based survey was distributed via social media over an 8-week period from April 13, 2020, to June 8, 2020. RESULTS: Data were derived from 2,222 adults (57% female; 40% racial/ethnic minorities).

We previously showed that narrow band ultraviolet-A (NB-UVA) treatment salvages coronavirus (CoV)-229E-infected human tracheal cells, and that daily endotracheal NB-UVA therapy reduced severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) levels in human subjects, with improved clinical outcomes. Here, we examined NB-UVA effects on cytokine release during CoV-229E infection. METHODS: Primary human tracheal epithelial cells were transfected with CoV-229E, then exposed to 2 mW/cm(2) NB-UVA for 20 minutes every 24h, either 3 or 4 times. Secreted cytokine/chemokine levels were analyzed in supernatants collected from CoV-229E-infected/UVA-exposed cells 24h after the last UVA treatment, and from matched non-infected/UVA-exposed controls, CoV-229E-infected/non-exposed controls, and non-infected/non-exposed (na?ve) controls. Metabolic pathway/downstream prediction analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and chemokines IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), were significantly increased in CoV-229E-infected cells, and significantly decreased following NB-UVA treatment. Interferon (IFN)-2, IFN-, and IL-10 were not upregulated in response to CoV-229E. Metabolic pathway predictions indicated hypercytokinemia as the top inflammatory response in CoV-229E-infected cells, whereas the top predicted pathway in CoV-229E-infected/UVA-exposed cells was the recovery stage of severe acute respiratory syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Human tracheal epithelial cells infected with CoV-229E showed reduced cytokine secretions including IL-6, TNF, IL-8, and MCP-1, following NB-UVA exposure. This reduction of cytokine levels in vitro, coupled with previously identified reduced cell death in CoV-229E-infected/UVA-exposed cells, suggests that determining UVA effects on cytokine storm in human SARS-Co-V2 patients is warranted.","output":"Ultraviolet-A light reduces cellular cytokine release from human endotracheal cells infected with Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol have been previously used to treat acute respiratory syndrome- coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in clinical practice; nevertheless, their effectiveness remains controversial.

The impairment of cerebral autoregulation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of IVH, whose incidence is highest during the transitional period. This pilot study aimed to evaluate whether patterns of cerebral autoregulation and oxygenation differ in relation to IVH development in very preterm infants during the transitional period. Methods: Infants <32 weeks' gestation were enrolled within 12 h from birth. A simultaneous monitoring of cerebral oxygenation (CrSO2) by near-infrared spectroscopy and of heart rate and peripheral oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was performed over the first 72 h. Cerebral fractional oxygen extraction (cFTOE) and tissue oxygenation-heart rate reactivity index (TOHRx), which represents a marker of cerebrovascular reactivity, were calculated. Daily cranial and cardiac ultrasound scans were performed, in order to assess the hemodynamic status and to detect a possible IVH onset. CrSO2 and cFTOE, clustered on 6-hour epochs, were compared between infants who developed IVH during the study period and those who did not. A between-group comparison of TOHRx before and after IVH detection was also performed. Results: Twenty preterm infants with a median gestational age of 27 weeks (interquartile range, IQR: 25-30 weeks) and median birth weight of 895 g (IQR: 822-1208 g) were enrolled. Of these, 8 developed IVH. The median age at IVH detection was 40 h (IQR: 30-48 h). Pre-IVH TOHRx was significantly higher compared to matched control periods (p <0.001). CrSO2 was significantly lower from 12 to 30 h and from 42 h onwards in cases compared to controls; however, a temporary CrSO2 rise preceded IVH detection. Similarly, cFTOE was significantly higher in IVH infants from 12 to 30 h and from 48 to 72 h, with a transient decrease between the two periods. Conclusions: In preterm infants during the transitional period, the development of IVH is preceded by transient changes in cerebral oxygenation and oxygen extraction which, in turn, may underlie an early impairment of cerebral autoregulation.

METHOD S2 gene fragment was amplified from SARS-CoV GD322 genome with RT-PCR and ligated to pGEM-T vector for sequence analysis after transformation of the plasmid into E. coli DH5a. The variability of S2 genes and S2 proteins from 12 strains isolated in the early, intermediate and advanced stages of the SARS outbreak were analyzed and the phylogenetic tree was constructed with Lasergene, Clustal X, DNAman and Treeview. T cell antigen epitopes of S2 protein were predicted on the basis of Internet database. RESULT With the epidemic spread of SARS-CoV, the S2 genes of the virus tended to become stable. Homology of S2 genes of SARS-CoV isolated in advanced stage of the outbreak reached 99.9%. Prediction of T cell antigen epitope showed that mutation at the 57th amino acid effected T cell antigen epitope. CONCLUSION S2 gene of GD322 SARS-CoV is relatively stable during the epidemic spread of the virus, and mutation at the 57th amino acids of S2 protein may affect the T cell antigen epitope.","output":"[Variability analysis of S2 gene of SARS-CoV]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The internet has become an important source of health information for users worldwide The novel Coronavirus caused a pandemic search for information with broad dissemination of false or misleading health information OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality and readability of online information about Wuhan Coronavirus (actually COVID-19), which was a trending topic in the net, using validated instruments and relate the quality of information to its readability METHODS: The search was based on the term Wuhan Coronavirus on the Google website (6 February 2020) At the search time, the terms \\"COVID-19\\" or \\"SARS-CoV-2\\" did not exist yet Critical analysis was performed on the first 110 hits using HON code, JAMA benchmark, DISCERN instrument, and Google rank RESULTS: The Google search returned 309,000,000 hits The first 110 websites were critically analyzed, and only 1 81% of the websites had the HON code seal The JAMA benchmark showed that 39% of websites did not have any of the categories required by this tool and only 10% of the websites had the 4 quality criteria required by JAMA The DISCERN score showed that 70% of the websites were evaluated as low score and none one was rated as high score CONCLUSIONS: Non-health personnel and the scientific community need to be aware of the quality of the information they read and produce respectively The Wuhan Coronavirus health crisis misinformation was produced by the media and the misinformation the users obtain from the net The use of the internet has a risk to public health and in cases like this;the governments should be developing strategies to regulate health information in the internet without censuring the population By February 6, no quality information was available in the internet about COVID-19","output":"COVID- 19 misinformation on the internet: The other epidemy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Traditional Chinese medicine has been reported to be effective in the treatment of epidemic diseases. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of combined therapy of Chinese and western medicine on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS A total of 60 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled. Both the ordinary and severely affected patients were randomly divided into Groups A-C each with 10 cases each. The patients in Group A-C received Western medicine, Western medicine + traditional Chinese medicine, and Western medicine + traditional Chinese medicine + high dose of vitamin C, respectively. The time of disease recovery, symptoms disappearance, chest CT improvement, and tongue amelioration was recorded. Leukocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte were monitored, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), procalitonin (PCT), inflammatory factors, partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and oxygenation index (PaO2). Urinary tract stones, liver function, and other side-effects such as gastrointestinal dysfunction were also investigated. RESULTS Traditional Chinese medicine enhanced the effect of Western medicine, including the reduction of CRP, ESR, PCT, and inflammatory factors, and the increase of leukocyte, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts, and the improvement of respiratory rate, PaO2, PaCO2, and oxygenation index. Traditional Chinese medicine combined with high-dose Vitamin C therapy more effectively shortened the time of disease recovery, symptom disappearance, chest CT improvement, and tongue amelioration.

Residents behavior can have a profound influence in contributing to personal and global communitys health by responding effectively to emergency strategies in disease outbreaks such as the Coronavirus. It is evident that an understanding of residents behavior(s) pre COVID-19 across fields have relied on over-simplistic models, many of which will need to be revisited. Our interaction with people and nature while respecting social distancing has profound positive impacts on our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing. The current health pandemic has called that people be confined in their homes across many nations as a means to control the spread of the virus and save lives. This calls for research exploring the mechanisms; this paper develops and proposes a conceptual framework suggesting that place confinement promotes pro-social and household pro-environmental behaviors which could become habitual and contribute further to our peoples and our planets health. The proposed model concerns socio-economically favored social sectors whose survival is not as threatened by the pandemic as the poor sectors where wellbeing (and mental health) are at high risk. Some evidence shows that human connectedness to place may contribute to engagement in desirable behaviors. Interaction with other members of the household can help create meanings leading to collective actions promoting psychological wellbeing. Promoting hygienic behaviors in the household (frequent hand washing) while at the same time being conscious not to keep the water flowing when not required would contribute to a range of benefits (health, financial, biospheric, altruistic) and promote wellbeing. Engaging in pro-social behaviors may result in positive effects on psychological wellbeing, reducing mental distress giving rise to a sense of attachment and belongingness, trust and overall life satisfaction. Engaging people in low-effort pro-environmental behavior to maintain some levels of physical activity and biological harmony with natural environmental settings (e.g., gardening) may help reduce anxiety and distress. This is the first study exploring the interplay of relationships between place confinement, pro-social behavior, household pro-environmental behaviors, place attachment as a multi-dimensional construct and presenting their relationships to residents wellbeing. Behavioral change interventions are proposed to promote lifestyle change for peoples wellbeing and broader societal benefits.","output":"COVID-19 Place Confinement, Pro-Social, Pro-environmental Behaviors, and Residents Wellbeing: A New Conceptual Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The commercialization of medical devices and biotechnology products is characterized by high failure rates and long development lead times particularly among start-up enterprises.

Dynamic regulation of autophagy is associated with development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); however, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of autophagy in NAFLD/NASH are not well understood. Here we discuss our recent work identifying MLKL as an important nexus between autophagy and necroptosis in models of NAFLD/NASH. Mlkl, but not Ripk3, deficiency protects mice from Western diet-induced liver injury. Mlkl deficiency also prevents the accumulation of SQSTM1/p62 and LC3-II in liver in response to Western diet feeding or challenge with the protease inhibitor leupeptin. Western diet increases expression, phosphorylation and oligomerization of MLKL. In hepatocytes, palmitic acid (PA) induces the expression and translocation of MLKL to autophagosomes prior to the plasma membrane. Importantly, Mlkl, but not Ripk3, deficiency prevents the inhibition of autophagy by PA or chloroquine in hepatocytes. In contrast, overexpression of Mlkl blocks autophagic flux. Importantly, inhibition of autophagy by leupeptin or chloroquine triggers MLKL translocation to the plasma membrane, suggesting that MLKL is intimately involved in the regulation of autophagy under multiple conditions. These data indicate that MLKL contributes to Western diet-induced liver injury through inhibition of autophagy and induction of necroptosis.","output":"MLKL contributes to Western diet-induced liver injury through inhibiting autophagy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Comprehend, Cope and Connect (CCC) is a third-wave cognitive behavioural approach developed for acute mental health services.

The study adopted a within-subjects pre-post-test design. Participants (N=23) were recruited from five acute psychiatric wards and a crisis resolution home treatment team. Service users had a range of diagnoses of complex and severe mental health conditions, in particular mood, personality, and psychotic disorders. Feasibility data was gathered for number of times the CCC formulation was accepted, duration of CCC intervention, clinician adherence to manualised protocol, and frequency of goal-based activity completion. Acceptability data on pre- and post-CCC mood and post-CCC helpfulness were self-reported by participants. Findings indicated a significant increase in positive mood (large effect) and moderate-high helpfulness rating post-intervention. Most participants reported goal-based activity completion. There was high fidelity to the protocol, high percentage of acceptance of the formulation and formulation components completed, and frequent single-session completion. Single-session CCC appears feasible and acceptable in acute and crisis psychology services and yields formulation-driven goal-based activities intended to stabilise mental health crisis. High fidelity to formulation protocol suggests broader applications for single-session CCC, e.g. to support clinical staff to manage crisis situations in their work environment or to train non-psychologist clinicians to deliver the intervention for service users.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is a systemic disorder typically presenting with fever, fatigue, and upper and lower respiratory symptoms, although neurological manifestations are increasingly reported, but pathological mechanisms have yet to be established.

ICPs exist in both membrane and soluble forms in vivo and in vitro. Imbalances between inhibitory and stimulatory membrane-bound ICPs (mICPs) in malignant cells and immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) have been well documented. Blockades of inhibitory mICPs have emerged as an immense breakthrough in cancer therapeutics. However, the origin, structure, production regulation, and biological significance of soluble ICPs (sICPs) in health and disease largely remains elusive. Soluble ICPs can be generated through either alternative mRNA splicing and secretion or protease-mediated shedding from mICPs. Since sICPs are found in the bloodstream, they likely form a circulating immune regulatory system. In fact, there is increasing evidence that sICPs exhibit biological functions including (1) regulation of antibacterial immunity, (2) interaction with their mICP compartments to positively or negatively regulate immune responses, and (3) competition with their mICP compartments for binding to the ICP blocking antibodies, thereby reducing the efficacy of ICP blockade therapies. Here, we summarize current data of sICPs in cancer and infectious diseases. We particularly focus on sICPs in COVID-19 and HIV infection as they are the two ongoing global pandemics and have created the worlds most serious public health challenges. A storm of sICPs occurs in the peripheral circulation of COVID-19 patients and is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Similarly, sICPs are highly dysregulated in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and some sICPs remain dysregulated in PLHIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART), indicating these sICPs may serve as biomarkers of incomplete immune reconstitution in PLHIV on ART. We reveal that HIV infection in the setting of alcohol misuse exacerbates sICP dysregulation as PLHIV with heavy alcohol consumption have significantly elevated plasma levels of many sICPs. Thus, both stimulatory and inhibitory sICPs are present in the bloodstream of healthy people and their balance can be disrupted under pathophysiological conditions such as cancer, COVID-19, HIV infection, and alcohol misuse. There is an urgent need to study the role of sICPs in immune regulation in health and disease.","output":"Soluble Immune Checkpoints Are Dysregulated in COVID-19 and Heavy Alcohol Users With HIV Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnostic radiology plays a crucial role in children.

METHODS: We collected data on street reallocations (interventions that expand street space for active transportation or physical distancing) from April 1 to August 15, 2020 from websites and media. For each city, we summarized length of street reallocations (km) and described implementation strategies and communications. We assessed socio-spatial patterning of interventions by comparing differences in where interventions were implemented by area-level mobility, accessibility, and socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Two themes motivated street reallocations: supporting mobility, recreation, and physical distancing in populous areas, and bolstering COVID-19 recovery for businesses. The scale of responses ranged across cities, from Halifax adding an additional 20% distance to their bicycle network to Kelowna closing only one main street section. Interventions were located in downtown cores, areas with high population density, higher use of active transportation, and close proximity to essential destinations. With respect to socio-demographics, interventions tended to be implemented in areas with fewer children and areas with fewer visible minority populations. In Victoria, the interventions were in areas with lower income populations and higher proportions of Indigenous people.

The impact of bubbling on COVID-19 transmission is challenging to quantify because of the complex social structures involved. We developed a network description of households in the UK, using the configuration model to link households. We explored the impact of bubbling scenarios by joining together households of various sizes. For each bubbling scenario, we calculated the percolation threshold, that is, the number of connections per individual required for a giant component to form, numerically and theoretically. We related the percolation threshold to the household reproduction number. We find that bubbling scenarios in which single-person households join with another household have a minimal impact on network connectivity and transmission potential. Ubiquitous scenarios where all households form a bubble are likely to lead to an extensive transmission that is hard to control. The impact of plausible scenarios, with variable uptake and heterogeneous bubble sizes, can be mitigated with reduced numbers of contacts outside the household. Bubbling of households comes at an increased risk of transmission; however, under certain circumstances risks can be modest and could be balanced by other changes in behaviours.

However, to our knowledge no population-based study has assessed the association between the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and Bell's palsy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of Bell's palsy after BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccination. METHODS: In this case series and nested case-control study done in Hong Kong, we assessed the risk of Bell's palsy within 42 days following vaccination with BNT162b2 (FosunCBioNTech [equivalent to PfizerCBioNTech]) or CoronaVac (from Sinovac Biotech, Hong Kong) using data from voluntary surveillance reporting with the Hospital Authority, the COVID-19 Vaccine Adverse Event Online Reporting system for all health-care professionals, and the Hospital Authority's territory-wide electronic health records from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System. We described reported cases of Bell's palsy among vaccine recipients (aged 18C110 years for CoronaVac and aged 16C110 years for BNT162b2). We compared the estimated age-standardised incidence of clinically confirmed cases among individuals who had received the CoronaVac or BNT162b2 vaccination (up to 42 days before presentation) with the background incidence in the population. A nested case-control study was also done using conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for risk of Bell's palsy and vaccination. Cases and controls were matched (1:4) by age, sex, admission setting, and admission date. FINDINGS: Between February 23 and May 4, 2021, 451 939 individuals received the first dose of CoronaVac and 537 205 individuals received the first dose of BNT162b2. 28 clinically confirmed cases of Bell's palsy were reported following CoronaVac and 16 cases were reported following BNT162b2. The age-standardised incidence of clinically confirmed Bell's palsy was 669 cases per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 372 to 966) following CoronaVac vaccination and 428 per 100 000 person-years (194 to 661) for BNT162b2 vaccination. The age-standardised difference for the incidence compared with the background population was 415 (95% CI 117 to 714) for CoronaVac and 170 (?66 to 406) for BNT162b2, equivalent to an additional 48 cases per 100 000 people vaccinated for CoronaVac and 20 cases per 100 000 people vaccinated for BNT162b2. In the nested case-control analysis, 298 cases were matched to 1181 controls, and the adjusted ORs were 2385 (95% CI 1415 to 4022) for CoronaVac and 1755 (0886 to 3477) for BNT162b2. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest an overall increased risk of Bell's palsy after CoronaVac vaccination. However, the beneficial and protective effects of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine far outweigh the risk of this generally self-limiting adverse event. Additional studies are needed in other regions to confirm our findings. FUNDING: The Food and Health Bureau of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.

A robust surveillance system is essential for correct estimation of the disease burden and containment of the pandemic. We evaluated the performance of COVID-19 case-based surveillance system in FCT, Nigeria and assessed its key attributes. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional study design, comprising a survey, key informant interview, record review and secondary data analysis. A self-administered, semi-structured questionnaire was administered to key stakeholders to assess the attributes and process of operation of the surveillance system using CDCs Updated Guidelines for Evaluation of Public Health Surveillance System 2001. Data collected alongside surveillance data from March 2020 to January 2021 were analyzed and summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Out of 69,338 suspected cases, 12,595 tested positive with RT-PCR with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 18%. Healthcare workers were identified as high-risk group with a prevalence of 23.5%. About 82% respondents perceived the system to be simple, 85.5% posited that the system was flexible and easily accommodates changes, 71.4% reported that the system was acceptable and expressed willingness to continue participation. Representativeness of the system was 93%, stability 40%, data quality 56.2% and timeliness 45.5%, estimated result turnaround time (TAT) was suboptimal. CONCLUSION: The system was found to be useful, simple, flexible, sensitive, acceptable, with good representativeness but the stability, data quality and timeliness was poor. The system meets initial surveillance objectives but rapid expansion of sample collection and testing sites, improvement of TAT, sustainable funding, improvement of electronic database, continuous provision of logistics, supplies and additional trainings are needed to address identified weaknesses, optimize the system performance and meet increasing need of case detection in the wake of rapidly spreading pandemic. More risk-group persons should be tested to improve surveillance effectiveness.","output":"Performance of COVID-19 case-based surveillance system in FCT, Nigeria, March 2020 CJanuary 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Blood groups are considered to have an impact on the occurrence and severity of coronavirus disease. While among Chinese and Caucasian, blood group O individuals were less and group A were more likely to have severe disease and mortality, data on South Asians arent available. Objective This study aimed to find out the association of disease severity with blood group among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Materials and methodology Data were collected on a predesigned questionnaire containing details of patient demographics, medical comorbidities, clinical presentation, and laboratory parameters. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association of the blood group with the severity of coronavirus disease. Result Among the study participants, blood group B has the highest distribution (39.8%), followed by O (30.0), A (21.9%), and AB (8.1%). About three-fourths (69.9%) had mild to moderate disease while 30.0% had severe disease. Age, gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hemoglobin level were all associated with disease severity among COVID-19 patients in univariate analysis on P-value for selection (<0.25). The final model showed that the odds of disease severity is 3.62 times higher among males (OR: 3.62, 95% CI: 2.15-6.08) and 2.00 times higher among diabetic patients (OR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.10-3.01) as compared to female and non-diabetic respectively. However, there was no significant association found between blood group and disease severity. Conclusion Blood groups dont have any role in forecasting the severity of coronavirus disease. However, the male gender and diabetics are prone to have severe disease.","output":"The Relation of ABO Blood Group to the Severity of Coronavirus Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study From a Tertiary Care Hospital in Karachi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital pedagogy was used as a contingency plan to achieve teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, little is known about how breakthrough infection (BTI) in COVID-19 vaccinated individuals will impact the magnitude and breadth of the neutralizing antibody response. Here, we compared neutralizing antibody responses between unvaccinated and COVID-19 vaccinated individuals (including both AZD1222 and BNT162b2 vaccinees) who have been infected with the delta (B.1.617.2) variant. Rapid production of Spike-reactive IgG was observed in the vaccinated group providing evidence of effective vaccine priming. Overall, potent cross-neutralizing activity against current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern was observed in the BTI group compared to the infection group. This study provides important insights into population immunity where transmission levels remain high.","output":"Humoral responses following SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection in COVID-19 vaccinated individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Viruses have been a continuous threat to human beings.

We report a colorimetric viral detection method based on the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 endonuclease dead (dCas9) system. In this method, RNA in the viral lysate was directly recognized by the CRISPR/dCas9 system with biotin-protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-presenting oligonucleotide (PAMmer). Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase then bound to biotin-PAMmer, inducing a color change through the oxidation of 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine. Using the developed method, we successfully identified SARS-CoV-2, pH1N1, and pH1N1/H275Y viruses by the naked eye. Moreover, the detection of viruses in human nasopharyngeal aspirates and sputum was demonstrated. Finally, clinical samples from COVID-19 patients led to a successful diagnosis.

However, the primary drawback of this approach is poor cell and in vivo oligonucleotide uptake efficacy. Biological activities can be significantly enhanced through the use of synthetically conjugated cationic cell penetrating peptides (CPPs). Studies to date have focused on the delivery of a single SSO conjugated to a CPP, but here we describe the conjugation of two phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO) SSOs to a single CPP for simultaneous delivery and pre-mRNA targeting of two separate genes, exon 23 of the Dmd gene and exon 5 of the Acvr2b gene, in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Conjugations of PMOs to a single CPP were carried out through an amide bond in one case and through a triazole linkage (click chemistry) in the other. The most active bi-specific CPPCPMOs demonstrated comparable exon skipping levels for both pre-mRNA targets when compared to individual CPPCPMO conjugates both in cell culture and in vivo in the mdx mouse model. Thus, two SSOs with different target sequences conjugated to a single CPP are biologically effective and potentially suitable for future therapeutic exploitation.","output":"Bi-specific splice-switching PMO oligonucleotides conjugated via a single peptide active in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Effective treatments for patients with severe COVID-19 are needed. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of canakinumab, an anti-interleukin-1? antibody, in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial was conducted at 39 hospitals in Europe and the United States. A total of 454 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, hypoxia (not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]), and systemic hyperinflammation defined by increased blood concentrations of C-reactive protein or ferritin were enrolled between April 30 and August 17, 2020, with the last assessment of the primary end point on September 22, 2020. Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive a single intravenous infusion of canakinumab (450 mg for body weight of 40-<60 kg, 600 mg for 60-80 kg, and 750 mg for >80 kg; n = 227) or placebo (n = 227). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was survival without IMV from day 3 to day 29. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19-related mortality, measurements of biomarkers of systemic hyperinflammation, and safety evaluations. Results: Among 454 patients who were randomized (median age, 59 years; 187 women [41.2%]), 417 (91.9%) completed day 29 of the trial. Between days 3 and 29, 198 of 223 patients (88.8%) survived without requiring IMV in the canakinumab group and 191 of 223 (85.7%) in the placebo group, with a rate difference of 3.1% (95% CI, -3.1% to 9.3%) and an odds ratio of 1.39 (95% CI, 0.76 to 2.54; P = .29). COVID-19-related mortality occurred in 11 of 223 patients (4.9%) in the canakinumab group vs 16 of 222 (7.2%) in the placebo group, with a rate difference of -2.3% (95% CI, -6.7% to 2.2%) and an odds ratio of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.30 to 1.50). Serious adverse events were observed in 36 of 225 patients (16%) treated with canakinumab vs 46 of 223 (20.6%) who received placebo. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, treatment with canakinumab, compared with placebo, did not significantly increase the likelihood of survival without IMV at day 29.

Objective To assess pregnancy outcomes with COVID-19 lessons learned from the pandemic. Study design This retrospective observational study was conducted at Teerthanker Mahaveer Medical College and Research Centre, Moradabad, a level 3 COVID hospital in Northern India, with a patient pool of all the antenatal females diagnosed COVID 19 positive via a positive quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) test of maternal pharyngeal and nasal swab samples in the given time period of three months and ten days, i.e., May 25, 2020 to September 3, 2020. In conjunction with maternal outcomes, neonatal outcomes including evidence of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by testing neonatal pharyngeal swab samples. Results Out of 100 COVID-19 positive patients, the average age of women was 26.2 years, 73 women (73%) were asymptomatic, and 50 patients (50%) women had associated co-morbidities such as anaemia in 38 (38%) women, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) in four patients (4%) each, respectively. No case of spontaneous abortion in early gestation was reported. Out of 100 patients, 32 (32%) patients delivered during their stay, out of which 17 women (53.1%) delivered via cesarean section which was performed mainly due to obstetric indications. One maternal death was reported due to antepartum eclampsia which was unrelated to COVID-19 complications. Five neonates were born prematurely, out of which three were delivered followed by spontaneous premature preterm rupture of membranes (PPROM). The Appearance Pulse Grimace Activity Respiration (APGAR) score was recorded to be 9 at the five minutes mark in 28 out of 30 live babies (93.3%) and the birth weight of the babies ranged from 1.8 to 3.5 kg) with an average birth weight of 2.71 kg. Two neonatal deaths were reported due to respiratory distress. There were two documented intrauterine demise (IUD) cases both due to PIH. Furthermore, all 30 live neonates tested for SARS CoV-2 had negative results. Conclusion The spectrum of Coronavirus infection leans more towards asymptomatic and mild symptomatic clinical presentation. Favourably, the likelihood of spontaneous preterm birth was not escalated in our current study and remained low. The rate of intrauterine fetal demise and neonatal death were less. As none of the neonates tested positive for COVID-19, there is no corroborative proof of vertical perinatal transmission.","output":"Pregnancy Outcomes With COVID-19 Lessons Learned From the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We undertook a qualitative study to examine and compare the experience of ethical principles by telehealth practitioners and patients in relation to service delivery theory. The study was conducted prior to and during the recent global increase in the use of telehealth services due to the COVID-19 pandemic, METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 telehealth practitioners and patients using constructionist grounded theory methods to collect and analyse data. Twenty-five axial coded data categories were then unified and aligned through selective coding with the Beauchamp and Childress (2013) framework of biomedical ethics. The groups were then compared. RESULTS: Thirteen categories aligned to the ethical framework were identified for practitioners and 12 for patients. Variance existed between the groups. Practitioner results were non-maleficence 4/13 or (31%), beneficence 4/13 (31%), professionalCpatient relationships 3/12 (22%), autonomy 1/13 (8%) and justice 1/13 (8%).

This paper proposes an initial contactless web-based tele-health clinical decision support system that integrates near-field communication (NFC) tags and a smart cloud-based structuring tool that enables the quick diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 symptoms and monitors the remotely located quarantine wards during the recent pandemic. The proposed framework consists of three-stages: (i) contactless health parameter extraction from the patient using an NFC tag; (ii) converting medical report into digital text using optical character recognition algorithm and extracting values of relevant medical-parameters using natural language processing; and (iii) smart visualization of key medical parameters. The accuracy of the proposed system from NFC reader until analysis using a novel structuring algorithm deployed in the cloud is more than 94%. Several capabilities of the proposed web-based system were compared with similar systems and tested in an authentic mock clinical setup, and the physicians found that the system is reliable and user friendly.

This retrospective cohort study involved patients aged 20 years or older with symptoms of viral respiratory disease who were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection across the System of Epidemiological Surveillance of Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico from January 1 through November 4, 2020. Cox proportional-hazard regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio for 28-day mortality and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Among 757,210 patients with COVID-19 (outpatients and inpatients), 120,476 (16%) had diabetes and 80,616 died. Among 878,840 patients without COVID-19 (those who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection), 88,235 (10.0%) had diabetes and 20,134 died. Among patients with COVID-19, diabetes was associated with a hazard ratio for death of 1.49 (95% CI 1.47C1.52), adjusting for age, sex, smoking habit, obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiency, and cardiovascular, pulmonary, and chronic renal disease. The strength of the association decreased with age (trend test: P = 0.004). For example, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 3.12 (95% CI 2.86C3.40) for patients 20C39 years of age; in contrast, the adjusted hazard ratio of death for patients 80 years of age or older was 1.11 (95% CI 1.06C1.16). The adjusted hazard ratios were 1.66 (95% CI 1.58C1.74) in outpatients and 1.14 (95% CI 1.12C1.16) in inpatients. In hospitalized patients 80 years of age or older, no association was observed between diabetes and COVID-19-related mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.03; 95% CI 0.98C1.08). Among patients without COVID-19, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 1.78 (95% CI 1.73C1.84).

The post-lockdown period was associated with a 1.72 percentage point reduction (95% CI, -3.42%, -0.02%) in the risk of any adverse outcome (5% relative reduction) and a 1.62 percentage point reduction (95% CI, -2.69%, -0.55%) in the risk of any severe adverse outcome (14% relative reduction). Reductions in adverse outcomes were largest among women with HIV and among women delivering at urban delivery sites, driven primarily by reductions in preterm birth and SGA. Conclusions Adverse birth outcomes decreased from the pre-lockdown to post-lockdown periods in 2020, relative to the change during the same periods in 2017-2019.

However, in some cases a subpopulation of treated cells can exhibit a sublethal response, termed \\"minority MOMP\\". In this phenomenon, the affected cells survive, despite a low level of caspase activation and subsequent limited activation of the endonuclease CAD (DFFB). Consequently, these cells can experience DNA damage, increasing the probability of oncogenesis. However, little is known about the minority MOMP response. To discover genes that affect the MOMP response in individual cells, we conducted an imaging-based phenotypic siRNA screen. We identified multiple candidate genes whose downregulation increased the heterogeneity of MOMP within single cells, among which were genes related to mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy that participate in the mitochondrial quality control (MQC) system. Furthermore, to test the hypothesis that functional MQC is important for reducing the frequency of minority MOMP, we developed an assay to measure the clonogenic survival of caspase-engaged cells. We found that cells deficient in various MQC genes were indeed prone to aberrant post-MOMP survival. Our data highlight the important role of proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in preventing apoptotic dysregulation and oncogenesis.","output":"Disruption of Mitochondrial Quality Control Genes Promotes Caspase-Resistant Cell Survival Following Apoptotic Stimuli."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA and infectious virus particles from patient samples requires a good sample quality.

The Village Health Worker (VHW) program, initiated in 2007, is an example of a long standing horizontal CHW program in rural Southwestern Uganda that has delivered village-level care for chronic disease based on a biannual village health census that identifies individual and family health risks. To facilitate continuity of care for problems identified, health census data were electronically transformed into family-specific Family Health Sheets (FHS) in 2016 which summarize the pertinent demographic and health data for each family, as well as health topics the family would like to learn more about. The FHS, evaluated and discussed here, serves as an epidemiologically-informed bedside tool to help VHWs provide longitudinal care in their villages. METHODS: 48 VHWs in the program completed a survey on the utility of the FHS and 24 VHWs participated in small discussion groups. Responses were analyzed using both quantitative and standard conceptual content analysis models RESULTS: 46 out of 48 VHWs reported that the FHS made them a much better VHW. In addition to helping target interventions in child health, womens health, and sanitation, the FHS assisted follow-up of non-communicable diseases in the community. In discussion groups, VHWs reported that the FHS helped them understand risks for future disease, facilitated earning stipends, and increased credibility and trust in the community. Limitations cited were the infrequent updates of the FHS, only biannually with the census, and the lack of cross-reference capability by health problem. DISCUSSION: The FHS supports VHWs in providing longitudinal and comprehensive healthcare of chronic diseases in their villages. Limitations, potential solutions, and future directions are discussed.

DESCRIPTION: COVID-19 directly affects pregnant women causing more severe disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The indirect effects due to the monumental COVID-19 response are much worse, increasing maternal and neonatal mortality. ASSESSMENT: Amidst COVID-19, governments must balance effective COVID-19 response measures while continuing delivery of essential health services. Using the World Health Organizations operational guidelines as a base, countries must conduct contextualized analyses to tailor their operations. Evidence based information on different services and comparative cost-benefits will help decisions on trade-offs. Situational analyses identifying extent and reasons for service disruptions and estimates of impacts using modelling techniques will guide prioritization of services. Ensuring adequate supplies, maintaining core interventions, expanding non-physician workforce and deploying telehealth are some adaptive measures to optimize care. Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, governments must reinvest in maternal and child health by building more resilient maternal health services supported by political commitment and multisectoral engagement, and with assistance from international partners. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-sectoral investments providing high-quality care that ensures continuity and available to all segments of the population are needed. A robust primary healthcare system linked to specialist care and accessible to all segments of the population including marginalized subgroups is of paramount importance. Systematic approaches to digital health care solutions to bridge gaps in service is imperative.

On the 11th of March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and nations around the world have taken drastic measures to reduce transmission of the disease. The situation is similar in Switzerland, a small high-income country in Central Europe, where the first COVID-19 case was registered on the 25th of February 2020. Through literature review as well as correspondence with public health professionals and experts in mathematical modeling, this case study focuses on the outbreak's impact on Switzerland and on the measures this country has implemented thus far. Along with the rapid spread of the virus, the political organization, economy, healthcare system, and characteristics of the country greatly influence the approach taken in facing the crisis. Switzerland appears to be structurally well-prepared, but, according to mathematical modeling predictions, in order to avoid total collapse of healthcare facilities, the measures taken by the Swiss Government need to reduce the virus transmission chain by at least 70%. Fortunately, updated models on April 22nd show evidence that the non-pharmaceutical measures invoked have decreased transmission by an estimated 89%, proving effective management by the federal government and allowing for progressive deconfinement measures.","output":"Understanding the Dynamics of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Real-Time Analysis of Switzerland's First Wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The solid-liquid distribution coefficient (Kd) is a key input parameter in radioecological models. However, its large variability hampers its usefulness in modelling transport processes as well as its accuracy in representing soil-radionuclide interactions. For the specific case of radiocaesium, the analyses of a Cs Kd soil dataset (769 entries) showed that values varied over a five order of magnitude range, and the resulting Cs Kd best estimate (calculated as a geometric mean = 2.5  103 L kg-1) lacked reliability and representativity. Grouping data and creation of partial datasets based on the experimental approach (short-term (< ~1 yr) vs. long-term experiments (> ~1 yr)) and soil factors affecting Cs interaction (i.e., the ratio of the radiocaesium interception potential (RIP) to the potassium content in soil solution (Kss); organic matter content (OM) and soil texture) succeeded in reducing variability a few orders of magnitude, with Cs Kd best estimates also differing by one-two orders of magnitude depending on the type of soil and experimental approach. The statistical comparison of the Cs Kd best estimates and related cumulative distribution functions of the partial datasets revealed a relevant effect of the sorption dynamics on Cs Kd values (with long-term values systematically higher than short-term ones), and that the RIP/Kss ratio was an excellent predictor of Cs Kd for short-term scenarios, whereas the RIP parameter could be predicted on the basis of texture information. The OM threshold to distinguish between OM threshold to distinguish between Mineral and Organic soils subclasses, regarding Cs interaction was determined to be 50% and 90% OM for short- and long-term scenarios, respectively. It was then recommended to select the Cs Kd input data depending on the soils and scenarios to be assessed (e.g., short- vs. long-term; OM %) to improve the reliability and decrease the uncertainty of the radioecological models.","output":"Deriving probabilistic soil distribution coefficients (Kd).

We demonstrated that MS2 bacteriophage could successfully package double-stranded DNA of 1.3-, 3-, 3.5-, and 6.5-kb length into viral capsids with high reassembly efficiency. This is the first application of RNA bacteriophage MS2 as a platform to encapsulate double-stranded DNA, forming virus-like particles (VLPs) which were indistinguishable from native MS2 capsids in size and morphology. Moreover, by analyzing the interaction mechanism of pac site and the MS2 coat protein (CP), we found that in addition to the recognized initiation signal TR-RNA, TR-DNA can also trigger spontaneous reassembly of CP dimers, providing a more convenient and feasible method of assembly. In conclusion, this straightforward and reliable manufacturing approach makes armored DNA an ideal control and standard for use in clinical laboratory tests and diagnostics, possessing prospects for broad application, especially providing a new platform for the production of quality controls for DNA viruses.

Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) mainly responsible for the global warming and climate change. These GHGs have drawn lot of attention due to their significant role in the global warming potential. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested to stop global warming at 1.5oC above preindustrial levels as warming beyond this level might lead to heat extremes, alter insect and plant phenology (Phenological shifts) and more occurrence of vector borne diseases.

Results: Among 47 children, 22 children (46.8%) were aged 24 months or younger (ie, group A), with 11 boys (50.0%) and median (interquartile range [IQR]) age 12.5 (10.0-17.5) months, and 25 children (53.2%) were aged older than 24 months to 144 months or younger, with 13 boys (52.0%) and median (IQR) age 100.0 (72.0-120.0) months. During the first 60 minutes of evaluation in the 2 groups, there was no significant change in group A in median (IQR) partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (Petco2; 33.0 [32.0-34.0] mm Hg; P for Kruskal Wallis = .59), oxygen saturation (Sao2; 98.0% [97.0%-99.0%]; P for Kruskal Wallis = .61), pulse rate (PR; 130.0 [115.0-140.0] pulsations/min; P for Kruskal Wallis = .99), or respiratory rate (RR; 30.0 [28.0-33.0] breaths/min; P for Kruskal Wallis = .69) or for group B in median (IQR) Petco2 (36.0 [34.0-38.0] mm Hg; P for Kruskal Wallis = .97), Sao2 (98.0% [97.0%-98.0%]; P for Kruskal Wallis = .52), PR (96.0 [84.0-104.5] pulsations/min; P for Kruskal Wallis test = .48), or RR (22.0 [20.0-25.0] breaths/min; P for Kruskal Wallis = .55). After the group B walking test, compared with before the walking test, there was a significant increase in median (IQR) PR (96.0 [84.0-104.5] pulsations/min vs 105.0 [100.0-115.0] pulsations/min; P < .02) and RR (22.0 [20.0-25.0] breaths/min vs 26.0 [24.0-29.0] breaths/min; P < .05). Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study among infants and young children in Italy found that the use of facial masks was not associated with significant changes in Sao2 or Petco2, including among children aged 24 months and younger.","output":"Assessment of Respiratory Function in Infants and Young Children Wearing Face Masks During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intangibles provide competitive advantages and enhance productivity and efficiency. We investigate whether accumulated intangible assets mitigate the adverse impact of pandemic shocks on corporate performance. Using a sample of 8738 unique U.S. firms during the period 1985C2020, we find that a firm's pre-pandemic intangible assets mitigate the pandemic-induced negative stock price reaction and operating performance. We also show that the resilience to pandemic shocks is driven by both internally generated and externally acquired intangible assets. Finally, we explore related channels, and find that intangible assets-driven corporate resilience to pandemic shocks is explained by positive investor sentiment, customer loyalty, and managerial ability. Importantly, corporate resilience to pandemic shocks emanating from intangibles holds for non-Covid pandemic periods.

Methods The sample included US counties with at least one SARS-CoV-2 case during April 1 to May 15, 2020. Outcomes were growth in SARS-CoV-2 cases, SARS-CoV-2-related deaths, and mobility reduction across three settings: retail/recreation, grocery/pharmacy, and workplace. The main explanatory variable was the Social Deprivation Index (SDI), a composite socioeconomic disadvantage measure. Results Adjusted differences in outcomes between low-, medium-, and high-SDI counties (defined by tertile) were calculated using linear regression with state fixed effects. Workplace mobility reduction was 1.75 (95% CI, -2.36 to -1.14; P<.001) and 3.48 percentage points (CI, -4.21 to -2.75; P<.001) lower for medium- and high-SDI counties relative to low-SDI counties, respectively. Mobility reductions in the other settings were also significantly lower for higher-SDI counties. In analyses adjusted for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence on April 1, medium- and high-SDI counties had 1.39 (CI, 0.85 to 1.93; P<.001) and 2.56 (CI, 1.77 to 3.34; P<.001) more SARS-CoV-2 cases/1,000 on May 15 compared with low-SDI counties, respectively. Deaths per capita were also significantly higher for higher-SDI counties. Conclusion Counties with higher social deprivation scores experienced greater growth in SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths, but reduced mobility at lower rates. These findings are consistent with evidence demonstrating that economically disadvantaged communities have been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus 2019 pandemic. Efforts to socially distance may be more burdensome for these communities, potentially exacerbating disparities in SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes.","output":"Socioeconomic Disparities in Community Mobility Reduction and COVID-19 Growth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Opioid analgesics are essential for treating cancer pain. However, patients are sometimes reluctant to use them because of concerns about addiction and dependence. Rapid pain relief following opioid administration may help overcome the psychological barriers to opioid analgesic use. This study aims to determine the relationship between psychological resistance to strong opioid analgesic use and pain amelioration speed in patients with advanced recurrent cancer. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This ongoing, multicentre, observational study enrols patients aged 20 years or older with distant metastasis or advanced recurrent cancer receiving strong opioid analgesics for cancer pain for the first time. All participants, both inpatient and outpatient, were recruited from five Japanese hospitals. We are investigating the relationship between psychological barriers at the start of treatment and pain relief during the first week of treatment in these patients. The primary outcome is the Japanese version of the Barriers Questionnaire-II score at baseline. The secondary outcomes are the relationships between psychological barriers to strong opioid analgesic use and changes in pain over time. The participants are asked to fill out an electronic patient-reported outcome daily during the first week of treatment. The sample size was determined based on the number of patients in the year prior to study commencement who used strong opioid analgesics, met the eligibility criteria and could be expected to consent to participate in the study. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee (approval ID B200600091) of Yokohama City University on 24 August 2020.

This study aims to investigate the incidence and predictors of weight gain during the quarantine period. METHODS: An online survey was performed five months after the social distance measures implementation. Participants recorded their current and usual weight before lockdown. A multivariate logistic regression model was performed. RESULTS: Data on 1334 participants were evaluated (33.6y, 79.8% females), and 58.8% have gained weight (3.0 kg; 0.1 to 30.0 kg). Predictors of weight gain were increased food intake (OR = 5.40); snacking (OR = 2.86); fast food (OR = 1.11); canned products (OR = 1.08); and in physical activity (OR = 0.99) concerning the period before the pandemic; also time spent at work, including household chores (OR = 1.58); evening snack (OR = 1.54); higher frequency of alcoholic beverage intake (OR = 1.59) and dose of alcoholic beverage (OR = 1.11); uncontrolled eating (OR = 1.01), and vegetable intake (OR = 0.92) during the quarantine and physical activity before pandemic period (OR = 0.99).

Exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic, provider well-being has become a critical issue for health care systems worldwide. We describe the prevalence and key system-level drivers of burnout in oncologists in Ontario, Canada. METHODS This is a cross-sectional survey study conducted in November-December 2019 of practicing cancer care physicians (surgical, medical, radiation, gynecologic oncology, and hematology) in Ontario, Canada. Ontario is Canada's largest province (with a population of 14.5 million), and has a single-payer publicly funded cancer system. The primary outcome was burnout experience assessed through the Maslach Burnout Inventory. RESULTS A total of 418 physicians completed the questionnaire (response rate was 44% among confirmed oncologists). Seventy-three percent (n = 264 of 362) of oncologists had symptoms of burnout (high emotional exhaustion and/or depersonalization scores). Significant drivers of burnout identified in multivariable regression modeling included working in a hectic or chaotic atmosphere (odds ratio [OR] = 15.5; 95% CI, 3.4 to 71.5; P < .001), feeling unappreciated on the job (OR = 7.9; 95% CI, 2.9 to 21.3; P < .001), reporting poor or marginal control over workload (OR = 7.9; 95% CI, 2.9 to 21.3; P < .001), and not being comfortable talking to peers about workplace stress (OR = 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1 to 7.9; P < .001). Older age ( 56 years) was associated with lower odds of burnout (OR = 0.16; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.4; P < .001). CONCLUSION Nearly three quarters of participants met predefined standardized criteria for burnout. This number is striking, given the known impact of burnout on provider mental health, patient safety, and quality of care, and suggests Oncologists in Ontario may be a vulnerable group that warrants attention. Health care changes being driven by the COVID-19 pandemic provide an opportunity to rebuild new systems that address drivers of burnout. Creating richer peer-to-peer and leadership engagement opportunities among early- to mid-career individuals may be a worthwhile organizational strategy.","output":"Prevalence and Workplace Drivers of Burnout in Cancer Care Physicians in Ontario, Canada."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are observed in severe COVID-19 infections and cytokine storm is associated with disease severity. Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, is used to treat chimeric antigen receptor T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome and may attenuate the dysregulated immune response in COVID-19. We compared outcomes among tocilizumab-treated and untreated critically ill COVID-19 patients. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a retrospective observational study conducted at a tertiary referral center investigating all patients admitted to the intensive care unit for COVID-19 who had a disposition from the hospital because of death or hospital discharge between March 1, 2020 and May 18, 2020 (n=96). The percentages of death and secondary infections were compared between patients treated with tocilizumab (n=55) and those who were not (n=41). Measurements and Main Results More tocilizumab-treated patients required mechanical ventilation (44/55, 80%) compared to non-treated patients (15/41, 37%; p<0.001). Of 55 patients treated with tocilizumab, 32 (58%) were on mechanical ventilation at the time of administration and 12 (22%) progressed to mechanical ventilation after treatment. Thirty of 44 (68%) treated ventilated patients were intubated within one day of tocilizumab. Fewer deaths were observed among tocilizumab-treated patients, both in the overall population (15% vs. 37%; p=0.02) and among the subgroup of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (14% vs. 60%; p=0.001). Secondary infections were not different between the two groups (tocilizumab: 31%, non-tocilizumab: 17%; p=0.16) and were predominantly related to invasive devices, such as urinary and central venous catheters.

The aim of the present study is to compare selection processes to specialist surgeon training in the European Union (EU). A secondary goal is to provide guidance for evidence-based methods by a proposed minimum standard that would align countries within the EU. METHODS: Publications and grey literature describing selection strategies were sought. Correspondence with Union Europenne des Mdecins Specialists (UEMS) Section of Surgery delegates was undertaken to solicit current information on national selection processes. Content analysis of 13 semi-structured interviews with experienced Swedish surgeons on the selection process. Two field trips to Ireland, a country with a centralized selection process were conducted. Based on collated information typical cases of selection in a centralized and decentralized setting, Ireland and Sweden, are described and compared. RESULTS: A multitude of methods for selection to surgical training programs were documented in the 27 investigated countries, ranging from locally run processes with unstructured interviews to national systems for selection of trainees with elaborate structured interviews, and non-technical and technical skills assessments. Associated with the difference between centralized and decentralized selection systems is whether surgical training is primarily governed by an employment or educational logic. Ireland had the most centralized and elaborate system, conducting a double selection process using evidence-based methods along an educational logic. On the opposite end of the scale Sweden has a decentralized, local selection process with a paucity of evidence-based methods, no national guidelines and operates along an employment logic, and Spain that rely solely on examination tests to rank candidates. CONCLUSION: The studied European countries all have different processes for selection of surgical trainees and the use of evidence-based methods for selection is variable despite similar educational systems. Selection in decentralized systems is currently often conducted non-transparent and subjectively. A suggested improvement towards an evidence-based framework for selection applicable in centralized and decentralized systems as well as educational and employer logics is suggested.

We observed that 13 of 17 patients with COVID-19 had stereotypic variable heavy chain (V(H)) antibody clonotypes directed against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These antibody clonotypes were composed of immunoglobulin heavy variable 3-53 (IGHV3-53) or IGHV3-66 and immunoglobulin heavy joining 6 (IGHJ6) genes. These clonotypes included IgM, IgG3, IgG1, IgA1, IgG2, and IgA2 subtypes and had minimal somatic mutations, which suggested swift class switching after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The different IGHV chains were paired with diverse light chains resulting in binding to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Human antibodies specific for the RBD can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting entry into host cells. We observed that one of these stereotypic neutralizing antibodies could inhibit viral replication in vitro using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that these V(H) clonotypes existed in 6 of 10 healthy individuals, with IgM isotypes predominating. These findings suggest that stereotypic clonotypes can develop de novo from na?ve B cells and not from memory B cells established from prior exposure to similar viruses.

On the other hand, COVID-19 could worse pre-existing CVD or trigger the development of new-onset CVD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between pre-existing CVD, CV risk factors, and CV therapy with the clinical course of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients admitted to the Cardiovascular COVID-19 Unit at Policlinico Umberto I of Rome between December 2020 and April 2021 were enrolled. All patients underwent a cardiovascular evaluation including troponin, electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiogram. Data on medical history, pre-existing CVD, CV risk factors, and therapy were collected. Admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU), as well as the development of new-onset CVD, were considered as endpoint of the study. Among n = 229 patients enrolled, 22 (10%) died. Nearly half of patients (112, 49%) were admitted to the ICU/CICU. The presence of prior ischaemic heart disease nearly doubled the probability of hospitalization in the ICU/CICU (HR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.132C3.866, P 0.018). In regards of therapy, beta blockers reduced the likelihood of admission in the ICU/CICU (HR: ?1016, 95% CI: 0.192C10.682, P 0.002). However, neither the use of RAAS blockers, heparin or dexamethasone influenced the risk of ICU/CICU admission (respectively, HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.498C1.450, P 0.551; HR: 0.768, 95% CI: 0.435C1.356, P 0.363; HR: 0.861, 95% CI: 0.453C1.635, P 0.647). N = 89 patients (39%) experienced a new onset CVD including arrythmias (18.3%) with nearly half experiencing atrial fibrillation, acute coronary syndrome (10.9%), acute pulmonary embolism (5.3%), heart failure (HF) (3%), and myocarditis and pericarditis (1.3%). A pre-existing diagnosis of HF substantially increased the likelihood of new onset CVD (HR: 2.380, 95% CI: 1.004C5.638, P 0.049).

A susceptible-exposed-infectious-asymptomatic-recovered (SEIAR) model was developed for the assessment. The information of each confirmed case and asymptomatic infection was collected from Ningbo Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to calculate the key parameters of the model in Ningbo City, China. A total of 157 confirmed COVID-19 cases (including 51 imported cases and 106 secondary cases) and 30 asymptomatic infections were reported in Ningbo City. The proportion of asymptomatic infections had an increasing trend. The proportion of elder people in the asymptomatic infections was lower than younger people, and the difference was statistically significant (Fisher's Exact Test, P = 0.034). There were 22 clusters associated with 167 SARS-CoV-2 infections, among which 29 cases were asymptomatic infections, accounting for 17.37%. We found that the secondary attack rate (SAR) of asymptomatic infections was almost the same as that of symptomatic cases, and no statistical significance was observed (&#967;2 = 0.052, P = 0.819) by Kruskal-Wallis test. The effective reproduction number (Reff) was 1.43, which revealed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was moderate. If the interventions had not been strengthened, the duration of the outbreak would have lasted about 16 months with a simulated attack rate of 44.15%. The total attack rate (TAR) and duration of the outbreak would increase along with the increasing delay of intervention. SARS-CoV-2 had moderate transmissibility in Ningbo City, China.

The resultant cytokines were then analyzed for their interrelationships and fluctuating features in sequential samples from 38 COVID-19 patients. Three cytokines, M-CSF, IL-8 and SCF, which were clustered into 3 different correlation groups and had relatively small fluctuations during SARS-CoV-2 infection, were selected for the construction of a multiclass classification model. This model discriminated healthy individuals and asymptomatic and nonsevere patients with accuracy of 77.4% but was not successful in classifying severe patients. Further searching led to a single cytokine, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which classified severe from nonsevere COVID-19 patients with a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 97.9% under a cutoff value of 1128 pg/ml. The level of this cytokine did not increase in nonsevere patients but was significantly elevated in severe patients. Considering its potent antiinflammatory function, we suggest that HGF might be a new candidate therapy for critical COVID-19.

Bronchoscopy is a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure with a potential for direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure and hospital-acquired infection. Current guidelines about personal protective equipment and environment considerations represent key competencies to minimize droplets dispersion and reduce the risk of transmission. Different measures should be put in field based on setting, patient's clinical characteristics, urgency and indications of bronchoscopy.

There were 8.8% who were classified as high risk due to failure in removing and replacing personal protective equipment (PPE); 6.3% were at high risk for not performing hand hygiene before and after touching COVID-19 patients, and 5% did not follow the recommended guidelines in performing hand hygiene after touching the patients' surroundings. In addition, 3.8% of the participants had an accident related to biological material, such as with splashes of biological fluid (in the eyes). These nurses were classified as high risk for COVID-19 virus infection, CONCLUSION: This study identifies practices that need improvement in combatting this virus. Since policies and guidelines may not always be optimal in all settings, a tailor-fitted guideline is appropriate. Nurse leaders, for example, need to establish an infection control system that provides real-time monitoring and facilitates immediate correction for nurses. Doing so will provide the nurses with a continuous awareness of predisposing themselves to acquiring the virus.","output":"Risk assessment and management among frontline nurses in the context of the COVID-19 virus in the northern region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the landscape of both inpatient and outpatient healthcare. During the height of the pandemic, most elective and many nonelective procedures were halted. Prenatal care services including ultrasound and genetic screening and testing remained active (given gestational age dependence) while shifting from in-person towards telehealth counseling. NewYork Citywas at the epicenter of the pandemic fromMarch through June 2020. Elective procedures at Montefiore Medical Center, which serves a diverse urban population in the Bronx, NY,were cancelled from March 16, 2020 to June 20, 2020. Prenatal ultrasound shifted from a dating ultrasound and a nuchal translucency ultrasound to one first trimester ultrasound and anatomy scans were scheduled at 20C22 weeks gestation rather than 18C20 weeks. The majority of counseling sessions were conducted via telehealth and prenatal diagnostic procedures (including amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling [CVS]) were performed with a limited team to adhere to COVID-19 protocols. We examined the impact of this shift on rates of prenatal genetic screening and diagnostic procedures before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous literature has revealed that since the advent of noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS), prenatal genetic diagnostic procedures rates have been on the decline.We hypothesized that the rate of genetic diagnostic procedure rates would decrease and NIPS would increase as compared to the similar period in 2019. Methods: Retrospective analysis of data collected in a secure institutional logbook at Montefiore Medical Center Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Womens Health (Division of Reproductive and Medical Genetics and Division of Fetal Medicine and Ultrasound) from January 1, 2019CDecember 31, 2020. Collected data included number of procedures, gestational age, and indication for procedure (categorized as advanced maternal age (AMA), ultrasound anomalies, positive screening test, hereditary disease in the family possibly affecting fetus (including family history or genetic carrier), or other. Procedures for multiple gestations were considered as a single procedure.. Results: 503 diagnostic procedures (359 amniocenteses and 144 CVS) were included. Most common indication (ultrasound anomaly) and average gestational age (13 weeks for CVS and 19 weeks for amniocentesis) were the same in 2019 and 2020. In total, 275 procedures were performed in 2019 as compared to 228 in 2020 (20.6% decrease) ( p = 0.018). Specifically, amniocentesis decreased from 187 to 172 (8% decrease) ( p = 0.214) and CVS decreased from 88 to 56 (36% decrease) ( p = 0.004). NIPS increased from 1,312 tests in 2019 to 1727 tests in 2020 (31.6%) ( p < 0.001). The same data points were then analyzed during the four-month period at the height of the pandemic in New York City. We compared numbers of procedures from the period March 1, 2019CJune 30, 2019 to March 1, 2020CJune 30, 2020. Total prenatal diagnostic procedures during this period were 91 in 2019 and 81 in 2020 (12.3% decrease). This included 59 amniocenteses compared with 60 in the same period in 2020 (1.6% increase) and 32 CVS in 2019 compared to 21 in 2020 (34.3% decrease). Noninvasive prenatal screening increased from 348 to 510 (increase of 46.5%) during this period. Discussion: At Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, NY, prenatal genetic diagnostic procedures decreased while NIPS rates increased during the pandemic. This trend may reflect patients concerns for a COVID-19 exposure during in-office procedures, shift to telehealth counseling, or be reflective of the overall trends seen since the widespread offering of NIPS to prenatal patients. The decrease in CVS may be explained by an intentional system delay of combining ultrasound and blood draw to a single visit at the end of the first trimester. Future studies should investigate how access to care and gestational age at the time of presentation influenced prenatal genetic screening and testing cho ces during the pandemic, in order to better explain the identified trends.","output":"eP499 Prenatal genetic screening and diagnostic testing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Bronx, NY"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The safety of performing spinal anaesthesia for both patients and anaesthetists alike in the presence of active infection with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]). Spinal anaesthesia was not associated with cardiorespiratory compromise intraoperatively. No patients subsequently developed severe pneumonia. Of 44 anaesthetists, 37 (84.1%) provided spinal anaesthesia using Level 3 PPE. Coronavirus disease 2019 infection was subsequently confirmed by PCR in 5/44 (11.4%) anaesthetists. One (2.7%) of 37 anaesthetists who wore Level 3 PPE developed PCR-confirmed COVID-19 compared with 4/7 (57.1%) anaesthetists who had Level 1 protection in the operating theatre (relative risk reduction: 95.3% [95% confidence intervals: 63.7C99.4]; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal anaesthesia was delivered safely in patients with active COVID-19 infection, the majority of whom had Caesarean sections.

Much research has been done in recent years in the development of sophisticated data-driven models for realistic computer-based simulations of infectious disease spreading. However, only a few computational tools are presently available for assessing scenarios, predicting epidemic evolutions, and managing health emergencies that can benefit a broad audience of users including policy makers and health institutions. RESULTS: We present \\"GLEaMviz\\", a publicly available software system that simulates the spread of emerging human-to-human infectious diseases across the world. The GLEaMviz tool comprises three components: the client application, the proxy middleware, and the simulation engine. The latter two components constitute the GLEaMviz server. The simulation engine leverages on the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEaM) framework, a stochastic computational scheme that integrates worldwide high-resolution demographic and mobility data to simulate disease spread on the global scale. The GLEaMviz design aims at maximizing flexibility in defining the disease compartmental model and configuring the simulation scenario; it allows the user to set a variety of parameters including: compartment-specific features, transition values, and environmental effects. The output is a dynamic map and a corresponding set of charts that quantitatively describe the geo-temporal evolution of the disease. The software is designed as a client-server system. The multi-platform client, which can be installed on the user's local machine, is used to set up simulations that will be executed on the server, thus avoiding specific requirements for large computational capabilities on the user side. CONCLUSIONS: The user-friendly graphical interface of the GLEaMviz tool, along with its high level of detail and the realism of its embedded modeling approach, opens up the platform to simulate realistic epidemic scenarios. These features make the GLEaMviz computational tool a convenient teaching/training tool as well as a first step toward the development of a computational tool aimed at facilitating the use and exploitation of computational models for the policy making and scenario analysis of infectious disease outbreaks.","output":"The GLEaMviz computational tool, a publicly available software to explore realistic epidemic spreading scenarios at the global scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The establishment of SARS CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped lentiviral (LV) systems has enabled the rapid identification of entry inhibitors and neutralizing agents, alongside allowing for the study of this emerging pathogen in BSL-2 level facilities. While such frameworks recapitulate the cellular entry process in ACE2+ cells, they are largely unable to factor in supplemental contributions by other SARS CoV-2 genes. To address this, we performed an unbiased ORF screen and identified the nucleoprotein (N) as a potent enhancer of spike-pseudotyped LV particle infectivity. We further demonstrate that the spike protein is better enriched in virions when the particles are produced in the presence of N protein. This enrichment of spike renders LV particles more infectious as well as less vulnerable to the neutralizing effects of a human IgG-Fc fused ACE2 microbody. Importantly, this improvement in infectivity is observed with both wild-type spike protein as well as the D614G mutant.

RESULTS: In this report, we firstly analyzed its genome and two open reading frameworks (ORFs) from this aspect of codon usage bias. Our researches indicated that mutation pressure rather than natural is the most important determinant in RHDV with high codon bias, and the codon usage bias is nearly contrary between ORF1 and ORF2, which is maybe one of factors regulating the expression of VP60 (encoding by ORF1) and VP10 (encoding by ORF2). Furthermore, negative selective constraints on the RHDV whole genome implied that VP10 played an important role in RHDV lifecycle.

Face mask-induced facial dermatosis has been investigated previously in healthcare workers without involving the general population. However, as a precautionary measure against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, wearing a face mask has become mandatory for the general population, similar to healthcare workers. Objective: To measure the prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic-induced facial dermatosis. Also, to determine the type of face mask used that causes the most facial dermatosis and the association between prolonged usage of face masks and facial dermatosis in Western Saudi Arabia's population. Methods: The study covers the Western region of Saudi Arabia. A self-administered Google survey was shared on social media. The study used prior surveys from similar studies. The data collection included participants demographic information, pre-existing skin conditions, mask type, and mask-related skin conditions. The data were analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results: The median age was 30 years (interquartile range {IQR} 23-43).

Absent or inadequate blinding in clinical trials has consistently been shown in large meta-analyses to result in overestimation of intervention effects. Blinding in dry needling trials, particularly blinding of participants and therapists, is a practical challenge; therefore, specific effects of dry needling have yet to be determined. Despite this, dry needling is widely used by health practitioners internationally for the treatment of pain. This review presents the first empirical account of the influence of blinding on intervention effect estimates in dry needling trials. The aim of this systematic review was to determine whether participant beliefs about group allocation relative to actual allocation (blinding effectiveness), and/or adequacy of blinding procedures, moderated pain outcomes in dry needling trials. Methods Twelve databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, Scopus, CINAHL, PEDro, The Cochrane Library, Trove, ProQuest, trial registries) were searched from inception to February 2016. Trials that compared active dry needling with a sham that simulated dry needling were included. Two independent reviewers performed screening, data extraction, and critical appraisal. Available blinding effectiveness data were converted to a blinding index, a quantitative measurement of blinding, and meta-regression was used to investigate the influence of the blinding index on pain. Adequacy of blinding procedures was based on critical appraisal, and subgroup meta-analyses were used to investigate the influence of blinding adequacy on pain. Meta-analytical techniques used inverse-variance random-effects models. Results The search identified 4,894 individual publications with 24 eligible for inclusion in the quantitative syntheses. In 19 trials risk of methodological bias was high or unclear. Five trials were adequately blinded, and blinding was assessed and sufficiently reported to compute the blinding index in 10 trials. There was no evidence of a moderating effect of blinding index on pain. For short-term and long-term pain assessments pooled effects for inadequately blinded trials were statistically significant in favour of active dry needling, whereas there was no evidence of a difference between active and sham groups for adequately blinded trials. Discussion The small number and size of included trials meant there was insufficient evidence to conclusively determine if a moderating effect of blinding effectiveness or adequacy existed. However, with the caveats of small sample size, generally unclear risk of bias, statistical heterogeneity, potential publication bias, and the limitations of subgroup analyses, the available evidence suggests that inadequate blinding procedures could lead to exaggerated intervention effects in dry needling trials.","output":"Effectiveness and adequacy of blinding in the moderation of pain outcomes: Systematic review and meta-analyses of dry needling trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of countries' Bacillus Calmette\\\\Gurin (BCG) vaccination policies on the course of coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) outbreak is a curiosity.

Rapid and informed guidance of epidemic (research) responses to severe infectious disease outbreaks requires quick compilation and integration of existing pathophysiological knowledge. As a case study we chose the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak that started in 2015 to develop a proof-of-concept knowledge repository. To extract data from available sources and build a computationally tractable and comprehensive molecular interaction map we applied generic knowledge management software for literature mining, expert knowledge curation, data integration, reporting and visualization. A multi-disciplinary team of experts, including clinicians, virologists, bioinformaticians and knowledge management specialists, followed a pre-defined workflow for rapid integration and evaluation of available evidence. While conventional approaches usually require months to comb through the existing literature, the initial ZIKV KnowledgeBase (ZIKA KB) was completed within a few weeks. Recently we updated the ZIKA KB with additional curated data from the large amount of literature published since 2016 and made it publicly available through a web interface together with a step-by-step guide to ensure reproducibility of the described use case. In addition, a detailed online user manual is provided to enable the ZIKV research community to generate hypotheses, share knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and interactively explore and interpret data. A workflow for rapid response during outbreaks was generated, validated and refined and is also made available.

This may, in part, be attributable to variable pre-existing neutralizing immunity in patients, which can impact the antitumor efficacy and lead to response heterogeneity. Our aim was to isolate new Ads for the development of oncolytic vectors with low prevalence of neutralizing immunity in the human population. To this end, we isolated a collection of new nonhuman primate (nhp) Ads from stool samples of four great ape species held captive. We elected 12 isolates comprising the broadest genetic variability for further characterization. For three new nhpAds, all classified as the human adenovirus B (HAdV-B) species, no neutralizing activity could be detected when exposed to a preparation of immunoglobulins isolated from a pool of >1,000 donors as a surrogate of population immunity. In addition, the nhpAds of the HAdV-B species showed enhanced oncolytic potency compared to nhpAds of the HAdV-C species as well as to human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-C5) in vitro when tested in a panel of 29 human cancer cell lines. Next-generation sequencing of the viral genomes revealed higher sequence similarity between hAds and nhpAds of HAdV-B compared to HAdV-C, which might underlie the differences in oncolytic ability. As a proof-of-concept, the Rb-binding domain of the E1A protein of the gorilla-derived HAdV-B nhpAd-lumc007 was deleted, thereby creating a new oncolytic derivative, which demonstrated increased oncolytic potential compared to HAdV-C5. Collectively, our data demonstrate that nhpAds of the HAdV-B species can serve as an alternative for the development of potent oncolytic Ad vectors with limited pre-existing neutralizing immunity in humans.","output":"Nonhuman Primate Adenoviruses of the Human Adenovirus B Species Are Potent and Broadly Acting Oncolytic Vector Candidates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To determine whether plasma human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA predates clinical recurrence and compare its accuracy with 3-month fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in locally advanced cervical cancer. METHODS This prospective multicenter study accrued 23 women with stage IB to IVA cervical cancer planned for definitive chemoradiation therapy (CRT). Plasma HPV DNA was measured serially by digital polymerase chain reaction, and FDG-PET was performed at 3 months post-CRT. RESULTS Of the 19 women with HPV+ cervical cancer included in this analysis, 32% were stage IB, 58% IIB, and 10% IIIB/IVA. Median follow-up was 24 months (range, 18 to 30 months). All patients had detectable plasma HPV DNA before treatment. Six patients had detectable plasma HPV DNA at the end of CRT, and three of them developed metastases at 3 months. Of the 13 patients with undetectable plasma HPV DNA at end of CRT, to date, only one has developed recurrence. Six of those 13 patients had a positive 3-month FDG-PET with no definite residual disease on subsequent imaging or clinical examination to date, and four of these six had undetectable plasma HPV DNA at 3 months. Patients with undetectable plasma HPV DNA at end of CRT had significantly higher 18-month progression-free survival than those with detectable plasma HPV DNA (92% v 50%; P = .02). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (accuracy) of 3-month plasma HPV DNA and 3-month FDG-PET imaging for predicting recurrence at 18 months were 77% and 60%, respectively (P = .008). CONCLUSION Detectable plasma HPV DNA at end of CRT predates the clinical diagnosis of metastases and is associated with inferior progression-free survival. Moreover, 3-month plasma HPV DNA level is more accurate than 3-month FDG-PET imaging in detecting residual disease. The clinical utility of plasma HPV DNA detection for guiding adjuvant/salvage therapy should be evaluated in future studies.","output":"Circulating Human Papillomavirus DNA as a Biomarker of Response in Patients With Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer Treated With Definitive Chemoradiation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newly emerging coronavirus.

We reviewed the incidence and the pathogens involved in HAI among infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICU) in Brazil. METHODS: A search was conducted in the MEDLINE, LILACS and SciELO databases from January 1995 to October 2019. Two authors scrutinized potential articles independently, after one author selected them from screening abstracts from every article flagged as related to neonatal HAI. Then, they were included in the review if they met our inclusion criteria. The studies were evaluated based on a quality score proposed by the authors, rated 0 to 1, with 1 point as the best quality rate. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for HAI cumulative incidence and incidence density were calculated, when the same denominators were available, using meta-analysis. A quality effect was applied to the models using the MetaXL software. Heterogeneity was assessed using I(2) statistics and the Cochrans Q test. RESULTS: Of a total of 5596 citations identified, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, which comprised 24,408 patients and 312,744 patient-days. Quality of the studies varied between 0.36 and 1 according to the adopted score, and six (40.0%) studies presented a score of 1.

We used routine surveillance data from Portugal to identify risk factors for COVID-19 outcomes, in order to support risk stratification, clinical and public health interventions, and to improve scenarios to plan health care resources. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study including 20,293 laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Portugal to 28 April 2020, electronically through the National Epidemic Surveillance System of the Directorate-General of Health(DGS). We calculated absolute risks, relative risks (RR) and adjusted relative risks (aRR) to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with hospitalization, admission to ICU and death using Poisson regressions. Results Increasing age after 60 years was the greatest determinant for all outcomes. Assuming 0-50 years as reference, being aged 80-89 years was the strongest determinant of hospital admission (aRR-5.7), 70-79 years for ICU(aRR-10.4) and >90 years for death(aRR-226.8) with an aRR of 112.7 in those 70-79 . Among comorbidites, Immunodeficiency, cardiac disease, kidney disease, and neurologic disease were independent risk factors for hospitalization (aRR 1.83, 1.79, 1.56, 1.82), for ICU these were cardiac, Immunodeficiency, kidney and lung disease (aRR 4.33, 2.76, 2.43, 2.04), and for death they were kidney, cardiac and chronic neurological disease (aRR: 2.9, 2.6, 2.0) Male gender was a risk factor for all outcomes. There were statistically significant differences for the 3 outcomes between regions. Discussion and Conclusions Older age stands out as the strongest risk factor for all outcomes specially for death as absolute is risk was small for those younger than 50. These findings have implications in terms of risk stratified public health measures that should prioritize protecting older people. Epidemiologic scenarios and clinical guidelines may consider the estimated risks, even though under-ascertainment of mild and asymptomatic cases should be considered in different age groups.","output":"COVID-19 :Determinants of Hospitalization, ICU and Death among 20,293 reported cases in Portugal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Internal coherence in research refers to the alignment between ontology (nature of reality), epistemology (nature of knowledge), axiology (values), methodology and methods and is an important but often overlooked element of research quality. We therefore aimed to illustrate the concept of internal coherence in nutrition and dietetics research, and its importance beyond individual elements of study quality. METHOD: A targeted literature search in Nutrition and Dietetics was used to identify research illustrating one example of three main approaches to research (scientific, interpretive and critical inquiry) published between November 2017 and November 2020. Studies were included if they related to education research based on the expertise of the authors, and illustrated diverse points about internal coherence. The authors independently critiqued included studies for internal coherence and synthesised their findings. RESULTS: From 76 manuscripts, 14 were identified as describing education research. Of the three selected studies that were critiqued, all had elements of internal coherence, in particular alignment between epistemology and methodology. However, each had elements of misalignment too, specifically between epistemology, axiology and method. The results point to the profession's historical groundings privileging the scientific approach, showing how this can yield misalignments, particularly when describing the limitations of interpretive and critical inquiry approaches. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrates the importance of internal coherence as a marker of quality, over and above existing quality assessment checklists for qualitative and quantitative methodologies.

Many nations are employing combinations of containment and mitigation strategies, where early diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital in controlling illness progression and limiting viral spread within the population. Thus, rapid and accurate methods of early detection are vital to contain COVID-19 and prevent further spread and predicted subsequent infectious waves of viral recurrence in future. Immediately after its initial characterization, Chinese and American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) rapidly employed molecular assays for detection of COVID-19, mostly employing real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. However, such methods require specific expensive items of equipment and highly trained analysts, requiring upwards of 4-8 hours to process. These requirements coupled with associated financial pressures may prevent effective deployment of such diagnostic tests. Loop mediated isothermal amplification(LAMP) is method of nucleic acid amplification which exhibits increased sensitivity and specificity are significantly rapid, and do not require expensive reagents or instruments, which aids in cost reduction for coronavirus detection. Studies have shown the successful application of LAMP assays in various forms to detect coronavirus RNA in patient samples, demonstrating that 1-10 copies of viral RNA template per reaction are sufficient for successful detection, 100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR methods. Importantly, studies have also now demonstrated the effectiveness of LAMP methodology in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at significantly low levels, particularly following numerous improvements to LAMP assay protocols. We hypothesise that recent advancements in enhanced LAMP protocols assay perhaps represent the best chance for a rapid and robust assay for field diagnosis of COVID-19, without the requirement of specialized equipment and highly trained professionals to interpret results. Herein, we present our arguments with a view to disseminate such findings, to assist the combat of this virus that is proving so devastating. We hope that this strategy could be applied rapidly, and confirmed for viability with clinical samples, before being rolled out for mass-diagnostic testing in these current times.","output":"Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays as a rapid diagnostic for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No one without the right clearance knows exactly what the US Air Force's X-37B spaceplanes do in orbit, but it must be a lot given the cumulative years they've spent up there The vehicles are sparking a resurgence of interest in spaceplanes as a necessary ingredient for expanding society to space Less than five minutes after liftoff, the United Launch Alliance webcast cut away from the Atlas V rocket before its payload shroud opened to expose its cargo: a US Air Force X-37B space-plane carrying orbital experiments housed inside its payload bay The online audience was treated to Boeing, ULA, Air Force and US Space Force leaders thanking first responders for their work during the COVID-19 pandemic The Air Force, which owns two X-37Bs, and the Space Force, which flies them, like to offer tantalizing glimpses but few details of the autonomous spaceplanes that have spent about eight years in orbit over six missions","output":"Spaceplane Cataylyst"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"-The positive developments on Covid-19 vaccines are broadly in line with our baseline forecast for emerging markets C we expect a noticeable impact from mass vaccination programs from around mid-2021 Our in-house survey reveals the news has reduced downside risks for 2021 for the great majority of EMs - But vaccines programs will diverge significantly across EMs Apart from China and Russia, which are developing their own vaccines, Chile tops the EM league for pre-ordered doses, at more than twice the population (Figure 1) Other EMs have also secured access to large quantities But many will fall short of inoculating even 30% of their populations, which may force governments to maintain contact and mobility restrictions to contain the pandemic - Over time, the global COVAX facility should ensure access to vaccines for countries missing in the initial ordering race, though its starting supply is scarce and re-deployment of excess doses will be protracted Domestic distribution will also be drawn-out in many geographies, stymied by poor infrastructure, including intermittent access to power - Meanwhile, vaccine progress in advanced economies and buoyant global financial markets should support demand Consequently, prospects will be brighter for countries that saw large recessions last year and can implement vaccination programs swiftly C Eastern Europe and Mexico fall in this group C though the outlook for tourism will remain challenging ?

In vitro models are valuable but lack the physiological context of a whole organism.

Within this topic, the aim of the paper was to quantify the effect of mobility habits in the spread of the Coronavirus in Italy through a multiple linear regression model. Estimation results showed that mobility habits represent one of the variables that explains the number of COVID-19 infections jointly with the number of tests/day and some environmental variables (i.e. PM pollution and temperature). Nevertheless, a proximity variable to the first outbreak was also significant, meaning that the areas close to the outbreak had a higher risk of contagion, especially in the initial stage of infection (time-decay phenomena). Furthermore, the number of daily new cases was related to the trips performed three weeks before. This threshold of 21 days could be considered as a sort of positivity detection time, meaning that the mobility restrictions quarantine commonly set at 14 days, defined only according to incubation-based epidemiological considerations, is underestimated (possible delays between contagion and detection) as a containment policy and may not always contribute to effectively slowing down the spread of virus worldwide. This result is original and, if confirmed in other studies, will lay the groundwork for more effective containment of COVID-19 in countries that are still in the health emergency, as well as for possible future returns of the virus.","output":"How mobility habits influenced the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from the Italian case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Reduced mortality at 28 days in patients treated with corticosteroids was demonstrated, but this result was not confirmed by certain large epidemiological studies. Our aim was to determine whether corticosteroids improve the outcomes of our patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Our retrospective, single centre cohort study included consecutive patients hospitalized for moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia between March 15 and April 15 2020. An early short course of corticosteroids was given during the second phase of the study. The primary composite endpoint was the need for mechanical ventilation or mortality within 28 days of admission. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the propensity score, i.e. the probability of each patient receiving corticosteroid therapy based on the initial variables. RESULTS: About 120 consecutive patients were included, 39 in the corticosteroids group, 81 in the no corticosteroids group; their mean ages (SD) were 66.4  14.1 and 66.1  15.2 years, respectively.

Primary course learning objectives were for students to locate credible COVID\\\\19 information sources and describe what is known about the general health impacts of the disease. Twelve public town halls, that included more than 35 different presenters, were delivered. Number of attendees on the Zoom webinars ranged between 20\\\\75 individuals with many others interacting with content through social media, radio, and the recorded content. Town hall themes included the role of public health to protect community health, impact of disease on physical and mental health, health disparities, mechanisms to interrupt and halt transmission, and strategies for adapting to lifestyle changes. Undergraduate and graduate students (n=37) from a variety of majors (biology, exercise science, chemistry, engineering, business, forestry) enrolled in the course. Nearly all students (96%) reported that the course increased their awareness about COVID\\\\19 and the majority (61%) indicated that the course was the most effective way to obtain COVID\\\\19 related information. All students recommended that other students take this course in the future. The public town hall series provided a robust platform to deliver critical, real\\\\time health information to our campus and broader community during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Additionally, students perceived that the academic course increased their awareness of COVID\\\\19. Increased public health messaging is a critical step to keeping Michigan's rural Upper Peninsula informed, safe, and healthy during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and may serve as a model for other rural university\\\\community partnerships.","output":"Rural Community Health: Keeping Michigan's Upper Peninsula Informed During the COVID\\\\19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel COVID-19 therapeutics are urgently needed. We generated a phage-displayed human antibody VH domain library from which we identified a high-affinity VH binder ab8. Bivalent VH, VH-Fc ab8 bound with high avidity to membrane-associated S glycoprotein and to mutants found in patients. It potently neutralized mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 in wild type mice at a dose as low as 2 mg/kg and exhibited high prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, possibly enhanced by its relatively small size. Electron microscopy combined with scanning mutagenesis identified ab8 interactions with all three S protomers and showed how ab8 neutralized the virus by directly interfering with ACE2 binding. VH-Fc ab8 did not aggregate and did not bind to 5300 human membrane-associated proteins. The potent neutralization activity of VH-Fc ab8 combined with good developability properties and cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 mutants provide a strong rationale for its evaluation as a COVID-19 therapeutic.","output":"High potency of a bivalent human VH domain in SARS-CoV-2 animal models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate prediction of the stock price is necessary for efficient financial decision making and reconstruction planning, especially during the COVID-19 crisis. Meanwhile, the ARIMA model with neural network approach is a hybrid statistical model that has been used widely in finance and statistics. It could solve the non-linearity problem in ARIMA. However, based on the unreliable sampling variation, the unbalance between the linearity and nonlinearity parts in the hybrid model could lead to inaccurate prediction. This matter motivates the purpose of this study, where the authors aim to balance the linearity and nonlinearity of the hybrid model towards predicting the Islamic investment during the Malaysia Movement Control Order (MCO). In this study, Islamic investment is analyzed using statistical based model of ARIMA. In order to balance linearity and nonlinearity parts of ARIMA which is outperforming the unreliable sampling variation, the aggregating bootstrap approach is used on ARIMA. The resampled linearity and nonlinearity parts will be declared as inputs of neural network system in order to predict the Islamic investment. Resampled nonlinearity part will be generated in this system and its sampling variation is examined. In addition, the performance of model procedure is estimated. It shows that the aggregating bootstrap gives smaller bias values and generates small weights in neural network system. In terms of prediction, applying the resampled procedure in neural network system eventually increases the precision of prediction estimation where it reduces the error estimation of MAE and MSE. Also, the prediction values continually align with actual values of investment at MCO phase. Balancing the linearity and nonlinearity part using the aggregating bootstrap in major procedure of prediction field contributes to high precise prediction of Islamic investment return estimation. The uncertainty of investment returns during MCO phase is a challenging phase and affects Malaysia financial trading. By considering using alternative procedure proposed in this study, i.e. helps in providing accuracy of investment prediction returns, a well-construct financial decisions and plans could be structured during MCO. However, this study limits to examine the effect of aggregating bootstrap. For further research, it is suggested to apply prediction on 10 years returns of Islamic investment using the proposed method. ? 2021 Horizon Research Publishing.

While securing PPE is a complex logistical challenge facing many countries, it is vital to recognise the social and health systems issues that structure the differential degrees of risk faced by various subgroups of healthcare workers. As an illustrative case study, the author identifies two key social factors that are likely to face the degrees of risk faced by midwives in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia, if and when COVID-19 takes hold in Indonesia. Healthcare workers in both high and low resource-settings globally are likely to face particular risks and vulnerabilities that are shaped by localized social and health systems factors.

The purpose of this study was to determine if porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection increases genetic variability of PRRSV during serial passages in pigs and to determine if there is a difference in the PRRSV mutation rate between pigs concurrently infected with PCV2a or PCV2b. After 8 consecutive passages of PRRSV alone (group 1), PRRSV with PCV2a (group 2), or PCV2b (group 3) in pigs, the sequences of PRRSV structural genes for open reading frame (ORF) 5, ORF6, ORF7 and the partial non-structural protein gene (Nsp) 2 were determined. The total number of identified amino acid mutations in ORF5, ORF6, ORF7 and Nsp2 sequences was 30 for PRRSV infection only, 63 for PRRSV/PCV2a concurrent infection, and 77 for PRRSV/PCV2b concurrent infection when compared with the original VR2385 virus used to infect the passage 1 pigs. Compared to what occurred in pigs infected with PRRSV only, the mutation rates in ORF5 and ORF6 were significantly higher for concurrent PRRSV/PCV2b infected pigs. The PRRSV/PCV2a pigs had a significantly higher mutation rate in ORF7. The results from this study indicated that, besides ORF5 and Nsp2, the PRRSV structural genes ORF6 and ORF7 were shown to mutate at various degrees when the PRRSV was passaged over time in vivo. Furthermore, a significantly higher mutation rate of PRRSV was observed when pigs were co-infected with PCV2 highlighting the importance of concurrent infections on PRRSV evolution and control.","output":"Concurrent porcine circovirus type 2a (PCV2a) or PCV2b infection increases the rate of amino acid mutations of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) during serial passages in pigs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia caused by COVID-19 shares overlapping imaging manifestations with other types of pneumonia. How to objectively and quantitatively differentiate pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 virus remains clinical challenge. OBJECTIVE: To formulate standardized scoring criteria and an objective quantization standard to guide decision making in detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 virus induced pneumonia in clinical practice. METHODS: A retrospective dataset includes computed tomography (CT) images acquired from 43 pneumonia patients with COVID-19 virus detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and 49 pneumonia patients without COVID-19 virus. All patients were treated during the same time period in two hospitals. Key indicators of differential diagnosis were identified in relevant literature and the scores were quantified namely, patients with more than 8 points were identified as high risk, those with 6-8 points as moderate risk, and those with fewer than 6 points as low risk for COVID-19 virus. In the study, 3 radiologists determined the scores for all patients. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were subsequently calculated. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were determined as high risk, among which 42 were COVID-19 positive by RT-PCR tests. Next, 9 were identified as moderate risk, one of whom was COVID-19 positive. Last, 22 were classified into the low-risk group, all of them are COVID-19 negative. Based on these results, the sensitivity of detection COVID-19 positive cases between the high-risk group and the non-high-risk group was 0.98 with 95% confidence interval [0.88, 1.00], and the specificity was 0.61 [0.46, 0.75]. The detection sensitivity between the moderate-/high-risk group and the low-risk group was 1.00 [0.92, 1.00], and the specificity was 0.45 [0.31, 0.60].

The importance of culture in rural-urban revitalisation has been underestimated in South Africa and the African continent at large. Despite some cultural initiatives that are still at developmental stages in big cities, such as Johannesburg, eThekwini and Cape Town, there is concern about the absence of sustainable policies and plans to support culture, creativity, and indigenous knowledge at national and municipal levels. Showcasing alternative strategies for making culture central to development, this book discusses opportunities to shift culture and indigenous knowledge from the peripheries and place them at the epicentre of sustainable development and the mainstream of cultural planning, which can then be applied in the contexts of Africa and the Global South. Governmental institutions, research councils, civil society organisations, private sector, and higher education institutions come together in a joint effort to explain the nexus between culture, economic development, rural-urban linkages, grassroots and technological innovations.

Globally, more than 3,517,345 cases have been confirmed with 243,401 deaths due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19. The antiviral drug discovery activity is required to control the persistence of COVID-19 circulation and the potential of the future emergence of coronavirus. However, the present review aims to highlight the important antiviral approaches, including interferons, ribavirin, mycophenolic acids, ritonavir, lopinavir, inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to provoke the nonstructural proteins and deactivate the structural and essential host elements of the virus to control and treat the infection of COVID-19 by inhibiting the viral entry, viral RNA replication and suppressing the viral protein expression. Moreover, the present review investigates the epidemiology, diagnosis, structure, and replication of COVID-19 for better understanding. It is recommended that these proteases, inhibitors, and antibodies could be a good therapeutic option in drug discovery to control the newly emerged coronavirus.

The level of ozone gas concentration in the air, confined within an indoor space during an ozone-based disinfection process, is analysed. The purpose of this work is to investigate how ozone is distributed in time within an enclosed space. Design/methodology/approach: A computational methodology for predicting the space- and time-dependent ozone concentration within the room across the consecutive steps of the disinfection process (generation, dwelling and destruction modes) is proposed. The emission and removal of ozone from the air volume are possible by means of a generator located in the middle of the room. This model also accounts for ozone reactions and decay kinetics, and gravity effect on the air. Finding: This work is validated against experimental measurements at different locations in the room during the disinfection cycle. The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data. This comparison proves that the presented methodology is able to provide accurate predictions of the time evolution of ozone concentration at different locations of the enclosed space.

METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-centre cohort study of confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to a Singapore tertiary hospital. Primary outcome was diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission and/or death. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyse the predictive performance of ED-specific variables. Accuracy of continuous variables was measured by area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: 294 patients were included. Patients with pneumonia were older (52.0 years, p < 0.001) and had higher C-reactive protein (CRP; 33.8 mg/L, p < 0.001). Patients with indeterminate chest radiograph (CRX) findings were at risk of pneumonia vs. patients with normal CRX (37.5% vs. 4.3%, p < 0.001). Patients admitted to ICU were older (60.0 years, p < 0.001) and had higher CRP (40.0 mg/L, p < 0.001). Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with ICU admission and death (30.0% vs 0.39%, p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age (aOR 1.07, p = 0.049), CRP (aOR 1.05, p = 0.006) and CRX findings (aOR 50.00, p < 0.001) had increased odds of pneumonia.

This global enhancement of evoked responses required coactivation of a sufficiently large population of neurons either within one cortical area or distributed in several areas. Enhancement of neuronal firing was saturable after repeated episodes of coactivation, diminished by inhibition of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors, and accompanied by elevated excitatory postsynaptic potentials, all consistent with activity-induced synaptic potentiation.

Smartphone applications produced a significant increase of 40.35 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity per week (7 studies; p = 0.04; 95% CI 1.03 to 79.67) and 2,390 steps per day (3 studies; p = 0.0007; 95% CI 1,006.9 to 3,791.2). Subgroup analyses found no difference when comparing diagnoses, sample size, activity tracker use, target behaviour and self-report versus device-measured outcome. Larger improvements in physical activity were noted in intervention durations of 3-months and participants 60yrs (95.35 mins.week(-1); p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone applications were effective in increasing physical activity in people with cardiovascular disease. Caution is warranted for the low-quality evidence, small sample and larger coronary heart disease representation. More rigorous research is needed to investigate the effect of smartphone applications across diagnoses and in sedentary behaviour.","output":"Smartphone applications for physical activity and sedentary behaviour change in people with cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background There is considerable debate about the rate of antibody waning after SARS-CoV-2 infection, raising questions around long-term immunity following both natural infection and vaccination. We undertook prospective serosurveillance in a large cohort of healthy adults from the start of the epidemic in England. Methods The serosurveillance cohort included office and laboratory-based staff and healthcare workers in 4 sites in England, who were tested monthly for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein IgG between 23rd March and 20th August 2020. Antibody levels from 21 days after a positive test were modelled using mixed effects regression models. Findings In total, 2247 individuals were recruited and 2014 (90%) had 3-5 monthly antibody tests. Overall, 272 (12.1%) of individuals had at least one positive/equivocal spike protein IgG result, with the highest proportion in a hospital site (22%), 14% in London and 2.1% in a rural area. Results were similar for nucleoprotein IgG. Following a positive result, 39/587 (6.6%) tested negative for nucleoprotein IgG and 52/515 (10.1%) for spike protein IgG. Nucleoprotein IgG declined by 6.4% per week (95% CI, 5.5-7.4%; half-life, 75 [95% CI, 66-89] days) and spike protein IgG by 5.8% (95% CI, 5.1-6.6%; half-life, 83 [95% CI, 73-96] days). Conclusions Over the study period SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was 8-10% overall and up to 21% in clinical healthcare workers. In seropositive individuals, nucleoprotein and spike protein IgG antibodies declined with time after infection and 50% are predicted to fall below the positive test threshold after 6 months.","output":"Serological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2: trends and humoral response in a cohort of public health workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a challenge to management of lymphedema. The aim of this study was to assess general health conditions and evaluate the problems and concerns of lymphedema patients with regard to access to care and provision of management and control follow-ups during the lockdown period between March and June 2020. Methods: A web-based online survey, which included questions about demographic and clinical properties, compliance with restrictions and self-management, complications, needs, and difficulties in accessing health care, as well as the presence of psychological symptoms, was applied. Results: Two hundred three patients (190 female and 13 male) replied. Majority of them (73.4%) were between 30 and 60 years old and had high school/university education (67%). The duration of lymphedema was more than 3 years and sites were commonly extremities with mild to moderate intensity in 70.5% patients. Majority of them adhered to stay home warnings (88.7%). Weight gain was a common problem and self-care methods were generally skipped (81.8%). Seventeen percent of them had wounds and/or cellulitis. Forty percent of patients needed to apply to health centers to renew the pressure garment, but could not reach it. More than 70% of patients had sleep disorders and anxiety/stress. Majority of patients used television and social media to get information related to COVID-19 and the exposure time was commonly 2 to 6 hours. Conclusions: The COVID-19 lockdown had a great impact on lymphedema patients' health care not only from medical but also from psychosocial aspects. All these implications have to be identified and dealt with properly to avoid concerns and consequences of future pandemic lockdowns.

In the UK, the initial peak was in April 2020; in the county of Norfolk (UK) and surrounding areas, which has a stable, low-density population, over 3,200 cases were reported between March and August 2020. As part of the activities of the national COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK) we undertook whole genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in positive clinical samples from the Norfolk region. These samples were collected by four major hospitals, multiple minor hospitals, care facilities and community organisations within Norfolk and surrounding areas. We combined clinical metadata with the sequencing data from regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes to understand the origins, genetic variation, transmission and expansion (spread) of the virus within the region and provide context nationally. Data were fed back into the national effort for pandemic management, whilst simultaneously being used to assist local outbreak analyses. Overall, 1,565 positive samples (172 per 100,000 population) from 1,376 cases were evaluated; for 140 cases between two and six samples were available providing longitudinal data. This represented 42.6% of all positive samples identified by hospital testing in the region and encompassed those with clinical need, and health and care workers and their families. 1,035 cases had genome sequences of sufficient quality to provide phylogenetic lineages. These genomes belonged to 26 distinct global lineages, indicating that there were multiple separate introductions into the region. Furthermore, 100 genetically-distinct UK lineages were detected demonstrating local evolution, at a rate of ~2 SNPs per month, and multiple co-occurring lineages as the pandemic progressed. Our analysis: identified a sublineage associated with 6 care facilities; found no evidence of reinfection in longitudinal samples; ruled out a nosocomial outbreak; identified 16 lineages in key workers which were not in patients indicating infection control measures were effective; found the D614G spike protein mutation which is linked to increased transmissibility dominates the samples and rapidly confirmed relatedness of cases in an outbreak at a food processing facility. The large-scale genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples has provided valuable additional data for public health epidemiology in the Norfolk region, and will continue to help identify and untangle hidden transmission chains as the pandemic evolves.","output":"Large scale sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from one region allows detailed epidemiology and enables local outbreak management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The p53/p21 pathway is activated in response to cell stress. However, its role in acute lung injury has not been elucidated. Acute lung injury is associated with disruption of the alveolo-capillary barrier leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support gas exchange in patients with ARDS, however, high positive airway pressures can cause regional overdistension of alveolar units and aggravate lung injury. Here, we report that acute lung injury and alveolar overstretching activate the p53/p21 pathway to maintain homeostasis and avoid massive cell apoptosis. A systematic pooling of transcriptomic data from animal models of lung injury demonstrates the enrichment of specific p53- and p21-dependent gene signatures and a validated senescence profile. In a clinically relevant, murine model of acid aspiration and mechanical ventilation, we observed changes in the nuclear envelope and the underlying chromatin, DNA damage and activation of the Tp53/p21 pathway. Absence of Cdkn1a decreased the senescent response, but worsened lung injury due to increased cell apoptosis. Conversely, treatment with lopinavir and/or ritonavir led to Cdkn1a overexpression and ameliorated cell apoptosis and lung injury. The activation of these mechanisms was associated with early markers of senescence, including expression of senescence-related genes and increases in senescence-associated heterochromatin foci in alveolar cells. Autopsy samples from lungs of patients with ARDS revealed increased senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. Collectively, these results suggest that acute lung injury activates p53/p21 as an antiapoptotic mechanism to ameliorate damage, but with the side effect of induction of senescence.","output":"Activation of p21 limits acute lung injury and induces early senescence after acid aspiration and mechanical ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic has presented a new set of challenges for the frontline National Health Service staff.

We investigate if CCP transfusion in patients with severe respiratory failure increases plasma titres of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and improves clinical outcomes. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 (n=34) were consented for CCP transfusion and serial blood draws pretransfusion and post-transfusion. Plasma SARS-CoV-2 antireceptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and IgM titres were measured by ELISA serially, and compared with serial plasma titre levels from control patients (n=68). The primary outcome was survival at 30 days, and secondary outcomes were length of ventilator and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, length of stay (LOS) in the hospital and in the intensive care unit (ICU). Outcomes were compared with matched control patients (n=34). Kinetics of antibodies and clinical outcomes were compared using LOess regression and ORs, respectively. RESULTS: Prior to CCP transfusion, 74% of patients were anti-RBD seropositive for IgG (median 1:3200), and 81% were anti-RBD IgM seropositive (median 1:320), while 16% were seronegative. The kinetics of antibody titres in CCP recipients were similar to controls. CCP recipients presented with similar survival, duration on ventilatory and/or ECMO support, as well as ICU and hospital LOS compared with controls.

Delirium is linked to increased lengths of stay, in-hospital falls, cognitive decline, and mortality, yet in a recent national survey of ACEP members, only 14% reported having a protocol addressing delirium in the ED. We conducted a feasibility pilot of a delirium toolkit developed to improve screening and management of delirium in the ED. Methods: Supported by a monthly workgroup, four EDs used the toolkit to develop and implement distinct quality improvement (QI) initiatives contextually appropriate to their ED (sites represented a range of ED environments). QI initiatives included delirium screening (using the CAM, bCAM, and/or DTS instruments) as well as delirium management strategies. Toolkit feasibility testing included assessment of implementation speed, protocol adherence, and qualitative feedback. Sites implemented and reported on process metrics for their QI initiatives from July C November 2020. Results: Findings reflect data from three sites (the fourth site did not contribute quantitative data). Over 73% of ED staff received delirium protocol training across sites in the first month of implementation, and staff participation in additional monthly trainings continued at a lower intensity over time. A total of 7,107 delirium screenings were conducted (representing 43% of older adults visiting the three EDs during the study period) and 4.5% of delirium screenings were positive. Over time, the monthly number and proportion of older adults screened for delirium trended slightly downwards, while the proportion of positive delirium screenings trended upwards. The sites provided 1,460 instances of delirium management activities (some patients received more than one). These activities were grouped into over a dozen different categories, with documenting an updated diagnosis or disposition being most common (300 instances), followed by orientation (239 instances) and hydration/nutrition interventions (196 instances). Conclusion: All pilot sites leveraged the ED-Delirium Toolkit to develop QI initiatives, with three of the four sites contributing data demonstrating successful implementation. These delirium QI initiatives were seen as complementary activities to the concurrent pandemic priorities given the recognition of delirium as both a presenting symptom as well as a common complication of COVID-19. ED nurses may have been able to improve targeted screening of patients over time based on the increasing positivity rate and declining proportion and number of screenings conducted.

This study explored various factors influencing the COVID-19 vaccination intention and the applicability of the health belief model (HBM) to explore vaccination intention among the population of Saudi Arabia. Methods: This is an online survey conducted between January 6, 2021, and January 19, 2021, using a GoogleTM form questionnaire among Saudi population. The questionnaire aimed to assess the factors that influence the intent to receive the vaccine, by evaluating demographic details, COVID-19 experience and health self-assessment, acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination and preferences and health belief regarding COVID-19 illness and vaccination. Results: The survey generated a total of 1333 responses from all over the 13 provinces of the Kingdom. The participants had mixed perceptions regarding the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. A total of 959 (71.9%) subjects responded positively to COVID-19 vaccine intent. Those with &gt;15,000 SR per month income, no past exposure to COVID-19, and comorbidities reported significantly higher intention to take vaccination (p&lt;0.05). Among the HBM variables, the perceived susceptibility construct (OR=3.82, 95% CI 1.64-8.94) and perceived benefit construct (OR=7.59, CI 1.65-34.86) were important facilitators for a definite intention to vaccinate. The perceived barriers construct (safety [OR= 0.062, CI 0.03-0.15];side effects of the vaccine [OR=0.31, CI 0.13-0.75]) and cues to action construct (OR=0.32, CI 0.13-0.77) were the significant factors hindering the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine. However, the perceived severity construct did not play an important role in predicting definite intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in the Saudi population.

We aim to report the prevalence, baseline characteristics, in-hospital management, and outcomes for patients with COVID-19Cassociated AM on the basis of a retrospective cohort from 23 hospitals in the United States and Europe. Methods: A total of 112 patients with suspected AM from 56 963 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were evaluated between February 1, 2020, and April 30, 2021. Inclusion criteria were hospitalization for COVID-19 and a diagnosis of AM on the basis of endomyocardial biopsy or increased troponin level plus typical signs of AM on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. We identified 97 patients with possible AM, and among them, 54 patients with definite/probable AM supported by endomyocardial biopsy in 17 (31.5%) patients or magnetic resonance imaging in 50 (92.6%). We analyzed patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes among all COVID-19Cassociated AM. Results: AM prevalence among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was 2.4 per 1000 hospitalizations considering definite/probable and 4.1 per 1000 considering also possible AM. The median age of definite/probable cases was 38 years, and 38.9% were female. On admission, chest pain and dyspnea were the most frequent symptoms (55.5% and 53.7%, respectively). Thirty-one cases (57.4%) occurred in the absence of COVID-19Cassociated pneumonia. Twenty-one (38.9%) had a fulminant presentation requiring inotropic support or temporary mechanical circulatory support. The composite of in-hospital mortality or temporary mechanical circulatory support occurred in 20.4%. At 120 days, estimated mortality was 6.6%, 15.1% in patients with associated pneumonia versus 0% in patients without pneumonia (P=0.044). During hospitalization, left ventricular ejection fraction, assessed by echocardiography, improved from a median of 40% on admission to 55% at discharge (n=47;P<0.0001) similarly in patients with or without pneumonia. Corticosteroids were frequently administered (55.5%). Conclusions: AM occurrence is estimated between 2.4 and 4.1 out of 1000 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The majority of AM occurs in the absence of pneumonia and is often complicated by hemodynamic instability. AM is a rare complication in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, with an outcome that differs on the basis of the presence of concomitant pneumonia.","output":"Prevalence, Characteristics, and Outcomes of COVID-19CAssociated Acute Myocarditis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The 2-O-methyltransferase is responsible for the capping of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA and consequently the evasion of the hosts immune system. This study aims at identifying prospective natural inhibitors of the active site of SARS-CoV-2 2O-methyltransferase (2-OMT) through an in silico approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The target was docked against a library of natural compounds obtained from edible African plants using PyRx - virtual screening software. The antiviral agent, Dolutegravir which has a binding affinity score of -8.5 kcal mol(?1) with the SARS-CoV-2 2-OMT was used as a standard. Compounds were screened for bioavailability through the SWISSADME web server using their molecular descriptors. Screenings for pharmacokinetic properties and bioactivity were performed with PKCSM and Molinspiration web servers respectively. The PLIP and Fpocket webservers were used for the binding site analyses. The Galaxy webserver was used for simulating the time-resolved motions of the apo and holo forms of the target while the MDWeb web server was used for the analyses of the trajectory data.

This research project aimed to explore the experiences of parents of adults with ID in relation to remote support provided by public support agencies. In a qualitative study, the authors used semistructured individual interviews with caregivers of people with ID. Data analysis distinguished the following categories: parents as therapists, organization difficulties, material problems, lack of social contacts, positive solutions, and difficult behavior. The results show the difficulties of parents in balancing professional, domestic, and supporting tasks.

The survey investigated the sleep patterns and disturbances (using a modified version of the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children) and screen exposure time before and during the lockdown. RESULTS: During the lockdown, 59.3% of children and 69.4% of adolescents with ADHD reported a change of bedtime with significant increase of ADHD patients that went to sleep at 11pm or later. Sleep duration, in contrast, resulted in two opposing processes with more children and adolescent sleeping either less than 6 hours/night or 10-11 hours/night. Among children and adolescents, respectively, 19.9% and 22% slept less than they did before lockdown, while 21.4% and 27.4% slept more hours.

Older people with dementia may face even greater barriers to appropriate care in acute care settings. Yet, studies about the care quality for older patients with dementia in acute care settings are still few. The objective of this study is to assess whether dementia status is associated with poorer treatment by examining the association of a patient's dementia status with the probability of receiving surgery and the waiting time until surgery for a hip fracture in acute care hospitals in Japan. METHODS: All patients with closed hip fracture were extracted from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) database between April 2014 and March 2018. After excluding complicated cases, we conducted regressions with multilevel models. We used two outcome measures: (i) whether the patient received a surgery or was treated by watchful waiting; and (ii) number of waiting days until surgery after admission. RESULTS: Two hundred fourteen thousand six hundred one patients discharged from 1328 hospitals were identified. Among them, 159,173 patients received surgery. Both 80-89 year-olds (OR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.84, 0.90) and those 90 years old and above (OR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.65, 0.70) had significantly lower odds ratios for receiving surgery compared to 65-79 year-olds. Those with severe dementia had a significantly greater likelihood of receiving surgery compared to those without dementia (OR 1.21; 95% CI, 1.16, 1.25). Patients aged 90 years old and above had shorter waiting time for surgery (Coef. -0.06; 95% CI, - 0.11, - 0.01). Mild dementia did not have a statistically significant impact on the number of waiting days until surgery (P = 0.34), whereas severe dementia was associated with shorter waiting days (Coef. -0.08; 95% CI, - 0.12, - 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest physicians may be taking proactive measures to preserve physical function for those with severe dementia and to avoid prolonged hospitalization although there are no formal guidelines on prioritization for the aged and dementia patients.","output":"An analysis of equity in treatment of hip fractures for older patients with dementia in acute care hospitals: observational study using nationwide hospital claims data in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No abstract provided.","output":"Human papillomavirus assay design is a crucial consideration for self-collection based cervical screening."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. During the spring of 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has caused significant resource strain in hospitals of Lombardy, Italy, with the demand for intensive care beds for COVID-19 patients exceeding the overall pre-crisis capacity. In this study, we evaluate the effect of healthcare strain on ICU admission and survival. Methods. We used data on 43,538 patients admitted to a hospital in the region between February 20 and July 12, 2020, of which 3,993 (9.2%) were admitted to an ICU. We applied logistic regression to model the probability of being admitted to an ICU and the probability of survival among ICU patients. Negative binomial regressions were used to model the time between hospital and ICU admission and the length of stay in ICU. Results. During the period of highest hospital strain (March 16 - April 22), individuals older than 70 years had a significantly lower probability of being admitted to an ICU and significantly longer times between hospital and ICU admission, indicating elective admission due to constrained resources. Healthcare strain did not have a clear effect on mortality, with the overall proportion of deaths declining from 52.1% (95%CI 49.8-54.5) for ICU patients admitted to the hospital before March 16, to 43.4% (95%CI 41.5-45.6) between March 16 and April 22, to 27.6% (95%CI 20.0-35.2) after April 22.

The pandemic has further widened the disparities in health care and exposed vulnerable populations. Health care services caring for such populations must not only continue to operate but create innovative methods of care delivery without compromising safety. We present our experience of incorporating telemedicine in our university hospitalCbased outpatient clinic in one of the worst-hit areas in the world. OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to assess the adoption of a telemedicine service in the first month of its implementation in outpatient practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also want to assess the need for transitioning to telemedicine, the benefits and challenges in doing so, and ongoing solutions during the initial phase of the implementation of telemedicine services for our patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective review of clinic operations data from the first month of a telemedicine rollout in the outpatient adult ambulatory clinic from April 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. A telemedicine visit was defined as synchronous audio-video communication between the provider and patient for clinical care longer than 5 minutes or if the video visit converted to a telephone visit after 5 minutes due to technical problems. We recorded the number of telemedicine visits scheduled, visits completed, and the time for each visit. We also noted the most frequent billing codes used based on the time spent in the patient care and the number of clinical tasks (eg, activity suggested through diagnosis or procedural code) that were addressed remotely by the physicians. RESULTS: During the study period, we had 110 telemedicine visits scheduled, of which 94 (85.4%) visits were completed. The average duration of the video visit was 35 minutes, with the most prolonged visit lasting 120 minutes. Of 94 patients, 24 (25.54%) patients were recently discharged from the hospital, and 70 (74.46%) patients were seen for urgent care needs. There was a 50% increase from the baseline in the number of clinical tasks that were addressed by the physicians during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high acceptance of telemedicine services by the patients, which was evident by a high show rate during the COVID-19 pandemic in Detroit.

OBJECTIVE: To define the respiratory tract microbiome in COVID-19 and relationship disease severity, systemic immunologic features, and outcomes. METHODS AND MEASUREMENTS: We examined 507 oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and endotracheal samples from 83 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, along with non-COVID patients and healthy controls. Bacterial communities were interrogated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, commensal DNA viruses Anelloviridae and Redondoviridae were quantified by qPCR, and immune features were characterized by lymphocyte/neutrophil (L/N) ratios and deep immune profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). MAIN RESULTS: COVID-19 patients had upper respiratory microbiome dysbiosis, and greater change over time than critically ill patients without COVID-19. Diversity at the first time point correlated inversely with disease severity during hospitalization, and microbiome composition was associated with L/N ratios and PBMC profiles in blood. Intubated patients showed patient-specific and dynamic lung microbiome communities, with prominence of Staphylococcus. Anelloviridae and Redondoviridae showed more frequent colonization and higher titers in severe disease. Machine learning analysis demonstrated that integrated features of the microbiome at early sampling points had high power to discriminate ultimate level of COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: The respiratory tract microbiome and commensal virome are disturbed in COVID-19, correlate with systemic immune parameters, and early microbiome features discriminate disease severity.

METHODS: We first evaluated our method using a residual solution of the H. pylori stool antigen test for adolescents. Then, we evaluated our method using culture testing for adults. RESULTS: Among 57 middle school students with H. pylori, the Nested PCR-QP test results of 53 (90.3%) were able to be analyzed. A total of 28 students had CAM resistance mutations. We found a genetic mutation in 28 students and no mutation in 23 students, and these results were consistent with those of PCR-direct sequencing. In the 23 adults who were diagnosed with H. pylori infection using the rapid urease test and culture testing, we were able to use Nested PCR-QP for analyzing 21 adults who tested positive in the stool H. pylori antigen test. The results obtained for all 21 adults were consistent with those obtained via the drug susceptibility test.

Social influences on subjective distress associated with COVID-19 remain understudied in the Chinese context. Wuhan with its surrounding areas in Hubei province was not only the locale where first COVID-19 cases were detected in the world but was also the hardest hit across China. Data from Hubei provide a unique opportunity to investigate COVID-19-related subjective distress and its social correlates. METHODS: We use original data (N=3,465) from the General Social Survey on COVID-19 in Hubei, China, conducted in August 2020. Regression analysis is employed to examine the impact of socioeconomic status, family structure, and social policies on COVID-19-related subjective distress measured by the Impact of Event-Scale-Revised (IES-R). RESULTS: First, individuals with higher socioeconomic status are not more immune to distress, and actually it is those better-educated ones who are more distressed. Second, family structure influences distress. Divorced and widowed individuals are more prone to distress than those who are married or single. Those living with COVID-19-infected family members or living with a larger family are particularly more distressed. Third, stricter lockdown measures promote real and perceived protection and also increase individuals' psychological distance from the disease, thereby reducing subjective distress. LIMITATIONS: The sample is not totally random so we should use caution when generalizing the findings to the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The findings contribute to our understanding of mental health disparity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain social groups are at a higher risk of distress than others.","output":"Subjective Distress about COVID-19 and Its Social Correlates: Empirical Evidence from Hubei Province of China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Down syndrome (DS) is a disorder characterized by impairments in global cognitive abilities and adaptive function.

Self-injectors in Malawi and Uganda are currently instructed to store used units in containers and return them to health workers for disposal. However, this may not be feasible in low-resource settings, especially for younger or covert self-injectors. We describe adolescent (15-19 years) and adult (20-49 years) self-injectors' disposal experiences in Uganda and Malawi. When possible, we compare covert and overt users' experiences. METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional qualitative studies in 2019 with 50 self-injectors in Uganda and 60 in Malawi. We purposively selected approximately half adolescents and included those trained by clinic-based providers and community health workers. We conducted semi-structured interviews and thematic data analysis and compared the findings across settings. RESULTS: Just under half of both samples were adolescents, substantially more of whom were covert users in Uganda (68%) than Malawi (~ 10%). Most participants reported being told to store used units in a container and return them to health workers. About two-thirds of Uganda participants had disposed of at least one unit by the interview, most commonly returning them to health workers. Over one-third of Malawi participants had disposed of at least one unit by the interview, slightly more disposed into latrines compared to returning to health workers. Participants in both settings reported compliance with health workers' disposal instructions as a primary reason for their disposal method. One-fifth of Uganda participants, mostly adolescent covert users, and one-quarter in Malawi said they were told they could dispose into latrines, and often did so. The majority in both settings said they would prefer to dispose units in latrines because they worried about needlestick injuries to others and because it was convenient. Some Uganda adolescent covert users felt returning units to health workers was challenging due to privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS: While most self-injectors disposed of used units as instructed, findings from both studies suggest that returning units to health workers is not preferred and may not be feasible for some adolescent covert users. More convenient disposal solutions should be identified.","output":"Adolescent and covert family planning users' experiences self-injecting contraception in Uganda and Malawi: implications for waste disposal of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) hospitalization is robustly linked to cardiometabolic health.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has affected professional as well as personal lives of physicians. We conducted a survey among Indian physicians to understand this impact. METHODS: A 31-point anonymized survey to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant lockdown on physicians' domestic responsibilities was disseminated via e-mail and text messaging applications. Our aim was to evaluate whether the impact was gender-based and to look for differences in aspects of domestic work, childcare, and professional commitments. RESULTS: We obtained 1,041 responses, of which 643 identified themselves as men and 393 as women. An increase in the domestic responsibilities during the lockdown was confirmed by 90% of the women compared with 82% men. More women than men were solely responsible for domestic chores (38.7% v 23.7%), managed their children's education (74% v 31%), and felt an adverse impact of the pandemic on their professional work (60.8% v 42.6%). Fewer women's spouses (57/359) than men's (174/594, P = .00001) were forced to take leave or work reduced hours, and double the proportion of women (3.5% v 1.5%) had to quit their jobs to manage responsibilities at home. CONCLUSION: As the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures threw newer challenges, more women physicians than men (81% v 63%) shouldered the burden of increased domestic work and childcare. This survey highlights the need to re-examine the specific challenges faced by women physicians and identify means to support and empower them.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Gendered Impact on Indian Physicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns on public health and household safety.

The discipline of epidemiology lays great emphasis on causation, while ML research does not. Some epidemiologists have proposed imposing what amounts to a causal constraint on ML in epidemiology, requiring it either to engage in causal inference or restrict itself to mere projection. We whittle down the issues to the question of whether causal knowledge is necessary for underwriting predictions about the outcomes of public health interventions. While there is great plausibility to the idea that it is, conviction that something is impossible does not by itself motivate a constraint to forbid trying. We disambiguate the possible motivations for such a constraint into definitional, metaphysical, epistemological, and pragmatic considerations and argue that Proceed with caution (rather than Stop!) is the outcome of each. We then argue that there are positive reasons to proceed, albeit cautiously. Causal inference enforces existing classification schema prior to the testing of associational claims (causal or otherwise), but associations and classification schema are more plausibly discovered (rather than tested or justified) in a back-and-forth process of gaining reflective equilibrium. ML instantiates this kind of process, we argue, and thus offers the welcome prospect of uncovering meaningful new concepts in epidemiology and public healthprovided it is not causally constrained.","output":"Can Robots Do Epidemiology?

On 14 March 2020, a state of emergency was declared in Spain in a bid to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. The aim of our study is to analyse the impact on emergency medicine attendance after the national lockdown, as well as the clinical presentation and the management of patients with suspected COVID-19 in the Paediatric Emergency Department. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study included children and adolescents under the age of 18, attended in our Paediatric Emergency Department during the period March 14 to April 17, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,666 patients were attended during the study period, 65.4% less than in the same period of 2019. Just over half (51.2%) were males, and mean age was 5.4 years. In triage, 39.9% were high priority levels, 6.5% more than 2019. Most frequent reasons for consultation at the Paediatric Emergency Department were fever (26.5%), respiratory symptoms (16.1%), and trauma (15.2%). A total of 218 patients (13%) received a diagnosis of possible COVID-19, with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in 18.4%, and 23.8% (52/218) were hospitalised. At discharge, 44% (96/218) were diagnosed with lower, and 33.9% (74/218) with upper respiratory infection.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus initially spread into the United States from international ports of entry and into urban population centers, like New York City. Over the course of the pandemic, cases emerged in more rural areas, implicating issues of transportation and mobility. Additionally, many rural areas developed into national hotspots of prevalence and transmission. Our aim was to investigate the preliminary impacts of road travel on the spread of COVID-19. This investigation has implications for future public health mitigation efforts and travel restrictions in the United States. METHODS: County-level COVID-19 data were analyzed for spatiotemporal patterns in time-to-event distributions using animated choropleth maps. Data were obtained from The New York Times and the Bureau of the Census. The arrival event was estimated by examining the number of days between the first reported national case (January 21, 2020) and the date that each county attained a given prevalence rate. Of the 3108 coterminous US counties, 2887 were included in the analyses. Data reflect cases accumulated between January 21, 2020, and May 17, 2020. FINDINGS: Animations revealed that COVID-19 was transmitted along the path of interstates. Quantitative results indicated rural-urban differences in the estimated arrival time of COVID-19. Counties that are intersected by interstates had an earlier arrival than non-intersected counties. The arrival time difference was the greatest in the most rural counties and implicates road travel as a factor of transmission into rural communities. CONCLUSION: Human mobility via road travel introduced COVID-19 into more rural communities. Interstate travel restrictions and road travel restrictions would have supported stronger mitigation efforts during the earlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced transmission via network contact.","output":"Interstates of Infection: Preliminary Investigations of Human Mobility Patterns in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To assess the performance of the Xpert Bladder Cancer (BC) Monitor during the follow-up of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). METHODS: Patients with previously diagnosed NMIBC and followed up in clinical practice settings in two French urology departments between September 2017 and July 2019 were consecutively enrolled in this prospective observational study. Patients with a positive cystoscopy or computed tomography urogram underwent subsequent transurethral resection of the bladder, and/or biopsy, and the specimens were pathologically assessed. Cytology and Xpert BC Monitor tests were performed on urine samples. Xpert BC Monitor performance was assessed versus cystoscopy for disease-negative patients or versus histology for disease-positive patients, and was compared to that of cytology. RESULTS: Overall, 500 patients with a median age of 70.0 years were included. NMIBC recurrence was diagnosed in 44 cases (8.8%). Overall sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values (NPVs) were 72.7% (32/44), 73.7% (330/448) and 96.5% (330/342) for the Xpert BC Monitor, and 7.7% (2/26), 97.8% (310/317) and 92.8% (310/334) for cytology, respectively. The Xpert BC Monitor detected 92.3% (12/13) of the high-grade tumours and ruled out their presence in 99.7% (330/331) of cases. Analysis of the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated the superior performance of the Xpert BC Monitor over that of cytology. CONCLUSION: Xpert BC Monitor performance was superior to that of cytology in the follow-up of NMIBC.

No prognostic tool has yet gained any widespread use. We compared the predictive value of various models based on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) subitems, ranging from simple to more complex models, for predicting large artery occlusion (LAO) in anterior circulation stroke. Methods Patients registered in the SITS international Stroke Register with available NIHSS and radiological arterial occlusion data were analysed. We compared 2042 patients harbouring an LAO with 2881 patients having no/distal occlusions. Using binary logistic regression, we developed models ranging from simple 1 NIHSS-subitem to full NIHSS-subitems models. Sensitivities and specificities of the models for predicting LAO were examined. Results The model with highest predictive value included all NIHSS subitems for predicting LAO (area under the curve (AUC) 0.77), yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 69% and 76%, respectively. The second most predictive model (AUC 0.76) included 4-NIHSS-subitems (level of consciousness commands, gaze, facial and arm motor function) yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 67% and 75%, respectively. The simplest model included only deficits in arm motor-function (AUC 0.72) for predicting LAO, yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 67% and 72%, respectively. Conclusions Although increasingly more complex models yield a higher discriminative performance for predicting LAO, differences between models are not large.

To try and mitigate this disruption, the psychiatry undergraduate teaching faculty developed a knowledge based remote curriculum. However, it became clear that our students sorely missed clinical and consultation experience. Prior to the pandemic we had delivered a mock Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) to those undertaking their psychiatry block. In Somerset Academy, we wanted to deliver a distanced alternative: the remote mock OSCE (ReMO). We hoped to demonstrate this would be a feasible and valuable learning experience.MethodIn keeping with other OSCEs, ReMO had active stations (4) and a rest station. Four simultaneous Skype meetings were set up as clinical stations, each with an examiner and actor. To test the technology, students and facilitators were emailed links to each meeting in advance, and invited to sign in. Students were given individualised timings to rotate between stations. Stations involved history taking, risk assessment, and management discussions of common psychiatric presentations.The students then rotated again, receiving personalised feedback about their performance, enabling immediate reflection and consideration of areas for development. This was followed up with written feedback, using examiner completed mark schemes.ResultAfter ReMO we invited feedback from medical students and facilitators. 7 out of the 8 medical students that participated completed a post-ReMO survey. 100% of students found ReMO useful, with 71% (5/7) rating it an extremely valuable experience and 29% (2/7) rating it fairly valuable. Students felt it was well organised, realistic, and increased their confidence in remote consultations and OSCE practice. 6 out of 8 facilitators completed feedback on ReMO. 100% felt that ReMO was reproducible and 83% (5/6) rated it as fairly realistic when compared to the face-to-face standard.ConclusionFirstly, ReMO was feasible. However, it was logistically difficult, requiring extensive organisation to ensure this relatively small group were in the right place at the right time. In future, we would consider alternative platforms such as Zoom, or specific consultation software, such as Attend Anywhere, to reduce the logistics burden and utilise features such as breakout rooms. We would recommend an allocated co-ordinator to troubleshoot any problems in real time via a group messaging service.In conclusion, ReMO is achievable and a valuable student learning experience. Since the pilot it has become an integral part of our curriculum. We recommend that all undergraduate Psychiatry faculties consider adding it to their programme.","output":"Remote Mock OSCE (ReMO): The new normal?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Furin is a serine protease that takes part in the processing and activation of the host cell pre-proteins.

In addition to other well-established risk factors, the early activation of coagulation systems present in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage could potentially play a role in the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis. This study aims to identify possible predictors for deep-vein thrombosis related to subarachnoid hemorrhage. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on patients with a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage who presented to our institution between 1 January 2014 and 1 August 2018. We reviewed electronic medical records and analyzed several parameters such as Fisher scale, World Federation of Neurosurgical Surgeons scale, aneurysm site, surgical or endovascular treatment, decompressive craniectomy, vasospasm, infection (meningitis and pneumonia), presence of motor deficit, length of stay in the ICU, length of hospital stay, number of days under ventilator support, d-dimer at hospitalization, and the time to thromboprophylaxis (days). RESULTS: The univariate analysis showed that intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage, d-dimer at hospitalization, the time to thromboprophylaxis, motor deficit, and aneurysm located at the internal carotid artery were statistically significant factors. Intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage (OR 2,78 95%CI 1.07C7.12), motor deficit (OR 3.46; 95%CI 1.37C9.31), and d-dimer at hospitalization (OR 1.002 95% CI 1.001C1.003) were demonstrated as independent risk factors for deep-vein thrombosis. Length of hospital stay was also found to be significantly longer in patients who developed deep-vein thrombosis (p value 0.018). CONCLUSION: Elevated d-dimer level at the time of hospitalization, motor deficit, and the presence of an intraparenchymal hemorrhage are independent risk factors for deep-vein thrombosis. Patients with DVT also had a significantly longer hospital stay. Even though further studies are needed, patients with elevated d-dimer at hospitalization and intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage may benefit from a more aggressive screening strategy for deep-vein thrombosis.","output":"Predictors of deep-vein thrombosis in subarachnoid hemorrhage: a retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores COVID-19 pandemic biopolitics in Sri Lanka through tropes of islanding and segregation by discussing how notions of island isolation, insularity, and geo-spatial boundedness have been transformed from their colonial origins to our post-colonial present, and in the wake of wartime governance.

Therefore, we assessed clinical platelet parameters and circulating platelet activity in patients with severe and nonsevere COVID-19. An assessment of clinical blood parameters in patients with severe COVID-19 disease (requiring intensive care), patients with nonsevere disease (not requiring intensive care), general medical in-patients without COVID-19, and healthy donors was undertaken. Platelet function and activity were also assessed by secretion and specific marker analysis. We demonstrated that routine clinical blood parameters including increased mean platelet volume (MPV) and decreased platelet:neutrophil ratio are associated with disease severity in COVID-19 upon hospitalisation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Strikingly, agonist-induced ADP release was 30- to 90-fold higher in COVID-19 patients compared with hospitalised controls and circulating levels of platelet factor 4 (PF4), soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), and thrombopoietin (TPO) were also significantly elevated in COVID-19.

One focus has been to characterize variability in metabolic enzyme systems that could impact internal doses of pharmaceuticals or environmental pollutants. Methods are needed for using this metabolic information to estimate the resulting variability in tissue doses associated with chemical exposure. We demonstrate here the use of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling in combination with Monte Carlo analysis to incorporate information on polymorphisms into the analysis of toxicokinetic variability. Warfarin and parathion were used as case studies to demonstrate this approach. Our results suggest that polymorphisms in the PON1 gene, that give rise to allelic variants of paraoxonase, which is involved in the metabolism of paraoxon (a metabolite of parathion), make only a minor contribution to the overall variability in paraoxon tissue dose, while polymorphisms in the CYP2C9 gene, which gives rise to allelic variants of the major metabolic enzyme for warfarin, account for a significant portion of the overall variability in (S)-warfarin tissue dose. These analyses were used to estimate chemical-specific adjustment factors (CSAFs) for the human variability in toxicokinetics for both parathion and warfarin. Implications of alternatives in the calculation of CSAFs are explored.

The aim of this study was to construct the key elements of a global multidimensional male involvement framework, based on the latest evidence and input of experts in the field. METHODS: For this purpose, a Delphi study, including an international panel of 26 experts, was carried out. The study consisted of three rounds, with 92% of respondents completing all three surveys. Experts were asked to rate indicators within six categories in terms of validity, feasibility, sensitivity, specificity and context robustness. Furthermore, they were encouraged to clarify their rating with open text responses. Indicators were excluded or adapted according to experts feedback before inclusion. A 85% agreement was used as threshold for consensus. RESULTS: A general consensus was reached for a global framework for assessing male involvement in maternal health, consisting of five categories: involvement in communication, involvement in decision-making, practical involvement, physical involvement and emotional involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Using the male involvement framework as a tool to assess the concept of male involvement in maternal health at local, national, and international levels could allow improved assessment and comparison of study findings.

Accumulating observational evidence suggests that V(T) should be limited in all mechanically ventilated patients-even those who do not have ALI/ARDS.

Available evidence does not support the use of higher PEEP, compared to lower PEEP, in unselected patients with acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS. However, results of a meta-analysis using individual patients from 3 randomized controlled trials suggest that higher PEEP should be used for ARDS, whereas lower PEEP may be more appropriate in patients with ALI. PEEP should be set to maximize alveolar recruitment while avoiding over-distention.

After discontinuation of isolation measures, therapy duration increased significantly (99.370.2 minutes; p<0.05).The baseline Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score was higher in the COVID-19 group (91.93 25.64 vs. 82.98 22.73 points) and FIM improvements were lower in COVID-19 patients than in the 2019 comparison group (6.96 8.96 vs 20.3 15.98 points; p<0.001). COVID-19 infection itself had a strong negative impact on FIM change as identified by regression analysis. Linear regression analysis showed that COVID-19 reduced the FIM at discharge by 8.9 points (95% CI -14.725;-3.097; p=0.003) after correction for FIM at admission, age, sex and morbidity index at admission. CONCLUSION In conclusion, COVID-19 had a strong negative impact on rehabilitation benefits as assessed by FIM. NMSR could be continued but all patients received less therapy minutes during isolation.

Virologic factors may also be important in determining clinical outcome and transmission rates, but limited patient-level data is available. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study at seven public hospitals in Singapore. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and compared between individuals infected with different SARS-CoV-2 clades. Firth's logistic regression was used to examine the association between SARS-CoV-2 clade and development of hypoxia, and quasi-Poisson regression to compare transmission rates. Plasma samples were tested for immune mediator levels and the kinetics of viral replication in cell culture were compared. FINDINGS: 319 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection had clinical and virologic data available for analysis. 29 (9%) were infected with clade S, 90 (28%) with clade L/V, 96 (30%) with clade G (containing D614G variant), and 104 (33%) with other clades 'O' were assigned to lineage B.6. After adjusting for age and other covariates, infections with clade S (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0030 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 00002-029)) or clade O (B6) (aOR 026 (95% CI 0064-093)) were associated with lower odds of developing hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen compared with clade L/V. Patients infected with clade L/V had more pronounced systemic inflammation with higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. No significant difference in the severity of clade G infections was observed (aOR 095 (95% CI: 035-252). Though viral loads were significantly higher, there was no evidence of increased transmissibility of clade G, and replicative fitness in cell culture was similar for all clades. INTERPRETATION: Infection with clades L/V was associated with increased severity and more systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Infection with clade G was not associated with changes in severity, and despite higher viral loads there was no evidence of increased transmissibility.","output":"Association of SARS-CoV-2 clades with clinical, inflammatory and virologic outcomes: An observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), led to the ongoing global public health crisis.

The rapid increase in the numbers of patients requiring ICU care may imply a sudden and major challenge for affected health care systems. In this narrative review, we aim to summarize current knowledge of pathophysiology, clinical and morphological characteristics of COVID-19-associated ARDS and ARDS caused by other factors (classical ARDS) as defined by Berlin criteria, and therefore to elucidate the differences, which can affect clinical management of COVID-19-associated ARDS. Fully understanding the characteristics of COVID-19-associated ARDS will help identify its early progression and tailor the treatment, leading to improved prognosis in severe cases and reduced mortality. The notable mechanisms of COVID-19-associated ARDS include severe pulmonary infiltration/edema and inflammation, leading to impaired alveolar homeostasis, alteration of pulmonary physiology resulting in pulmonary fibrosis, endothelial inflammation and vascular thrombosis. Despite some distinct differences between COVID-19-associated ARDS and classical ARDS as defined by Berlin criteria, general treatment principles, such as lung-protective ventilation and rehabilitation concepts should be applied whenever possible.

The diagnostic criteria involve clinical, laboratory, and complementary tests. This review aims to draw pediatrician attention to this diagnosis, suggesting early treatment strategies, and proposing a pediatric emergency care flowchart. SOURCES: The PubMed/MEDLINE/WHO COVID-19 databases were reviewed for original and review articles, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, case series, and recommendations from medical societies and health organizations published through July 3, 2020. The reference lists of the selected articles were manually searched to identify any additional articles. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: COVID-19 infection is less severe in children than in adults, but can present as MIS-C, even in patients without comorbidities. There is evidence of an exacerbated inflammatory response with potential systemic injury, and it may present with aspects similar to those of Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome. MIS-C can develop weeks after COVID-19 infection, suggesting an immunomediated cause. The most frequent clinical manifestations include fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, mucous membrane changes, and cardiac dysfunction. Elevated inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, and coagulopathy are common laboratory findings. Supportive treatment and early immunomodulation can control the intense inflammatory response and reduce complications and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is serious, rare, and potentially fatal. The emergency department pediatrician must recognize and treat it early using immunomodulatory strategies to reduce systemic injury. Further studies are needed to identify the disease pathogenesis and establish the most appropriate treatment.","output":"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 from the pediatric emergency physician's point of view"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has spread around the world rapidly causing a pandemic.

In the past, we demonstrated that trypanosome infections impair B cell homeostasis and abolish vaccine-induced protection against unrelated antigens. Hence, here we hypothesized that trypanosome infection can affect the onset of CIA by specifically dampening specific B-cell responses and type II collagen antibody titers in DBA/1 prone mice. We observed a substantial delay in the onset of collagen-induced arthritis in T. brucei-infected DBA/1 mice that correlates with a drastic decrease of type II collagen titers of the different IgG isotypes in the serum. Treatment of infected mice with Berenil, a trypanocidal drug, restored the development of CIA-associated clinical symptoms. Interestingly, these data were confirmed by the challenge of immunized DBA/1 prone mice with T. brucei-infected tsetse flies. Together, these results demonstrate that T. brucei infection is impairing the maintenance of the antigen specific plasma B cell pool driving the development of CIA in DBA/1 prone mice.","output":"Experimental African Trypanosome Infection by Needle Passage or Natural Tsetse Fly Challenge Thwarts the Development of Collagen-Induced Arthritis in DBA/1 Prone Mice via an Impairment of Antigen Specific B Cell Autoantibody Titers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The concerns related to particulate matters health effects alongside the increasing demands from citizens for more participatory, timely, and diffused air quality monitoring actions have resulted in increasing scientific and industrial interest in low-cost particulate matter sensors (LCPMS).

Institutional social distancing requirements have resulted in many neurosurgical programs utilizing video conferencing for educational activities. However, it is unclear how or if these practices should continue after the pandemic. The objective of this study was to characterize virtual education in neurosurgery and understand how it should be utilized after COVID-19. METHODS A 24-question, 3-part online survey was administered anonymously to all 117 US neurosurgical residency programs from May 15, 2020, to June 15, 2020. Questions pertained to the current use of virtual conferencing, preferences over traditional conferences, and future inclinations. The Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 3 = neutral, 5 = strongly agree) was used. Comparisons were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. RESULTS One-hundred eight responses were recorded. Overall, 38 respondents (35.2%) were attendings and 70 (64.8%) were trainees. Forty-one respondents (38.0%) indicated attending 5-6 conferences per week and 70 (64.8%) attend national virtual conferences. When considering different conference types, there was no overall preference (scores < 3) for virtual conferences over traditional conferences. In regard to future use, respondents strongly agreed that they would continue the practice at some capacity after the pandemic (median score 5). Overall, respondents agreed that virtual conferences would partially replace traditional conferences (median score 4), whereas they strongly disagreed with the complete replacement of traditional conferences (median score 1). The most common choices for the partial replacement of tradition conferences were case conferences (59/108, 55%) and board preparation (64/108, 59%). Lastly, there was a significant difference in scores for continued use of virtual conferencing in those who attend nationally sponsored conferences (median score 5, n = 70) and those who do not (median score 4, n = 38; U = 1762.50, z = 2.97, r = 0.29, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS Virtual conferences will likely remain an integral part of neurosurgical education after the COVID-19 pandemic has abated. Across the country, residents and faculty report a preference for continued use of virtual conferencing, especially virtual case conferences and board preparation. Some traditional conferences may even be replaced with virtual conferences, in particular those that are more didactic.

This study investigated the influence of middle turbinate resection on the deposition of inhaled pollutants that cover spherical and non-spherical particles (e.g. pollen). A computational model of the nasal cavity from CT scans, and its corresponding post-operative model with virtual surgery performed was created. Two constant flow rates of 5a?L/min, and 15a?L/min were simulated under a laminar flow field. Inhaled particles including pollen (non-spherical), and a spherical particle with reference density of 1000a?kg/m3 were introduced in the surrounding atmosphere. The effect of surgery was most prominent in the less patent cavity side, since the change in anatomy was proportionally greater relative to the original airway space.

We investigate how the consequences of the pandemic, in terms of healthcare, state intervention and impositions, and daily life and habits, have affected trust in public institutions in Italy, at the time when the contagion was rapidly spreading in the country (early March 2020). In this survey, addressed to 4260 Italian citizens, we analyzed and measured such impact, focusing on various aspects of trust. This attention to multiple dimensions of trust constitutes the key conceptual advantage of this research, since trust is a complex and layered construct, with its own internal dynamics. In particular, the analysis focuses on how citizens attribute trust to Public Authorities, in relation to the management of the health crisis: with regard to the measures and guidelines adopted, the purposes pursued, the motivations that determine them, their capacity for involvement, and their effectiveness for the containment of the virus itself. A pandemic creates a bilateral need for trust, both in Public Authorities (they have to rely on citizens compliance and must try to promote and maintain their trust in order to be effective) and in citizens, since they need to feel that somebody can do something, can (has the power to) protect them, to act at the needed collective level. We are interested to explore how this need for trust affects the attributional process, regarding both attitudes and the corresponding decisions and actions. The most striking result of this survey is the very high level of institutional trust expressed by respondents: 75% of them trust Italian public authorities to be able to deal with the COVID-19 emergency. This is in sharp contrast with the relatively low levels of institutional trust characteristic of Italy, both historically and in recent surveys. Moreover, the survey allowed the discrimination of several potential predictors for trust, thus emphasizing factors that, during this crisis, are exhibiting an anomalous impact on trust.","output":"All We Need Is Trust: How the COVID-19 Outbreak Reconfigured Trust in Italian Public Institutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-coV-2 variants, along with vaccination, mark the second year of the pandemic. The spike region is a focal point in COVID-19 pathogenesis, with different amino acid changes potentially modulating vaccine response and some being part of variant signatures. NGS is the standard tool to sequence the virus but limitations of different sources hinders expansion of genomic surveillance in many places. To improve surveillance capability we developed a Sanger based sequencing protocol to obtain coverage of most (>95%) spike gene. Eleven nasopharyngeal swabs collections had RNA extracted for real time PCR diagnosis and leftover RNA had up to 3785 bp sequenced at an ABI3500 using dye termination chemistry of nested PCR products of two reactions of one Step RT-PCR. P1 amino acid mutations signatures were present in 18% (2/11), with 82% (9/11) with three or more additional amino acid changes (GISAID CoVsurver list). Most sequences (86%, 7/8) from 2021 have the E484K, whereas the mutation was not present in samples collected in 2020 (0/4, p=0.015).

Initially, it was postulated that autophagosomes might play a structural role in replication complex formation. However, cryo-EM tomography of DENV replication complexes showed that DENV replicates on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cisternae invaginations and not on classical autophagosomes. Recently, it was reported that autophagy plays an indirect role in DENV replication by modulating cellular lipid metabolism. DENV-induced autophagosomes deplete cellular triglycerides that are stored in lipid droplets, leading to increased -oxidation and energy production. This is the first example of a virus triggering autophagy to modulate cellular physiology. In this review, we summarize these data and discuss new questions and implications for autophagy during DENV replication.","output":"Dengue Virus and Autophagy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to investigate the time of onset and duration of symptoms of loss of smell and taste in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: Two independent authors performed a systematic review of the Medline/PubMed, SCOPUS, COCHRANE, Lilacs and Web of Science electronic databases. The time of onset and duration of symptoms were considered primary outcomes. The sex and age of individuals, the geographical location of the study, the prevalence of symptoms, other associated symptoms, associated comorbidities, and the impact on quality of life and eating habits were considered secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Our search generated 17 articles. Many of the studies reported that the onset of anosmia and ageusia occurred 4 to 5 days after the manifestation of other symptoms of the infection and that these symptoms started to disappear after one week, with more significant improvements in the first two weeks. CONCLUSION: The present study concludes that the onset of symptoms of loss of smell and taste, associated with COVID-19, occurs 4 to 5 days after other symptoms, and that these symptoms last from 7 to 14 days. Findings, however, varied and there is therefore a need for further studies to clarify the occurrence of these symptoms.

Previous works typically predict the stock price mainly based on its own information, neglecting the cross effect among involved stocks.

To take the cross effect into consideration, we propose a deep learning framework, called Multi-GCGRU, which comprises graph convolutional network (GCN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to predict stock movement. Specifically, we first encode multiple relationships among stocks into graphs based on financial domain knowledge and utilize GCN to extract the cross effect based on these pre-defined graphs. To further get rid of prior knowledge, we explore an adaptive relationship learned by data automatically. The cross-correlation features produced by GCN are concatenated with historical records and then fed into GRU to model the temporal dependency of stock prices.

METHODS: The IPPE course for ITPD students was redesigned to offer remote educational activities in the health system setting and simulated practice and communication activities in the community setting. Students were evaluated via surveys regarding the perceived value of these changes, and changes in knowledge, skills and abilities before and after activities. RESULTS: A total of 6 students were enrolled in the revised IPPE course. Students agreed or strongly agreed that the overall distance-based IPPE experience, the remote health system activities, and the community activities were valuable. Students also strongly agreed that course design successfully met course outcomes and was relevant to pharmacy practice. In terms of knowledge, skills and abilities, numeric improvements were observed in remote health system activities and community-based simulated patient interactions, but results were not statistically significant. A high baseline level of knowledge led to minimal improvements in perceptions of improvement in community pharmacy skills regarding pharmacy simulation software.

These crises were met with both a counterproductive and inadequate response from the federal government. We examine these converging crises at the individual, social, and political scales. The biological realities of COVID-19 impact different populations in widely varied ways-the poor, the elderly, Black, Indigenous, and people of color, and those living with comorbidities get sick and die at the highest rates. Social distancing guidelines shifted millions of people to work-from-home and millions more lost their jobs, even as care laborers, preponderantly women, Black, Indigenous, and people of color, were asked to put their and their loved ones' lives on the line for the continuation of all of our lives. These biological, social, and economic crises have been punctuated by civil unrest, as millions took to the streets for racial justice, noting the unequal impacts of the pandemic. These converging crises have laid bare decades of neoliberal and neoconservative policies and ideologies, undergirded as they have been by racial capitalism, for their fundamental uncaringness. In this paper, we argue that this pandemic not only made a wider population more acutely aware of the necessity and importance of the need to care and for caring labors, but also that we stand at the precipice of potentiality--of producing a more caring society.

The HPLC results indicate that quercitrin and hyperoside are the major polyphenolics in HC-EA and are responsible for providing protection against UVB-induced cell death. These responses were associated with the regulation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, which rescued HaCaT cells from UVB-induced apoptosis. In addition, HC-EA, quercitrin, and hyperoside attenuated UVB-induced inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, and iNOS. Furthermore, the treatment of cells with HC-EA and its active compounds abolished intracellular ROS and increased levels of heme oxygenase-1 and superoxide dismutase. UVB-induced ROS production mediated Akt and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways, including p38, ERK, and JNK. Our results show HC-EA, quercitrin, and hyperoside decreased UVB-induced p38 and JNK phosphorylation, while increasing ERK and Akt phosphorylation.

The addition of an ambulatory SW in partnership with an inpatient SW allowed our Burn Center to continue participation in the group and individual peer support offerings despite the simultaneous COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to examine participation in support services using our dual SW model. Methods Prior to 2020, our ABA verified Burn Center only had an inpatient SW who was able to engage our admitted patient population to support services. With the addition of an ambulatory SW, we have been able to target support group participation in the larger ambulatory population. Our dual SW model allows for continued recruitment to our support services;meeting the patients needs at each stage of recovery. This tag team approach, coupled with increased use of technology driven by the pandemic, has shown to increase the average number of participants. We reviewed our support group participation and attendance over the past 2 years. Results In calendar year 2020 with one SW facilitator, only 14 virtual support groups were held with an attendance average of 4-5 participants and 22 individual peer support visits. In only the first 9 months of calendar year 2021 with the addition of a second SOAR trained SW, 18 support groups were completed virtually with new inpatient, in-person participation. The participation rate of now bi-monthly support groups has increased to 9 participants per support group average. At this continued rate, we expect to serve 216 attendees per year through support group. In this same 9-month span 51 SOAR individual peer support visits (12 in-person and 39 virtual), were conducted. Which is an increase from the 22 total peer support visits facilitated in 2020. Conclusions An additional SOAR trained SW to our Burn Center has increased participation and availability of support groups and individual peer support visits. Peer support promotes socialization and can provide healing for the burn patients and their families in a meaningful and profound way. Burn centers must continue to prioritize the role of the clinical SW to ensure programs such as SOAR support group and individual peer support can be facilitated to ensure an environment that fosters psychological and emotional healing.","output":"Increasing SOAR Participation in a Burn Center through a Social Work Team Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: During the first nine months COVID-19 pandemic, many emergency departments (EDs) experimented with telehealth applications to reduce virus exposure, decrease visit volume, and conserve personal protective equipment. We interviewed ED leaders who implemented telehealth programs to inform responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future emergencies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September-November 2020, we conducted semi-structured interviews with ED leaders across the United States. We identified EDs with pandemic-related telehealth programs through literature review and snowball sampling. Maximum variation sampling was used to capture a range of experiences. We used standard qualitative analysis techniques, consisting of both inductive and deductive approaches to identify and characterize themes. RESULTS: We completed 15 interviews with EDs leaders in 10 states. From March-November 2020, participants experimented with more than a dozen different types of telehealth applications including tele-isolation, tele-triage, tele-consultation, virtual post-discharge assessment, acute care in the home, and tele-palliative care. Prior experience with telehealth was key for implementation of new applications. Most new telehealth applications turned out to be temporary because they were no longer needed to support the response. The leading barriers to telehealth implementation during the pandemic included technology challenges and the need for hands-on implementation support in the ED.

Coagulation activation, angiogenesis and alterations of endothelial barrier (EB) are elements of immunothrombosis that have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Angiopoietins (Ang) 1 and 2 and their receptor Tie2 and VEGF-A are well-known pro-angiogenic mediators that, during inflammation also mediate EB disruption. Recently, it has also been demonstrated that the Ang/Tie2 pathway is involved in coagulation activation. Here we explored whether increased levels of angiogenesis/EB regulators (which have been previously associated with disease severity in COVID-19) are also associated with both EB disruption and coagulation activation in this condition. Methods: the study population consisted of 30 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and presenting typical CT findings admitted due to hypoxemia. Thirty sex- and age-matched healthy individuals were recruited at the same time, from the same geographic region. Patients were part of a clinical trial (REBEC: U1111-1250-1843) but samples were obtained before any study intervention, within 24 hours from diagnosis confirmation. Circulating levels of angiogenesis/EB regulation mediators and coagulation biomarkers were measured by commercial assays (immunological or functional). Monolayers of endothelial cells from umbilical veins (HUVECs) or lung (HULECs) were used for measurement of EB integrity using an impedance sensor system (ECIS, Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing System). Cells were stimulated with serum from patients or healthy individuals and EB integrity was continuously monitored for 36 hours. Clinical outcomes were obtained from the digital medical records. Results: mean length of hospital stay (LOS) was 12.9  9.8 days. Twelve patients (40%) required intensive care (ICU) and 28/30 patients survived. Mean D-dimer was 3,609  14,440 ng/mL. Circulating levels of Ang1, Ang2, sTie2 and VEGF-A were all significantly increased in patients compared to healthy individuals (Ang1: 463.2  194.6 vs 237.4  104.9 pg/mL, p<0.0001; Ang2: 1,926 (1,275 - 3,134) vs 1,215 (9 - 1,440 pg/mL), p<0.0001; Tie2: 10,753  2,377 vs 8,603  1,851 pg/mL, p<0.0001 and VEGF-A: 94.7 (73.4 - 116.0) vs 45.9 (39.7 - 57.0 pg/mL), p<0.0001.). In contrast, soluble VE-cadherin levels were decreased in patients compared to healthy individuals (1,234  318 vs 1,539  363 ng/mL, P=0.001). Serum from COVID-19 patients induced decreases of EB integrity in monolayers of both HUVECs and HULECs as early as 15 minutes, lasting up to 5 hours after stimulation (figure 1). The magnitude of EB disruption was correlated with clinically relevant outcomes such as time of ICU stay and LOS (figure 1). Interestingly, levels of Ang1, Ang2 and soluble VE-cadherin levels were also significantly correlated with the magnitude of EB disruption, as well as with biomarkers of coagulation activation such as fibrinogen, Von Willebrand Factor antigen levels, PAI-1, P-selectin and urokinase receptor (uPAR). Conclusions: Ang-1/Ang-2 mediated Tie2 signaling has been shown to be important for the fine regulation of barrier integrity and coagulation activation at the endothelial level, which are two critical elements of immunothrombosis. Our results provide evidence supporting that the interplay between these processes can play a role in the mechanisms driving COVID-19 severity, and suggest that targeting the Ang/Tie2 and VEGF-A pathways could be attractive strategies to modulate not only changes of the alveolar-capillary barrier, but also of coagulation activation in COVID-19. Figure 1. In (a), endothelial barrier (EB) integrity of HUVEC monolayers upon stimulation by serum from COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals (n=27-30 per group). The lower the normalized resistance, the higher the magnitude of EB disruption. Significant differences (* to ****) are evident from 15 min to 5 hours (Anova corrected for multiple comparisons). In the lower panels, the correlation of EB disruption with clinically relevant outcomes such as length of hospital stay (b) and days of intensive care (c) are shown. Negative correlations (Spearman test) indicate that the magnitude of EB disruption is associated with worse outcomes.

A series of Ac-(XKXE)2 -NH2 peptides incorporating aromatic amino acids of increasing molecular volume and steric profile (X = phenylalanine [Phe], homophenylalanine [Hph], tryptophan [Trp], 1-naphthylalanine [1-Nal], 2-naphthylalanine [2-Nal], or biphenylalanine [Bip]) were assessed to determine substitution effects on self-assembly propensity and on morphology of the resulting nanoribbon structures. Additional studies were conducted to determine the effects of incorporating amino acids of differing steric profile in the hydrophobic core (Ac-X1 KFEFKFE-NH2 and Ac-(X1,5 KFE)-NH2 peptides, X = Trp or Bip). Spectroscopic analysis by circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy indicated -sheet formation for all variants.

In a cohort of 100 patients with cancer who were hospitalized for COVID-19, patients with hematologic cancer had higher mortality relative to patients with solid cancer. In two additional cohorts, flow cytometric and serologic analyses demonstrated that patients with solid cancer and patients without cancer had a similar immune phenotype during acute COVID-19, whereas patients with hematologic cancer had impairment of B cells and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody responses. Despite the impaired humoral immunity and high mortality in patients with hematologic cancer who also have COVID-19, those with a greater number of CD8 T cells had improved survival, including those treated with anti-CD20 therapy. Furthermore, 77% of patients with hematologic cancer had detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses. Thus, CD8 T cells might influence recovery from COVID-19 when humoral immunity is deficient.

We estimated SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody prevalence (seroprevalence) among blood donors in metropolitan Melbourne following a COVID-19 outbreak in the city between June and September 2020. The aim was to determine the extent of infection spread and whether seroprevalence varied demographically in proportion to reported cases of infection. The design involved stratified sampling of residual specimens from blood donors (aged 20-69 years) in three postcode groups defined by low (<3 cases/1,000 population), medium (3{-}{-}-7 cases/1,000 population) and high (>7 cases/1,000 population) COVID-19 incidence based on case notification data. All specimens were tested using the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay. Seroprevalence was estimated with adjustment for test sensitivity and specificity for the Melbourne metropolitan blood donor and residential populations, using multilevel regression and poststratification. Overall, 4,799 specimens were collected between 23 November and 17 December 2020. Seroprevalence for blood donors was 0.87% (90% credible interval: 0.25-1.49%). The highest estimates, of 1.13% (0.25-2.15%) and 1.11% (0.28-1.95%), respectively, were observed among donors living in the lowest socioeconomic areas (Quintiles 1 and 2) and lowest at 0.69% (0.14-1.39%) among donors living in the highest socioeconomic areas (Quintile 5). When extrapolated to the Melbourne residential population, overall seroprevalence was 0.90% (0.26-1.51%), with estimates by demography groups similar to those for the blood donors. The results suggest a lack of extensive community transmission and good COVID-19 case ascertainment based on routine testing during Victorias second epidemic wave. Residual blood donor samples provide a practical epidemiological tool for estimating seroprevalence and information on population patterns of infection, against which the effectiveness of ongoing responses to the pandemic can be assessed.","output":"SEROLOGICAL TESTING OF BLOOD DONORS TO CHARACTERISE THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 IN MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on political leadership around the world. Differences in how leaders address the pandemic through public messages have practical implications for building trust and an effective response within a country. METHODS: We analysed the speeches made by 20 heads of government around the world (Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Scotland, Sint Maarten, United Kingdom, United States and Taiwan) to highlight the differences between men and women leaders in discussing COVID-19. We used an inductive analytical approach, coding speeches for specific themes based on language and content. FINDINGS: Five primary themes emerged across a total of 122 speeches on COVID-19, made by heads of government: economics and financial relief, social welfare and vulnerable populations, nationalism, responsibility and paternalism, and emotional appeals. While all leaders described the economic impact of the pandemic, women spoke more frequently about the impact on the individual scale. Women leaders were also more often found describing a wider range of social welfare services, including: mental health, substance abuse and domestic violence. Both men and women from lower-resource settings described detailed financial relief and social welfare support that would impact the majority of their populations. While 17 of the 20 leaders used war metaphors to describe COVID-19 and the response, men largely used these with greater volume and frequency. CONCLUSION: While this analysis does not attempt to answer whether men or women are more effective leaders in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, it does provide insight into the rhetorical tools and types of language used by different leaders during a national and international crisis. This analysis provides additional evidence on the differences in political leaders messages and priorities to inspire citizens adhesion to the social contract in the adoption of response and recovery measures.

The reporter genes were expressed from two different sites within the CD-61 sequence and expression was not affected by interruption of the CD-61-specific ORF. Expression of the reporter genes was under the control of a transcription-associated sequence (TAS) derived from the Beaudette gene 5, normally used for the transcription of IBV subgenomic mRNA 5.

However, despite numerous investigations, there are still debates on the organization of this brain region. In vivo neuroimaging techniques such as resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to define the functional circuitry of brain areas, producing results largely consistent with gold-standard invasive tract-tracing techniques and offering the opportunity for cross-species comparisons within the same modality. Our results using resting-state fMRI from macaque monkeys to uncover the intrinsic functional architecture of the LFC corroborate previous findings and inform current debates. Specifically, within the dorsal LFC, we show that 1) the region along the midline and anterior to the superior arcuate sulcus is divided in two areas separated by the posterior supraprincipal dimple, 2) the cytoarchitectonically defined area 6DC/F2 contains two connectional divisions, and 3) a distinct area occupies the cortex around the spur of the arcuate sulcus, updating what was previously proposed to be the border between dorsal and ventral motor/premotor areas. Within the ventral LFC, the derived parcellation clearly suggests the presence of distinct areas: 1) an area with a somatomotor/orofacial connectional signature (putative area 44), 2) an area with an oculomotor connectional signature (putative frontal eye fields), and 3) premotor areas possibly hosting laryngeal and arm representations.

Professional lactation support by the International Board Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLCs) increases breastfeeding rates; however, many communities lack access to IBCLCs. Black and Latinx parents have lower breastfeeding rates, and limited access to professional lactation support may contribute to this disparity. Virtual telelactation consults that use two-way video have the potential to increase access to IBCLCs among disadvantaged populations. We present a protocol for the digital Tele-MILC trial, which uses mixed methods to evaluate the impact of telelactation services on breastfeeding outcomes. The objective of this pragmatic, parallel design randomized controlled trial is to assess the impact of telelactation on breastfeeding duration and exclusivity and explore how acceptability of and experiences with telelactation vary across Latinx, Black, and non-Black and non-Latinx parents to guide future improvement of these services. METHODS: 2400 primiparous, pregnant individuals age > 18 who intend to breastfeed and live in the USA underserved by IBCLCs will be recruited. Recruitment will occur via Ovia, a pregnancy tracker mobile phone application (app) used by over one million pregnant individuals in the USA annually. Participants will be randomized to (1) on-demand telelactation video calls on personal devices or (2) ebook on infant care/usual care. Breastfeeding outcomes will be captured via surveys and interviews and compared across racial and ethnic groups. This study will track participants for 8 months (including 6 months postpartum). Primary outcomes include breastfeeding duration and breastfeeding exclusivity. We will quantify differences in these outcomes across racial and ethnic groups. Both intention-to-treat and as-treated (using instrumental variable methods) analyses will be performed. This study will also generate qualitative data on the experiences of different subgroups of parents with the telelactation intervention, including barriers to use, satisfaction, and strengths and limitations of this delivery model.

Four experiments compared sensitivity to the syllable structure of labial- vs. corona-initial speech stimuli (e.g., plaf > pnaf > ptaf vs. traf > tmaf > tpaf); meanwhile, participants (English vs. Russian speakers) lightly bit on their lips or tongues. Results suggested that the perception of these stimuli was selectively modulated by motor stimulation (e.g., stimulating the tongue differentially affected sensitivity to labial vs. coronal stimuli). Remarkably, stimulation did not affect sensitivity to syllable structure.

Here, we report our intubation team experience and activity as well as patient outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The MERIT members followed a protocolized early tracheal intubation model. Over a seven-week period during the peak of the pandemic, prospective data were collected on MERIT activity, COVID-19 symptoms or diagnosis in the team members, and demographic, procedural, and clinical outcomes of patients. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 150 primary tracheal intubation episodes, with 101 (67.3%) of those occurring in men, and with a mean (standard deviation) age of 55.7 (13.8) yr. Black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups accounted for 55.7% of patients. 91.3% of tracheal intubations were performed with videolaryngoscopy, and the first pass success rate was 88.0%. The 30-day survival was 69.2%, and the median [interquartile range] length of critical care stay was 11 [6C20] days and of hospital stay was 12 [7C22] days. Seven (11.1%) MERIT healthcare professionals self-isolated because of COVID-19 symptoms, with a total 41 days of clinical work lost.

Computational network modeling has deduced inflammation in experimental and clinical settings. We measured immune mediators in plasma from competent and incompetent leg veins inferring the role of cellular immunity based on cytokine networks. Methods Temperature was assessed using infrared thermography (IRT) to measure inflammation. Blood was obtained during sclerotherapy or endovenous thermal ablation for VVs. Control subjects underwent phlebotomy from saphenous and forearm veins. Vein segments were harvested during surgery. Demographics, clinical, etiology, anatomy and pathophysiology classification, venous clinical severity scores (VCSSs), and body mass index (BMI) were collected. Twenty-five mediators were measured in serum and vein segments. Means were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Pearson correlations equaling or exceeding a threshold prompted connections among nodes, and mapped as networks. Spearman correlations were performed between interleukin (IL)-17A and both granulocyte macrophage colony stimulation factor, and IL-10 as indicators of pathogenic and nonpathogenic Th17 cell involvement. Results Age, BMI, and VCSSs differed significantly between groups. Temperatures were higher over diseased veins. Plasma concentrations of 20 cytokines differed between control and patient subjects (P<0.05), and most were lower in patients. C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-9 (aka monokine-induced by gamma interferon), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (aka IFN induced protein 10), and soluble IL-2 receptor-alpha were higher in patients, but not connected to other mediators in networks. In contrast, IL-17A, IL-12p70, and interferon gamma were the only mediators that were more highly interconnected in venous insufficiency. IL-17A and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were highly correlated in chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) but not in controls. In tissue, refluxing VVs significantly higher IL-15 expression than competent saphenous veins. Conclusions Venous insufficiency associates with age, BMI, skin temperature, and plasma cytokines associated with interferon gamma and possibly IL-17A signaling. The vein wall may be a source of activation of cellular activation, given elevated IL-15 expression. Correlations between IL-17A and GM-CSF suggested a potential role for pathogenic Th17 cells in VVs.

Ultrahigh-field MRI shows advantages such as increased sensitivity to magnetic susceptibility differences and improved signal-to-noise ratio that can be translated into smaller voxel size, but also increased sensitivity to static and B1 field inhomogeneities. The aim was to produce a systematic comparison of three MRI-based methods for estimation of OEF. METHODS OEF estimates in 16 healthy subjects were obtained at 7T utilizing susceptometry-based oximetry (SBO), quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and transverse relaxation rate (R2*). Two major draining veins, that is, the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and the straight sinus (SS), were investigated, including mutual agreement between the methods in each of the two different vessels, agreement between vessels as well as potential vessel angle and vessel size dependences. RESULTS Very good correlation (r = .88) was found between SBO-based and QSM-based OEF estimates in SSS. Only QSM showed a moderate correlation (r = .61) between corresponding OEF estimates in SSS and SS. For SBO, a trend of increasing OEF estimates was observed as the SS vessel angle relative to the main magnetic field increased. No obvious size dependence could be established for any method. The R2*-based OEF estimates were reasonable (35%-36%), but the observed range was somewhat low.

In order to inform adolescent-specific delivery care initiatives and coverage, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of trends, projections and inequalities in coverage of delivery care services among adolescents at national, urban-rural and socio-economic levels in LMICs. METHODS: Using 224 nationally representative cross-sectional survey data between 2000 and 2019, we estimated the coverage of institutional delivery (INSD) and skilled birth attendants (SBA). Bayesian hierarchical regression models were used to estimate trends, projections and determinants of INSD and SBA. RESULTS: Coverage of delivery care services among adolescents increased substantially at the national level, as well as in both urban and rural areas in most countries between 2000 and 2018. Of the 54 LMICs, 24 countries reached 80% coverage of both INSD and SBA in 2018, and predictions for 40 countries are set to exceed 80% by 2030. The trends in coverage of INSD and SBA of adult mothers mostly align with those for adolescent mothers. Our findings show that urban-rural and wealth-based inequalities to delivery care remain persistent by 2030. In 2018, urban settings across 54 countries had higher rates of coverage exceeding 80% compared to rural for both INSD (45 urban, 16 rural) and SBA (50 urban, 19 rural). Several factors such as household head age  46 years, household head being female, access to mass media, lower parity, higher education, higher ANC visits and higher socio-economic status could increase the coverage of INSD and SBA among adolescents and adult women.

This study aimed to examine the expression of mTOR pathway genes in patients with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine, which is considered an mTOR inhibitor and autophagy inducer. METHODS Thirty-two patients with acute schizophrenia who had been treated with olanzapine for four weeks (average dose 14.24  4.35 mg/d) and 32 healthy volunteers were recruited. Before and after olanzapine treatment, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was used to evaluate the symptoms of patients with schizophrenia, and the mRNA expression levels of mTOR pathway-related genes, including MTOR, RICTOR, RAPTOR, and DEPTOR, were detected in fasting venous blood samples from all subjects using real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS The MTOR and RICTOR mRNA expression levels in patients with acute schizophrenia were significantly decreased compared with those of healthy controls and further significantly decreased after four weeks of olanzapine treatment. The DEPTOR mRNA expression levels in patients with acute schizophrenia were not significantly different from those of healthy controls but were significantly increased after treatment. The expression levels of the RAPTOR mRNA were not significantly different among the three groups. The pairwise correlations of MTOR, DEPTOR, RAPTOR, and RICTOR mRNA expression levels in patients with acute schizophrenia and healthy controls were significant. After olanzapine treatment, the correlations between the expression levels of the DEPTOR and MTOR mRNAs and between the DEPTOR and RICTOR mRNAs disappeared. CONCLUSIONS Abnormalities in the mTOR pathway, especially DEPTOR and mTORC2, might play important roles in the autophagy mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and effects of olanzapine treatment.","output":"Alteration in the mRNA expression profile of the autophagy-related mTOR pathway in schizophrenia patients treated with olanzapine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been worldwide debate on the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19. In the recent RECOVERY trial, evaluating the effect of dexamethasone, a reduced 28-day mortality in patients requiring oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation was shown. Their results have led to considering amendments in guidelines or actually already recommending corticosteroids in COVID-19. However, the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids still remain uncertain, and reliable data to further shed light on the benefit and harm are needed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids in COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature search of RCTS and observational studies on adult patients was performed across Medline/PubMed, Embase and Web of Science from December 1, 2019, until October 1, 2020, according to the PRISMA guidelines. Primary outcomes were short-term mortality and viral clearance (based on RT-PCR in respiratory specimens). Secondary outcomes were: need for mechanical ventilation, need for other oxygen therapy, length of hospital stay and secondary infections. RESULTS: Forty-four studies were included, covering 20.197 patients. In twenty-two studies, the effect of corticosteroid use on mortality was quantified. The overall pooled estimate (observational studies and RCTs) showed a significant reduced mortality in the corticosteroid group (OR 0.72 (95%CI 0.57-0.87). Furthermore, viral clearance time ranged from 10 to 29 days in the corticosteroid group and from 8 to 24 days in the standard of care group. Fourteen studies reported a positive effect of corticosteroids on need for and duration of mechanical ventilation. A trend toward more infections and antibiotic use was present. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings from both observational studies and RCTs confirm a beneficial effect of corticosteroids on short-term mortality and a reduction in need for mechanical ventilation. And although data in the studies were too sparse to draw any firm conclusions, there might be a signal of delayed viral clearance and an increase in secondary infections.","output":"Corticosteroid use in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis on clinical outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been described as a new non-transthoracic esophagectomy that the single-port inflatable mediastinoscopy and laparoscopic surgery is safe and effective for the radical esophagectomy of esophageal cancer.

METHODS: Outpatient, hospitalized, and community recruited volunteers < 18 years with COVID-19 were enrolled in a longitudinal study at Seattle Childrens Hospital. Analysis includes symptomatic and asymptomatic children with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who provided blood samples at approximately 4wks (range: 2-18wks, IQR:4-8wks) and 24 wks (range: 23-35wks, IQR:25-27wks) after diagnosis. We measured neutralizing Ab using an in-house pseudoneutralization assay and anti-N binding Ab using the Abbott Architect assay. RESULTS: Of 32 children enrolled between April 2020 and January 2021, 27 had no underlying immunocompromised state and 25 of these 27 children had symptomatic disease. Ten of 27 had a > 2-fold decrease neutralization titers between 4 and 24wks (most were < 10-fold); 12 had < 2-fold change; and 5 had neutralization titers that increased > 2-fold over time (Fig. 1A). All but one of these 27 children had detectable neutralizing activity at 24wks. Anti-N Abs were assessed for 25 children at 4wks and 17 children at 24wks (data pending for 14 samples); all children with paired samples had a > 1.75-fold Abbott index reduction at 24wks, and 5 children had no detectable anti-N Abs by 24wks (Fig. 2A). An additional 5 children with symptomatic disease had complicating immunosuppression or multiple blood transfusions; 2 had decreasing neutralizing titers, 2 increased, and 1 had no change (Fig. 1B).

A model-based eigenvalue analysis of viral load data from eight symptomatic COVID-19 patients was conducted. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the instabilities were determined that give rise to COVID-19. For all eight patients, it was found that the virus dynamics followed the unstable eigenvectors until the viral load reached the respective peak values. At the peak virus values, the virus dynamics branched off from the directions specified by the eigenvectors. The temporal course of the unstable eigenvalues was determined as well. For all patients, it was found that the eigenvalues switched from positive to negative values just when the virus load reached peak values. These findings suggest that the fixed, instability-related eigenvalues and eigenvectors determine initial stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections during which virus load increases. In contrast, the time-dependent eigenvalues show a sign-switching phenomenon that indicates when the virus dynamics switches from the growth stage (increasing virus load) to the decay stage (decreasing virus load). The virus dynamics model was a standard three-variable virus dynamics model frequently used in the literature.","output":"Eigenvalue analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral load data: illustration for eight COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Plasma lipids have been at the center stage of the prediction and prevention strategies for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and novel lipidomic traits have been recognized as reliable biomarkers for CVD risk prediction. The mitochondria serve as energy supply sites for cells and can synthesize a variety of lipids autonomously. Therefore, investigating the relationships between mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and plasma lipidomic traits is meaningful. Here, we enrolled a total of 1,409 Han Chinese patients with coronary artery disease from three centers and performed linear regression analyses on the SNPs of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and lipidomic traits in two independent groups. Sex, age, aspartate aminotransferase, estimated glomerular filtration rate, antihypertensive drugs, hypertension, and diabetes were adjusted. We identified three associations, namely, D-loop(m.16089T>C) with TG(50:4) NL-16:0, D-loop(m.16145G>A) with TG(54:5) NL-18:0, and D-loop(m.16089T>C) with PC(16:0_16:1) at the statistically significant threshold of FDR < 0.05. Then, we explored the relationships between mitochondrial genetic variants and traditional lipids, including triglyceride, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Two significant associations were found, namely MT-ND6(m.14178T>C) with TC and D-loop(m.215A>G) with LDLC. Furthermore, we performed linear regression analysis to determine on the SNPs of mtDNA and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and found that the SNP D-loop(m.16145G>A) was nominally significantly associated with LVEF (P = 0.047).

Hence, it is difficult to make an exclusive diagnosis. METHODS: Thirty confirmed cases of COVID-19 and forty-three cases of other aetiology or clinically confirmed non-COVID-19 in a general hospital were included. The clinical data including age, sex, exposure history, laboratory parameters and aetiological diagnosis of all patients were collected. Seven positive signs (posterior part/lower lobe predilection, bilateral involvement, rounded GGO, subpleural bandlike GGO, crazy-paving pattern, peripheral distribution, and GGO +/? consolidation) from significant COVID-19 CT image features and four negative signs (only one lobe involvement, only central distribution, tree-in-bud sign, and bronchial wall thickening) from other non-COVID-19 pneumonia were used. The scoring analysis of CT features was compared between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19). RESULTS: Older age, symptoms of diarrhoea, exposure history related to Wuhan, and a lower white blood cell and lymphocyte count were significantly suggestive of COVID-19 rather than non-COVID-19 (p < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the combined CT image features analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the scoring system was 0.854. These cut-off values yielded a sensitivity of 56.67% and a specificity of 95.35% for a score > 4, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 23.26% for a score > 0, and a sensitivity of 86.67% and a specificity of 67.44% for a score > 2.

To achieve economic recovery and avoid a waste of resources, different regions have developed prevention and control strategies according to their social, economic, and medical conditions and culture. COVID-19 disparities under the interaction of various factors, including interventions, need to be analyzed in advance for effective and precise prevention and control. Considering the United States as the study case, we investigated statistical and spatial disparities based on the impact of the county-level social vulnerability index (SVI) on the COVID-19 infection rate. The county-level COVID-19 infection rate showed very significant heterogeneity between states, where 67% of county-level disparities in COVID-19 infection rates come from differences between states. A hierarchical linear model (HLM) was adopted to examine the moderating effects of state-level social distancing policies on the influence of the county-level SVI on COVID-19 infection rates, considering the variation in data at a unified level and the interaction of various data at different levels. Although previous studies have shown that various social distancing policies inhibit COVID-19 transmission to varying degrees, this study explored the reasons for the disparities in COVID-19 transmission under various policies. For example, we revealed that the state-level restrictions on the internal movement policy significantly attenuate the positive effect of county-level economic vulnerability indicators on COVID-19 infection rates, indirectly inhibiting COVID-19 transmission. We also found that not all regions are suitable for the strictest social distancing policies. We considered the moderating effect of multilevel covariates on the results, allowing us to identify the causes of significant group differences across regions and to tailor measures of varying intensity more easily.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is a retrospective review of laparoscopic colorectal cases performed with or without epidural analgesia for cancer, diverticular disease, and benign polyps. Patient demographic characteristics, disease and procedure types, and hospital settings were listed for patients in the epidural and conventional analgesia groups. A 1 to 4 case-matched analysis was performed, matching for patient demographic characteristics, hospital setting, indications, and procedure type. Data were obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Total hospital charge, length of stay, mortality, pneumonia, respiratory failure, urinary tract infection, urinary retention, anastomotic leak, and postoperative ileus. RESULTS A total of 191576 laparoscopic colorectal cases were identified during the study period. Epidural analgesia was used in 4102 cases (2.14%). Epidurals were more likely to be used in large teaching hospitals, cancer cases, and rectal operations. On case-matched analysis, epidural analgesia was associated with a longer hospital stay by 0.60 day (P=.003), higher hospital charges by $3732.71 (P=.02), and higher rate of urinary tract infection (odds ratio=1.81; P=.05). Epidural analgesia did not affect the incidence of respiratory failure, pneumonia, anastomotic leak, ileus, or urinary retention.

Subgroup analyses were performed using the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Of 340 health care workers approached, 338 (99.4%) consented to the survey; 163 (48.7%) were registered nurses and 160 (48.3%) lived with children. While 326 (97.3%) workers were concerned about putting their family/coworkers at risk of infection after caring for a patient with SARS-CoV-2, only 30 (8.9%) were unwilling to treat a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Registered nurses were more likely than other health care workers to think it was ethical to refuse care for SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, worried more often about contracting infection, and felt that SARS-CoV-2 added to their stress level (P = .009, P = .018, P < .001, respectively). A similar contrast was seen when comparing workers who live with children with those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of stress and concern were extremely high. In spite of that, the overwhelming majority of workers were willing to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Registered nurses and health care workers who live with children were more likely to think it is ethical to refuse care for SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.","output":"Health Care Workers Attitudes Toward Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) causes community-acquired pneumonia affecting mainly children, and tends to produce cyclic outbreaks. The widespread use of macrolides is increasing resistance rates to these antibiotics. Molecular tools can help in diagnosis, typing and resistance detection, leading to better patient management. OBJECTIVES: To assess the MP genotypes and resistance pattern circulating in our area while comparing serological and molecular diagnosis of MP. METHODS: Molecular and serological diagnosis of MP was performed in 821 samples collected in Badalona (Barcelona, Spain) from 2013 to 2017. Multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and macrolide resistance detection by pyrosequencing were performed in those cases positive by PCR. Presence of respiratory viruses and relevant clinical data were also recorded. RESULTS: MP was detected in 16.8% of cases by PCR, with an overall agreement with serology of 76%. Eleven different MLVA types were identified, with 4-5-7-2 (50.1%) and 3-5-6-2 (29.2%) being the most abundant, with the latter showing a seasonal increase during the study. A total of 8% of the strains harboured a point substitution associated with macrolide resistance, corresponding mainly to an A2063G 23S rRNA mutation and directly related to previous macrolide therapy. Analysis of respiratory viruses showed viral coinfections in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: Serological and molecular tools combined could improve MP diagnosis and the analysis of its infection patterns. Macrolide resistance is associated with previous therapy. Given that MP pneumonia usually resolves spontaneously, it should be reconsidered whether antibiotic treatment is suitable for all cases.","output":"Macrolide resistance and molecular typing of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections during a 4 year period in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The use of amalgam in Dentistry has decreased since the 1980s. This study aimed to (i) assess the time trend in the usage of amalgam and composite in posterior teeth at Griffith University Dental Clinic from 2010 to 2019; (ii) to test whether this trend varied according to the dental health provider. METHODS We analyzed clinic records from 2010 to 2019. Prais-Winsten analyses were performed, and the average annual percentages change (AAPC) for amalgam and composite was estimated. RESULTS There were 397,013 procedures, including 80,995 direct posterior restorations. Amalgam use decreased from 12.9% in 2010 to 0.5% in 2019 among students, while composite use has increased from 87.1% to 99.5% of posterior restorations. The annual increase of composite was 1.4% per year for students, while amalgam decreased by 30.2% per year on average. A similar trend was noted among the dentists. CONCLUSIONS A significant decrease in the use of amalgam was observed over time for both students and professionals.

Early studies of GR signaling led to broad acceptance of models in which glucocorticoid receptor (GR) monomers tether repressively to inflammatory transcription factors, thus abrogating inflammatory gene expression. However, newer data challenge this core concept and present an exciting opportunity to reframe our understanding of GR signaling. Here, we present an alternate, two-part model for transcriptional repression by glucocorticoids. First, widespread GR-mediated induction of transcription results in rapid, primary repression of inflammatory gene transcription and associated enhancers through competition-based mechanisms. Second, a subset of GR-induced genes, including targets that are regulated in coordination with inflammatory transcription factors such as NF-&#954;B, exerts secondary repressive effects on inflammatory gene expression. Within this framework, emerging data indicate the gene set regulated through the cooperative convergence of GR and NF-&#954;B signaling is central to the broad clinical effectiveness of glucocorticoids in terminating inflammation and promoting tissue repair.","output":"Repression of transcription by the glucocorticoid receptor: A parsimonious model for the genomics era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Renal artery denervation (RDN) procedure is a broadly discussed method in the treatment of resistant hypertension. Many studies report short-term (3C12 months) results for blood pressure and arterial stiffness. The primary endpoints were changes in 24 h mean systolic blood pressure (BP) and office systolic BP 48 months after RDN. The secondary endpoints were changes in aortic pulse wave velocity and impact of polypharmacy on these variables. Materials and Methods: Renal artery denervation was performed in 73 patients treated for resistant hypertension; 49 patients remained in final analysis. Patient examination was carried out before the procedure, and subsequently at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 months later. Patients antihypertensive and overall medication regimens were carefully analysed. Results: Mean 24 h arterial blood pressure lowered and was sustained at lower levels for up to 48 months; median (interequartile rangeIQR) from 158(23.5)/100(14.2) to 140(26.5)/86(16.2) mmHg. Mean reduction in 24 h ambulatory systolic BP was ?11  25 mmHg (95% CI, ?20 to ?2; p < 0.001), while office systolic BP reduced by ?7  23 mmHg (95%CI, ?24 to ?1; p < 0.02).

After 48 months, there was no worsening compared to the baseline level of 10.3 [4.0] m/s (95% CI 6.9 to 17.8) (p > 0.05). The total mean number of antihypertensive drugs remained unchanged: 5.97(1.1) vs. 5.24 (1.45).

Background: Parents needed to reallocate care work between themselves as, on the one hand, kindergartens and schools closed for two months and, on the other hand, employment-related changes arose, e.g., working from home. The results are discussed in light of major theories that address the division of care work: the time availability approach and gender role theory. Method: This study employs data from the Austrian Corona Panel Project 2020/21, a web-based survey using quota sampling, which started in the second week of the first lockdown (n=372 for respondents in couples with children below age 15). Altogether, seven waves contain information about time spent on childcare and housework;three were conducted during or right after the first lockdown (April and May 2020) and four between June 2020 and February 2021. Linear and logistic regression models were used. Results: Within the whole study period, parents' total workload (care work and employment) was highest during the first lockdown. The workload was greatest-an average of 15 hours on weekdays-among mothers with children below age six. While mothers shouldered more care work in most families, partners shared tasks equally in around one third of them. Care time depended on employment hours, especially for fathers. Yet, it was higher for mothers with the same level of employment as fathers. Conclusion: The COVID-19-related employment changes led to a rise in arrangements that rarely existed before in Austria, e.g., fathers working part-time. Consequently, some fathers took on new roles, especially when they worked from home (mostly among the higher educated), were non-employed (mostly among the lower educated) or worked part-time. The paper concludes by discussing whether those experiences may permanently result in more egalitarian gender roles.","output":"Childcare and housework during the first lockdown in Austria: Traditional division or new roles?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At present, several countries, such as Germany and India, have employed a pool testing method on the nucleic acid testing of COVID-19 for the shortage of detection kits. In this method, the testing is performed on several samples of the cases together as a bunch. If the test result of the bunch is negative, then it is shown that none of the cases in the bunch has been infected with the novel coronavirus. On the contrary, if the test result of the bunch is positive, then the samples are tested one by one to confirm which cases are infected. We verified that the pool testing method of COVID-19 is effective in the situation of the shortage of nucleic acid detection kits based on probabilistic modeling. Moreover, the following interesting results are also obtained. (1) If the infection rate is extremely low, while the same number of detection kits are used, the expected number of cases that can be tested by the pool testing method is far more than that by the one-by-one testing method. (2) The pool testing method is effective only when the infection rate is less than 0.3078. While the infection rate decreases from 0.3078 to 0.0018, the optimal sample sizes in one bunch increases from 3 to 25. In general, the higher the infection rate, the smaller the optimal sample size in one bunch. (3) If N samples are tested by the pool testing method, while the sample size in one bunch is G, the number of detection kits required is in the interval (N/G, N). Additionally, the lower the infection rate, the fewer detection kits are needed. Therefore, the pool testing method is not only suitable for the situation of the shortage of detection kits, but also the situation of the overall or sampling detection for a large population.","output":"Is Pool Testing Method of COVID-19 Employed in Germany and India Effective?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the dawn of cities, the built environment has both affected infectious disease transmission and evolved in response to infectious diseases.

DISCUSSION: Built environment risk factors for COVID-19 transmission include crowding, poverty, and racism (as they manifest in housing and neighborhood features), poor indoor air circulation, and ambient air pollution. Potential long-term implications of COVID-19 for the built environment include changes in building design, increased teleworking, reconfigured streets, changing modes of travel, provision of parks and greenspace, and population shifts out of urban centers.

Clinical presentation can range from asymptomatic to severe illness and mortality. Thrombotic complications in COVID-19 have been associated with mortality. The incidence of systemic hypercoagulation in COVID-19 is associated with the process of severe inflammation. The majority of severely ill patients have developed coagulopathy, and this condition is associated with poor outcomes. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old man presented with respiratory symptoms and was diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection. He presented with tachypnea, tachycardia, increased blood pressure, and 74% peripheral oxygen saturation under 15 L/min oxygen per non-rebreather mask. Initial laboratory test results showed severe hypoxemia as per blood gas analysis (pH 7.42, pCO2 23 mmHg, pO2 43 mmHg, HCO3 15 mmol/L, base deficit -9 mmol/L), with increased procalcitonin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, D-dimer, fibrinogen, creatine kinase myocardial band, and Troponin I. He subsequently developed thrombosis of the pulmonary arteries and multiple branches of the pulmonary vein despite therapeutic anticoagulation. We initiated heparin therapy (average dose 25 191 units per day, mean activated partial thromboplastin time, 64.35 seconds). Radiological investigations revealed multiple thromboses on pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins, as well as multiple locations of brain infarction. Rescue thrombolytic therapy was given, but unfortunately, the patient died due to multiple end-organ failures.

A previous real world study in the UK had demonstrated a significant attrition rate between each line of therapy suggesting less than half of patients who received first line SACT then received second line therapy and less than a fifth of first line SACT patients reach third line. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients treated between January 2018 and end of June 2021 to see if advancement in treatment options had impacted on the drop-off rates. Data was collected from 5 UK sites. Patients were identified from electronic SACT database. All reimbursed treatment options including the COVID interim treatment guidelines options were included. Patients who received SACT as part of a clinical trial were also included. Patients who remained on the respective lines of treatment were censored. Results: Data for 515 patients (372 male: 143 female) who received first-line SACT for mRCC were included in the analyses. IMDC prognostic groups were 103 favourable, 236 intermediate, 127 poor (49 not available). On progression 69% of patients were able to receive second-line therapy and 34% were able to receive third-line therapy. Of the 515 first-line therapies, 24% of patients received frontline ipilimumab and nivolumab, 10% received TKI and IO combination and 63% received single agent VEGF TKI. Second-line nivolumab or cabozantinib (43% and 40% respectively) were the most commonly prescribed options. Third-line cabozantinib 61% and nivolumab 16% remain the most used options. Across all lines of therapy progressive disease was the primary reason for discontinuation. 5% switched treatment due to toxicity. Conclusions: These results suggest that, with more treatment options available, including combination/ immunotherapy therapies, more patients are able to receive second and third-line therapies. Despite this, nearly one third of patients only receive one line of treatment which highlights the need to deliver the most efficacious treatments first to optimise patient outcomes. Moreover, single agent TKI was the most commonly used first-line SACT despite advances in the management pathway.

In the analytic situation the analysts position implies the risk of conflict with the parental internal objects resulting from the primary introjections, especially if the original environment was abusive or severely neglectful. Similarly, the adoptive family is often burdened with revengeful and competitive aggressiveness of their own introjected parental objects, having as a main task to keep unified the pre-adoptive autobiographical memories that were dissociated and interrupted. In such cases it is very important to give the adoptive parents help so as to cope with their difficult countertransference, supporting them to reduce their sense of guilt and unsuitability to nurse their children, especially if the adoptive parents feel guilty because of their own infertility.

This exploratory multi-site epidemiological study comprised all consecutive adult stays (n = 320) in 18 medical intensive care units (ICU) or intermediate care wards (ICW) for probable or confirmed Influenza virus infection during the 2017C2018 flu season. RESULTS: Patients admitted to ICU/ICW had low vaccination coverage (21%), required life support in 60% of cases, stayed in the ICU for a median of 8 days, and had high 28-day mortality rate (19.7%; 95% confidence interval 15.5C24.5).

Following proteolytic cleavage after pro-inflammatory stimulation, CD163 is shed from the cell surface and its soluble form in plasma, sCD163, is a biomarker of monocyte/macrophage lineage activation. The assessment of sCD163 plasmatic levels in an early stage of the disease could have clinical utility in predicting the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. The use of tocilizumab (monoclonal antibody anti-IL-6 receptor) in COVID-19 patients reduces lethality rate at 30 days. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of tocilizumab on sCD163 plasmatic levels in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In COVID-19 patients, on hospital admission (T0), after 7 days from hospitalization (T7) and after 45 days from discharge (T45) sCD163 plasmatic levels were evaluated, along with other laboratory parameters. COVID-19 patients were stratified into tocilizumab (TCZ) and non-tocilizumab (non-TCZ) groups. TCZ group was further divided into responder (R) and non-responder (NR) groups. Patients who died or required mechanical ventilation were defined as NR. As control group, healthy donors (HD) were enrolled. RESULTS: Seventy COVID-19 patients and 47 HD were enrolled. At T0, sCD163 plasmatic levels were higher in COVID-19 patients compared to HD (p<0.0001) and the longitudinal evaluation showed a reduction in sCD163 plasmatic levels at T7 compared to T0 (p=0.0211). At T0, both TCZ and non-TCZ groups showed higher sCD163 plasmatic levels compared to HD (p<0.0001 and p=0.0147, respectively). At T7, the longitudinal evaluation showed a significant reduction in sCD163 plasmatic levels (p=0.0030) only in the TCZ group, reaching levels comparable to those of HD. Conversely, not statistically significance in non-TCZ group was observed and, at T7, a statistically significance was found comparing non-TCZ group to HD (p=0.0019). At T0, R and NR groups showed not statistically significance in sCD163 plasmatic levels and both groups showed higher levels compared to HD (p=0.0001 and p=0.0340, respectively). The longitudinal evaluation showed significant reductions in both groups (R: p=0.0356; NR: p=0.0273) independently of the outcome. After 45 days of follow-up sCD163 plasmatic levels remain stable. CONCLUSION: sCD163 plasmatic levels are increased in COVID-19 pneumonia and is efficiently down-regulated by tocilizumab treatment regardless of the clinical outcome.","output":"Role of Tocilizumab in Down Regulating sCD163 Plasmatic Levels in a Cohort of COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Childrens nutrition is highly influenced by community-level deprivation and socioeconomic inequalities and the health outcomes associated, such as childhood obesity, continue to widen.

PURPOSE The aim of the study was to examine the association of multilevel organizational capabilities and adoption of social risk screening among system-owned physician practices. METHODOLOGY Secondary analyses of the 2018 National Survey of Healthcare Organizations and Systems were conducted. Multilevel linear regression models examined physician practice and system characteristics associated with practice adoption of screening for five social risks (food insecurity, housing instability, utility needs, interpersonal violence, and transportation needs), accounting for clustering of practices within systems using random effects. RESULTS System-owned practices screened for an average of 1.7 of the five social risks assessed. The intraclass correlation indicated 16% of practice variation in social risk screening was attributable to differences between their health systems owners, with 84% attributable to differences between individual practices. Practices owned by systems with multiple hospitals screened for an additional 0.44 social risks (p = .046) relative to practices of systems without hospitals. Practice characteristics associated with social risk screening included health information technology capacity ( = 0.20, p = .005), innovation culture ( = 0.26, p < .001), and patient engagement strategies ( = 0.57, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS Health care system capabilities account for less variation in physician practice adoption of social risk screening compared to practice-level capabilities.

During septic shock, inflammatory reaction generates endothelial activation and procoagulant state with microvascular thrombi inducing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Although CAC and DIC induce altered coagulation responses, their clinical outcomes are different. Objective We investigated and compared coagulopathy between septic shock and critical COVID-19 patients. Method Septic shock patients were diagnosed following the Survival Sepsis Campaign guidelines. COVID-19 patients were admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Both were included in the study within 2 days after admission. Biomarkers were measured by ELISA from patient's plasma. Results We observed an increase in vWF and TFPI in both septic and COVID-19 patients compared to controls, highlighting endothelial damage. Interestingly, circulating TF was only elevated in COVID-19 patients. Platelet activation differed between the two cohorts of patients. P-selectin and TLT-1 were specifically heightened in septic shock whereas CD40L was only augmented in COVID-19. Coagulation markers were increased in a disease-dependent way, with PAI-1, tPA and D-Dimers higher in septic shock and fibrinogen level, higher in COVID-19. Discussion COVID-19 patients had longer length-of-stay with more pronounced respiratory failure. This strong lung disruption overtime induced plasmatic TF release with sustained inflammatory response characterized by sCD40L and fibrinogen secretion. Given the similarities between COVID-19 and septic shock regarding fibrinolysis and coagulation, but not platelet activation, endothelium seems to play a central role in COVID-19 and might explain the differences between CAC and DIC.","output":"Head-to-head comparison of cytokines storm-coagulopathy in septic shock and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 1990s saw a systemic shift from the liberal postCWorld War II international order of liberal multilateralism (LIO I) to a postCCold War international order of postnational liberalism (LIO II).

Egypt emitted 250 million tons of CO(2) in 2018, thereby ranking 27th among the countries of the world in terms of energy-related CO(2) emissions. Approximately 40% of CO(2) emissions in Egypt orginate from the electricity generation sector, which is predominately dependent on oil and gas (90%), followed by renewables (10%; solar, wind and hydroelectric). To achieve its development goals, Egypt plans to build new power plants with a total generating capacity of 30 gigawatts (GW). Added to the current generating capacity of Egypts power plants (60 GW), the new power plants will enable electricity generating capacities to reach approximately 90 GW by 2030. Egypt has three scenarios to achieve this goal. In the first scenario, a diversified energy mix scenario, dependence on oil and gas will be decreased in favor of a more diversified energy mix of coal, nuclear power, in addition to renewables and hydro. The second scenario, a fossil fuel-based scenario, is based on recent discoveries of proven natural gas reserves, possibly shifting Egypts vision towards more dependence on natural gas, as well as renewables, nuclear and hydro. These two scenarios might lead to increased amounts of released CO(2) into the atmosphere. Here we suggest a third scenario, the environmentally friendly scenario or the green scenario, in which more dependence is placed on renewables, hydro and nuclear power, in addition to natural gas, with no coal in the suggested energy mix. In this article, we analyze CO(2) emissions derived from electricity generation under these three futuristic scenarios. The results of our comparison show that building new power plants will lead to CO(2) emissions of 307, 330 and 128 million tons (Mt), respectively, according to the first, second and third scenario, respectively, compared to the current 100 Mt of emissions. These results clearly demonstrate that the third (green) scenario is the only scenario that allows the country to build new power plants to achieve its goals of development while only slightly increasing the amount of CO(2) emissions.

Methods: VPCD incidence rates in Europe were based on The Surveillance Atlas of Infectious Diseases by the ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control); vaccination schedules were based on ECDC reports. Results: The obligation to vaccinate was not universal, and it generally only applied to two preparations: the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and the one against polio. During the study, the situation associated with mumps did not change or improve in individual countries; the median incidence amounted to 30 cases. The median incidence associated with rubella amounted to 1 case, but in a few countries, it grew very rapidly, i.e., in Germany, Italy, and Romania; in Poland, the incidence was clearly decreasing, from 5923 to 1532 cases. The most dynamic situation concerned measles. The total median was 2.4 cases per 100,000 population; the only one country with falling incidence was Germany. The diseases associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis remained at a stable level in all analyzed countries. Conclusion: Vaccine schedules differ among the countries, so does the epidemiological situation of selected diseases. Morbidity on measles was the most disturbing phenomenon: the incidence rate increased in almost 40% of all countries, regardless of the obligation to vaccinate. The increasing incidence of VPCD may be due to anti-vaccine movements, the activity of which is often caused by mistrust and spreading misinformation.

Compared to those who do not have them, households with children tend to plan much more meals, spend more time eating, seek a healthier diet, increase the number of daily meals, and look more at labeling. In contrast, people who live alone have worsened the hourly routines of the main meals.

As an emerging powerful decentralized technique, blockchain has been explored to ensure data privacy and security in contact tracing processes. However, existing works are mostly high-level designs with no sufficient demonstration and treat blockchain as separate storage system assisting third-party central servers, ignoring the importance and capability of consensus mechanism and incentive mechanism. In this paper, we propose a light-weight and fully third-party free Blockchain-Driven Contact Tracing framework (BDCT) to bridge the gap. In the BDCT framework, RSA encryption based transaction verification method (RSA-TVM) is proposed to ensure contact tracing correctness, which can achieve more than 96\\\\% contact cases recording accuracy even each person has 60\\\\% probability of failing to verify the contact information. Reputation Corrected Delegated Proof of Stake (RC-DPoS) consensus mechanism is proposed together with the incentive mechanism, which can ensure timeliness of reporting contact cases and keep blockchain decentralized. A novel contact tracing simulation environment is created, which considers three different contact scenarios based on population density. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and attack resistance of RSA-TVM and RC-DPoS in the proposed BDCT.","output":"Blockchain Driven Privacy Preserving Contact Tracing Framework in Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of technology and social media among adolescents is an increasingly prevalent phenomenon. However, there is a paucity of evidence on the relationship between frequency of use of electronic devices and social media and sleep-onset difficulties among the Italian population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the association between the use of technology and social media, including Facebook and YouTube, and sleep-onset difficulties among adolescents from Lombardy, the most populous region in Italy. METHODS: The relationship between use of technology and social media and sleep-onset difficulties was investigated. Data came from the 2013-2014 wave of the Health Behavior in School-aged Children survey, a school-based cross-sectional study conducted on 3172 adolescents aged 11 to 15 years in Northern Italy. Information was collected on difficulties in falling asleep over the last 6 months. We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) for sleep-onset difficulties and corresponding 95% CIs using logistic regression models after adjustment for major potential confounders. RESULTS: The percentage of adolescents with sleep-onset difficulties was 34.3% (1081/3151) overall, 29.7% (483/1625) in boys and 39.2% (598/1526) in girls. It was 30.3% (356/1176) in 11-year-olds, 36.2% (389/1074) in 13-year-olds, and 37.3% (336/901) in 15-year-olds. Sleep-onset difficulties were more frequent among adolescents with higher use of electronic devices, for general use (OR 1.50 for highest vs lowest tertile of use; 95% CI 1.21-1.85), use for playing games (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.11-1.64), use of online social networks (OR 1.40 for always vs never or rarely; 95% CI 1.09-1.81), and YouTube (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.50-2.66). CONCLUSIONS: This study adds novel information about the relationship between sleep-onset difficulties and technology and social media in a representative sample of school-aged children from a geographical location that has not been included in studies of this type previously. Exposure to screen-based devices and online social media is significantly associated with adolescent sleep-onset difficulties. Interventions to create a well-coordinated parent- and school-centered strategy, thereby increasing awareness on the unfavorable effect of evolving technologies on sleep among adolescents, are needed.","output":"The Role of Technology and Social Media Use in Sleep-Onset Difficulties Among Italian Adolescents: Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Nigeria, family physicians are doctors with specialised training to manage a broad range of clinical conditions and pathologies when they first present, considering the psychosocial, economic, cultural and environmental context of the individual and his or her family. In Nigeria, family physicians may be found at district hospitals but are more likely to be located at tertiary health care facilities, where their roles in medical education, research and clinical services cannot be overemphasised. Many patients present to tertiary facilities with primary-care problems, bypassing primary and secondary care. They are often seen initially by family physicians in general outpatient clinics, where 70% of all problems are managed without referral to other specialists. These physicians are also in charge of most of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) clinics nationwide. They are thus the gatekeepers to the majority of tertiary hospital services.","output":"Contributions of family physicians to health care services in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic Ocular Diseases (COD) such as myopia, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and cataract can affect the eye and may even lead to severe vision impairment or blindness. According to a recent World Health Organization (WHO) report on vision, at least 2.2 billion individuals worldwide suffer from vision impairment. Often, overt signs indicative of COD do not manifest until the disease has progressed to an advanced stage. However, if COD is detected early, vision impairment can be avoided by early intervention and cost-effective treatment. Ophthalmologists are trained to detect COD by examining certain minute changes in the retina, such as microaneurysms, macular edema, hemorrhages, and alterations in the blood vessels. The range of eye conditions is diverse, and each of these conditions requires a unique patient-specific treatment. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in multi-disciplinary fields, including the detection of a variety of eye diseases. In this study, we combined several preprocessing approaches with convolutional neural networks to accurately detect COD in eye fundus images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a qualitative analysis of preprocessing approaches for COD classification using CNN models. Experimental results demonstrate that CNNs trained on the region of interest segmented images outperform the models trained on the original input images by a substantial margin. Additionally, an ensemble of three preprocessing techniques outperformed other state-of-the-art approaches by 30% and 3%, in terms of Kappa and F(1) scores, respectively. The developed prototype has been extensively tested and can be evaluated on more comprehensive COD datasets for deployment in the clinical setup.","output":"An empirical study of preprocessing techniques with convolutional neural networks for accurate detection of chronic ocular diseases using fundus images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reviews nasal structure and function in the light of intranasal pharmacotherapy.

We previously reported initial findings from a single centre prospective study evaluating antibody response after BNT162b2 vaccine, showing that adequate antibody response was achieved after two doses, but not after one, in patients with cancer vaccinated during anticancer therapy. Herein, we report a follow-up study, evaluating antibody response six months after the second vaccine dose. METHODS: The study included patients with solid tumours undergoing anticancer treatment, and immunocompetent health-care workers serving as controls. Serum titres of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG and neutralising antibodies (Nabs) were measured approximately six months after the second vaccine dose. Complete blood count values were collected and evaluated as predictors for antibody response. RESULTS: The analysis included 93 patients with cancer (66.7% metastatic). Six months after the second vaccine dose (mean 176  20 days), seropositivity rate among patients and controls was 83.9% versus 96.3% (p = 0.0001), respectively. Median RBD-IgG titre was lower among patients compared with controls (2.3 versus 3.2, p = 0.0002). Among seropositive individuals, median Nabs titre was similar between patients with cancer and controls (p = 0.566). Among patients with cancer, lymphocyte and neutrophil counts were not correlated with either RBD-IgG or Nabs titres. CONCLUSIONS: Seropositivity rates and RBD-IgG titre at six months after second BNT162b2 vaccine dose are lower among patients with cancer compared with healthy controls. However, Nabs titre is similar, suggesting a comparable protection among seropositive individuals. Lymphocyte count is not predictive of antibody response.","output":"Seropositivity and neutralising antibodies at six months after BNT162b2 vaccination in patients with solid tumours"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially stressed health care systems globally, subsequently reducing cancer care services and delaying treatments Pediatric populations infected by COVID-19 have shown mild clinical symptoms compared to adults, perhaps due to decreased susceptibility Several scientific societies and governments have released information on the management of patients with cancer, wherein they warn against exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest continuing treatment To determine the best diagnostic and therapeutic approach, multidisciplinary tumor boards should convene regularly, including through conference calls and telematics platforms A prompt diagnostic workup may reduce children's suffering and prevent loss of confidence in the health care system among parents Moreover, ensuring adequate support and information regarding measures for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in pediatric patients and their families is essential for avoiding panic and excessive stress, allowing early reporting of any suspected symptoms of cancer and, in turn, facilitating early diagnosis and prompt modulation of treatment ? 2021 The Author(s)","output":"Managing children with brain tumors during the COVID-19 era: Don't stop the care!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To overcome the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, transmission routes, such as healthcare worker infection, must be effectively prevented. Ultraviolet C (UVC) (254 nm) has recently been demonstrated to prevent environmental contamination by infected patients; however, studies on its application in contaminated hospital settings are limited. Herein, we explored the clinical application of UVC and determined its optimal dose. Environmental samples (n = 267) collected in 2021 were analyzed by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and subjected to UVC irradiation for different durations (minutes). We found that washbasins had a high contamination rate (45.5%). SARS-CoV-2 was inactivated after 15 min (estimated dose: 126 mJ/cm(2)) of UVC irradiation, and the contamination decreased from 41.7% before irradiation to 16.7%, 8.3%, and 0% after 5, 10, and 15 min of irradiation, respectively (p = 0.005). However, SARS-CoV-2 was still detected in washbasins after irradiation for 20 min but not after 30 min (252 mJ/cm(2)). Thus, 15 min of 254-nm UVC irradiation was effective in cleaning plastic, steel, and wood surfaces in the isolation ward. For silicon items, such as washbasins, 30 min was suggested; however, further studies using hospital environmental samples are needed to confirm the effective UVC inactivation of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Clinical Application of Ultraviolet C Inactivation of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in Contaminated Hospital Environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the early days of the pandemic, clinical biomarkers for COVID -19 have been investigated to predict patient mortality.

In this work, we highlighted the importance of the cohort made publicly available and complemented the findings by incorporating further evaluation. Results confirmed poor short-term prognosis to abnormal levels of some laboratorial indicators, such as LDH, CRP, lymphocytes, interleukin-6, and procalcitonin. In addition, our findings provide insights into COVID-19 research, such as key levels of fibrin degradation products, which are directly associated with the Dimerized plasmin fragment D and could indicate active coagulation and thrombosis.

the impact of AUD in HIV patients that were screened using the AUDIT self-administered questionnaire Methods All HIV patients undergoing outpatient care at the Beaumont Hospital HIV clinic were provided this self-administered AUDIT questionnaire as part of routine, check-in procedure by clinic staff starting on February 5, 2019 Scores were divided into At Risk or Not At Risk categories Men (aged 18-60) screened positive for at-risk drinking if they scored 8 or higher Men (older than 60) and women of all ages screened positive for at-risk drinking if they scored 4 or higher This categorization of risk was determined using the criteria established by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Analysis between groups was made using T-Tests, Chi-Square tests, and odds ratios (OR), with corresponding 95% Confidence Intervals Results A total of 121 HIV patients completed at least one AUDIT form There were a total of 157 patient encounters The mean age of At Risk
