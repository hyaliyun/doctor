We report a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia leading to ARDS and subsequent development of an alveolopleural fistula who was successfully treated with multiple endobronchial valves. Case: The Patient was a 55-year-old Hispanic male who presented with 2 days of dry cough and shortness of breath. Vital signs on admission showed an oxygen saturation of 68% on ambient air and respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. He was admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and found to have a positive SARS-Cov2 infection. Initial CT chest without contrast showed diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities. His oxygen requirement increased as well as his work of breathing requiring BiPAP, and subsequent intubation. On the 10th day of admission, he developed a right-sided pneumothorax, requiring chest tube placement. A tracheostomy was completed on day 14 for further ventilator weaning. On day 20, he developed persistent air leak concerning for an alveolopleural fistula, repeat CT chest concerning for a moderate-sized pneumothorax and findings concerning for post ARDS fibrotic lungs. He continued to have persistent air leak but was not deemed to be a surgical candidate hence he was referred for endobronchial valve placement to facilitate chest tube removal and ventilator weaning. Bronchoscopy was done on day 41 of admission. Total 6 endobronchial valves were placed (right middle and lower lobes). Over next few days his leak completely resolved. Patient was weaned off of positive pressure a week later to trach collar, and the chest tube was subsequently removed. Discussion: Alveolopleural fistula is a communication or fistula between a alveoli and the pleural space. Patient's with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 requiring high amounts of PEEP and are at higher risk in developing a pneumothorax. Endobronchial valves (EBV) have been used since 2005 to treat alveolopleural and bronchopleural fistula in patients who are not considered a good surgical candidate. This is the first documented use of an EBV in the setting of COVID-19 that we could find. The placement of the valves, allowed a significant reduction in the air leak. This assisted in the patient's breathing trials on the ventilator and tracheostomy collar trials by reducing the overall volume loss through the fistula, ultimately allowing the patient to successfully liberated from the ventilator and have his chest tubes removed.","output":"Use of endobronchial valve to treat covid-19 adult respiratory distress syndrome related alveolopleural fistula"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The rapid emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic globally collapsed health care organizations worldwide. Incomplete knowledge of best practices, progression of disease, and its impact could result in fallible care. Data on symptoms and advancement of the SARS-CoV-2 virus leading to critical care admission have not been captured or communicated well between international organizations experiencing the same impact from the virus. This led to the expedited need for establishing international communication and data collection on the critical care patients admitted with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Developing a global registry to collect patient data in the critical care setting was imperative with the goal of analyzing and ameliorating outcomes. METHODS: A prospective, observational global registry database was put together to record extensive deidentified clinical information for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. RESULTS: Project management was crucial for prompt implementation of the registry for synchronization, improving efficiency, increasing innovation, and fostering global collaboration for valuable data collection. The Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery VIRUS (Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study): COVID-19 Registry would compile data for crucial longitudinal outcomes for disease, treatment, and research. The agile project management approach expedited establishing the registry in 15 days and submission of institutional review board agreement for 250 participating sites. There has been enrollment of sites every month with a total of 306 sites from 28 countries and 64,114 patients enrolled (as of June 7, 2021). CONCLUSIONS: This protocol addresses project management lessons in a time of crises which can be a precept for rapid project management for a large-scale health care data registry. We aim to discuss the approach and methodology for establishing the registry, the challenges faced, and the factors contributing to successful outcomes.

Four hundred and fifty-nine patients with RD and their parents completed the present study, as well as 336 healthy peers. The age and gender of the children were similar across groups. Under 12 years of age, the trait anxiety of the children and the psychological symptoms of parents were similar across groups; while over 13 years of age, anxiety and depression scores of the parents, as well as trait anxiety of the children were higher than the control groups' (7.3  3.4 vs 6.3  3.8, p = 0.006 for parental anxiety; 6.6  3.8 vs. 5.3  3.9, p < 0.001 for parental depression; 36.1  8.7 vs. 33.3  7.9, p = 0.002 for child trait anxiety). In patient group, there were no differences in scale scores according to variables such as rheumatological disease diagnosis, the consulting of doctor for treatment, thinking that RD increases the risk of COVID-19, the history of rheumatic disease attack during the pandemic process, and the use of biological agents. The children's trait anxiety was positively correlated with their parents' anxiety (r = 0.414, p < 0.001) and depression (r = 0.300, p < 0.001) scores.

Although students are vulnerable to depression and suicidal ideation, few studies have been conducted in Uganda. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation, and associated factors among undergraduate university students in Uganda. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduates [N = 540; 363 males; mean age = 23.3 ( 2.64) years] recruited from four universities using an online questionnaire that explored sociodemographic factors, depression, and other associated factors. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression, and Item 9 was used to assess suicidal ideation in the past 2 weeks. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the factors associated with depression and suicidal ideation. RESULTS: The prevalence of moderate to severe depression was 20% (n = 108) (cut-off: 10/27 based on the PHQ-9), and the prevalence of past-2-week suicidal ideation was 13.89% (n = 75) (cut-off: 1/3 based on the PHQ-9 Item 9). About half of the individuals who screened positive for depression had suicidal ideation. Factors associated with depression were: having relationship issues [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13C2.81, p = 0.012], and having a history of sexual abuse (aOR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.10C3.84, p = 0.023). Factors associated with reducing the risk of depression were: satisfaction with current academic performance (aOR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.32C0.79, p = 0.003), and being in the fifth year of academic study (aOR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.03C0.73, p = 0.018). Factors associated with suicidal ideation were: smoking cigarettes and/or marijuana (aOR = 4.83, 95% CI = 1.10C21.12, p = 0.037), and having financial tuition constraints (aOR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.08C3.16, p = 0.024), However, satisfaction with current academic performance reduced the likelihood of suicidal ideation (aOR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.23C0.70, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Approximately one-fifth of undergraduate university students were moderately to severely depressed, especially those who had relationship issues and those with a history of sexual abuse. Suicidal ideation was common among smokers and those having financial tuition constraints. Therefore, it is recommended that the university authorities implement measures to provide psychological support for the students with problems concerning financial tuition constraints, relationships, and sexual abuse. Also, all students with depression should be screened for suicidality.","output":"Prevalence and Factors Associated With Depression and Suicidal Ideation During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among University Students in Uganda: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study assessed relationships of duration of family Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) participation with racial/ethnic disparities in child sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) and water intake.

Objective: to evaluate the level of unsupervised physical activity of breast cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the factors associated with difficulties in engaging and maintaining recommended physical activity levels. Methods: This is a cross-sectional epidemiological study with a sample of 37 breast cancer survivors. They participated in a canoeing training program (project Remama) at the University of S?o Paulo before the COVID-19 pandemic. Socioeconomic aspects, engagement in physical activity, motivation, and potential exposure to COVID-19 were investigated through an online survey, administered in September of 2020. Results: During the pandemic, participants increased their body weight (5  3.4 kg); 90% reported decreasing physical activity levels associated with increased sedentary time. Twenty-one (58%) participants exhibited some COVID-19-related symptoms, most used public transportation (59%), or returned to work during the period of a high incidence of COVID-19. The only factor associated with perceived difficulty in engaging in physical activities was having had more than three cancer treatments (RR: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.07C4.27). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a group of previously active breast cancer survivors to decrease their physical activity, gain weight, and have sedentary behavior.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in six healthcare facilities across NMBM between January 2020 and March 2020. Five hundred first-line healthcare professionals were recruited to respond to a validated self-administered questionnaire to collect demographic characteristics, self-confidence levels and knowledge of suicide assessment and associated factors. RESULTS: A total of 344 first-line health professionals completed the questionnaire (68.8% response rate); 40% of the respondents work in emergency units and 77.3% reported frequent encounters with patients who attempted suicide. Most participants had not received suicide assessment training during their undergraduate or postgraduate years (59.6% and 81.1%, respectively). They also lacked adequate knowledge and self-confidence in suicide assessment. Younger age, minimal work experience and attendance of two or more hours of suicide prevention training were associated with higher knowledge of suicide assessment.

DKA is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs, but can be prevented with appropriate management of diabetes. The FreeStyle Libre is flash glucose monitoring device that measures glucose levels in the interstitial subcutaneous tissue and has been shown to reduce HbA1c, time in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, as well as improve health-related quality of life. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and recurrent DKA and who initiated FreeStyle Libre (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA, USA) was conducted. DKA frequency and severity, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and frequency of blood glucose monitoring were compared between the 2-year period before FreeStyle Libre initiation and the 2-year period after FreeStyle Libre initiation. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients with T1DM with recurrent DKA were included. FreeStyle Libre was associated with a reduction in the frequency of DKA events, with a mean of 0.2 (standard deviation [SD] 0.4) events per person during the 2 years after FreeStyle Libre initiation versus 2.9 (SD 0.9) during the 2 years before FreeStyle Libre initiation. Severity of DKA events was also reduced, with fewer severe (before mean 0.3 [SD 0.5] versus after 0.0 [SD 0.0]; p < 0.001) DKA events. A reduction in HbA1c (mean 7.4% [SD 0.5] after versus 9.9% [SD 1.2] before [p < 0.001]) and an increase in frequency of blood glucose testing (mean 8.1 scans/day [SD 1.7] after versus 2.2 finger-pricks/day [SD 0.7] at before [p < 0.001]) were also observed. CONCLUSION: FreeStyle Libre is associated with a reduction in the frequency and severity of DKA events, reduction in HbA1c, and increase in frequency of blood glucose testing in patients with T1DM and recurrent DKA. The use of such a glucose monitoring tool can help to reduce the burden of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with complications of diabetes.","output":"Frequency of Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using FreeStyle Libre: A Retrospective Chart Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the outbreak of what would become the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing measures were quickly introduced across East Asia-including drastic shelter-in-place orders in some cities-drawing on experience with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) almost two decades ago. \\"Smart City\\" technologies and other digital tools were quickly deployed for infection control purposes, ranging from conventional thermal scanning cameras to digital tracing in the surveillance of at-risk individuals.

DATA EXTRACTION A single reviewer extracted data from the included publications and a second reviewer completed cross-checking. Qualitative data were extracted in five categories relating to the key factors influencing delivery of early mobilization to critically ill patients. DATA SYNTHESIS Methodological quality was appraised using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II scores for applicability were low. Median quality scores for editorial independence, rigor of development, and stakeholder engagement were also poor. Narrative synthesis of publication content was undertaken. All publications supported implementation of early mobilization. Most documents agreed upon seven topics: 1) early mobilization is safe and may reduce healthcare costs, 2) safety criteria should be provided, 3) a protocolized or structured approach should be used, 4) collaborative teamwork is required, 5) staff require specific skills or experience, 6) patient and family engagement is important, and 7) program evaluation and outcome measurement are a key component of implementation. There was no consensus on dosage and patient selection. The areas of team culture and leadership were poorly addressed. CONCLUSIONS Despite significant variation in the methodological quality of clinical practice guidelines for early mobilization, there were important consistencies in recommendations internationally.

Search terms were generated by members of the multidisciplinary research team, and combined with work outcome, future- and change-related and vulnerable worker search terms. Six search portals were used to uncover peer reviewed and gray literature across diverse disciplines. Search terms were also entered into Twitters standard search interface to identify social media resources. Literature was screened for eligibility (i.e., English language, documented a change in the nature of work, industrialized context and description of impact to vulnerable workers). Each relevant article was synthesized, and trend categories were developed by through iterative discussions among the research team. Results: . An initial search yielded 4,800 articles after removing duplicates. Following a title and abstract relevancy screen, 3,195 articles were excluded. A total of 342 articles were fully reviewed. A synthesis of articles found nine trend categories which included digital transformation of the economy, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML)-enhanced automation, AI-enabled human resource management systems, skill requirements for the future of work;globalization 2.0, climate change and the green economy, Gen Zs and the work environment;populism and the future of work, and external shocks to accelerate the changing nature of work (The COVID-19 example).

This study examines the host tissue response to a new cyanoacrylate (CA) adhesive (n-octyl, OCA). Partial defects (3  5 cm) created in the rabbit anterior abdominal wall were repaired by mesh fixation using OCA, Glubran2?(n-butyl-CA), Ifabond?(n-hexyl-CA) or sutures. Samples were obtained at 14/90 days for morphology, collagens qRT-PCR/immunofluorescence and biomechanical studies. All meshes were successfully fixed. Seroma was detected mainly in the Glubran group at 14 days. Meshes fixed using all methods showed good host tissue incorporation. No signs of degradation of any of the adhesives were observed. At 14 days, collagen 1 and 3 mRNA expression levels were greater in the suture and OCA groups, and lower in Ifabond, with levels varying significantly in the latter group with respect to the others. By 90 days, expression levels had fallen in all groups, except for collagen 3 mRNA in Ifabond. Collagen I and III protein expression was marked in the suture and OCA groups at 90 days, but lower in Ifabond at both time points. Tensile strengths were similar across groups. Our findings indicate the similar behavior of the adhesives to sutures in terms of good tissue incorporation of the meshes and optimal repair zone strength. The lower seroma rate and similar collagenization to controls induced by OCA suggests its improved behavior over the other two glues. This article deals with a preclinical study to examine different aspects of the repair process in the host of three alkyl cyanoacrylates (n-butyl (GLUBRAN 2), n-hexyl (IFABOND), and n-octyl cyanoacrylate (EVOBOND)) compared to sutures (control), in the fixation of surgical meshes for hernia repair.

Previously we reported on an image-based tool to noninvasively measure absolute myocardial blood flow at locations just below individual epicardial vessel to help guide revascularization. The aim of this work is to determine the robustness of vessel-specific flow measurements (MBFvs) extracted from the fusion of dynamic PET (dPET) with coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) myocardial segmentations, using flow measured from the fusion with CCTA manual segmentation as the reference standard. METHODS: Forty-three patients' 13NH3 dPET, CCTA image datasets were used to measure the agreement of the MBFvs profiles after the fusion of dPET data with three CCTA anatomical models: (1) a manual model, (2) a fully automated segmented model and (3) a corrected model, where major inaccuracies in the automated segmentation were briefly edited. Pairwise accuracy of the normality/abnormality agreement of flow values along differently extracted vessels was determined by comparing, on a point-by-point basis, each vessel's flow to corresponding vessels' normal limits using Dice coefficients (DC) as the metric. RESULTS: Of the 43 patients CCTA fully automated mask models, 27 patients' borders required manual correction before dPET/CCTA image fusion, but this editing process was brief (2-3 min) allowing a 100% success rate of extracting MBFvs in clinically acceptable times. In total, 124 vessels were analyzed after dPET fusion with the manual and corrected CCTA mask models yielding 2225 stress and 2122 rest flow values. Forty-seven vessels were analyzed after fusion with the fully automatic masks producing 840 stress and 825 rest flow samples. All DC coefficients computed globally or by territory were  0.93. No statistical differences were found in the normal/abnormal flow classifications between manual and corrected or manual and fully automated CCTA masks. CONCLUSION: Fully automated and manually corrected myocardial CCTA segmentation provides anatomical masks in clinically acceptable times for vessel-specific myocardial blood flow measurements using dynamic PET/CCTA image fusion which are not significantly different in flow accuracy and within clinically acceptable processing times compared to fully manually segmented CCTA myocardial masks.","output":"Clinically viable myocardial CCTA segmentation for measuring vessel-specific myocardial blood flow from dynamic PET/CCTA hybrid fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic in March 2020.

It is under investigation as a therapeutic agent in sickle cell anemia and in conditions where pulmonary oxygen uptake is deteriorated or limited (e.g., various clinical conditions or altitude exposure). The combination of 5-HMF and -ketoglutaric acid (KG) is commercially available as a nutritional supplement. To further elucidate dose effects, ODCs were measured in vitro in venous whole blood samples of 20 healthy volunteers (10 female and 10 male) after the addition of three different doses of 5-HMF, KG and the combination of both. Linear regression analysis revealed a strong dose-dependent increase in HbCO(2) affinity for 5-HMF (R(2) = 0.887; p < 0.001) and the commercially available combination with KG (R(2) = 0.882; p < 0.001). KG alone increased HbCO(2) affinity as well but to a lower extent. Both the combination (5-HMF + KG) and 5-HMF alone exerted different P50 and Hill coefficient responses overall and between sexes, with more pronounced effects in females. With increasing HbCO(2) affinity, the sigmoidal shape of the ODC was better preserved by the combination of 5-HMF and KG than by 5-HMF alone. Concerning the therapeutic effects of 5-HMF, this study emphasizes the importance of adequate dosing in various physiological and clinical conditions, where a left-shifted ODC might be beneficial. By preserving the sigmoidal shape of the ODC, the combination of 5-HMF and KG at low (both sexes) and medium (males only) doses might be able to better maintain efficient oxygen transport, particularly by mitigating potentially deteriorated oxygen unloading in the tissue.

Thirty semistructured telephone interviews with parents of children between 4 and 18 years. RESULTS: We found four themes relating to symptom attribution ('normalising symptoms', 'err on the side of caution', 'experience of temperature', 'symptoms not normal for us'). In general, parents were more likely to attribute symptoms to COVID-19 if a temperature was present or the symptoms were perceived as 'unusual' for their family. Four themes relating to self-isolation ('difficult to prevent contact with children', 'isolation would be no different to lockdown life', 'ability to get food and supplies', 'limited space'). Parents believed they would find isolation within the household difficult or impossible if they had dependent children, had limited space or could not shop for groceries. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight complexities in symptom perception, attribution and household isolation. We suggest that they can be overcome by (a) providing better guidance on what symptoms require action, (b) providing guidance as to how to prevent infection within the household and (c) by supporting families with grocery shopping through a potential second or third wave.","output":"Parental perceptions of COVID-19-like illness in their children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Smartphone magnetometer readings exhibit high linear correlation when two phones coexist within a short distance.

A considerable number of complications after anastomosis of the colon and rectum can be noticed and the colonic obstruction has been as one of the main factors. OBJECTIVE: Study the anastomotic healing in the colon of rats after intestinal obstruction. METHODS: The animals (n=39) were divided in: Group I (submitted to intestinal obstruction induced four days before of the anastomoses, n=22) and Group II (Controls, n=22). The colonic anastomosis were made by a standardized technique and, seven days later, the segments which them were reviewed, resected and analyzed for a hydroxyproline dosage. RESULTS: The complications were more usual in the animals with obstruction (11 rats: 50%) than in the controls (3 rats: 17,7%), p 0,05. The median value of hydroxyproline was higher in the Group I (975,0 x 872,0), p>0,05. CONCLUSION: The anastomosis in the rat's colon with intestinal obstruction is related to more complications. This can be explained by the following factor's: more technical difficulty in the preparation of the anastomosis caused by different diameter of the bowel, higher undernourishment, proximal faecal retention, bacterial translocation and ischaemia. The statistical similarity between the groups regarding to the dosage of hydroxyproline suggests that the healing of the rats' colonic anastomosis with intestinal obstruction, in the absence of complications, follows the same process of collagen synthesis as the controls ones.","output":"Cicatrizao de anastomoses col?nicas na vigncia de obstruo intestinal: Estudo experimental em ratos"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) results in increased inflammatory markers previously associated with atrial arrhythmias. However, little is known about their incidence or specificity in COVID-19, or their association with outcomes. We determined the incidence, predictors and outcomes of atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF/AFL) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, or hospitalized with Influenza. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of 3,970 patients admitted with PCR-positive COVID-19 between 2/4/2020-4/22/2020 with manual review performed of 1,110. The comparator arm included 1,420 patients with influenza hospitalized between 1/1/2017-1/1/2020. Results Among 3970 inpatients with COVID-19, the incidence of AF/AFL was 10% (N=375) and in patients without a history of atrial arrhythmias, 4% (N=146). Patients with new-onset AF/AFL were older with increased inflammatory markers including Interleukin-6 (93 vs 68 pg/ml, P<0.01), and more myocardial injury (Troponin-I: 0.2 vs 0.06ng/ml, P<0.01). AF/AFL were associated with increased mortality (46% vs 26%, P<0.01). Manual review captured a somewhat higher incidence of AF/AFL (13%, N=140). Compared to inpatients with COVID-19, patients with Influenza (N=1420) had similar rates of AF/AFL (12%, n=163) but lower mortality. The presence of AF/AFL correlated with similarly increased mortality in both COVID-19 (RR 1.77) and Influenza (RR 1.78). Conclusions AF/AFL occurs in a subset of patients hospitalized with either COVID-19 or Influenza, and is associated with inflammation and disease severity in both infections. The incidence and associated increase in mortality in both cohorts suggests that AF/AFL in not specific to COVID-19, but is rather a generalized response to the systemic inflammation of severe viral illnesses.","output":"Atrial Fibrillation in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19: Incidence, Predictors, Outcomes and Comparison to Influenza"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"GSK983, a novel tetrahydrocarbazole, inhibits the replication of a variety of unrelated viruses in vitro with EC(50) values of 5C20 nM.

To reduce introduction of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the state of Alaska implemented a program on June 6, 2020, for arriving air, sea, and road travelers that required either molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or a 14-day self-quarantine after arrival. The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) used weekly standardized reports submitted by 10 participating Alaska airports to evaluate air traveler choices to undergo testing or self-quarantine, traveler test results, and airport personnel experiences while implementing the program. Among 386,435 air travelers who arrived in Alaska during June 6-November 14, 2020, a total of 184,438 (48%) chose to be tested within 72 hours before arrival, 111,370 (29%) chose to be tested on arrival, and 39,685 (10%) chose to self-quarantine without testing after arrival. An additional 15,112 persons received testing at airport testing sites; these were primarily travelers obtaining a second test 7-14 days after arrival, per state guidance. Of the 126,482 airport tests performed in Alaska, 951 (0.8%) results were positive, or one per 406 arriving travelers. Airport testing program administrators reported that clear communication, preparation, and organization were vital for operational success; challenges included managing travelers' expectations and ensuring that sufficient personnel and physical space were available to conduct testing. Expected mitigation measures such as vaccination, physical distancing, mask wearing, and avoidance of gatherings after arrival might also help limit postarrival transmission. Posttravel self-quarantine and testing programs might reduce travel-associated SARS-CoV-2 transmission and importation, even without enforcement.

The operational benefits, however, have been less explored. Here, we report our initial clinical experience in implementing fast MRI techniques for outpatient brain imaging during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Aggregate acquisition times were extracted from the medical record on consecutive imaging examinations performed during matched pre-implementation (7/1/2019-12/31/2019) and post-implementation periods (7/1/2020-12/31/2020). Expected acquisition time reduction for each MRI protocol was calculated through manual collection of acquisition times for the conventional and accelerated sequences performed during the pre- and post-implementation periods. Aggregate and expected acquisition times were compared for the five most frequently performed brain MRI protocols: brain without contrast (BR-), brain with and without contrast (BR+), multiple sclerosis (MS), memory loss (MML), and epilepsy (EPL). RESULTS: The expected time reductions for BR-, BR+, MS, MML, and EPL protocols were 6.6 min, 11.9 min, 14 min, 10.8 min, and 14.1 min, respectively. The overall median aggregate acquisition time was 31 [25, 36] min for the pre-implementation period and 18 [15, 22] min for the post-implementation period, with a difference of 13 min (42%). The median acquisition time was reduced by 4 min (25%) for BR-, 14.0 min (44%) for BR+, 14 min (38%) for MS, 11 min (52%) for MML, and 16 min (35%) for EPL.

In this study, we analysed a broad range of socioeconomic indicators in relation to hospitalised cases in the Paris area. METHODS We extracted 303 socioeconomic indicators from French census data for 855 residential units in Paris and assessed their association with COVID-19 hospitalisation risk. FINDINGS The indicators most associated with hospitalisation risk were the third decile of population income (OR=9.10, 95% CI 4.98 to 18.39), followed by the primary residence rate (OR=5.87, 95% CI 3.46 to 10.61), rate of active workers in unskilled occupations (OR=5.04, 95% CI 3.03 to 8.85) and rate of women over 15 years old with no diploma (OR=5.04, 95% CI 3.03 to 8.85). Of note, population demographics were considerably less associated with hospitalisation risk. Among these indicators, the rate of women aged between 45 and 59 years (OR=2.17, 95% CI 1.40 to 3.44) exhibited the greatest level of association, whereas population density was not associated. Overall, 86% of COVID-19 hospitalised cases occurred within the 45% most deprived areas.

The quality of the sequence data obtained from these genotyping efforts depends on several factors, including the quantity/integrity of the input material, the technology, and laboratory-specific implementation. The current lack of guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 genotyping leads to inclusion of error-containing genome sequences in genomic epidemiology studies. We aimed to establish clear and broadly applicable recommendations for reliable virus genotyping. METHODS: We established and used a sequencing data analysis workflow that reliably identifies and removes technical artefacts;such artefacts can result in miscalls when using alternative pipelines to process clinical samples and synthetic viral genomes with an amplicon-based genotyping approach. We evaluated the impact of experimental factors, including viral load and sequencing depth, on correct sequence determination. RESULTS: We found that at least 1000 viral genomes are necessary to confidently detect variants in the SARS-CoV-2 genome at frequencies of &gt;=10%. The broad applicability of our recommendations was validated in over 200 clinical samples from six independent laboratories.

Antiviral tests in vitro are generally performed in Vero-B4 cells, a well characterised cell line derived from the kidney of an African green monkey. In this work we characterised a CHIKV patient isolate from Brazil (CHIKV(Brazil)) with regard to cell affinity, infectivity, propagation and cell damage and compared it with a high-passage lab strain (CHIKV(Ross)). Infecting various cell lines (Vero-B4, A549, Huh-7, DBTRG, U251, and U138) with both virus strains, we found distinct differences between the two viruses. CHIKV(Brazil) does not cause cytopathic effects (CPE) in the human hepatocarcinoma cell line Huh-7. Neither CHIKV(Brazil) nor CHIKV(Ross) caused CPE on A549 human lung epithelial cells.

Several studies have linked ZIKV infection in pregnant women with the development of microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities, emphasizing the need for a safe and effective vaccine to combat the spread of this disease. Preclinical studies and vaccine development efforts have largely focused on the role of humoral immunity in disease protection. Consequently, relatively little is known in regard to cellular immunity against ZIKV, although an effective vaccine will likely need to engage both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system. To that end, we utilized two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to identify 90 ZIKV peptides that were naturally processed and presented on HLA class I and II molecules (HLA-A*02:01/HLA-DRB1*04:01) of an immortalized B cell line infected with ZIKV (strain PRVABC59).

Most of the therapeutic antibodies are ineffective against the omicron variant, and double immunization with BioNTech-Pfizer (BNT162b2) might not adequately protect against severe disease induced by omicron B.1.1.529. So far, no efficient antiviral drugs are available against omicron. The present study identified the promising inhibitors from seaweeds bioactive compounds to inhibit the omicron variant B.1.1.529. We have also compared the seaweeds compounds with the standard drugs ceftriaxone and cefuroxime, which were suggested as beneficial antiviral drugs in COVID-19 treatment. Our molecular docking analysis revealed that caffeic acid hexoside (?6.4 kcal/mol; RMSD = 2.382 ?) and phloretin (?6.3 kcal/mol; RMSD = 0.061 ?) from Sargassum wightii (S. wightii) showed the inhibitory effect against the crucial residues ASN417, SER496, TYR501, and HIS505, which are supported for the inviolable omicron and angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor interaction. Cholestan-3-ol, 2-methylene-, (3beta, 5 alpha) (CMBA) (?6.0 kcal/mol; RMSD = 3.074 ?) from Corallina officinalis (C. officinalis) manifested the strong inhibitory effect against the omicron RBD mutated residues LEU452 and ALA484, was magnificently observed as the essential residues in Indian delta variant B.1.617.2 previously. The standard drugs (ceftriaxone and cefuroxime) showed no or less inhibitory effect against RBD of omicron B.1.1.529.

The results could be used to develop potent seaweed-based antiviral drugs and/or dietary supplements to treat omicron B.1.1529-infected patients.","output":"In Silico Screening of Bioactive Compounds of Representative Seaweeds to Inhibit SARS-CoV-2 ACE2-Bound Omicron B.1.1.529 Spike Protein Trimer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To investigate the feasibility and safety of solo surgery with single-port laparoscopic appendectomy, which is termed herein solo-SPLA (solo-single-port laparoscopic appendectomy). METHODS This study prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed data from patients who had undergone either non-solo-SPLA (n = 150) or solo-SPLA (n = 150). Several devices were utilized for complete, skin-to-skin solo-SPSA, including a Lone Star Retractor System and an adjustable mechanical camera holder. RESULTS Operating times were not significantly different between solo- and non-solo-SPLA (45.0  21.0 minutes vs. 46.7  26.1 minutes, P = 0.646). Most postoperative variables were also comparable between groups, including the necessity for intravenous analgesics (0.7  1.2 ampules [solo-SPLA] vs. 0.9  1.5 ampules [non-solo-SPLA], P = 0.092), time interval to gas passing (1.3  1.0 days vs. 1.4  1.0 days, P = 0.182), and the incidence of postoperative complications (4.0% vs. 8.7%, P = 0.153). Moreover, solo-SPLA effectively lowered the operating cost by reducing surgical personnel expenses. CONCLUSION Solo-SPLA economized staff numbers and thus lowered hospital costs without lengthening of operating time. Therefore, solo-SPLA could be considered a safe and feasible alternative to non-solo-SPLA.","output":"The feasibility of single-port laparoscopic appendectomy using a solo approach: a comparative study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent decades, the use of engineered nanoparticles has been increasing in various sectors, including biomedicine, diagnosis, water treatment, and environmental remediation leading to significant public concerns.

The manuscript explores radiomics approaches in different fields of neoadjuvant radiotherapy, including esophageal cancer, lung cancer, sarcoma and rectal cancer in order to shed a light in the setting of neoadjuvant radiotherapy that can be used to tailor the best subsequent therapeutical strategy. ABSTRACT: Introduction: Neoadjuvant radiotherapy is currently used mainly in locally advanced rectal cancer and sarcoma and in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer and esophageal cancer, whereas in other diseases it is under investigation. The evaluation of the efficacy of the induction strategy is made possible by performing imaging investigations before and after the neoadjuvant therapy and is usually challenging. In the last decade, texture analysis (TA) has been developed to help the radiologist to quantify and identify the parameters related to tumor heterogeneity, which cannot be appreciated by the naked eye. The aim of this narrative is to review the impact of TA on the prediction of response to neoadjuvant radiotherapy and or chemoradiotherapy. Materials and Methods: Key references were derived from a PubMed query. Hand searching and ClinicalTrials.gov were also used. Results: This paper contains a narrative report and a critical discussion of radiomics approaches in different fields of neoadjuvant radiotherapy, including esophageal cancer, lung cancer, sarcoma, and rectal cancer. Conclusions: Radiomics can shed a light on the setting of neoadjuvant therapies that can be used to tailor subsequent approaches or even to avoid surgery in the future.

However, the population of patients with COVID who are admitted with false negative testing is unstudied. OBJECTIVE: To characterize and develop a model to predict true SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients who initially test negative for COVID by PCR. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Five hospitals within the Yale New Haven Health System between 3/10/2020 and 9/1/2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients who received diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus within the first 96 hours of hospitalization. EXPOSURE: We developed a logistic regression model from readily available electronic health record data to predict SARS-CoV-2 positivity in patients who were positive for COVID and those who were negative and never retested. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This model was applied to patients testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 who were retested within the first 96 hours of hospitalization. We evaluated the ability of the model to discriminate between patients who would subsequently retest negative and those who would subsequently retest positive. RESULTS: We included 31,459 hospitalized adult patients; 2,666 of these patients tested positive for COVID and 3,511 initially tested negative for COVID and were retested. Of the patients who were retested, 61 (1.7%) had a subsequent positive COVID test. The model showed that higher age, vital sign abnormalities, and lower white blood cell count served as strong predictors for COVID positivity in these patients. The model had moderate performance to predict which patients would retest positive with a test set area under the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) of 0.76 (95% CI 0.70C0.83). Using a cutpoint for our risk prediction model at the 90(th) percentile for probability, we were able to capture 35/61 (57%) of the patients who would retest positive. This cutpoint amounts to a number-needed-to-retest range between 15 and 77 patients. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: We show that a pragmatic model can predict which patients should be retested for COVID. Further research is required to determine if this risk model can be applied prospectively in hospitalized patients to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"Predicting patients with false negative SARS-CoV-2 testing at hospital admission: A retrospective multi-center study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines the major advances and obstacles in the field of HIV vaccine research as they pertain to informing the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study included 369 adults from Western Mxico with diagnosis or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two samples were collected; a naso-oropharyngeal was used for a molecular determination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The molecular analysis was carried out using DeCoV19 Kit Triplex (Genes2life S.A.P.I.) based on the CDC diagnostic panel for N1, N2, and N3 regions. The second sample was retrieved from a nasopharyngeal rub and used for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 antigen employing the commercial STANDARD&#8482; Q COVID-19 Ag Test (SD BIOSENSOR).

Due to their features, siRNAs can provide a potential strategy to interfere with the replication of viral diseases. We think that since oral and nasal epithelial cells are relatively easily accessible it may allow to develop siRNA molecules to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 already at the entry where it continues to replicate for a period (Fig. 1, Ref. 50).","output":"Potential therapeutic road for targeting the SARS-CoV-2 at throat."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disease registry systems provide a strong information infrastructure for decision-making and research.

The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is highly infectious, thus requiring additional measures during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Since CPR is a highly aerosol-generating procedure, it carries a substantial risk of viral transmission. We hypothesized that patients with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 might have worse outcomes following OHCA outcomes compared to non-COVID-19 patients. To raise awareness of this potential problem, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that reported OHCA in the pandemic period, comparing COVID-19 suspected or diagnosed patients vs. COVID-19 not suspected or diagnosed group. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge (SHD). Secondary outcomes were the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to hospital admission or survival with favorable neurological outcomes. Data including 4210 patients included in five studies were analyzed. SHD in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were 0.5% and 2.6%, respectively (odds ratio, OR = 0.25; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.12, 0.53; p < 0.001). Bystander CPR rate was comparable in the COVID-19 vs. not COVID-19 group (OR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.22; p = 0.43). Shockable rhythms were observed in 5.7% in COVID-19 patients compared with 37.4% in the non-COVID-19 group (OR = 0.19; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.96; p = 0.04; I2 = 95%). ROSC in the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were 13.3% vs. 26.5%, respectively (OR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.81; p < 0.001).

Our meta-analysis suggests that suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 reduces the SHD rate after OHCA, which seems to be due to the lower rate of shockable rhythms in COVID-19 patients, but not due to reluctance to bystander CPR. Future trials are needed to confirm these preliminary results and determine the optimal procedures to increase survival after OHCA in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Survival Rate: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hospitalization is common among older adults.

We demonstrated in the past that volatile anesthetics such as sevoflurane attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury during liver resection. In this randomized study, we examined if volatile anesthetics have an effect on acute graft injury and clinical outcomes after liver transplantation. METHODS Cadaveric liver transplant recipients were enrolled from January 2009 to September 2012 at 3 University Centers (Zurich/Sao Paulo/Ghent). Recipients were randomly assigned to propofol (control group) or sevoflurane anesthesia. Postoperative peak of aspartate transaminase was defined as primary endpoint, secondary endpoints were early allograft dysfunction, in-hospital complications, intensive care unit, and hospital stay. RESULTS Ninety-eight recipients were randomized to propofol (n = 48) or sevoflurane (n = 50). Median peak aspartate transaminase after transplantation was 925 (interquartile range, 512-3274) in the propofol and 1097 (interquartile range, 540-2633) in the sevoflurane group. In the propofol arm, 11 patients (23%) experienced early allograft dysfunction, 7 (14%) in the sevoflurane one (odds ratio, 0.64 (0.20 to 2.02, P = 0.45). There were 4 mortalities (8.3%) in the propofol and 2 (4.0%) in the sevoflurane group. Overall and major complication rates were not different. An effect on clinical outcomes was observed favoring the sevoflurane group (less severe complications), but without significance. CONCLUSIONS This first multicenter trial comparing propofol with sevoflurane anesthesia in liver transplantation shows no difference in biochemical markers of acute organ injury and clinical outcomes between the 2 regimens.

Recently, we have shown that poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticle-entrapped inactivated PRRSV vaccine (NP-KAg) induces a cross-protective immune response in pigs. To further improve its cross-protective efficacy, the NP-KAg vaccine formulation was slightly modified, and pigs were coadministered the vaccine twice intranasally with a potent adjuvant: Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole-cell lysate. In vaccinated virulent heterologous PRRSV-challenged pigs, the immune correlates in the blood were as follows: 1) enhanced PRRSV-specific antibody response with enhanced avidity of both immunoglobulin (Ig)-G and IgA isotypes, associated with augmented virus-neutralizing antibody titers; 2) comparable and increased levels of virus-specific IgG(1) and IgG(2) antibody subtypes and production of high levels of both T-helper (Th)-1 and Th2 cytokines, indicative of a balanced Th1CTh2 response; 3) suppressed immunosuppressive cytokine response; 4) increased frequency of interferon-(+) lymphocyte subsets and expanded population of antigen-presenting cells; and most importantly 5) complete clearance of detectable replicating challenged heterologous PRRSV and close to threefold reduction in viral ribonucleic acid load detected in the blood. In conclusion, intranasal delivery of adjuvanted NP-KAg vaccine formulation to growing pigs elicited a broadly cross-protective immune response, showing the potential of this innovative vaccination strategy to prevent PRRS outbreaks in pigs.

Our study investigates the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among staff at primary healthcare institutions in Prishtina, and factors associated with seroprevalence. METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional survey including SARS-CoV-2 serological testing and questionnaires with primary healthcare workers from primary healthcare facilities in the Prishtina, the capital city of Kosovo. We calculated prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and of self-reported positive PCR test among primary healthcare workers, as well as crude and adjusted ORs for explanatory factors. RESULTS: Eighty-three of the healthcare workers (17.47%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies IgG or IgM, while 231 (48.63%) either had antibodies or a previous positive PCR test. Odds of seropositivity were affected by male gender (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.20, 3.61), and infected family members (OR 3.61, 95% CI 2.25, 5.79) of healthcare workers. Higher education, being part of larger families and having infected family members gave higher odds of positive PCR test and seropositivity. Other healthcare workers had lower odds of positive PCR test and seropositivity than physicians. CONCLUSION: Over 17% of healthcare workers were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and close to half of them were either seropositive or PCR self-reported positive test. Several factors are associated with decreased and increased odds for such outcomes.

Herein we report a Japanese patient with iMCD with a novel heterozygous Ile729Met mutation in exon 10 of the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene. METHODS: We performed genetic analysis via targeted next-generation sequencing analysis and Sanger sequencing and conducted molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the hydrophobic interactions around the 729th amino acid in human pyrin. RESULTS: In February 2011, a 59-year-old man was diagnosed with IgG4-related disease at our department based on the findings of cervical and hilar lymphadenopathies, typical lung lesions and cervical lymph node biopsy. The patient was followed up without treatment, as he was asymptomatic. However, he had been experiencing prolonged fatigue and fever with high levels of CRP since June 2017. Axillary lymph node biopsy findings led to the diagnosis of iMCD. He was successfully treated with an IL-6 inhibitor and has been in remission for 12 months. Genetic analyses for hereditary autoinflammatory disease-related genes were performed, revealing a novel heterozygous Ile729Met mutation in exon 10 of the MEFV gene. We identified that this novel mutation significantly altered the local interaction of the human pyrin B30.2 domain by molecular dynamics simulation analysis and experimentally had the potential for inflammasome activation with increased inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: The abnormal function of pyrin due to a mutation in the MEFV gene in this patient may have contributed to the development of MCD by inducing IL-6 production via inflammasome signalling.","output":"Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease with novel heterozygous Ile729Met mutation in exon 10 of familial Mediterranean fever gene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Probabilistic forecasts play an indispensable role in answering questions about the spread of newly emerged pathogens.

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study using a panel sample of internet users selected from the general population living in Germany. Responses to a survey with 28 items were collected using computer-assisted telephone interviews conducted in October 2020. The items were divided into four topics: (1) general attitudes toward digitization, (2) COVID-19 pandemic, (3) physical activity, and (4) perceived digital health (eHealth) literacy measured with the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS; sum score of 8=lowest to 40=highest perceived eHealth literacy). The data were analyzed in IBM-SPSS24 using relative frequencies. Three univariate multiple regression analyses (linear or binary logistic) were performed to investigate the associations among the sociodemographic factors (age, gender, education, and household income) and digital technology use. RESULTS: The participants included 1014 internet users (n=528, 52.07% women) aged 14 to 93 years (mean 54, SD 17). Among all participants, 66.47% (674/1014) completed up to tertiary (primary and secondary) education and 45.07% (457/1017) reported a household income of up to 3500 Euro/month (1 Euro=US $1.18). Over half (579/1014, 57.10%) reported having used digital technologies for health-related purposes. The majority (898/1014, 88.56%) noted that digitization will be important for therapy and health care, in the future. Only 25.64% (260/1014) reported interest in smartphone apps for health promotion/prevention and 42.70% (433/1014) downloaded the COVID-19 contact-tracing app. Although 52.47% (532/1014) reported that they come across inaccurate digital information on the COVID-19 pandemic, 78.01% (791/1014) were confident in their ability to recognize such inaccurate information. Among those who use digital technologies for moderate physical activity (n=220), 187 (85.0%) found such technologies easy to use and 140 (63.6%) reported using them regularly (at least once a week). Although the perceived eHealth literacy was high (eHEALS mean score 31 points, SD 6), less than half (43.10%, 400/928) were confident in using digital information for health decisions. The use of digital technologies for health was associated with higher household income (odds ratio [OR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.11-1.47). The use of digital technologies for physical activity was associated with younger age (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.94-0.96) and more education (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.46). A higher perceived eHealth literacy score was associated with younger age (=C.22, P<.001), higher household income (=.21, P<.001), and more education (=.14, P<.001).

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by WHO. Most patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibited symptoms of fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and shortness of breath. Many infected people may be asymptomatic. It is generally believed that airway exposure to respiratory droplets from an infected patient is the main transmission route of this disease. However, apart from respiratory source, other source specimens like faecal matter and urine could be possible for COVID-19 infectivity. The spreading other routes of the virus has been alarming sign, both for public and health care professionals.

Mass media campaigns have been used in several countries to reduce this trend. The objectives of this systematic review were to identify, critically appraise and synthesise the findings, including the barriers and enablers, of mass media campaigns directed at lay people to reduce unnecessary CS. Methods We included any study design that reported health communication mass media campaigns directed at lay people with the specific objective of reducing unnecessary CS, created by any agent, in any format. We searched seven electronic databases without language restrictions, from inception to February 2019. Experts in the field were contacted. Results The search yielded 14 320 citations; 50 were selected for full-text reading; and one was included. Six other reports were included. The seven campaigns were conducted in 2009-2017, mostly in Latin America. Most campaigns were independent efforts by non-governmental or activist organisations. Only one campaign conducted formative research and pretested the intervention. All campaigns used indirect communication, mostly through internet channels; two campaigns also used direct communication with the public. None assessed their effects on CS rates. Only two campaigns measured their impacts on participants' knowledge, attitudes and birth preferences but only in the short term. The main barriers were lack of financial and human resources. The main enablers were the enthusiasm of volunteers, the participation of famous persons/celebrities and the involvement of communication professionals. Conclusions There are few mass media campaigns directed at lay people to reduce CS. Most campaigns did not use key principles recommended for the creation and implementation of health communication interventions, and none assessed their effects in reducing CS rates. If media campaigns can play a role in modifying population views towards CS, there is a need for more rigorous studies including impact assessment.

This study examines stress, anxiety, and depression levels in Chinese residents in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. It identifies risk factors and the roles of disaster preparedness and social support. An online survey among Chinese residents in Japan was conducted from 22 June to 14 July 2020. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, Disaster Preparedness for Resilience Checklist, and Social Support Rate Scale were used to measure psychological symptoms. Multivariable linear regressions identified the risk factors and positive effects of disaster preparedness and social support. Of the total 497 participants, 45.3%, 66.6%, and 54.3% reported severe stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, respectively. People with a lower level of education, a higher level of economic influence, the presence of COVID-19 symptoms, and confirmed or suspected family or friends in China were associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first survey to reveal the protective role of disaster preparedness in reducing psychological symptoms during the pandemic.

Canada has amongst the longest periods between vaccine doses worldwide, despite Vancouver having the highest P.1 variant rate outside Brazil. Methods: With surveillance data since the pandemic began, we tracked laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, positivity rates, and vaccine uptake in all 25,558 HCWs in Vancouver Coastal Health, by occupation and subsector, and compared to the general population. We employed Cox regression modelling adjusted for age and calendar-time to calculate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 in fully vaccinated ([] 7 days post-second dose), partially vaccinated (14 days post vaccine) and unvaccinated HCWs; we also compared with unvaccinated community members of the same age-range. Findings: Only 3.3% of our HCWs became infected, mirroring community rates, with peak positivity of 9.1%, compared to 11.8% in the community. As vaccine coverage increased, SARS-CoV-2 infections declined significantly in HCWs, despite a surge with predominantly VOC; unvaccinated HCWs had an infection rate of 1.3/10,000 person-days compared to 0.89 for HCWs post first dose, and 0.30 for fully vaccinated HCWs. VE compared to unvaccinated HCWs was 37.2% (95% CI: 16.6-52.7%) 14 days post-first dose, 79.2% (CI: 64.6-87.8%) 7 days post-second dose; one dose provided significant protection against infection until at least day 42. Compared with community infection rates, VE after one dose was 54.7% (CI: 44.8-62.9%); and 84.8% (CI: 75.2-90.7%) when fully vaccinated. Interpretation: Predominantly droplet-contact precautions, with N95s required for aerosol generating medical procedures and available as needed according to point-of-care risk assessment, has been a highly effective approach to preventing occupational infection in HCWs, with one dose of mRNA vaccination further reducing infection risk despite VOC and transmissibility concerns. Delaying second doses to allow more widespread vaccination against severe disease, with strict public health, occupational health and infection control measures, has been effective in protecting the healthcare workforce.","output":"Infection control, occupational and public health measures including mRNA-based vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infections to protect healthcare workers from variants of concern: a 14-month observational study using surveillance data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this article is to examine the restrictions imposed by European States on individual human rights during the COVID-19 pandemic in the light of the European Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

The epicentre of the pandemic has since shifted to Europe and The Americas. In certain cities and regions, health systems became overwhelmed by high numbers of cases and deaths, whereas other regions continue to experience low incidence rates. Still, lockdowns were usually implemented country-wide, albeit with differing intensities between countries. Compared to its neighbours, Germany has managed to keep the epidemic relatively well under control, in spite of a lockdown that was only partial. In analogy to many countries at a similar stage, Germany is now under increasing pressure to further relax lockdown measures to limit economic and psychosocial costs. However, if this is done too rapidly, Germany risks facing tens of thousands more severe cases of COVID-19 and deaths in the coming months.

Benefits of briefinterventions are well established, but GPs and pharmacistsreport challenges implementing them in practice includinglimited training, time, and poor fit with existing practices [2].Aim: This government-funded Slintecare project aimedto develop a novel method for brief interventions in pharmacy/GP settings using human-centred design.Methods: User research was carried out with twelve users,including patients (3), GPs (4), and pharmacists (5) to identify their needs and priorities. Participants were recruited viaemail using a purposive sampling approach and completedsemi-structured interviews with a design researcher. All participants invited agreed to participate. Next, a series of design sprints were completed with the research team. Designsprints allowed the team to integrate insights from user research with findings from a literature review/secondary research to understand pain points, identify stakeholder anduser goals, and develop a list of initial design specifications.This list was used to develop and iterate a series of prototype solutions. Prototype service blueprints and wireframes(simple, two-dimensional schematic illustrations of thedigital interface) were developed and tested with users before final versions were agreed.Results: Findings from the interviews and literature review indicated (1) the main barrier to adoption was time, (2)patients and pharmacists were very positive about brief interventions with GPs more hesitant, (3) an approach blendingtechnology with a consultation was preferred, and (4) havinga specific list of local supports was important. Prototyping and evaluation processes identified that a simple interfacewith a clear indication of progress were preferred.A blended intervention combining a tablet-based digitaltool and structured interaction was developed. The interface was designed to maximise use of patient and healthcareprofessional time, and mapped to the 5As approach (whichis underpinned by principles of motivational interviewing,shared-decision making, and readiness to change frameworks). The HealthEir digital tool enables patients to selfcomplete the Ask, Advise, and Assess phases of a briefintervention using a tablet device while waiting to see theirpharmacist/GP. The pharmacist or GP then review thepatient's responses, risk level, and importance confidenceand readiness scores. They complete the Assist and Arrangeelements during the consultation, supported by a directoryof local/national patient support services before printinginformation tickets for the patient to keep. The HealthEirintervention has been successfully rolled out at eight pilotpharmacy sites nationally, with a mix of urban/rural sites,and independent/chain pharmacies.Conclusions: Adopting an interdisciplinary approachbased on human-centred design principles led to the development of a blended brief intervention that has been successfully introduced in pilot sites across Ireland. While theimplementation has been smooth despite COVID-19 challenges, and initial feedback has been very positive, the impactcannot yet be fully evaluated as research is ongoing.

The aim being to identify compounds common in plants with anti-RVFV activity, potentially being the major contributors to the anti-viral effect. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy coupled with multivariate data analysis (MVDA) was applied to characterize metabolite profiles of twenty antiviral medicinal plants. Discrimination and prediction of metabolome data of active anti-RVFV from the less-active samples was assessed using the multivariate statistical models by constructing a robust principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) regression model. Annotation of metabolites in the samples with higher activity were performed by Chenomx software and the compounds confirmed using Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-qTOF-MS). Both the PCA and OPLS-DA score plots showed clustering of samples; however, the OPLS-DA plot indicated a clear separation among active and less-active samples. Metabolic biomarkers were screened by p-value < 0.05 and variable importance in the projection (VIP) value >1 and S-plot. Among active samples, the most prominent metabolites putatively identified by NMR include trigonelline, vanillic acid, fumarate, chlorogenic acid, ferulate, and formate. The presence of the compounds were confirmed by UHPLC-qTOF-MS, and two hydroxylated fatty acids were additionally detected indicated by peaks at m/z 293.2116 and m/z 295.2274 13S-Hydroxy-9Z,11E,15Z-octadecatrienoic acid and 13-Hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid were annotated for the first time in all the antiviral active samples and are considered potential metabolites responsible for the antiviral activity.

Clinical data to date with an associated six-month follow-up, suggests the combination therapy may prevent the progression of the disease from mild to moderate to severe, as well as prevent / treat many of the aspects of Long COVID, thereby cost effectively reducing both morbidity and mortality. To investigate patient outcomes, 53 consecutive COVID-19 test (+) cases (ages 3-90) from a well-established, single-center practice in Boston, Massachusetts, between March C November 2020, were treated with levocetirizine and montelukast in addition to then existing protocols [2].

OBJECTIVE: This literature review explores the question in what way health-promoting work from home can be excercised. RESULTS: Working from home requires consideration of the same guidelines just like those for office and computer workstations. To prevent negative mental and physical stress reactions, an ergonomic workstation design is recommended. Furthermore, the organization of working time (structuring the working day, adhering to breaks and regeneration units, and avoiding disturbances and interruptions) is of great importance for a health-promoting work design at home. CONCLUSION: Important components of a health-promoting work design are temporal, spatial and mental separation of work and private life.

Baby was investigated for sepsis and commenced on IV antibiotics empirically. In view of persistent fever, diarrhoea, rash and absence of obvious microbial etiology of inflammation, with elevated inflammatory marker and an epidemiologic link to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the diagnosis of MIS-C-was made. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) was administered and defervescence occurred within 24 hours. He also developed neutropenia during course of illness which persisted on follow up.

While proteasome inhibitors have shown modest activity in R/R FL (Goy et al., JCO 2005), limited data address their use frontline. The comparatively favorable toxicity profile and convenient oral dosing of ixazomib support its investigation in this space. Methods: We evaluated ixazomib and its combination with short-course rituximab (R) for FL as part of an open-label, phase II investigator-initiated trial at the University of Washington / Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center / Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (NCT 02339922). Eligibility included an indication for treatment per NCCN guidelines and no prior standard systemic FL therapy. Ixazomib was administered at 4 mg orally once a week until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity. One course of R at 4 weekly doses of 375 mg/m 2 was added during the 7 th 28-day cycle, after an initial 6-cycle window on ixazomib alone. Available pretreatment formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue biopsies were subjected to RNA extraction by standard methods and gene expression profiling (GEP) using the NanoString? PanCancer IO 360 panel to query pathways in proteasomal degradation and lymphomagenesis. Standard GEP quality control and data processing were performed with the ROSALIND? platform. Patients vaccinated per standard of care for COVID-19 while actively receiving ixazomib and  6 mo after completing R were evaluated for serologic response  2 weeks after the final dose of vaccine using the Roche Elecsys? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay against the spike protein receptor binding domain. Results: Twenty pts began therapy between Feb 2017 and January 2020. All had grade I/II FL and FLIPI score was 2 in 20% and  3 in 20%; FLIPI score in all other patients was 0 or 1. Eleven (55%) pts met GELF criteria for high tumor burden disease including 6 (30%) pts with a tumor mass  7 cm. Median follow-up was 32.1 months (range 5.7 - 51.6). The ORR by Lugano criteria was 35% (CR 5%) during the ixazomib window and 65% (CR 45%) overall. At data cut (June 15, 2021) all patients were alive and 8 (40%) remained progression-free on treatment (Figure 1). By KM estimate, median PFS was 25.8 mo and median DOR was not reached at a median follow-up of 29.6 mo. As expected, high-grade treatment-related AEs were infrequent for ixazomib and R, including grade  3 events in 3 unique pts (15%; diarrhea, transaminitis, and cytopenias). No grade  4 or serious AEs were observed. Toxicities led to study-directed drug interruptions in 4 (20%) pts and dose reduction to ixazomib 3 mg weekly in 2 pts (10%). Higher ORR to ixazomib monotherapy was associated with FLIPI > 1 (p = 0.04) and, by exploratory GEP, downregulation of components of proteasomal degradation and upregulation of NF-KB and chemokine signaling (Figure 2). High tumor burden by GELF (p = 0.89) and tumor mass  7 cm (p = 0.26) were not associated with ORR to ixazomib. All 6 of 6 patients evaluated to date for response to COVID-19 vaccination, administered at a median of 32.5 mo (range 7.0 - 41.0) after last dose of R, achieved positive anti-spike protein antibodies (median anti-S 163.8 AU/mL, range 13.3 - 1139); none was diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusions: The simple outpatient regimen of weekly oral ixazomib and the addition of 4 doses of R shows significant long-term activity with low toxicity in untreated FL. Extended DOR is achievable especially in patients who respond to ixazomib monotherapy. Ixazomib efficacy was associated with higher FLIPI scores and gene expression signatures implicated in proteasomal degradation and B-cell signaling pathways. Ixazomib deserves further investigation as a biomarker-driven therapeutic in untreated FL, particularly as an option that prioritizes outpatient management and serologic responsiveness to immunization.

To identify emerging mental health problems, strategies to address them, and opportunities to reform mental health systems during the COVID-19 pandemic in South America. METHODS. An online questionnaire was sent to mental health decision-makers of ministries of health in 10 South American countries in mid-April 2020. The semi-structured questionnaire had 12 questions clustered into three main sections: emerging challenges in mental health, current and potential strategies to face the pandemic, and key elements for mental health reform. We identified keywords and themes for each section through summative content analysis. RESULTS. Increasing mental health burden and needs were reported as direct and indirect consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. National lockdowns challenge the delivery and access to mental health treatment and care. Strategies to meet mental health needs rely heavily on timely and adequate responses by strengthened mental health governance and systems, availability of services, virtual platforms, and appropriate capacity-building for service providers. Short- and medium-term strategies focused on bolstering community-based mental health networks and telemedicine for high-risk populations. Opportunities for long-term mental health reform entail strengthening legal frameworks, redistribution of financial resources, and collaboration with local and international partners. CONCLUSIONS. Mental health and psychosocial support have been identified as a priority area by South American countries in the COVID-19 response. The pandemic has generated specific needs that require appropriate actions, including implementing virtual interventions, orienting capacity-building toward protecting users and health providers, strengthening evidence-driven decision-making, and integrating mental health and psychosocial support in high-level mechanisms guiding the response to COVID-19.","output":"Emerging mental health challenges, strategies, and opportunities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: Perspectives from South American decision-makers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Confinement to the home and psychological distress due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may lead to harmful health behaviors, such as overeating, sedentary behavior with reduced physical activity, elevated alcohol and tobacco use and increased screen time causing impaired sleep. All of these behaviors are associated with non-communicable diseases and can interfere with immunity. While no foods, single nutrients or dietary supplements are capable of preventing infection with COVID-19, a balanced diet containing sufficient amounts of macronutrients and diverse micronutrients is a prerequisite of an optimally functioning immune system. High-energy Western diets and obesity are major risk factors for a more severe course of COVID-19. Alcohol use and tobacco also have detrimental effects on the immune system. Therefore, population-wide body weight control, reduction of smoking rates and limitation of alcohol consumption are important preventive measures. Furthermore, sufficient restorative sleep is needed for adequate immune functioning. Appropriate lifestyle changes in regard to nutrition, exercise, sleep, smoking and alcohol intake may help shift the population distribution of infection risk and aid in preventing severe COVID-19 disease.

This study aims to describe the experience from PUCRS's Sao Lucas Hospital Thoracic Surgery team on mediastinal tumor resections (MTR) during the investigation of TET. Methods: The Thoracic Surgery team from PUCRS's Sao Lucas Hospital maintains a prospective database with the Brazilian Thoracic Surgery Society. Data from patients who underwent investigation for TET within 2016 and 2020 were collected from medical records in March 2021. Descriptive analyses were performed on this data. We used the classification proposed by the World Health Organization (2004) to classify all cases found. Results: There were 90 MTR performed on a total of 87 patients between 2016 and 2020. Of these, 56 (64.36%) were female, and the average age was 54.28. Among performed MTR, 11 (12.22%) were due to TET, being 10 (11.11%) by thymoma and 1 (1.11%) by thymic carcinoma. From the 10 cases of thymoma, 7 (70%) were female, and the only patient diagnosed with thymic carcinoma was male. Of the 11 patients diagnosed with TET, the average age was 56. According to the TET classification used, 1 (9.09%) was type A, 5 (45.45%) was AB, 1 (9.09%) was B2, 1 (9.09%) was B3, 1 (9.09%) was C (thymic carcinoma was classified as type C), 1 (9.09%) classified as types B1 and B2, and another (9.09%) as types AB and B3. Among 10 cases of thymoma, 2 (20%) had myasthenia gravis (MG). Immediate postoperative mortality was zero. During yearly follow-up, only 1 (9.09%) patient had a recurrence of disease, and 1 (9.09%) died. It is important to highlight that from all 90 MTR performed, 80 (88.88%) occurred between 2016 to 2019 (18 in 2016, 16 in 2017, 21 in 2018, 25 in 2019), resulting in an average of 20 RTM per year. However, in 2020, only 10 (11.11%) RTM were performed, showing a significant reduction during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Conclusion: Our data converge to what is shown in the literature since a small portion of patients who underwent MTR had a thymoma diagnosis and only one had a diagnosis of thymic carcinoma. The most frequent type was AB. Studies demonstrate that 30-65% of patients with thymoma also have MG. On the other hand, our sample shows 20%. It is essential to emphasize the reduction in the number of procedures during the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020.

Thus, the improved splicing method is introduced into a genetic algorithm to enhance exploitation capability for achieving balance between exploitation and exploration of GA. It can effectively identify true gene subsets with high probability. Furthermore, a dataset of the body weight of Hu sheep has been used to show that the proposed method can obtain a better minimal subset of genes with a few iterations, compared with all considered algorithms including genetic algorithm and adaptive best-subset selection algorithm. ABSTRACT: Selecting the minimal best subset out of a huge number of factors for influencing the response is a fundamental and very challenging NP-hard problem because the presence of many redundant genes results in over-fitting easily while missing an important gene can more detrimental impact on predictions, and computation is prohibitive for exhaust search. We propose a modified memetic algorithm (MA) based on an improved splicing method to overcome the problems in the traditional genetic algorithm exploitation capability and dimension reduction in the predictor variables. The new algorithm accelerates the search in identifying the minimal best subset of genes by incorporating it into the new local search operator and hence improving the splicing method. The improvement is also due to another two novel aspects: (a) updating subsets of genes iteratively until the no more reduction in the loss function by splicing and increasing the probability of selecting the true subsets of genes; and (b) introducing add and del operators based on backward sacrifice into the splicing method to limit the size of gene subsets. Additionally, according to the experimental results, our proposed optimizer can obtain a better minimal subset of genes with a few iterations, compared with all considered algorithms. Moreover, the mutation operator is replaced by it to enhance exploitation capability and initial individuals are improved by it to enhance efficiency of search. A dataset of the body weight of Hu sheep was used to evaluate the superiority of the modified MA against the genetic algorithm. According to our experimental results, our proposed optimizer can obtain a better minimal subset of genes with a few iterations, compared with all considered algorithms including the most advanced adaptive best-subset selection algorithm.","output":"A Modified Memetic Algorithm with an Application to Gene Selection in a Sheep Body Weight Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Given the high prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) globally, and the increased number of patients being discharged, it is necessary to understand the health consequences of COVID-19 to formulate and manage public policy concerning convalescent patients. Methods: A longitudinal follow-up investigation of 25 patients from a tertiary hospital in Henan provincial was conducted 8 weeks after discharge. Of these patients, 15 attended a second follow-up appointment 8 weeks after that. A throat swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis for SARS-CoV-2 and chest computerized tomography (CT) scans were implemented at the first follow-up appointment, and a total of 40 blood samples (25 from the first and 15 from the second follow-up appointment) were collected. Patients' levels of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody against S-Receptor binding domain (S-RBD) and Nucleocapsid Protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 and the subpopulation of lymphocytes were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) test and flow cytometry, respectively. Results: At the first follow-up appointment, 10 of the 25 patients (40.0%) showed complete radiological resolution. Of these patients, 80.0% were classified as moderate, and 80.0% were younger (those whose age was  the median age of all the patients). The predominant patterns of abnormalities included an irregular line (12/25, 48.0%), ground-glass opacity (GGO) (44.0%), and multiple GGOs (28.0%). At the first follow-up appointment, 40.0% (10/25) of patients still had lymphopenia. Of the 15 patients who were followed-up with twice, the ratio of lymphopenia was 80% (12/15), 60.0% (9/15), and 46.7% (7/15) at 0, 8, and 16 weeks after discharge, respectively. This was mainly due to a decrease in the cluster of differentiation (CD) 4+ T lymphocyte, which was observed in 60% (9/15), 60% (9/15), and 46.7% (7/15) of total patients at 0, 8, and 16 weeks after discharge, respectively. All of the patients were S-RBD and NP IgG antibody positive at the first follow-up appointment. 40.0% (6/15) and 66.7% (10/15) of patients showed a decrease over 50.0% in the level of NP and S-RBD IgG antibodies, respectively, at the second follow-up appointment. The NP and S-RBD IgG antibodies' levels declined to 44.6% (P=0.044) and 28.1% (P=0.18), respectively. 0 and 26.7% (4/15) of patients turned from NP and S-RBD IgG antibody positive to negative, respectively. Conclusions: About half of the patients still showed at least 1 abnormality in chest CT scans 8 weeks after discharge and lymphopenia 16 weeks after discharge. The level of the IgG antibody had declined by the follow-up appointment. Notably, the S-RBD IgG antibody declined more dramatically than that of NP. These results may have implications in the making of policies related to disease prevention, the long-term management of discharged patients, and vaccines' development.","output":"A longitudinal follow-up of COVID-19 patients in the convalescent phase showed recovery in radiological results, the dynamics of lymphocytes, and a decrease in the level of IgG antibody: A single-centre, observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background The COVID-19 pandemic has swept across the world, causing a staggering number of deaths, particularly among older individuals The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath, but delirium has been reported in older adults, including those with preexisting neurodegenerative disorders Some research has suggested that the role of neuropsychiatric sequelae in COVID-19, especially delirium, has been underreported and that the lack of fever and respiratory distress in this population may exacerbate underdiagnosis and subsequent mortality Here, we discuss the variable course of COVID-19 by detailing the course of illness in two individuals who are age 90+ with mild COVID-19 Method We conducted chart reviews and telephone interviews in two patients who were age 90+ Case 1 had an outpatient follow-up visit via teleconferencing Due to COVID-19 protocols, in-person research assessments were not completed Both were on hospice due to underlying terminal medical conditions Result Both cases are age 90+ patients with dementia who receive hospice care for multiple underlying medical comorbidities Case 1 presented at home with a low-grade temperature that was below the CDC COVID-19 guidelines for fever at that time;he experienced cough, confusion, and functional decline and was admitted to a COVID-19 unit after testing positive for the disease His workup also included a COVID-19 laboratory panel, which was mostly abnormal (including extremely elevated brain natriuretic peptide) but had normal WBC He did not experience further deterioration, and 22 days later, after testing COVID-19 negative, he was discharged to a skilled nursing facility (SNF), followed by discharge to home 15 days later Case 2 had metastatic carcinoma and a preexisting diagnosis of probable dementia with Lewy bodies COVID-19 was diagnosed through all-resident screening at his SNF He did not exhibit respiratory symptoms or fever at that time While nursing staff reported confusion, agitation, and restlessness, these symptoms could not be differentiated from complications related to his underlying dementia This patient was isolated within the SNF and was not hospitalized Conclusion These two cases demonstrate the variability of symptom manifestation in COVID-19 in this high-risk population","output":"Mild disease course in cognitively impaired oldest old individuals with COVID-19: A description of two cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung ultrasound (LUS) has recently been advocated as an accurate tool to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.

Researchers immediately leveraged these data to infer the evolutionary relationships among viral samples and to study key biological questions, including whether host viral genome editing and recombination are features of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. This global sequencing effort is inherently decentralized and must rely on data collected by many labs using a wide variety of molecular and bioinformatic techniques. There is thus a strong possibility that systematic errors associated with labor protocolspecific practices affect some sequences in the repositories. We find that some recurrent mutations in reported SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been observed predominantly or exclusively by single labs, co-localize with commonly used primer binding sites and are more likely to affect the protein-coding sequences than other similarly recurrent mutations. We show that their inclusion can affect phylogenetic inference on scales relevant to local lineage tracing, and make it appear as though there has been an excess of recurrent mutation or recombination among viral lineages. We suggest how samples can be screened and problematic variants removed, and we plan to regularly inform the scientific community with our updated results as more SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences are shared (https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473 and https://virological.org/t/masking-strategies-for-sars-cov-2-alignments/480).

The effect of lockdown on those with alcohol-related disease is of interest; and whether there were associated implications for a change in alcohol intake and consequent presentations with decompensated disease. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to seven Scottish hospitals with a history of liver disease between 1 April and 30 April 2020 and compared across the same time in 2017, 2018 and 2019. We also repeated an intermediate assessment based on a single centre to examine for delayed effects between 1 April and 31 July 2020. RESULTS: We found that results and outcomes for patients admitted in 2020 were similar to those in previous years in terms of morbidity, mortality, and length of stay. In the Scotland-wide cohort: admission MELD (Model for End-stage Liver Disease) (16 (12C22) vs 15 (12C19); p=0.141), inpatient mortality ((10.9% vs 8.6%); p=0.499) and length of stay (8 days (4C15) vs 7 days (4C13); p=0.140).

C and D were located within 1.5 and 1.5 km away from the study site, respectively. Parasite prevalence, malaria incidence, and the proportion of the Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases were evaluated. Results: After 3 monthly rounds of AP-MDA, the parasite prevalence and the gametocyte carriage rate of P. falciparum in zone A decreased from 28.29() to 0 and 4.99() to 0, respectively. Compared to zone B, the relative risk for the population with Plasmodium falciparum malaria in zone A was lower (RR = 0.458, 95% CI: 0.146C1.437). Malaria incidence fell from 290.49() (the same period of the previous year) to 15.27() (from the 29th week in 2019 to the 14th week in 2020), a decrease of 94.74% in zone A, and from 31.74 to 5.46(), a decline of 82.80% in zone B.

We have previously demonstrated that replacement of the S glycoprotein ectodomain from the avirulent Beaudette strain of IBV with the corresponding region from the virulent M41-CK strain resulted in a recombinant virus, BeauR-M41(S), with the in vitro cell tropism of M41-CK. The IBV Beaudette strain is able to replicate in both primary chick kidney cells and Vero cells, whereas the IBV M41-CK strain replicates in primary cells only. In order to investigate the region of the IBV S responsible for growth in Vero cells, we generated a series of recombinant IBVs expressing chimeric S glycoproteins, consisting of regions from the Beaudette and M41-CK S gene sequences, within the genomic background of Beaudette. The S2, but not the S1, subunit of the Beaudette S was found to confer the ability to grow in Vero cells. Various combinations of Beaudette-specific amino acids were introduced into the S2 subunit of M41 to determine the minimum requirement to confer tropism for growth in Vero cells. The ability of IBV to grow and produce infectious progeny virus in Vero cells was subsequently narrowed down to just 3 amino acids surrounding the S2 cleavage site. Conversely, swapping of the 3 Beaudette-associated amino acids with the corresponding ones from M41 was sufficient to abolish Beaudette growth in Vero cells. IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis remains a major problem in the global poultry industry, despite the existence of many different vaccines. IBV vaccines, both live attenuated and inactivated, are currently grown on embryonated hen's eggs, a cumbersome and expensive process due to the fact that most IBV strains do not grow in cultured cells. The reverse genetics system for IBV creates the opportunity for generating rationally designed and more effective vaccines. The observation that IBV Beaudette has the additional tropism for growth on Vero cells also invokes the possibility of generating IBV vaccines produced from cultured cells rather than by the use of embryonated eggs. The regions of the IBV Beaudette S glycoprotein involved in the determination of extended cellular tropism were identified in this study. This information will enable the rational design of a future generation of IBV vaccines that may be grown on Vero cells.","output":"The S2 Subunit of Infectious Bronchitis Virus Beaudette Is a Determinant of Cellular Tropism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To summarize the main characteristics of clinical studies regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) registered on the Chinese and US NIH Official Clinical Trial Registration Websites.

Describe the iterative process by which 2 interdisciplinary palliative care teams developed a quality improvement (QI) dashboard 2. Identify common facilitators and barriers to conducting QI work Background Quality improvement (QI) is recommended by multiple national palliative care guidelines. However, little guidance exists on how to execute this work in clinical settings. Aim Statement To assess the impact of a QI dashboard for interdisciplinary palliative care teams. Methods Two palliative care teams, one outpatient and one inpatient, at distinct academic medical centers, identified the need for a QI dashboard that was easily accessible by team members and promoted continuous, collaborative improvement. We modeled the dashboard after the True North Board from Lean methodology. After a series of brainstorming sessions, teams voted on improvement priorities and metrics that were meaningful and feasible. With the emergence of COVID-19 and physical distancing, both teams transitioned from a physical to an electronic dashboard that was shared virtually at team meetings. To refine the approach to QI after implementation of the dashboard, focus groups and individual semistructured interviews were conducted with eight outpatient and five inpatient interdisciplinary team members about the dashboard and barriers and facilitators to QI. Results Benefits of the dashboard included increasing awareness of QI work: It makes explicit what matters most. Regularly seeing data encouraged participation and a growth mindset. Facilitators of QI work included identifying a QI champion, aligning team priorities with those of the institution, and systematic integration of QI work into schedules. Common barriers at both sites were lack of dedicated time for QI, inadequate training, and difficulty measuring important aspects of care: The ability to measure what matters most, and improve on that, feels like a juggernaut. Additionally, changes in providers week to week lead to shifts in what we care about and how things are done. Conclusions and Implications Palliative care teams can use dashboards to promote engagement in QI in outpatient and inpatient settings.

However, high doses of the agent are necessary to obtain an efficient antiviral activity. Favipiravir is teratogen in pregnant women and associated with the hyperuricemia. Therefore, the administration of the drug should be well controlled. Investigating the antiviral prophylactic potency of favipiravir and search for its pro-drugs and/or analogs showing improved activity and/or safety are critical.","output":"A review on favipiravir: the properties, function, and usefulness to treat COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background As the early peak phase in the coronavirus outbreak has intensified, stay at home mandates were advised requiring individuals to remain home to prevent community transmission of the disease Further mandates escalated isolated environments such as school closures, social distancing, travel restrictions, closure of public gathering spaces, and business closures As citizens were forced to stay home during the pandemic, the crisis created unique trends in trauma referrals, which consisted of atypical trends in injuries related to trauma Methods A retrospective review of all trauma registry patients presenting to a rural American College of Surgeons (ACS) verified Level I trauma center with associated trauma activation before and during the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, integral dates January 1, 2020, to May 1, 2020 A comparison was made regarding trauma trends based on the previous year (January 1, 2019, to May 1, 2019) The data collected included patient characteristics, grouping by trauma activation, injury type, injury severity score (ISS), alcohol screen, drug screen, and mode of injury Results A statistically significant increase was found largely among males (p = 0 02) with positive alcohol screens (p &lt; 0 001) The statistically significant mode of injury among this trauma population included falling, jumping, pushed (p = 0 02);self-harm-jump (p = 0 01);assault (p = 0 03);and assault with sharp object (p = 0 036) Conclusions Although overall trauma volume was reduced preceding and during the COVID-19 stay at home mandates, a significant increase in specific trauma trends were observed, such as falls, jumps, and pushed;self-harm-jumps;assaults;and assaults with sharp objects Largely, the trauma trends were among men with higher levels of alcohol than previously reported","output":"Trauma Trends During the Initial Peak of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Midst of Lockdown: Experiences From a Rural Trauma Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ethical and legal social issues of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include (1) bio- and public health ethics, (2) research ethics, (3) implementation of the legal system, (4) participation of COVID-19 parties, (5) impact on vulnerable populations, and (6) use of digital technology The following are some examples This article addresses the background and definitions of prejudice, discrimination, and risk communication issues that underlie these issues, as well as recent developments","output":"[XVI.

Moreover, the present study aims to add to the understanding of the role of personal resources in the Job Demands-Resources model (JD-R) by examining whether personal resources-such as the professionals' orientation towards patient engagement-may also strengthen the impact of job resources and mitigate the impact of job demands. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 532 healthcare professionals working during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. It adopted the Job-Demands-Resource Model to study the determinants of professional's burnout. An integrative model describing how increasing job demands experienced by this specific population are related to burnout and in particular to emotional exhaustion symptoms was developed. RESULTS: The results of the logistic regression models provided strong support for the proposed model, as both Job Demands and Resources are significant predictors (OR = 2.359 and 0.563 respectively, with p < 0.001). Moreover, healthcare professionals' orientation towards patient engagement appears as a significant moderator of this relationship, as it reduces Demands' effect (OR = 1.188) and increases Resources' effect (OR = 0.501).

To estimate this disconnect between available evidence and prescribing behavior, we created a Bayesian model analyzing a-priori optimistic belief of physicians in Hydroxychloroquine's effectiveness. Methodology: We created a Bayesian model to simulate the impact of different a-priori beliefs related to Hydroxychloroquine's effectiveness on clinical and economic outcome.

However, there was little scholarly attention paid to stigma while the outbreak was still active. This chapter explores the effects of stigmatization on the health care services that pregnant women, both with and without Ebola, were able to access and receive during the outbreak. We propose three primary ways in which stigma operated to reduce pregnant womens access to health care services during the outbreak: (1) Women and their relatives were afraid to go to health facilities for fear of being infected with Ebola while there, i.e., stigmatization of health care facilities; (2) Health care workers frequently died due to their occupational exposure to EVD while caring for others, i.e., they were stigmatized as carriers or transmitters of Ebola; and (3) Pregnant women themselves were refused services at health facilities due to fears that they were infected with Ebola, i.e., the physiological processes of birth, which involve high levels of potential for exposure to bodily fluids, led to health care workers stigmatization of these women when they sought services during pregnancy or, particularly, at the time of giving birth. In several of the countries that experienced the worst of the outbreak, women already faced some of the worlds highest rates of pregnancy-related death even prior to the advent of the epidemic. We argue that the high fatality rate for pregnant women with Ebola, the drastic effects of the epidemic on countries health care workforce, and the inherent messiness of birth, all coalesced to create heightened discrimination and stigma around seeking care during pregnancy and birth.","output":"Effects of the West African Ebola Epidemic on Health Care of Pregnant Women: Stigmatization With and Without Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, is an international concern.

In this review, a number of broad-spectrum antivirals with potential efficacy to inhibit the virus replication via targeting the virus spike protein (S protein), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) that are critical in the pathogenesis and life cycle of coronavirus, have been evaluated as possible treatment options against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Existing antiviral options against SARS-CoV-2 replication in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the evolutionary drivers determining the transmission rate and virulence of pathogens remains an important challenge for evolutionary theory with clear implications to the control of human, agricultural and wildlife infectious disease. Although disease is often very dynamic, classical theory examines the long-term outcome of evolution at equilibrium and, in simple models, typically predicts that R0 is maximized. For example, immune escape may lead to complex disease dynamics including repeated epidemics, fluctuating selection and diversification. Here we model the impact of antigenic drift and escape on the evolution of virulence and show analytically that these non-equilibrium dynamics select for more acute pathogens with higher virulence. Specifically, under antigenic drift and when partial cross immunity leads to antigenic escape, our analysis predicts the long-term maximization of the intrinsic growth rate of the parasite resulting in more acute and virulent pathogens than those predicted by classic R0 maximization. Furthermore, it follows that these pathogens will have a lower R0 leading to implications for epidemic, endemic behavior and control. Our analysis predicts both the timings and outcomes of antigenic shifts leading to repeated epidemics and predicts the increase in variation in both antigenicity and virulence before antigenic escape. There is considerable variation in the degree of antigenic escape that occurs across pathogens and our results may help to explain the difference in virulence between related pathogens most clearly seen in the human A, B and C influenzas.

Several studies have shown an association of NAFLD with multiple cardiovascular risk factors such as abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidaemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose tolerance. Atherosclerosis is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory disease, which begins early in life and follows a long asymptomatic phase. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is the radiological confirmation of the presence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. The predictive value of CAC for future cardiac events is well established. Also, the progression of CAC is strongly associated with the development of cardiovascular events. AIM: To assess the association of NAFLD with the progression of subclinical atherosclerotic activity, reflected as the dynamic changes in CAC score over time. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The databases PubMed/Medline/Embase from inception until 31 December 2020 were searched for observational studies investigating NAFLD and CAC progression in adults. RESULTS: In total, 5 studies were included, 4 of which, including 10,060 patients, provided data regarding the association of NAFLD with the progression of CAC. The analysis showed that NAFLD is associated with significant odds of progression of CAC; OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.34C1.68, p = 0.001. No publication bias was detected (Eggers test p = 0.6).

Methods: Four English and four Chinese databases were searched from their inception to June 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing therapeutic effects of Bupleuri radix on ARTI were eligible for inclusion. The risk of bias for each trial was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. RevMan 5.4 software was used for data analyses with effects estimated as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the online GRADEpro tool. Results: Seven randomized trials involving 910 patients with acute upper respiratory tract infection (AURTI) were included. The review identified Bupleuri radix agents with four administration routes (oral, acupoint injection, intramuscular injection, nebulized inhalation). Bupleuri radix acupoint injection compared with placebo showed statistically significant effects in reducing fever resolution time (MD: ?33.32 h, 95%CI: ?35.71, ?30.93), and in increasing the proportion of participants with fever resolved within 48 h from treatment onset (RR: 14, 95%CI: 1.96, 99.94). Bupleuri radix acupoint injection combined with usual care is more effective in reducing the temperature at day 1 from treatment onset (MD: ?1.00C, 95%CI: ?1.19, ?0.81) compared with usual care alone. Bupleuri radix pills showed similar antipyretic effects to acetaminophen. However, Bupleuri radix intramuscular injection plus vitamins failed to demonstrate an effect in reducing fever, when compared with ribavirin plus vitamins. It suggested that oral administration of Bupleuri radix solution for injections, pills, and Bupleuri radix decoction have a similar effect on improving global AURTI symptoms including two key symptoms (nasal discharge and cough), when compared with usual care alone. Only two trials reported whether or not there were any AEs and found no occurrence of adverse events in the herbal group. Conclusion: Low-certainty or very low-certainty evidence demonstrated that Bupleuri radix (solution for injections and pills) has an antipyretic effect on febrile patients with AURTI, but it has no effect on other AURTI symptoms.

Further, the discovery of the type V CRISPR-Cas12 (Cpf1) system provides more flexibility and precision in DNA manipulation in prokaryotes, plants, and animals. However, much effort has been made to employ and utilize the above CRISPR tools for RNA manipulation but the ability of Cas9 and Cas12 to cut DNA involves the nuisance of off-target effects on genes and thus may not be employed in all RNA-targeting applications. Therefore, the search for new and diverse Cas effectors which can precisely detect and manipulate the targeted RNA begins and this led to the discovery of a novel RNA targeting class 2, type VI CRISPR-Cas13 system. The CRISPR-Cas13 system consists of single RNA-guided Cas13 effector nucleases that solely target single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) in a programmable way without altering the DNA. The Cas13 effectors family comprises four subtypes (a-d) and each subtype has distinctive primary sequence divergence except the two consensuses Higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding domain (HEPN) that includes RNase motifs i.e. R-X4-6-H. These two HEPN domains are solely responsible for executing targetable RNA cleavage activity with high efficiency.

We aimed to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics, treatment and outcome of children diagnosed with community-acquired MP pneumonia (CAMP) in a tertiary hospital in Valencia, Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Medical records of children <14 years with CAMP were retrospectively reviewed from January 2010 to December 2015. Patients with radiological evidence of pneumonia and microbiological confirmation of MP (PCR from nasopharyngeal swab and/or serum specific IgM) were considered CAMP. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty two children were diagnosed with CAMP; median age 6 years (IQR: 4C9). The positive MP test rate among children with CAP progressively increased with age as did the empirical use of macrolides. There were two peaks of cases in 2011 and in 2015, being July, August, November and December the seasons with the higher number of cases. The most frequent radiological pattern was segmental infiltrate (62.3%) and 22 (13.6%) children had pleural effusion. It was noteworthy the mild symptomatology and low levels of inflammatory parameters that children with CAMP had. A macrolide was empirically initiated in 68.5% of cases. Hospital admission rate was inversely proportional to patient's age. CONCLUSIONS: According to this study, older, less symptomatic patients and with lower inflammatory parameters had the greatest rate of MP infection among children with CAP and thus they could benefit of empiric macrolide therapy.

We used MIPSA to profile circulating autoantibodies from 55 patients with severe COVID-19 against 11,076 DNA-barcoded proteins of the human ORFeome library. MIPSA identified previously known autoreactivities, and also detected undescribed neutralizing interferon lambda 3 (IFN-3) autoantibodies. At-risk individuals with anti- IFN-3 antibodies may benefit from interferon supplementation therapies, such as those currently undergoing clinical evaluation.","output":"Neutralizing IFNL3 Autoantibodies in Severe COVID-19 Identified Using Molecular Indexing of Proteins by Self-Assembly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text]","output":"A new mission awaits: Machine learning to predict COVID-19 related complications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social Sustainability among university students, especially how students deal with psychological distress, is important during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The inclusion criteria were: (1) currently an active status university student;(2) absent of visual disability;(3) absent of network coverage issues;and (4) absent of clinical symptoms of psychological distress. The total respondents were 385 students from this university who ranged from 20 to 23 years of age and were collected from all the faculties available at the main campus of Public University in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. The research method applied was a survey method, collecting the data through an online questionnaire platform. Three instruments were used: (1) Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21);(2) Brief COPE Scale (Brief COPE);and (3) Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The result of the descriptive analysis indicated that the levels of both depression and anxiety in students of the Public University in Sabah were mild. In contrast, the stress level was moderate during the pandemic. The results of the inferential analysis indicated the relationship between perceived social support and psychological distress, which focused on depression, anxiety and stress among the university students, to overall having a significantly negative correlation between its subscales (r = between ?0.148 and ?0.359;p < 0.05). Based on the findings, it is clear how vulnerable university students are to psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it can be overcome with social support and suitable types of coping strategy. Besides, a negative link between depression and problem-focused coping was reported (r = ?0.274, p < 0.05). These findings also contribute to social sustainability and the wellbeing of students at the Public University in Sabah, Malaysia.","output":"Perceived Social Support, Coping Strategies and Psychological Distress among University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Exploration Study for Social Sustainability in Sabah, Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rab GTPases (Rabs) are small proteins that play crucial roles in vesicle transport and membrane trafficking. Owing to their widespread functions in several steps of vesicle trafficking, Rabs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several disorders, including cancer, diabetes, and multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

On the other side, the implementation of social distancing has increased womens workload at home. However, culturally, womens works in private sectors such as care works, and mothering tend to be normalized. Economic activity is associated with mens jobs as breadwinners, and it is limited on public space. Therefore, women seem not productive economically even though they have endless works (at home). This article does not only explore one single aspect of womens double burdens.

The use of i.v. fluid has represented the cornerstone for the treatment of hypoperfusion for two centuries. METHODS As a part of International Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative XII Fluids Workgroup meeting, we sought to incorporate recent advances in our understanding of vascular biology into a more comprehensive yet accessible approach to the patient with hypoperfusion. In this workgroup, we attempted to develop a framework that incorporates key aspects of the vasculature into a diagnostic approach. RESULTS The four main components of our proposal involve the assessment of the blood flow (BF), vascular content (vC), the vascular barrier (vB), and vascular tone (vT). Any significant perturbation in any of these domains can lead to hypoperfusion at both the macro- and micro-circulatory level. We have termed the BF, vC, vB, and vT diagnostic approach the vascular component (VC) approach. CONCLUSIONS The VC approach to hypoperfusion has potential advantages to the current diagnostic system. This approach also has the distinct advantage that it can be used to assess the systemic, regional, and micro-vasculature, thereby harmonizing the approach to clinical vascular diagnostics across these levels. The VC approach will need to be tested prospectively to determine if this system can in fact improve outcomes in patients who suffer from hypoperfusion.","output":"Vascular content, tone, integrity, and haemodynamics for guiding fluid therapy: a conceptual approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?sszefoglal. jabb megfigyelsek szerint a SARS-CoV-2-fert?zst k?vet?en gyermekekben a paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) elnevezs?, sokkllapottal sz?v?d?tt Kawasaki-megbetegedshez hasonlt, t?bbszervi elgtelensgnek megfelel? tnetegyttes alakulhat ki.

Recently following SARS-CoV-2 infection, a new, multisystem disease (paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome, PIMS) with fever was recognized in children with shock and multiorgan failure. On of the first Hungarian cases will be described. A 15-year-old boy was admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit with persistent high fever, diffuse abdominal pain, septic shock, multiple organ failure, gloves- and socks-shaped cutan exanthema, conjunctivitis and laboratory signs of inflammation. Some weeks preceding his admission, symptoms of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection were revealed. At admission, the SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antigen tests were negative, however, the presence of IgG antibody was shown. Following complex supportive intensive care along with internationally recommended immunoglobulin, aspirin and steroid treatment, the patient was completely cured without any sequalae. In children after SARS-CoV-2 infection, PIMS could occur mimicking Kawasaki syndrome. At this time, in children virus PCR or antigen tests are usually negative already, but the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody could prove the preceding disease. Due to the increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the occurrence of post-SARS-CoV-2 PIMS in childhood is expected to increase. For paediatric patients, in case of severe septic state and multiple organ failure, PIMS should be also considered, which may require intensive care and targeted therapy. As far as we know, the described case is one of the earliest cases of PIMS in Hungary.

Manifestations of cardiac involvement have been noted in a significant number of patients in the acute phase. There are increasing concerns that some of these cardiac sequels may persist beyond the acute phase. If untreated, the sustained cardiac injury, especially myocarditis and fibrosis, could have severe consequences. Recent studies have assessed the presence of cardiac involvement using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging during the post-acute phase. PURPOSE: We present a systematic review of studies assessing evidence of cardiac involvement in patients recovered from COVID-19 during the post-acute phase using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) Imaging. METHODS: We reported this study in accordance with PRISMA. A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), and Google scholar databases using Boolean operators and the relevant key terms covering COVID-19, Cardiac injury, CMR, and follow-up. Retrieved articles were included based on predefined eligibility criteria. RESULTS: Of 1406 articles retrieved from the initial search, 11 items, 9 cohort, and 2 case series studies met our eligibility criteria. The rate of raised T1 (reported in 6 articles) in patients recovered from COVID-19 varied across studies from 5% to73%. In 4 out of 9 studies, raised T2 was detected in any patients, and in remained studies, its rate ranged from 2% to 60%. In most of the included studies, LGE (myocardial or pericardial) was observed in COVID-19 survivors, ranged from 7.0% to 100%. Myocardial LGE mainly had nonischemic patterns. None of the cohort studies observed myocardial LGE in healthy controls. Most studies found that patients who recovered from COVID-19 had significantly a greater mean (SD) T1 and T2 compared to participants in the control group. CONCLUSION: Our systematic review study found evidence of subclinical and clinical myocardial and pericardial involvement in patients recovered from COVID-19.

The study aims to assess the relations between social impact and mental health among adults living in Spain during COVID-19 lockdown measures, taking a gender-based approach into account. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among adults living in Spain during the lockdown of COVID-19 with an online survey from 8 April to 28 May 2020. The main variable was mental health measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale for anxiety and the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression. Sex-stratified multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to assess the association between social impact variables, anxiety and depression. RESULTS: A total of 7053 people completed this survey. A total of 31.2% of women and 17.7% of men reported anxiety. Depression levels were reported in 28.5% of women and 16.7% of men. A higher proportion of anxiety and depression levels was found in the younger population (18-35 years), especially in women. Poorer mental health was mainly related to fear of COVID-19 infection, with higher anxiety levels especially in women (adjusted ordinal OR (aOR): 4.23, 95% CI 3.68 to 4.87) and worsened economy with higher levels of depression in women (aOR: 1.51, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.84), and perceived inadequate housing to cope with lockdown was especially associated with anxiety in men (aOR: 2.53, 95% CI 1.93 to 3.44). CONCLUSION: The social impact of the lockdown is related to gender, age and socioeconomic conditions. Women and young people had worse mental health outcomes during lockdown.

Cyanobacteria and microcystins were measured by flow cytometry and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in two interconnected reservoirs varying in age and management regimes, in southern Britain over a 12-month period. Microcystins were detected in both reservoirs, with significantly higher concentrations in the southern lake (maximum concentration >7 g L-1). Elevated microcystin concentrations were not positively correlated with numbers of cyanobacterial cells, but multiple linear regression analysis suggested temperature and dissolved oxygen explained a significant amount of the variability in microcystin across both reservoirs. The presence of a managed fishery in one lake was associated with decreased microcystin levels, suggestive of top down control on cyanobacterial populations.

Nevertheless, such outbreaks continue to disrupt the travel industry. This aspect of the IHR has received little attention in the academic literature despite its considerable impact on affected States and commercial activity. This article outlines the challenges and gaps in knowledge regarding the relationship between outbreaks and the travel sector and discusses the opportunities for further research and policy work to overcome these challenges. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a literature review on the relationship between outbreaks and travel restrictions, with a particular focus on the 2014-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. This review was complemented by an expert roundtable at Chatham House and further supported by case studies and qualitative interviews. RESULTS: Numerous travel stakeholders are affected by, and affect, large-scale infectious disease outbreaks. These stakeholders react in different ways: peer pressure plays an important role for both governments and the travel sector, and the reactions of the media and public influence and are influenced by these stakeholders. While various data sources on travel are available, and World Health Organization is mandated to work with States, there is no recognized coordinating body to disseminate timely, consistent, reliable and authoritative information and best practices to all stakeholders. CONCLUSION: This article highlights the interdependent relationship between various travel stakeholders. The reasons for interruption of travel during the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak were complex, with decisions by States only partly contributing to the cessation. Decisions by non-state actors, particularly the travel industry itself, contributed significantly and were based on a variety of factors.

Silicosis represents a major global health problem causing more than 45.000 deaths per year. The inflammasome-caspase-1 pathway contributes to the development of silica-induced inflammation and fibrosis via IL-1 and IL-18 production. Recent studies indicate that tetracycline can be used to treat inflammatory diseases mediated by IL-1 and IL-18. Therefore, we hypothesized that tetracycline reduces silica-induced lung injury and lung fibrosis resulting from chronic silicosis via limiting IL-1 and IL-18 driven inflammation. METHODS: To investigate whether tetracycline is a therapeutic option to block inflammasome-caspase-1 driven inflammation in silicosis, we incubated macrophages with silica alone or combined with tetracycline. The in vivo effect of tetracycline was determined after intratracheal administration of silica into the mouse lung. RESULTS: Tetracycline selectively blocks IL-1 production and pyroptotic cell death via inhibition of caspase-1 in macrophages exposed to silica particles. Consistent, treatment of silica-instilled mice with tetracycline significantly reduced pulmonary caspase-1 activation as well as IL-1 and IL-18 production, thereby ameliorating pulmonary inflammation and lung injury. Furthermore, prolonged tetracycline administration in a model of chronic silicosis reduced lung damage and fibrotic remodeling. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that tetracycline inhibits caspase-1-dependent production of IL-1 in response to silica in vitro and in vivo. The results were consistent with tetracycline reducing silica-induced pulmonary inflammation and chronic silicosis in terms of lung injury and fibrosis. Thus, tetracycline could be effective in the treatment of patients with silicosis as well as other diseases involving silicotic inflammation.","output":"Tetracycline ameliorates silica-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis via inhibition of caspase-1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prostate cancer refers to uncontrolled abnormal cell growth (Cancer) within the prostate gland. The disease is a rising health concern and accounts for 3.8% of all cancer deaths globally. Uganda has one of the highest incidence rates of the disease in Africa being 5.2% and many of the diagnosed patients are found to have advanced stage prostate cancer. This study aimed to use STEAP2 protein (prostate cancer specific biomarker) for the discovery of new lead compounds against prostate cancer. To determine the most likely compound that can bind to STEAP2 protein, we docked the modelled STEAP2 3 Dimension structure against 2466 FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved drug candidates using Autodock vina. Protein Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTp) search, Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), and phylogenetics were further carried out to analyse the diversity of this marker and determine its conserved domains as suitable target regions. Six promising drug candidates (ligands) were identified of which Triptorelin had the highest binding energy (-12.1 kcal/mol). Leuprolide was the second most promising candidate with a docking energy of -11.2 kcal/mol. All the top 3 of 6 drugs interacted with highly conserved residues Ser-372 and Gly-369 in close proximity with the iron binding domain that was shown to be important for catalysis of metal reduction. The two drugs had earlier been approved for treatment of advanced prostate cancer but with an elusive mode of action. Thanks to this study we now have an insight on how their interaction with STEAP2 might be important during treatment. Author summary Previous studies on prostate cancer prevalence have shown that Uganda among other low to middle income countries has a high prostate cancer incidence rate. Majority of the patients at the time of diagnosis have advanced stage disease. While there has been great improvement in therapeutic options for prostate cancer over the last decade, the drugs currently used are still limited and not 100% effective making cure elusive. This is further compounded by undesirable side-effects from some of the treatments. Altogether this creates a need for the discovery of novel, safe, and efficacious chemotherapeutic agents with minimal or no side effects. In this study, we used a prostate cancer specific protein biomarker; STEAP2 that is highly expressed at all disease stages and is androgen independent and FDA approved drugs from the drugbank to help improve drug specificity, efficacy, and reduce undesirable side effects through in-silico methods. The results from the study give an insight on mechanisms of action of current therapy for advanced disease and suggest these very drugs be used even at early stage disease.","output":"A molecular docking study of human STEAP2 for the discovery of new potential anti-prostate cancer chemotherapeutic candidates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread worldwide since its first incidence in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Although the case fatality rate of COVID-19 appears to be lower than that of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the higher transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 has caused the total fatality to surpass other viral diseases, reaching more than 1 million globally as of October 6, 2020. The rate at which the disease is spreading calls for a therapy that is useful for treating a large population. Multiple intersecting viral and host factor targets involved in the life cycle of the virus are being explored. Because of the frequent mutations, many coronaviruses gain zoonotic potential, which is dependent on the presence of cell receptors and proteases, and therefore the targeting of the viral proteins has some drawbacks, as strain-specific drug resistance can occur. Moreover, the limited number of proteins in a virus makes the number of available targets small. Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share common mechanisms of entry and replication, there are substantial differences in viral proteins such as the spike (S) protein. In contrast, targeting cellular factors may result in a broader range of therapies, reducing the chances of developing drug resistance. In this Review, we discuss the role of primary host factors such as the cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), cellular proteases of S protein priming, post-translational modifiers, kinases, inflammatory cells, and their pharmacological intervention in the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses.","output":"Targeting Crucial Host Factors of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic continues without specific treatment.

However, mainstream research mainly focuses on publicly available composite BCS confidence indicators and inspects their predictive accuracy. We depart from this stance by considering a battery of novel techniques for quantifying BCS-based leading indicators with the particular aim to evaluate their predictive characteristics compared to conventional BCS leading indicators. We build upon the recently established weighted balance method, forecast disagreement, and surprise index. Additionally, we differ from the standpoint of rational expectations by introducing indicators of irrational sentiment and adaptive expectations, which have not previously been used in BCS studies of this sort. Our analysis in industry, consumer, and retail trade sectors of 28 European economies reveals that most of these novel techniques (especially irrational sentiment and adaptive expectations) produce more accurate predictions of economic activity than standard BCS benchmarks.

DESIGN: Quality improvement report. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: First 3 years of experience of an inpatient geriatric hemodialysis rehabilitation program in Toronto. Patients with new-onset disability from prolonged illness or an acute event rendering them incapable of living independently. QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PLAN: Provision of in-patient rehabilitation with on-site dialysis; a simplified referral system; preferential admission of elderly dialysis patients; short daily dialysis sessions; integrated multidisciplinary care by experts in rehabilitation, geriatric medicine, and nephrology; and reciprocal continued medical education among staff. MEASURES: Outcome measures were percentage of patients discharged home, score on the Functional Independence Measure, and attainment of rehabilitation goals. RESULTS: In the first 36 months, 164 dialysis patients aged 74.5  7.8 years were admitted. On admission, patients had a mean Charlson comorbidity score of 7.8  2.5, 98% had difficulty walking, and 84% required help with bed-to-chair transfers. After a median of 48.5 days, 111 patients (69%) were discharged home; 15 patients (9%), to an assisted-living setting; 20 patients (12%), to a long-term care facility; and 18 patients (11%), to other facilities for acute or palliative care. Of those completing therapy, 82% met some or all of their rehabilitation goals. LIMITATIONS: The program relied on the leadership and drive of key personnel.

Although the majority of patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may not be infected with COVID-19, the quarantine and public health emergency measures may have affected this particular high risk group. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic on ACS admissions and clinical course in a tertiary care hospital in Portugal's most affected region. METHODS: This retrospective, case-control study included patients admitted with a diagnosis of ACS during March and April 2020 (pandemic group) and in the same period in 2019 (control group). Clinical course and complications were also assessed. RESULTS: During the pandemic, there were fewer ACS admissions but presentation was more severe, with a larger proportion of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (54.9% vs. 38.8%, p=0.047), higher maximum troponin levels and greater prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction at discharge (58.0% vs. 35.0%, p=0.01). In this population, although not statistically significant, it was observed a delay between the onset of symptoms and percutaneous coronary intervention, which may traduce a deferred search for urgent medical care during the pandemic.

METHODS: In total, 141 COVID-19 patients were assigned to group 1 (diabetes), group 2 (secondary hyperglycemia) or group 3 (controls). Initial and six- and twelve-month follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans were performed 16 days, 175 days and 351 days after symptom onset, respectively. CT findings and clinical and peak laboratory parameters were collected and compared. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the independent predictors for the presence of residual lung abnormalities at the 6-month follow-up exam. Seven variables (age; the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome; the duration of hospitalization; the peak levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein; and the initial total CT score) were chosen in the final multivariable models. RESULTS: At the six-month follow-up, abnormalities were still observed on chest CT in 77/141 (54.6%) patients. Reticular patterns (40/141, 28.4%) and ground-glass opacities (GGOs) (29/141, 20.6%) were the most common CT abnormalities on the follow-up CT scans. Patients in Groups 1 and 2 had significantly higher incidences of residual lung abnormalities than those in Group 3 (65.4% and 58.3%, respectively vs. 36.6%; p < 0.05). Twelve months after disease onset, the chest CT changes persisted in 13/25 (52.0%) patients. A duration of hospitalization > 20 days (OR: 5.630, 95% CI: 1.394C22.744, p = 0.015), an LDH level  317 U/L (OR: 7.020, 95% CI: 1.032C47.743, p = 0.046) and a total CT score > 15 (OR: 9.919, 95% CI: 1.378C71.415, p = 0.023) were independent predictors of residual pulmonary abnormalities in patients with diabetes or secondary hyperglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable proportion of surviving COVID-19 patients with diabetes or secondary hyperglycemia had residual pulmonary abnormalities six months after disease onset, and we found evidence of persistent chest CT changes at the one-year follow-up.

Since the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020, incidents of oxygen-related hospital fires in various countries around the world have caused over 200 deaths, the majority of whom were patients extremely ill with the novel Coronavirus. Fires involving medical oxygen are not a new phenomenon but are more common in the operating theatre where oxygen is routinely administered. In these settings, strict safety protocols are normally enforced and surgical staff are well trained in dealing with oxygen hazards. It appears that some hospitals may not have been fully prepared for the elevated risk of oxygen-related fire in intensive care units due to the high demand for oxygen therapy in severely ill Covid-19 patients. Indeed, gas producers and public health authorities were also slow to recognize and alert hospitals to the potential dangers. Oxygen is essential to life and generally makes up about 21% of the gases in the air we breathe. Pure oxygen reacts with common materials such as oil and grease to cause fires, and even explosions, when released at high pressures. A leaking valve or hose, and openings at interfaces of masks and tubes, when in a confined space or where air circulation is low, can quickly increase the oxygen concentration to a dangerous level. Even a small increase in the oxygen level in the air to 24% can create a fire hazard. In an oxygen-enriched environment, materials become easier to ignite and fires will burn hotter and more fiercely than in normal air. There is also a potentially heightened risk of using ethanol-based and organic solvents as cleaning agents in an oxygen rich atmospheres. This paper will provide an overview of oxygen accident scenarios that may be relevant for hospital intensive care units, with particular reference to recent events and similar accidents that have occurred in the past. The paper will recommend that hospitals recognize their chemical risks as part of their risk governance responsibility and assign chemical risk management a prominent role in their overall management. Investigation of dangerous events to extract causes and lessons learned should be utilized to highlight opportunities for prevention as well as emergency response. The industrial gas industry also needs to actively support hospitals in adoption of more rigorous risk management approaches, building on lessons learned in chemical process safety for managing flammable and explosive atmospheres.","output":"Reducing the risk of oxygen-related fires and explosions in hospitals treating Covid-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) is a two-stage procedure most frequently applied in the setting of an extended right-sided hemi-hepatectomy. Initial reports of high mortality have sparked debate regarding the safety and efficacy of the procedure. We describe a higher incidence of early post-operative bile duct strictures after ALPPS, a complication rarely seen after conventional liver resection. METHODS An institutional review was conducted to assess the incidence of post-operative biliary strictures following conventional right-sided or extended right-sided hemi-hepatectomy and ALPPS. Patient demographics and operative data were obtained from the patient database of Karolinska University Hospital. RESULTS Between 2010 and 2015, 528 hemi-hepatectomies or extended hemi-hepatectomies were performed, of which 500 were conventional liver resections and 28 were ALPPS. The incidence of post-operative biliary stricture was 10.7% (n = 3) following ALPPS, 1.4% (n = 2) following extended right-sided hepatectomy (P = 0.023; OR = 8.46; 95% CI 1.35-53.2) and 1.1% following formal right-sided hepatectomy (P = 0.004; OR = 11.0; 95% CI 2.11-57.6). All biliary strictures were at the level of the hilum affecting the left hepatic duct. Pre-operative comorbidity was less in the ALPPS group and post-operative complications were more severe following ALPPS. CONCLUSION Iatrogenic biliary strictures following conventional liver resection is an uncommon complication. It does, however, occur more frequently following ALPPS and is associated with an increased morbidity. Caution should therefore be exercised when dividing the right hilar pedicle at stage 2 of ALPPS.","output":"High incidence of biliary stricture after associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract We previously reported the engineering of an Npro-disrupted bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), BSD1-Npro/eGFP2A (Fan and Bird, 2008a).

The most severely affected patients are older men, individuals of black and Asian minority ethnicity and those with comorbidities. COVID-19 is also associated with an increased risk of hypercoagulability and venous thromboembolism. The overwhelming majority of patients admitted to hospital have respiratory failure and while most are managed on general wards, a sizeable proportion require intensive care support.

Other manifestations include GI symptoms, loss of taste and smell and thromboembolism. Here we introduce a case of suspected COVID-19 induced viral myocarditis in an 86 year old woman. Case presentation: An 86-year-old female with no reported past medical history, not on daily medications, was brought in by ambulance after fall and unable to get up for many hours. On presentation, she was in mild distress due to left sided musculoskeletal pain, afebrile, tachycardic, tachypneic, and saturating at 93% on room air. Patient denied chest pain throughout her hospitalization. Tenderness in the left chest wall, left upper and lower extremities was elicited on physical examination. Labs obtained were significant for a creatine kinase of 37,000 IU/L and troponin I of 9.93ng/mL. EKG showed nonspecific T wave abnormalities, and prolonged QTC of 548ms. Chest x-ray showed multifocal pneumonia with no features suggestive of trauma. She was admitted to telemetry for further management of COVID-91 pneumonia and cardiac work up. Her troponin I peaked to 12.52ng/mL and she was treated with empiric intravenous heparin and aspirin. Echocardiogram shows global hypokinesis with left ventricular ejection fraction of 35-40%. Heart failure regimen with beta blocker and aldosterone receptor blocker were started. Rhabdomyolysis normalized with intravenous fluids. For COVID-19 pneumonia, she received dexamethasone and remdesivir and was weaned to 4L oxygen on discharge. Discussion:Viral myocarditis often results from a combination of direct viral injury and subsequent cellular immune activation. There is limited knowledge for COVID-19 associated viral myocarditis;most documented cases are from existing case reports, where most patients are male, and under the age of 70 years. Diagnosis is often challenging, as endomyocardial biopsy is often forgone in the setting of the ongoing pandemic and increased infection risk. Treatment for viral myocarditis involves heart failure management followed by directed therapy based on suspected etiology. Lymphocytic myocarditis, as seen in the setting of COVID-19, would typically involve immunosuppression in the form of glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulin;although these regimens have yet to be extensively studied in COVID-19 associated myocarditis. As literature on this infection is rapidly evolving, it is vital to recognize and document suspected cases.

Here, we dissect the mechanism of function of CMT mutant glycyl-tRNA synthetase (CMT-GARS), using high-resolution ribosome profiling and reporter assays. We find that CMT-GARS mutants deplete the pool of glycyl-tRNA(Gly) available for translation and inhibit the first stage of elongation, the accommodation of glycyl-tRNA into the ribosomal A-site, which causes ribosomes to pause at glycine codons. Moreover, ribosome pausing activates a secondary repression mechanism at the level of translation initiation, by inducing the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eIF2 and the integrated stress response. Thus, CMT-GARS mutant triggers translational repression via two interconnected mechanisms, affecting both elongation and initiation of translation.","output":"CharcotCMarieCTooth mutation in glycyl-tRNA synthetase stalls ribosomes in a pre-accommodation state and activates integrated stress response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article is a critical inquiry into the shifting nature of the local and the proximate during the COVID-19 pandemic, through the ubiquitous usage of food delivery software applications, or gastro apps, in Bangalore, India.

Local recombination has also been identified in a few of them to facilitate bacterial rapid adaptation, although it remains unknown whether it is a common evolutionary mechanism for the porins or outer membrane proteins in Gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we investigated the beta-barrel (-barrel) porin-encoding genes in Escherichia coli that were reported under positive Darwinian selection. Besides fhuA that was found with ingenic local recombination previously, we identified four other genes, i.e., lamB, ompA, ompC, and ompF, all showing the similar mosaic evolution patterns. Comparative analysis of the protein sequences disclosed a list of highly variable regions in each family, which are mostly located in the convex of extracellular loops and coinciding with the binding sites of bacteriophages. For each of the porin families, mosaic recombination leads to unique combinations of the variable regions with different sequence patterns, generating diverse protein groups. Structural modeling indicated a conserved global topology among the different porins, with the extracellular surface varying a lot due to individual or combinatorial variable regions. The conservation of global tertiary structure would ensure the channel activity, while the wide diversity of variable regions may represent selection to avoid the invasion of phages, antibiotics or immune surveillance factors. Our study identified multiple bacterial porin genes with mosaic evolution. We hypothesize that this could be generalized strategy for outer membrane proteins to both maintain normal life processes and evade the attack of unfavored factors rapidly. IMPORTANCE Microevolution studies can disclose more elaborate evolutionary mechanisms of genes, appearing especially important for genes with multifaceted function such as those encoding outer membrane proteins. However, in most cases, the gene is considered as a whole unit, and the evolutionary patterns are disclosed. Here, we report that multiple bacterial porin proteins follow mosaic evolution, with local ingenic recombination combined with spontaneous mutations based on positive Darwinian selection, and conservation for most structural regions.

Also needed is the ability to provide vital radiation oncological care if radiation oncologists (RO) are reallocated to other departments. We implemented a novel remote RO SBRT coverage practice, requiring it to be reliable, of high audio and visual quality, timely, and the same level of specialty care as our current in-person treatment coverage practice. METHODS: All observed failure modes were recorded during implementation over the first 15 sequential fractions. The time from CBCT to treatment was calculated before and after implementation to determine timeliness of remote coverage. Image quality metrics were calculated between the imaging console screen and the RO's shared screen. Comfort levels with audio/visual communication as well as overall comfort in comparison to in-person RO coverage was evaluated using Likert scale surveys after treatment. RESULTS: Remote RO SBRT coverage was successfully implemented in 14/15 fractions with 3 observed process failures that were all corrected before treatment. Average times of pre-treatment coverage before and after implementation were 8.74 and 8.51min, respectively. The cross correlation between the imaging console screen and RO's shared screen was r=0.96 and lag was 0.05s. The average value for all survey questions was above 4.5, approaching in-person RO coverage comfort levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel method of remote RO SBRT coverage permits reduced personnel and patient interactions surrounding RT procedures. This may help to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in our department and provides a means for SBRT coverage if ROs are reallocated to other areas of the hospital for COVID-19 support.","output":"Implementation of a Novel Remote Physician SBRT Coverage Process during the Coronavirus Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New protein-coding genes can originate either through modification of existing genes or de novo. Recently, the importance of de novo origination has been recognized in eukaryotes, although eukaryotic genes originated de novo are relatively rare and difficult to identify. In contrast, viruses contain many de novo genes, namely those in which an existing gene has been overprinted by a new open reading frame, a process that generates a new protein-coding gene overlapping the ancestral gene. We analyzed the evolution of 12 experimentally validated viral genes that originated de novo and estimated their relative ages. We found that young de novo genes have a different codon usage from the rest of the genome. They evolve rapidly and are under positive or weak purifying selection. Thus, young de novo genes might have strain-specific functions, or no function, and would be difficult to detect using current genome annotation methods that rely on the sequence signature of purifying selection. In contrast to young de novo genes, older de novo genes have a codon usage that is similar to the rest of the genome. They evolve slowly and are under stronger purifying selection. Some of the oldest de novo genes evolve under stronger selection pressure than the ancestral gene they overlap, suggesting an evolutionary tug of war between the ancestral and the de novo gene.","output":"Evolution of Viral Proteins Originated De Novo by Overprinting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hydroxychloroquine is one of the most commonly used drugs in COVID-19 treatment.

The immunogenicity induced by the resulting recombinant RBD-rAAV was evaluated in BALB/c mice. The results demonstrated that (1) a single dose of RBD-rAAV vaccination could induce sufficient neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV infection; (2) two more repeated doses of the vaccination boosted the neutralizing antibody to about 5 times of the level achieved by a single dose of the immunization and (3) the level of the antibody continued to increase for the entire duration of the experiment of 5.5 months.

Children are one of the most susceptible groups for severe influenza. Clinical differentiation between viral and bacterial pneumonia is difficult to assess in children, so the aid of the complete blood count (CBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are used to differentiate between them. However, differential diagnosis between influenza-positive and -negative viral pneumonia is difficult. CRP levels have been found to be higher in H1N1 influenza adult patients. However, there are no studies regarding CBC, and CRP levels in pediatric patients with influenza-positive and -negative pneumonia. METHODS: From 2011 to 2016, we found children less than 18 years old with viral pneumonia who had positive viral RTCPCR test for adenovirus, bocavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Means for white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes and CRP were calculated. Comparisons between influenza and other respiratory viral pneumonia WBC and CRP means were made. Students t-test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: We analyzed 183 patients with positive viral pneumonia cases; of which, 37 (20.2%) had two viruses detected. Mean age was 1 year old and 56.5% were male. Viral detections were rhinovirus 75 (40.9%), RSV 45 (24.5%), influenza 31 (16.9%), metapneumovirus 30 (16.3%), bocavirus 20 (10.9%), parainfluenza 14 (7.6%), coronavirus 3 (1.6%) and adenovirus 2 (1.1%). Mean influenza WBC were 10,900  2040/L, neutrophils were 6998  1510/L, lymphocytes 2882  826/L and CRP 5.41  1.9 mg/dL. Mean influenza negative, viral-positive pneumonia were WBC 12227  868/L, neutrophils 6787  696/L, lymphocytes 4469  426/L, CRP 2.81  0.56 mg/dL. Lower lymphocyte counts (P = 0.002) and higher CRP levels (P = 0.019) were found in patients with influenza comparing them with pneumonia caused by other viruses. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, children with positive influenza pneumonia showed lower levels of lymphocytes and higher levels of CRP compared with negative influenza. Lower lymphocyte counts and high CRP levels have been found in influenza-positive patients mainly in adult studies. In children with suspected influenza pneumonia, lower lymphocyte counts and higher CRP levels can aid clinical diagnosis before molecular confirmation in influenza pneumonia.","output":"#83: Leukocytes and C-Reactive Protein Levels in Children with Influenza-positive and Influenza-negative Viral Pneumonia in a Third-level Pediatric Center in Mexico City from 2011 to 2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Lupus Myocarditis is a rare and severe manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus. We describe a patient with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) presenting with cardiogenic shock due to lupus myocarditis. DESCRIPTION: A 33 year old man with history of congenital HIV infection on anti-retroviral therapy, CD4 count 338/ mm3 and undetectable viral load, recurrent Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, disseminated zoster and chronic kidney disease stage 3 presented with shortness of breath for 2 weeks and hypotension with cold extremities and leg edema. Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated acute severe biventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 10%. CXR showed ground glass opacities with bibasilar consolidation. He was subsequently intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit for management of cardiogenic shock mixed with sepsis due to presumed multifocal pneumonia. He was treated with high dose vasopressors, inotropes and empiric antibiotics. Infectious work up revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in respiratory culture and negative viral infection including SARS-CoV-2. His course was complicated by worsening renal function with proteinuria and refractory metabolic acidosis required continuous venovenous hemofiltration and he suffered pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest with return of spontaneous circulation in 5 minutes. Coronary angiogram was normal. Auto-immune work up revealed elevated serologies: anti-Ds DNA >300 IU/ ml, Anti-Smith Ab: 1 (0-0.9 AI), Anti-chromatin Ab >8 (0 to 0.9 AI) with markedly low complement levels. Endomyocardial biopsy revealed lymphocytic infiltrate in endocardium and myocardium with no granulomas or thrombi. Based on these findings, he was diagnosed with lupus myocarditis and lupus nephritis. The patient clinically improved after treatment with pulse dose steroids and cyclophosphamide. His renal function recovered and cardiac function improved. He was weaned off from the ventilator and discharged to rehabilitation facility. DISCUSSION: Lupus Myocarditis requires urgent clinical attention as it may progress to heart failure and fatal cardiogenic shock.

At this stage, fast, accurate and early clinical assessment of the disease severity is vital. To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 485 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China, to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease mortality. For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the mortality of individual patients more than 10 days in advance with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia.

Systematic protocols to guide telehealth-centered interventions in response to COVID-19 outbreaks have yet to be delineated. This article is intended to inform PA/LTC facilities and neighboring health care partners how to collaboratively utilize telehealth-centered strategies to improve outcomes in facility outbreaks. Methods: The University of Virginia rapidly developed a multidisciplinary telehealth-centered COVID-19 facility outbreak strategy in response to a LTC facility outbreak in which 41 (out of 48) facility residents and 7 staff members tested positive. This strategy focused on supporting the facility team remotely using rapidly deployed technologic solutions. Goals included (1) early identification of patients who need their care escalated, (2) monitoring and treating patients deemed safe to remain in the facility, (3) care coordination to facilitate bidirectional transfers between the skilled nursing facility (SNF) and hospital, and (4) daily facility needs assessment related to technology, infection control, and staff well-being. To achieve these goals, a standardized approach centered on daily multidisciplinary virtual rounds and telemedicine consultation was provided. Results: Over a month since the outbreak began, 18 out of 48 (38%) facility residents required hospitalization and 6 (12.5%) died. Eleven facility residents have since returned back to the SNF after recovering from their hospitalization. No staff required hospitalization. Conclusions: Interventions that reduce hospitalizations and mortality are a critical need during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Most species are vectored by ticks (Ixodidae), with many zoonotic reservoir species among most terrestrial vertebrate groups. While the reservoir competence of many different vertebrate species is well known (e.g. birds, rodents and dogs), studies on insectivorous bats have been rarely performed despite their high species diversity, ubiquitous urban presence and importance in harboring zoonotic disease agents. Romania has a high diversity and ubiquity of bats. Moreover, seven out of eight SFG rickettsiae species with zoonotic potential were previously reported in Romania. Based on this, the aim of this study was to detect Rickettsia species in tissue samples in bats. METHODS: Here we report a large-scale study (322 bats belonging to 20 species) on the presence of Rickettsia spp. in Romanian bat species. Tissue samples from insectivorous bats were tested for the presence of Rickettsia DNA using PCR detection amplifying a 381 bp fragment of the gltA gene. Positive results were sequenced to confirm the results. The obtained results were statistically analyzed by chi-squared independence test. RESULTS: Positive results were obtained in 14.6% of bat samples. Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of R. monacensis in two bat species (Nyctalus noctula and Pipistrellus pipistrellus) in two locations.

Furthermore, gatherings at the end of the year and the beginning of next year are expected to worsen the effects. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the importance of prediction timing rather than prediction of the number of confirmed cases. Thus, in this study, five groups were set according to minimum, maximum, and high variability. Through empirical data analysis, the groups were subdivided into a total of 19 cases. The cumulative number of COVID-19 confirmed cases is predicted using the auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and compared with the actual number of confirmed cases.

The authors clarified the critical attributes of the government, organization management system and consumer behaviour using mediation-moderation models and demonstrated how those critical attributes influenced customer consumption intention during COVID-19 in Taiwan. Design/methodology/approach: Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, this research is mainly distributed through online questionnaires through Facebook and other social media channels to recruit volunteers. Second, the pre-test survey used 100 questionnaires collected from juniors and seniors from a university in northern Taiwan to make predictions. Third, this study also conducted a questionnaire validity analysis, which identified 9 criteria and 34 items. Fourth, the questionnaire collected samples for a total of three months. Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypotheses in a sample of 1,098 consumers in Taiwan. Findings: This study considers government, enterprise and consumer levels and conducts relevant factor analysis from consumers perspectives to understand the changes in consumer behaviour under COVID-19 influence. Regarding mediation, this study finds that information and communication mediate the relationships between crisis management and COVID-19 impact. Regarding moderation, this study exposes the critical moderating part of human resources, that hygiene and safety strengthen the relationships between COVID-19 impact and attitude towards life and that perceived anxiety strengthens the relationship between attitude towards life and consumption intention. Practical implications: During COVID-19, restaurants should cooperate with the government to reduce the risk of community infection. Therefore, the government also needs to cooperate with restaurant companies to enhance the industrial economy, actively communicate with consumers and provide correct and sufficient information. At the same time, restaurant enterprises also need to have sufficient human resource arrangements, hygiene and safety planning to eliminate consumers doubts. Originality/value: These findings indicate that consumers consumption intention to eat out is affected by the COVID-19 impact and attitude towards life. This research also confirms that perceived anxiety has a mediating effect on the relationship between consumer attitudes towards life and consumption intentions. To improve the restaurant economic process, they should consider solutions to reduce consumers perception of the COVID-19 impact and fear of eating out. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Critical criteria for enhancing consumption intention in restaurants during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nidoviruses and arenaviruses are the only known RNA viruses encoding a 3'-5' exonuclease domain (ExoN). The proofreading activity of the ExoN domain has played a key role in the growth of nidoviral genomes, while in arenaviruses this domain partakes in the suppression of the host innate immune signaling. Sequence and structural homology analyses suggest that these proteins have been hijacked from cellular hosts many times. Analysis of the available nidoviral ExoN sequences reveals a high conservation level comparable to that of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp), which are the most conserved viral proteins. Two highly preserved zinc fingers are present in all nidoviral exonucleases, while in the arenaviral protein only one zinc finger can be identified. This is in sharp contrast with the reported lack of zinc fingers in cellular ExoNs, and opens the possibility of therapeutic strategies in the struggle against COVID-19.","output":"Structural analysis of viral ExoN domains reveals polyphyletic hijacking events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is spreading since December 2019. In an attempt to contain the disease, health authorities call for self-quarantine of individuals suspected as exposures. Health officials assume the public will comply in high rates; however, studies suggest that a major obstacle to compliance for household quarantine is concern over loss of income. A cross sectional study of the adult population of Israel was conducted in the last week of February 2020 to assess public attitudes toward the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, public compliance rates with self-quarantine were assessed depending on compensation for lost wages. The results suggest that when compensation was assumed, the compliance rate was 94%; yet, when compensation was removed, the compliance rate dropped to less than 57%. This study demonstrates that providing people with assurances for their livelihood during self-quarantine is an important component in compliance with public health regulations.

However, there is no conclusive evidence that inclusive health care policies lead to better outcomes for this group of the population. The aim of this study is to analyse whether there is an association between inclusive health care policies and the mortality patterns of undocumented immigrants, or the distribution of different causes of death among those who have died. METHODS: We analyse individual data concerning the deceased in Switzerland between 2011 and 2017. We proceed in two steps. First, we estimate and compare the patterns of mortality of Swiss citizens, documented immigrants, and undocumented immigrants. Second, we test whether there is an association between cantonal authorities policies and differing mortality patterns. We use logistic regressions and multinomial regressions to estimate the relationship between legal status and mortality patterns both in Switzerland and across different cantons. RESULTS: We find a difference in the patterns of mortality between undocumented immigrants and the other groups of the population. Specifically, death from circulatory system diseases is twice as frequent among undocumented immigrants compared to documented immigrants and Swiss citizens. However, this difference is smaller in the Swiss cantons that have more inclusive health care policies towards undocumented immigrants. CONCLUSIONS: We interpret these results as an indication that policies that expand access to health services lead to better outcomes for undocumented immigrants. This finding has implications for research on civic stratification and public health. Further analysis is needed to evaluate the effects of extending public health care for undocumented immigrants in different contexts.

These measures carry a high economic and social cost, and might have little effect on COVID-19 epidemics if there are many more cases resulting from local transmission compared with imported cases. Our study aims to investigate the extent to which imported cases contribute to local transmission under different epidemic conditions. METHODS: To inform decisions about international travel restrictions, we calculated the ratio of expected COVID-19 cases from international travel (assuming no travel restrictions) to expected cases arising from internal spread, expressed as a proportion, on an average day in May and September, 2020, in each country. COVID-19 prevalence and incidence were estimated using a modelling framework that adjusts reported cases for under-ascertainment and asymptomatic infections. We considered different travel scenarios for May and September, 2020: an upper bound with estimated travel volumes at the same levels as May and September, 2019, and a lower bound with estimated travel volumes adjusted downwards according to expected reductions in May and September, 2020. Results were interpreted in the context of local epidemic growth rates. FINDINGS: In May, 2020, imported cases are likely to have accounted for a high proportion of total incidence in many countries, contributing more than 10% of total incidence in 102 (95% credible interval 63-129) of 136 countries when assuming no reduction in travel volumes (ie, with 2019 travel volumes) and in 74 countries (33-114) when assuming estimated 2020 travel volumes. Imported cases in September, 2020, would have accounted for no more than 10% of total incidence in 106 (50-140) of 162 countries and less than 1% in 21 countries (4-71) when assuming no reductions in travel volumes. With estimated 2020 travel volumes, imported cases in September, 2020, accounted for no more than 10% of total incidence in 125 countries (65-162) and less than 1% in 44 countries (8-97). Of these 44 countries, 22 (2-61) had epidemic growth rates far from the tipping point of exponential growth, making them the least likely to benefit from travel restrictions. INTERPRETATION: Countries can expect travellers infected with SARS-CoV-2 to arrive in the absence of travel restrictions. Although such restrictions probably contribute to epidemic control in many countries, in others, imported cases are likely to contribute little to local COVID-19 epidemics. Stringent travel restrictions might have little impact on epidemic dynamics except in countries with low COVID-19 incidence and large numbers of arrivals from other countries, or where epidemics are close to tipping points for exponential growth. Countries should consider local COVID-19 incidence, local epidemic growth, and travel volumes before implementing such restrictions.

Estimates of incidence vary between countries, due to different age distributions chosen, case definitions and choice of denominator (persons vaccinated vs immunizations given). This study clarifies these estimates by pooling data from ten countries and examining differences by age group. Methods: We examined case reports, press releases and immunization data and calculated pooled estimates of VITT incidence using random effects models. Sensitivity analyses considered different combinations of countries and varying assumptions on time between vaccination and reporting of cases. Results: Pooling all countries, VITT incidence was 0.73 per 100,000 persons receiving first dose of Covishield/Vaxzevira [95% CI .43,1.23]. Incidence for age 65 and over was 0.11 per 100,000 persons [95% CI .05-.26], and significantly higher among those under age 55: 1.67 per 100,000 persons [95% CI 1.30-2.14] in the UK, 5.06 per 100,000 persons in Norway [95% CI 2.16, 11.86]. The latter had the best data on counts of persons vaccinated. Incidence for age 55 to 64 years was 0.34 [95% CI 0.13, 0.85] in the UK, lower than for under age 55. Conclusion: VITT is a rare vaccine-associated adverse event. Incidence estimates vary between jurisdictions. However, even the highest reported incidence from Norway is low - and in settings with high community transmission, lower than risk of serious outcomes associated with Covid-19.

The impact of the type of anesthesia used during mechanical thrombectomy on patient outcomes remains controversial. This review discusses the current literature on the effects of anesthesia type on patient outcome following endovascular stroke therapy. RECENT FINDINGS EVT is the standard of treatment for intracranial large vessel occlusions. Recent studies show that general anesthesia is associated with negative clinical outcome in AIS patients undergoing EVT. Two of the possible mechanisms of this finding are systolic hypotension and hypocapnia. However, the only published randomized controlled studies to date, sedation vs. intubation for endovascular stroke treatment and anesthesia during stroke showed no difference in short-term clinical outcome between EVT patients treated with general anesthesia and conscious sedation and improved longer-term outcome in the general anesthesia group. SUMMARY Retrospective reports, and the 2015 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Guideline (focused update of the 2013 guidelines for the early management of patients with AIS regarding endovascular treatment) based on these reports, are in favor of sedation (conscious sedation) over general anesthesia for endovascular stroke thrombectomy. However, the two randomized controlled prospective studies published provide inconclusive evidence as to the best anesthetic practice for endovascular stroke therapy.

It belongs to the family coronaviriadae and the order Nidovirales. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA enveloped virus that includes spike proteins projecting from the envelope. The spike (S) protein interacts with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which plays a role in the viral entry into the cell. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is zoonotic, the wet animal market where live animals are sold is expected to be the source of infection. It is the third zoonotic coronavirus, after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Transmission of the virus among humans is confirmed by direct contact, droplet infection, fecal-oral, and blood transmission. The symptoms of COVID 19 include fever, dry cough, headache, and difficulty of breathing. COVID 19 complications, including the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute organ injury, secondary infection, and shock, are common in immunocompromised and elderly patients. Up till now, there is no established treatment for COVID-19, and supportive measures including mechanical ventilation and the use of nonspecific anti-viral therapies such as Remdesevir, Liponavir, and chloroquine are currently applied on the severe cases.

Schools can be opportune sites for delivery of mental health interventions. India, however, is without a whole-school mental health approach. This article describes the study design for the Safeguarding Adolescent Mental Health in India (SAMA) project. The aim of SAMA is to co-design and feasibility test a suite of multi-component interventions across the intersecting systems of adolescents, schools, families and their local communities in India. Methods and analysis Our project will co-design and feasibility test four interventions to run in parallel in eight schools (three assigned to waitlist) in Bengaluru and Kolar in Karnataka, India. The primary aim is to reduce the prevalence of adolescent anxiety and depression. Co-design of interventions will build on existing evidence and resources. Interventions for adolescents at school will be universal, incorporating curriculum and social components. Interventions for parents and teachers will target mental health literacy, and also for teachers, training in positive behaviour practices. Intervention in the school community will target school climate to improve student mental health literacy and care. Intervention for the wider community will be via adolescent-led films and social media. We will generate intervention cost estimates, test outcome measures and identify pathways to increase policy action on the evidence. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted by the National Institute of Mental Health Neurosciences Research Ethics Committee (NIMHANS/26th IEC (Behv Sc Div / 2020/2021)) and the University of Leeds School of Psychology Research Ethics Committee (PSYC-221).

PSD93, but not other MaGUKs, localizes to the axon initial segment (AIS). Using lentiviral-mediated shRNA knockdown in rat hippocampal neurons, we find that ZDHHC14 controls palmitoylation and AIS clustering of PSD93 and also of Kv1 potassium channels, which directly bind PSD93. Neurodevelopmental expression of ZDHHC14 mirrors that of PSD93 and Kv1 channels and, consistent with ZDHHC14s importance for Kv1 channel clustering, loss of ZDHHC14 decreases outward currents and increases action potential firing in hippocampal neurons. To our knowledge, these findings identify the first neuronal roles and substrates for ZDHHC14 and reveal a previously unappreciated role for palmitoylation in control of neuronal excitability.","output":"The palmitoyl acyltransferase ZDHHC14 controls Kv1-family potassium channel clustering at the axon initial segment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The perception that women represent a low risk population for cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) needs to be reconsidered.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of puppet theater on oral health knowledge and oral hygiene in preschoolers from a Peruvian public school. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An analytical, longitudinal, and quasi-experimental study was conducted in 132 preschoolers divided into three age-matched groups (3, 4, and 5 years old) from August to November 2019 in a Peruvian public school. At 4 weeks and 4 months after performing the puppet theater, a validated questionnaire of five closed questions was used to evaluate oral health knowledge, and the GreeneCVermillion index [only bacterial plaque index (BPI) part] was used to evaluate oral hygiene, considering good (0C0.6), fair (0.7C1.8), and poor (1.9C3.0). The theater sessions were held every week for the first month and every 2 weeks for the following 3 months. To analyze the levels in the BPI, the Wilcoxon and Friedman test was used to compare related measures, and to compare the knowledge for each question of the questionnaire, the McNemar and Cochrans Q tests were used, considering a P-value less than 0.05. RESULTS: The BPI in relation to age (3, 4, and 5 years), before and after 4 months of performing the puppet theater, was 1.9 [confidence interval (CI): 1.7C2.0], 1.8 (CI: 1.6C1.9), and 1.8 (CI: 1.7C2.0), decreasing to 0.9 (CI: 0.8C1.0), 0.8 (CI: 0.7C0.9), and 0.9 (CI: 0.8C1.00), respectively. In relation to gender (men and women), it was 1.8 (CI: 1.7C2.0) and 1.8 (CI: 1.7C1.9), decreasing to 0.9 (CI: 0.8C1.0) and 0.8 (CI: 0.8C0.9), respectively. In relation to origin (urban or rural), it was 1.8 (CI: 1.7C1.9) and 1.8 (CI: 1.4C2.2), decreasing to 0.9 (CI: 0.8C0.9) and 0.8 (CI: 0.7C0.9), respectively.

Thus, investigating predictors of falls in patients waiting for THA would be valuable as it lead to more strategic interventions to prevent these problems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictors of falls in patients during the first year after THA. Methods: This is a prospective cohort study. A total of 157 patients who underwent THA for unilateral hip osteoarthritis were analyzed. The incidence of falls during the first year after THA was monitored, and patients were classified into a \\"faller\\" and \\"non-faller\\" group. The following factors were compared between the two groups: demographic data (age, sex, body mass index, leg length discrepancy, length of hospital stay, and history of falling), preoperative hip abductor muscle strength, functional performance (single leg stance and maximum walking speed), pain during walking, and physical activity. Results: On multivariate logistic regression analysis, preoperative hip abductor muscle strength on the affected side and a history of falling were predictors of falls during the first year after THA. On subsequent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, preoperative hip abductor muscle strength on the affected side was retained as a significant predictor, with a cut-off strength of 0.46 Nm/kg differentiating the faller and non-faller groups with a specificity of 73.6%, specificity of 50.0%, and area under the curve of 70.2%. Conclusions: Finding from the present study suggested that clinicians should focus on low preoperative hip abductor muscle strength on the affected side and a history of falling to prevent falls during the first year after THA.","output":"Predictors of falls in patients during the first year after total hip arthroplasty: A prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has rapidly spread worldwide.

Annually, 250,000 to 1 million women are diagnosed with a precursor to CC. The aim of this study was to assess whether Hispanics have a higher prevalence of cervical dysplasia compared to Non-Hispanics Whites among a population of low-income women. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the results of 10,911 cervical cytology tests administered between 2003 and 2016 that were funded through the Center for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) program for low-income, uninsured women entitled the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP). In the state of Arizona, the program is called the Well Women HealthCheck Program (WWHP). Logistic regression was used to identify increased risk of dysplasia, including low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL/ICC), and multinomial logistic regression was used to assess increased likelihood for LSIL and HSIL/ICC as separate categories. RESULTS: In the crude analysis, Hispanic ethnicity was modestly associated with higher prevalence of LSIL (odds ratio (OR)=1.39, 95% CI=1.01C1.91), but this association was not statistically significant after adjusting for confounders. However, in the final models, lower income was independently associated with LSIL (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=1.55, 95% CI=1.30C1.44), while smoking (aOR=2.88, 95% CI=1.21C6.84) and no history of Pap test within five years (aOR=3.54, 95% CI=1.61C6.99) were independently associated with HSIL. CONCLUSION: After adjusting for confounding in a sample of low-income women with comparable Pap screening rates, ethnicity was not associated with greater prevalence of abnormal pap smears. However, other variables were independently associated with LSIL and HSIL. The higher proportion of LSIL cases among lower income individuals compared to those with higher incomes, and the higher proportion of HSIL cases observed among those screened least regularly stresses the importance of programs like WWHP: programs that target low-income, uninsured women.

METHODS This study used data from the 2008-2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Overall, 1,089 patients with diabetes aged >40 years were included. The duration of daily sunlight exposure was assessed via health interviews. Comprehensive ophthalmic evaluations, including standard retinal fundus photography after pupil dilation, were conducted. Diabetic retinopathy was graded using the modified Airlie House Classification. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the association between daily sunlight exposure duration and the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. RESULTS The risk of diabetic retinopathy was 2.66 times higher in the group with 5 h of daily sunlight exposure than in the group with less exposure after adjusting for risk factors such as duration of diabetes, serum hemoglobin A1c level, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (P = 0.023). Furthermore, the risk of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy was 3.13 times higher in the group with 5 h of daily sunlight exposure than in the group with less exposure (P = 0.009). In patients with diabetes for <10 years, the risks of diabetic retinopathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy were 4.26 and 4.82 times higher in the group with 5 h of daily sunlight exposure than the group with less exposure, respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS This study revealed that sunlight exposure for 5 h a day was significantly associated with an increased risk of diabetic retinopathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in Korean patients with diabetes. The risks were significantly higher in patients with diabetes for <10 years. Therefore, reducing daily sunlight exposure could be an early preventive strategy against diabetic retinopathy in people with diabetes.","output":"Association between daily sunlight exposure duration and diabetic retinopathy in Korean adults with diabetes: A nationwide population-based cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims: Malaysia's first Movement Control Order (MCO) or lockdown was in place for 6 weeks to curb the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Consequently, all universities were forced to close temporarily with abrupt changes to teaching and learning activities. However, there has been a lack of consensus regarding students' actual psychological status and mental health during the MCO implementation. This study investigates the link, state, and differences of negative emotional symptoms, happiness, and work-life balance among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: This study recruited 1,005 university students across Malaysia. Data was collected online using Qualtrics to measure negative emotional symptoms (The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale), happiness (The Oxford Happiness Inventory), and work-life balance (Work-Family Conflict Scale). All data was analyzed using SPSS version 25 and AMOS version 26 using T-test, ANOVA, logistic regression analyses, and path analysis method. Findings: Findings indicated that 22, 34.3, and 37.3% of the university students scored moderate to extremely severe levels of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, respectively. Half scored rather happy or very happy (50%) for happiness levels. Meanwhile, 50.4 and 39.4% scored high to very high levels of work-to-family and family-to-work conflict. Significant differences in stress, anxiety, depression, happiness, work-family conflict, and family-work conflict were recorded across different demographic factors. Happiness was found to be a protective factor with a lesser likelihood of experiencing severe stress (OR = 0.240, 95% CI: 0.180, 0.321), anxiety (OR = 0.336, 95% CI: 0.273, 0.414), and depression (OR = 0.121, 95% CI: 0.088, 0.165) with higher happiness levels. Higher score of work-to-family conflict contributes to greater odds of having severe levels of anxiety (OR = 1.453, 95% CI: 1.161, 1.818). While greater likelihood of developing severe stress (OR = 1.468, 95% CI: 1.109, 1.943) and severe anxiety (OR = 1.317, 95% CI: 1.059, 1.638) under increasing score of family-to-work conflict. Besides, happiness is found to negatively linked with lower negative emotional symptoms, while work-family conflict and family-work conflict are positively linked with higher negative emotional symptoms. Conclusion: Lockdown implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have a significant impact on university students' negative emotional symptoms, happiness, and work-life balance. Happiness was found to be a protective factor while the state of work-life balance is a risk factor that can predict students' negative emotional symptoms.","output":"The Unprecedented Movement Control Order (Lockdown) and Factors Associated With the Negative Emotional Symptoms, Happiness, and Work-Life Balance of Malaysian University Students During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sweden's tourism industry stands out for its large contribution to the development of the national economy The vast size of the country makes it possible to trace differences in incoming tourist flows from neighbouring countries This circumstance accounts for the novelty of this study, which lies in viewing national tourism geography from the perspective of the theory of transboundary tourism-and-recreation region building Interregional differences in the structure of incoming tourist flows help identify the country's cross-border tourism-and-recreation regions and delineate their borders This research employs statistical and cartographic methods The incoming tourist flow to Sweden grew steadily until 2020 However, the Covid-19 crisis has led to a drastic reduction in the number of incoming tourists Based on the 2019 statistics, the findings confirm the existence of a developed transboundary tourism-and-recreation mesoregion that brings together Germany, Denmark, and Sweden The formation boasts strong tourist links There are another five cross-border tourism-and-recreation mesoregions: Sweden-Norway-Denmark, Middle Sweden-Norway, Sweden-Norway-Finland, Middle Sweden-Finland, and South Sweden-Finland The number of tourists visiting cross-border mesoregions indicates the degree of development of the latter","output":"Geography of Inbound Tourism and Transboundary Tourism-and-recreation Region Building in Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic required rapid scale of telemedicine as well as other digital workflows to maintain access to care while reducing infection risk. Both patients and clinicians who hadn't used telemedicine before were suddenly faced with a multi-step setup process to log into a virtual meeting. Unlike in-person examination rooms, locking a virtual meeting room was more error-prone and posed a risk of multiple patients joining the same online session. There was administrative burden on the practice staff who were generating and manually sending links to patients, and educating patients on device set up was time-consuming and unsustainable. A solution had to be deployed rapidly system-wide, without the usual roll out across months. Our answer was to design and implement a novel EHR-integrated web application called the Switchboard, in just two weeks. The Switchboard leverages a commercial, cloud-based video meeting platform and facilitates an end-to-end virtual care encounter workflow, from pre-visit reminders to post-visit SMS text message-based measurement of patient experience, with tools to extend contact-less workflows to in-person appointments. Over the first 11 months of the pandemic, the in-house platform has been adopted across 6 hospitals and >200 practices, scaled to 8,800 clinicians who at their peak conducted an average of 30,000 telemedicine appointments/week, and enabled over 10,000-20,000 text messages/day to be exchanged through the platform. Furthermore, it enabled our organization to convert from an average of 75% of telehealth visits being conducted via telephone to 75% conducted via video within weeks.","output":"Insourcing and scaling a telemedicine solution in under 2 weeks: Lessons for the digital transformation of health care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preliminary investigations of human corneal tissues from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cadaveric donors indicated that no severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA is present.

Interferon is a marker of host antiviral immunity, which is disordered in COVID-19 patients. ERV can affect the secretion of interferon through the cGAS-STING pathway. In this study, we explored whether IFN-I and HERV-K (HML-2) were activated in COVID-19 patients and whether there was an interaction between them. Methods. We collected blood samples from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. We first detected the expression of HERV-K (HML-2) gag, env, and pol genes and IFN-I-related genes between patients and healthy people by qPCR, synchronously detected VERO cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Then, the chromosome distributions of highly expressed HERV-K (HML-2) gag, env, and pol genes were mapped by the next-generation sequencing results, and GO analysis was performed on the related genes. Results. We found that the HERV-K (HML-2) gag, env, and pol genes were highly expressed in COVID-19 patients and VERO cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. The interferon-related genes IFNB1, ISG15, and IFIT1 were also activated in COVID-19 patients, and GO analysis showed that HERV-K (HML-2) can regulate the secretion of interferon. Conclusions. The high expression of HERV-K (HML-2) might activate the increase of interferon in COVID-19 patients, proving that HERV-K does not only play a negative role in the human body.","output":"High Expression of HERV-K (HML-2) Might Stimulate Interferon in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Topically applied analgesic therapies have been used throughout history to treat a variety of patient conditions that present with pain. Before modem pharmaceuticals became readily available, mud-based emollients, salves, cold therapies, and other natural remedies were often used. Now we have effective therapies and are developing advanced topical analgesics as we learn more about the physiology and pathophysiology of pain. The use of topical analgesics may be associated with fewer patient systemic side effects than are seen with oral, parenteral, or transdermally administered agents, making the topical route of administration attractive to prescribers and patients. With further refinement of existing drugs and the development of novel agents, topical analgesics may offer relief for treating patient pain conditions that are currently challenging to treat, such as pain resulting from burns, wound debridement, and pressure ulcers. Recognizing the value of a multimodal approach, topical analgesics may offer a therapeutic option that can become part of a comprehensive treatment plan for the patient. With continued advancements in targeted drug-delivery systems, topical analgesics may be able to provide a method to prevent or reverse the phenomena of peripheral and central sensitization, or the neuroplastic changes believed to be responsible for the transition from acute to chronic pain states in patients. For those patients at risk for developing chronic pain states, such as complex regional pain syndrome, the combination of cutaneous stimulation (achieved through rubbing during application) and analgesic effects produced by the drug itself may prevent the disabling pain that often emerges during the subacute phase of disease. In summary, better utilization of currently available topical analgesics and continued research promise to ensure that topical analgesics are, and will continue to be, important tools in the treatment of patients with resistant pain.","output":"The future of topical analgesics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Developmental tasks of adolescence involve identity formation, building relationships, and achieving independence.

The global population continues to grow and people are becoming wealthier, so the food production system must respond by creating enough high-quality food to feed everyone with minimal damage to our environment. The number of people suffering or dying from diet-related chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer, continues to rise, which is partly linked to overconsumption of highly processed foods, especially high-calorie orrapidly digestible foods. After falling for many years, the number of people suffering from starvation or malnutrition is rising, and this has been exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The highly integrated food supply chains that spread around the world are susceptible to disruptions due to policy changes, economic stresses, and natural disasters, as highlighted by the recent pandemic. In this perspective article, written by members of the Editorial Committee of the Annual Review of Food Science and Technology, we highlight some of the major challenges confronting the modern food supply chain as well as how innovations in policy and technology can be used to address them. Pertinent technological innovations include robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, advanced diagnostics, nanotechnology, biotechnology, gene editing, vertical farming, and soft matter physics. Many of these technologies are already being employed across the food chain by farmers, distributors, manufacturers, and consumers to improve the quality, nutrition, safety, and sustainability of the food supply. These innovations are required to stimulate the development and implementation of new technologies to ensure a more equitable, resilient, and efficient food production system. Where appropriate, these technologies should be carefully tested before widespread implementation so that proper risk-benefit analyses can be carried out. They can then be employed without causing unforeseen adverse consequences. Finally, it is important to actively engage all stakeholders involved in the food supply chain throughout the development and testing of these new technologies to support their adoption if proven safe and effective. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Food Science and Technology, Volume 12 is March 2021.

This pandemic overlaps with the ongoing epidemics of cigarette smoking and electronic cigarette (e-cig) vaping, with over 1 billion smokers and vapers worldwide. However, there is scarce data relating COVID-19 risks and outcome with cigarette or e-cig use. In this study, we mined 3 independent RNA expression datasets from smokers and vapers to understand the potential relationship between vaping/smoking and the dysregulation of key genes and pathways related to COVID-19. We found that smoking, but not vaping, upregulates ACE2, the cellular receptor that SARS-CoV-2 requires for infection. Both smoking and use of nicotine and flavor-containing e-cig led to upregulations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and expression of genes related to inflammasomes. Vaping flavor-less and nicotine-less e-cig, however, did not lead to significant cytokine dysregulation and inflammasome activation. Release of inflammasome products, such as IL-1B, and cytokine storms are hallmarks of COVID-19 infection, especially in severe cases. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that smoking or vaping, specifically use of flavored or nicotine-containing e-cigs, may critically exacerbate COVID-19-related inflammation or increase susceptibility to the disease. Further scientific and public health investigations should be undertaken to address these concerning links between COVID-19 and e-cig/smoking.","output":"Tobacco, but not nicotine and flavor-less electronic cigarettes, induces ACE2 and immune dysregulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: ADHD limits the ability to comply with Covid-19 prevention recommendations.

While deep learning (DL) has proved successful on numerous other tasks, it is under-researched in the context of blind WSN calibration, particularly in scenarios with networks that mix static and mobile sensors. In this paper we investigate the use of DL architectures for such scenarios, including the effects of weather in both drifting and sensor measurement. New models are proposed and compared against a baseline, based on a previous proposed model and extended to include mobile sensors and weather data. Also, a procedure for generating simulated air quality data is presented, including the emission, dispersion and measurement of the two most common particulate matter pollutants: PM 2.5 and PM 10 . Results show that our models reduce the calibration error with an order of magnitude compared to the baseline, showing that DL is a suitable method for WSN calibration and that these networks can be remotely calibrated with minimal cost for the deployer.","output":"Blind Calibration of Air Quality Wireless Sensor Networks Using Deep Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To describe the response of breathing pattern and inspiratory effort upon changes in assist level and to assesss if changes in respiratory rate may indicate changes in respiratory muscle effort. METHODS: Prospective study of 82 patients ventilated on proportional assist ventilation (PAV+). At three levels of assist (20%-50%-80%), patients inspiratory effort and breathing pattern were evaluated using a validated prototype monitor. RESULTS: Independent of the assist level, a wide range of respiratory rates (16-35br/min) was observed when patients effort was within the accepted range. Changing the assist level resulted in paired changes in inspiratory effort and rate of the same tendency (increase or decrease) in all but four patients. Increasing the level in assist resulted in a 31% (8-44%) decrease in inspiratory effort and a 10% (0-18%) decrease in respiratory rate. The change in respiratory rate upon the change in assist correlated modestly with the change in the effort (R = 0.5). CONCLUSION: Changing assist level results in changes in both respiratory rate and effort in the same direction, with change in effort being greater than that of respiratory rate. Yet, neither the magnitude of respiratory rate change nor the resulting absolute value may reliably predict the level of effort after a change in assist.","output":"Inspiratory effort and breathing pattern change in response to varying the assist level: a physiological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to analyze the influence of COVID-19 social distancing on the dietary pattern of university students in the Northeast of Brazil and associated factors.

A food frequency questionnaire was used to evaluate diet. Weight and dietary alterations were reported. Exploratory factor analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used as statistical analyses. The mean age was 26 and 53.7% of the students observed an increase in their weight. Four dietary patterns were identified: (1) a predominantly in natura pattern, (2) a pattern of processed and ultra-processed foods, (3) a protein-based pattern, and (4) an infusion-based pattern. It was observed that students having a darker skin colour (OR 1.8; CI 95% 1.3-2.6) and 19 to 29 years old and not being a health course student (OR 1.5; CI 95% 1.1-2.1) were associated with greater adhesion to the in natura pattern.

Potential therapies and prophylaxis against COVID-19 are urgently needed to combat this novel infection. As a result of in vitro evidence suggesting zinc sulphate may be efficacious against COVID-19, our hospitals began using zinc sulphate as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. AIM: To compare outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients ordered to receive hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin plus zinc sulphate versus hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone. METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective observational study. Data was collected from medical records for all patients with admission dates ranging from 2 March 2020 through to 11 April 2020. Initial clinical characteristics on presentation, medications given during the hospitalization, and hospital outcomes were recorded. The study included patients admitted to any of four acute care NYU Langone Health Hospitals in New York City. Patients included were admitted to the hospital with at least one positive COVID-19 test and had completed their hospitalization. Patients were excluded from the study if they were never admitted to the hospital or if there was an order for other investigational therapies for COVID-19. RESULTS: Patients taking zinc sulphate in addition to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (n=411) and patients taking hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone (n=521) did not differ in age, race, sex, tobacco use or relevant comorbidities. The addition of zinc sulphate did not impact the length of hospitalization, duration of ventilation or intensive care unit (ICU) duration. In univariate analyses, zinc sulphate increased the frequency of patients being discharged home, and decreased the need for ventilation, admission to the ICU and mortality or transfer to hospice for patients who were never admitted to the ICU. After adjusting for the time at which zinc sulphate was added to our protocol, an increased frequency of being discharged home (OR 1.53, 95 % CI 1.12C2.09) and reduction in mortality or transfer to hospice among patients who did not require ICU level of care remained significant (OR 0.449, 95 % CI 0.271C0.744).

To support the chromatographic results the adsorption capability of HypercarbTM for selected antioxidants and UV absorbers has been determined by Raman spectroscopy and argon physisorption measurements. The shift of the Graphite-band in the Raman spectra of HypercarbTM upon infusion with additives correlates with the changes in the Adsorption Potential Distributions. The results of argon physisorption measurements go hand in hand with the chronology of desorption of the additives in liquid chromatography experiments.

This review addresses the current knowledge on genetic factors associated with the development of iTTP and the interplay between the patients immune system and environmental factors in the induction of autoimmunity against ADAMTS13. HLA-DRB1*11 has been identified as a risk factor for iTTP in the Caucasian population. Interestingly, HLA-DRB1*08:03 was recently identified as a risk factor in the Japanese population. Combined in vitro and in silico MHC class II peptide presentation approaches suggest that an ADAMTS13-derived peptide may bind to both HLA-DRB1*11 and HLA-DRB1*08:03 through different anchor-residues. It is apparent that iTTP is associated with the presence of infectious microorganisms, viruses being the most widely associated with development of iTTP. Infections may potentially lead to loss of tolerance resulting in the shift from immune homeostasis to autoimmunity. In the model we propose in this review, infections disrupt the epithelial barriers in the gut or lung, promoting exposure of antigen presenting cells in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue to the microorganisms. This may result in breach of tolerance through the presentation of microorganism-derived peptides that are homologous to ADAMTS13 on risk alleles for iTTP.","output":"Emerging Concepts in Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic is a substantial challenge for healthcare systems.

The current therapy for HCV infection consists of a combination of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin. On the other hand, HCV-related liver disease is also the leading indication for liver transplantation. However, posttransplant HCV re-infection of the graft has been reported to be universal.

Responses to date have been highly variable and it is not clear whether public health guidance has been informed by the best available evidence. We conducted a systematic review to synthesise the evidence on outbreaks of highly contagious diseases in prison. METHODS: We searched seven electronic databases for peer-reviewed articles and official reports published between 1 January 2000 and 28 July 2020. We included quantitative primary research that reported an outbreak of a given contagious disease in a correctional facility and examined the effects of interventions. We excluded studies that did not provide detail on interventions. We synthesised common themes using the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) guideline, identified gaps in the literature and critically appraised the effectiveness of various containment approaches. RESULTS: We identified 28 relevant studies. Investigations were all based in high-income countries and documented outbreaks of tuberculosis, influenza (types A and B), varicella, measles, mumps, adenovirus and COVID-19. Several themes were common to these reports, including the public health implications of infectious disease outbreaks in prison, and the role of interagency collaboration, health communication, screening for contagious diseases, restriction, isolation and quarantine, contact tracing, immunisation programmes, epidemiological surveillance and prison-specific guidelines in addressing any outbreaks. DISCUSSION: Prisons are high-risk settings for the transmission of contagious diseases and there are considerable challenges in managing outbreaks in them.

The functional capabilities of ML models in epidemiological research, especially for COVID-19, is not substantially explored. To bridge this gap, this study has adopted two advanced ML models, viz. Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM), to perform the regression modelling and provide subsequent interpretation. Five successive steps were followed to carry out the analysis: (1) identification of relevant key explanatory variables; (2) application of data dimensionality reduction for eliminating redundant information; (3) utilizing ML models for measuring relative influence (RI) of the explanatory variables; (4) evaluating interconnections between and among the key explanatory variables and COVID-19 case and death counts; (5) time series analysis for examining the rate of incidences of COVID-19 cases and deaths.

The results reveal that, firstly, based on their food health and risk perceptions of healthy and risky food, the respondents' general attitudes are positive toward organic food but relatively negative toward game meat. Secondly, older generations have a more positive attitude and are more committed to organic food. Younger generations' attitude toward game meat is more negative whereas older generations attach more importance to it because of its nutritional and medicinal values. In addition, this research also indicates that the COVID-19 crisis influences the respondents' perceptions of and attitudes toward organic food and game meat consumption. However, the likelihood of its impact on older generations' future change in diets is smaller, which implies that older generations' food beliefs are more stable.","output":"Generational Differences in Perceptions of Food Health/Risk and Attitudes toward Organic Food and Game Meat: The Case of the COVID-19 Crisis in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Personal protective equipment (PPE) is used to protect the health-care professional from bacterial, viral, or other hazards during this COVID-19 pandemic, and they should be made aware of proper usage of this equipment. AIMS: The aim was to evaluate how adequate knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) of health-care worker toward the appropriate use of PPE, which can prevent them and the community from virus contamination. METHODOLOGY: This study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic in a span of approximately 50 days. This cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was done in 155 health-care providers posted in the COVID-19 area. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Data were described in terms of range; mean  standard deviation, frequencies (number of cases) and relative frequencies (percentages) as appropriate. RESULTS: Health-care workers (HCWs) were aware of the importance and criticality of donning and doffing procedure, but they lack the knowledge about dispersion of virus as 62% responded that virus dispersion occurs more during donning than doffing. Gaps were found in attitude as 51% of HCWs found it inconvenient to don PPE that they sometimes think of compromising their own safety. Nearly 33.5% of HCWs move out of the doffing area without removing gloves and N-95, which needs serious correction in their practice. CONCLUSION: There were major gaps in KAP at institutional level among the health-care providers with regard to donning and doffing of PPE during the beginning of this pandemic.","output":"A Cross-Sectional Study on Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices of Donning and Doffing of Personal Protective Equipment: An Institutional Survey of Health-Care Staff during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Early identification of patients with COVID-19 who may develop critical illness is of great importance. METHODS: In this study a retrospective cohort of 264 COVID-19 cases admitted at Macarena University was used for development and internal validation of a risk score to predict the occurrence of critical illness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Backward stepwise logistic regression was used to derive the model, including clinical and laboratory variables predictive of critical illness. Internal validation of the final model used bootstrapped samples and the model scoring derived from the coefficients. External validation was performed in a cohort of 154 cases admitted at Valme and Virgen del Rocio University Hospital. RESULTS: A total of 62 (23.5%) patients developed a critical illness during their hospitalization stay, 21 (8.0%) patients needed invasive ventilation, 34 (12.9%) were admitted at the ICU and the overall mortality was of 14.8% (39 cases). 5 variables were included in the final model: age >59.5 years (OR: 3.11;95%CI 1.39-6.97), abnormal CRP results (OR: 5.76;95%CI 2.32-14.30), abnormal lymphocytes count (OR: 3.252;95%CI 1.56-6.77), abnormal CK results (OR: 3.38;95%CI 1.59-7.20) and abnormal creatinine (OR: 3.30;95%CI 1.42-7.68).

Among the cylindrical-shaped epithelial cells, mucus-producing and caveolin-1 (Cav-1)-expressing cells can be distinguished. Occasionally, the cuboidal-shaped cells also express Cav-1, which suggests that they are precursors of both mucus-producing and Cav-1-expressing cells. Very virulent infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) impedes the differentiation of Cav-1-expressing cells and shifts the differentiation of cuboidal cells towards mucus-producing cells. In control birds exclusively, the IFE surface shows a mucous membrane, but after IBDV infection, the surfaces of both IFE and FAE are also covered by a mucous membrane. After IBDV infection, the cells of FAE also produce mucus, providing evidence for cell transformation. In late postinfection (pi; 28 d pi), the Cav-1 expression returned in the IFE cells, whereas the follicle (the primary lymphoid organ) underwent atrophy. The appearance of the renewed Cav-1-positive cells is similar to that of the normal basal cell, but they randomly locate in different levels of IFE, suggesting the loss of epithelial polarity. Between days 2 and 7 pi, the Cav-1 expression in the endothelial cells of the cortico-medullary capillary web is variable, which may explain the hemorrhage in several infected birds. The IBDV infection stops the Cav-1 expression and subsequently the cholesterol efflux into the bursal lumen.

Among the most noticeable shortages was the lack of face shields. The urgent demand for PPE induced interdisciplinary cooperation to overcome the shortages, and additive manufacturing proved to be ideal for the crisis situation. OBJECTIVES To investigate the possibilities of implementing additive manufacturing technologies in the interventional fabrication of protective face shields for medical staff. MATERIAL AND METHODS An Ender 3 Pro 3D printer was used to print headbands and Cura 4.4 was chosen as the slicing software. Open source face shield designs were downloaded as standard tessellation language (STL) files and compared. Only models with scientific support were taken under consideration. RESULTS The mean time for producing the headbands tested ranged from 59 min to almost 3 h, depending on the design. After setting up our low budget printer and choosing the Prusa RC 3 protective face shield as the main product, we were able to fabricate about 30 face shields per week at a cost of about 1 each. During 4 weeks, 126 face shields were produced and delivered to various hospital wards, which substantially eased the shortages. CONCLUSIONS Additive manufacturing enables immediate responses to needs in emergency situations, and allows for mass production of personal protective equipment in a short time due the rapid exchange of data among printer users. Despite the unregulated legal situation and insufficient scientific evidence, such protective equipment has been approved by clinicians and is currently used by medical personnel around the world.","output":"Additive manufacturing technologies enabling rapid and interventional production of protective face shields and masks during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the effectiveness of two doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines against COVID-19 with the original virus and other lineages circulating in France. METHODS: In this nationwide case-control study, cases were SARS-CoV-2 infected adults with onset of symptoms between 14 February and 3 May 2021. Controls were non-infected adults from a national representative panel matched to cases by age, sex, region, population density and calendar week. Participants completed an online questionnaire on recent activity-related exposures and vaccination history. Information about the infecting virus was based on a screening RT-PCR for either B.1.1.7 or B.1.351/P.1 variants. FINDINGS: Included in our analysis were 7 288 adults infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, 31 313 with the B.1.1.7 lineage, 2 550 with B.1.351/P1 lineages, and 3 644 controls. In multivariable analysis, the vaccine effectiveness (95% confidence interval) seven days after the second dose of mRNA vaccine was estimated at 88% (81-92), 86% (81-90) and 77% (63-86) against COVID-19 with the original virus, the B.1.1.7 lineage, and the B.1.351/P.1 lineages, respectively. Recent (2 to 6 months) history of virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was found to be 83% (76-88), 88% (85-91) and 83% (71-90) protective against COVID-19 with the original virus, the B.1.1.7 lineage, and the B.1.351/P.1 lineages, respectively; and more distant (> 6 months) infections were 76% (54-87), 84% (75-90), and 74% (41-89) protective against COVID-19 with the original virus, the B.1.1.7 lineage, and the B.1.351/P.1 lineages, respectively.

Ensuring access to care, irrespective of COVID-19 status, in winter 2020-2021 is essential. METHODS: An integrated model of hospital capacity planning and epidemiological projections of COVID-19 patients is used to estimate the demand for and resultant spare capacity of ICU beds, staff and ventilators under different epidemic scenarios in France, Germany and Italy across the 2020-2021 winter period. The effect of implementing lockdowns triggered by different numbers of COVID-19 patients in ICUs under varying levels of effectiveness is examined, using a 'dual-demand' (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) patient model. RESULTS: Without sufficient mitigation, we estimate that COVID-19 ICU patient numbers will exceed those seen in the first peak, resulting in substantial capacity deficits, with beds being consistently found to be the most constrained resource. Reactive lockdowns could lead to large improvements in ICU capacity during the winter season, with pressure being most effectively alleviated when lockdown is triggered early and sustained under a higher level of suppression. The success of such interventions also depends on baseline bed numbers and average non-COVID-19 patient occupancy. CONCLUSION: Reductions in capacity deficits under different scenarios must be weighed against the feasibility and drawbacks of further lockdowns. Careful, continuous decision-making by national policymakers will be required across the winter period 2020-2021.","output":"Modelling intensive care unit capacity under different epidemiological scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic in three Western European countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The growth of respiratory diseases, as witnessed through the SARS and COVID-19 outbreaks, and antimicrobial-resistance together pose a serious threat to humanity. One reason for antimicrobial resistance is formation of bacterial biofilms. In this study the sulphated polysaccharides from green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr-SPs) is tested for its antibacterial and antibiofilm potential against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens. Agar cup assay clearly indicated the antibacterial potential of Cr-SPs. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(50)) of Cr-SPs against Klebsiella pneumoniae was found to be 850 g/ml, and it is 800 g/ml in Serratia marcescens. Time-kill and colony-forming ability assays suggest the concentration-dependent bactericidal potential of Cr-SPs. Cr-SPs showed 74C100% decrease in biofilm formation in a concentration-dependent manner by modifying the cell surface hydrophobic properties of these bacteria. Cr-SPs have also distorted preformed-biofilms by their ability to interact and destroy the extra polymeric substance and eDNA of the matured biofilm. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that Cr-SPs effectively altered the morphology of these bacterial cells and distorted the bacterial biofilms. Furthermore reduced protease, urease and prodigiosin pigment production suggest that Cr-SPs interferes the quorum sensing mechanism in these bacteria. The current study paves way towards developing Cr-SPs as a control strategy for treatment of respiratory tract infections.","output":"Algal polysaccharides potential to combat respiratory infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens biofilms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses are intracellular pathogens that have to usurp some of the cellular machineries to provide an optimal environment for their own replication. An increasing number of reports reveal that many viruses induce modifications of nuclear substructures including nucleoli, whether they replicate or not in the nucleus of infected cells. Indeed, during infection of cells with various types of human viruses, nucleoli undergo important morphological modifications. A large number of viral components traffic to and from the nucleolus where they interact with different cellular and/or viral factors, numerous host nucleolar proteins are redistributed in other cell compartments or are modified and some cellular proteins are delocalised in the nucleolus of infected cells. Well\\\\documented studies have established that several of these nucleolar modifications play a role in some steps of the viral cycle, and also in fundamental cellular pathways. The nucleolus itself is the place where several essential steps of the viral cycle take place.

In response, clinics have emerged dedicated to the treatment of individuals with PASC. OBJECTIVE To better understand the current characteristics of these clinics, barriers they face and interest in collaboration between clinics. DESIGN A cross-sectional survey study PARTICIPANTS: Clinicians working within dedicated PASC centers (N=94) identified primarily through the Survivor Corps database of Post-COVID Care Centers. Additional clinics were found through news articles, an American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Database, and word of mouth. METHODS The branching logic electronic survey consisting of up to 39 questions was sent electronically to potential participants. RESULTS Complete survey responses were obtained from 45 clinics. There were a wide variety of different clinical models and specialties involved. The majority of clinics were homed in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (40%), Pulmonology (22%), and Internal Medicine (16%). Most clinics (73%) reported experiencing obstacles in the treatment of their patients, the most common of which included needing more established protocols (45%) and more clinical resources (24%). Most clinics (76%) also reported an interest in participating in a collaborative clinical network. CONCLUSION Despite wide variability in current clinical models of PASC clinics, there are common practices such as using telemedicine, having initial visits longer than 30 minutes, involving certain specialties in the treatment team and having the ability for follow-up. Clinicians involved with PASC clinics have a strong interest in collaboration to improve patient care and overcome clinical obstacles, the most common of which is the lack of clear treatment protocols.

The literature employs differing definitions of politicizationat times referring to controversy in the public sphere, at others referring to the exploitation of the uncertainty inherent in science, and at still others referring to whether the issue enters political discourseall of which are viewed as distinct dimensions by the public. What is not known is how these different aspects of politicization influence public attitudes about the health topics and or broader attitudes about scientific guidelines, andassuming adverse effectswhat strategies might be effective at mitigating the consequences. This paper draws on a survey experiment of 3012 U.S. respondents fielded in summer 2020 that was designed as a pilot study to assess the effects of different dimensions of politicization. Findings do not suggest that one type of politicization is necessarily more pernicious than the others. In fact, all types of politicization increased negative emotional responses and confusion, both with respect to the health topic in question (HPV vaccine and COVID-19) but also on other domains, although opinions about policy were unaffected. The findings also suggest that inoculation may have potential as a messaging strategy for blunting the adverse effects of exposure to politicization.","output":"Effects of politicized media coverage: Experimental evidence from the HPV vaccine and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly transmits in general population, mainly between health-care workers (HCWs) who are in close contact with patients.

METHODS: 72 samples were obtained from HCWs working in Masih Daneshvari hospital as one of the main COVID-19 admission centers in Tehran, during April 4 to 6, 2020. Also we collected 2021 blood samples from general population. The SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM, and IgG antibodies in the collected serum specimens were measured by commercial ELISA kits. RESULTS: Based on the clinical manifestations, 25.0%, 47.2%, and 27.8% of HCWs were categorized as symptomatic with typical symptoms, symptomatic with atypical symptoms, and asymptomatic, respectively. Symptomatic individuals with typical and atypical symptoms were 63.2% and 36.8% positive in RT-PCR test, respectively. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in 15.3% and 27.8% of HCWs samples, respectively.

It is necessary to understand the impact of the pandemic among this population to address health care needs, reduce transmission, and diminish COVID-19-related morbidity. Methods: Thirty interviews were conducted with asylum seekers and health care professionals in a temporary camp in Matamoros, Mexico to determine challenges, perceptions, and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interviews were coded in NVivo12 by using a team-based approach. Results: The pandemic caused significant mental health burdens but no perceived adverse physical effects, with the U.S. border closure and health care access barriers as more pressing concerns. Participants reported access to information about COVID-19 but had varied levels of knowledge and adherence to disease reduction strategies due to camp conditions. Most participants believed that they had special protection from COVID-19, including strong immune systems or from God. The nongovernmental organizations providing health care and sanitation faced multiple challenges to implement new policies to manage COVID-19. The institution of required temperature checks and quarantine of COVID-19 positive patients led to distrust, decreased seeking of health care services among asylum seekers, and possible underreporting of COVID-19 cases. Conclusion: Our findings among asylum seekers in a Matamoros camp highlight the challenges to implementing disease reduction policies in low-resource congregate camps. Policies to address disease outbreaks focusing on the social determinants of health, health care access barriers, and community engagement may be more acceptable to asylum seekers, suggesting the need for effective strategies to provide prevention information that complements such measures.","output":"Challenges and Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Asylum Seeker Health at the U.S.-Mexico Border"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This month's selection provides guidance to evaluate and test patients for COVID\\\\19.","output":"Guidance for evaluating and testing patients for COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In response to COVID-19, many state Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) programs increased flexibilities and options for self-direction. OBJECTIVE: Our study sought to investigate the experiences of individuals self-directing during COVID-19.

METHODS: We partnered with community-based and national disability organizations for recruitment. We used a semi-structed interview guide to conduct remote interviews with 36 individuals from eleven states. The sample was diverse with regard to age, race/ethnicity, gender, and disability type. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged related to maintaining access to HCBS and direct care workers: 1) Benefits of authority to hire and fire; 2) Benefits of ability to hire family members; and 3) Fluctuations in needs and availability of workers. Two themes emerged related to maintaining safety against COVID-19: 1) Strategies for staying safe with workers; and 2) Barriers in public health and service system response. Three themes emerged related to maintaining health and well-being: 1) Barriers to basic needs; 2) Delaying needed care; and 3) Use of telehealth and technology.

METHODS We reviewed the archives of clinical examinations that were conducted at the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens during a 5-year period (2012-16). RESULTS Six hundred sixty-four clinical examinations were conducted at our Department for IPV allegations. According to our findings, women were more likely to seek medical care than men. Victims who have attended EDs were more likely to have sustained injuries located at least on the head or on the lower limbs. CONCLUSION The majority of IPV victims in the broader region of Attica (Greece) were women, usually married, and aged between 30 and 49 years old. Despite the fact that the majority of IPV incidents are not reported to police, every person who is engaged in the process of dealing with IPV victims has to be educated and adequately informed about this phenomenon, its implications and the possible ways to deal with it.

The real role of corticosteroid use in COVID-19 has long been of interest and is disputable. Methods: We aimed to quantitatively reevaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids on COVID-19. Databases were searched for eligible meta-analyses/systematic reviews with available outcome data. For each association, we estimated the summary effect size with fixed- and random-effects models, 95% confidence intervals, and 95% prediction intervals. Heterogeneity, Eggers test, evidence of small-study effects and excess significance bias, and subgroup analyses were rigorously evaluated. Results: Intended outcomes of 12 eligible studies were mortality, clinical improvement, hospitalization, mechanical ventilation (MV), adverse events (AEs), intensive care unit (ICU) stay, hospital stay, virus clearance time (VCT), and negative conversion. Corticosteroid administration was associated with a 27% risk reduction in MV [hazard ratio (HR): 0.73 (0.64C0.83)] and a 20% reduction in mortality of critically ill/severe COVID-19 patients [HR: 0.80 (0.65C0.98)]. Interestingly, shorter ICU stays and, conversely, potentially longer hospital stays, a longer VCT, and a longer time to negative conversion were associated with corticosteroid use. There was no significant impact of different corticosteroid doses on mortality. Only one study showed slightly excess significant bias. Caution should be applied given the weak nature of the evidence, and it has been confirmed by sensitivity analyses too. Conclusion: This umbrella study found benefits from corticosteroids on MV and especially the mortality of critically ill/severe patients with shorter ICU stays but prolonged hospital stays and VCT. The benefits and harms should be reevaluated and balanced before corticosteroids are cautiously prescribed in clinical practice.","output":"Systemic Corticosteroid Administration in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outcomes: An Umbrella Meta-Analysis Incorporating Both Mild and Pulmonary FibrosisCManifested Severe Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This paper deals with a method of using unknown serum as the first antibody to coat wells of the microtiter plate directly in application of the sandwich ELISA method with double antibodies for the assay of the antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus.

Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the benefits of high-flow nasal cannula in the peri-intubation period. DATA SOURCES We performed a comprehensive search of relevant databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science). STUDY SELECTION We included randomized clinical trials that compared high-flow nasal cannula to other noninvasive oxygen delivery systems in the peri-intubation period. DATA EXTRACTION Our primary outcome was severe desaturation (defined as peripheral oxygen saturation reading < 80% during intubation). Secondary outcomes included peri-intubation complications, apneic time, PaO2 before and after intubation, PaCO2 after intubation, ICU length of stay, and short-term mortality. DATA SYNTHESIS We included 10 randomized clinical trials (n = 1,017 patients). High-flow nasal cannula had no effect on the occurrence rate of peri-intubation hypoxemia (relative risk, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.68-1.42; 0.3% absolute risk reduction, moderate certainty), serious complications (relative risk, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71-1.06), apneic time (mean difference, 10.3 s higher with high-flow nasal cannula; 95% CI, 11.0 s lower to 31.7 s higher), PaO2 measured after preoxygenation (mean difference, 3.6 mm Hg higher; 95% CI, 3.5 mm Hg lower to 10.7 mm Hg higher), or PaO2 measured after intubation (mean difference, 27.0 mm Hg higher; 95% CI, 13.2 mm Hg lower to 67.2 mm Hg higher), when compared with conventional oxygen therapy. There was also no effect on postintubation PaCO2, ICU length of stay, or 28-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS We found moderate-to-low certainty evidence that the use of high-flow nasal cannula likely has no effect on severe desaturation, serious complications, apneic time, oxygenation, ICU length of stay, or overall survival when used in the peri-intubation period when compared with conventional oxygen therapy.","output":"Moderate Certainty Evidence Suggests the Use of High-Flow Nasal Cannula Does Not Decrease Hypoxia When Compared With Conventional Oxygen Therapy in the Peri-Intubation Period: Results of a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo: Introduo: Com a interrupo das atividades educacionais das universidades por causa da pandemia da Covid-19, formas de ensino virtuais, como a educao remota (ER), passaram a ser debatidas no meio acadmico.

BACKGROUND Bare metal stents (BMS), drug-eluting stents (DES), and drug-coated balloons (DCB) are associated with lower target lesion revascularization (TLR) probabilities than percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), but the economic impact is unknown. METHODS In December 2012, PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for studies with TLR as an endpoint. The 24-month probability of TLR for each treatment was weighted by sample size. A decision-analytic Markov model was used to assess the budget impact from payers' and facility-providers' perspectives of the four index procedure strategies (BMS, DES, DCB, and PTA). Base cases were developed for U.S. Medicare and the German statutory sickness fund perspectives using current 2013 reimbursement rates. RESULTS Thirteen studies with 2,406 subjects were included. The reported probability of TLR in the identified studies varied widely, particularly following treatment with PTA or BMS. The pooled 24-month probabilities were 14.3%, 19.3%, 28.1%, and 40.3% for DCB, DES, BMS, and PTA, respectively. The drug-eluting strategies had a lower projected budget impact over 24 months compared to BMS and PTA in both the U.S. Medicare (DCB: $10,214; DES: $12,904; uncoated balloons $13,114; BMS $13,802) and German public health care systems (DCB 3,619; DES 3,632; BMS 4,026; PTA 4,290). CONCLUSIONS DCB and DES, compared to BMS and PTA, are associated with lower probabilities of target lesion revascularization and cost savings for U.S. and German payers.","output":"Economic analysis of endovascular interventions for femoropopliteal arterial disease: a systematic review and budget impact model for the United States and Germany."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has relied heavily on the general public's compliance with health guidelines limiting social contact and mitigating risk when contact occurs.

A sample of US adults (N = 1,200) were surveyed in late April to mid-May 2020. The factor structure of adherence was examined using exploratory factor analysis. Machine learning regression models using elastic net regularization were used to examine predictors of adherence. Two factors characterized adherence: avoidance and cleaning. Elastic net models identified differential demographic and psychological predictors of these two forms of adherence. Religious affiliation, denial coping, full-time employment, substance use coping, and being 60 or older predicted lower avoidance adherence. Behavioral and mindfulness emotion regulation skills, agreeableness, and Democrat political affiliation predicted greater avoidance adherence. For cleaning adherence, interpersonal and behavioral emotion regulation skills and conscientiousness emerged as strong predictors of greater cleaning. Efforts to promote compliance with COVID-19 health guidelines may benefit from distinguishing avoidance and cleaning adherence and considering predictors of each of these aspects of adherence.","output":"Adhering to COVID-19 health guidelines: Examining demographic and psychological predictors of adherence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a significant challenge in responding to second waves of COVID-19 cases, with governments being hesitant in introducing hard lockdown measures given the resulting economic impact. In addition, rising case numbers reflect an increase in coronavirus transmission some time previously, so timing of response measures is highly important. Australia experienced a second wave from June 2020 onwards, confined to greater Melbourne, with initial social distancing measures failing to reduce rapidly increasing case numbers. We conducted a detailed analysis of this outbreak, together with an evaluation of the effectiveness of alternative response strategies, to provide guidance to countries experiencing second waves of SARS-Cov-2 transmission. An individual-based transmission model was used to (1) describe a second-wave COVID-19 epidemic in Australia; (2) evaluate the impact of lockdown strategies used; and (3) evaluate effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies. The model was calibrated using daily diagnosed case data prior to lockdown. Specific social distancing interventions were modelled by adjusting person-to-person contacts in mixing locations. Modelling earlier activation of lockdown measures are predicted to reduce total case numbers by more than 50%. Epidemic peaks and duration of the second wave were also shown to reduce. Our results suggest that activating lockdown measures when second-wave case numbers first indicated exponential growth, would have been highly effective in reducing COVID-19 cases. The model was shown to realistically predict the epidemic growth rate under the social distancing measures applied, validating the methods applied. The timing of social distancing activation is shown to be critical to their effectiveness. Data showing exponential rise in cases, doubling every 7-10 days, can be used to trigger early lockdown measures. Such measures are shown to be necessary to reduce daily and total case numbers, and the consequential health burden, so preventing health care facilities being overwhelmed. Early control of second wave resurgence potentially permits strict lockdown measures to be eased earlier.","output":"A modelling analysis of the effectiveness of second wave COVID-19 response strategies in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The introduction of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockers (i.e. nivolumab and pembrolizumab) has significantly improved the prognosis of patients with advanced melanoma. However, the long treatment duration (i.e. two years or longer) has a high impact on patients and healthcare systems in terms of (severe) toxicity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), resource use, and healthcare costs. While durable tumour responses have been observed and PD-1 blockade is discontinued on an individual basis, no consensus has been reached on the optimal treatment duration. The objective of the Safe Stop trial is to evaluate whether early discontinuation of first-line PD-1 blockade is safe in patients with advanced and metastatic melanoma who achieve a radiological response. METHODS: The Safe Stop trial is a nationwide, multicentre, prospective, single-arm, interventional study in the Netherlands. A total of 200 patients with advanced and metastatic cutaneous melanoma and a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) v1.1 will be included to early discontinue first-line monotherapy with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. The primary objective is the rate of ongoing responses at 24 months after discontinuation of PD-1 blockade. Secondary objectives include best overall and duration of response, need and outcome of rechallenge with PD-1 blockade, and changes in (serious) adverse events and HRQoL. The impact of treatment discontinuation on healthcare resource use, productivity losses, and hours of informal care will also be assessed. Results will be compared to those from patients with CR or PR who completed 24 months of treatment with PD-1 blockade and had an ongoing response at treatment discontinuation. It is hypothesised that it is safe to early stop first-line nivolumab or pembrolizumab at confirmed tumour response while improving HRQoL and reducing costs. DISCUSSION: From a patient, healthcare, and economic perspective, shorter treatment duration is preferred and overtreatment should be prevented. If early discontinuation of first-line PD-1 blockade appears to be safe, early discontinuation of PD-1 blockade may be implemented as the standard of care in a selected group of patients.

Chest CTs of 182 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were evaluated for the presence of CT-abnormalities and their frequency. Regarding the patient outcome each patient was categorized in 5 progressive stages and the duration of hospitalization was determined. Regression analysis was performed to find which CT findings are predictive for patient outcome and to assess prognostic factors for the hospitalization duration. Multivariate statistical analysis confirmed a higher age (OR = 1.023, P = .025), a higher total visual severity score (OR = 1.038, P = .002) and the presence of crazy paving (OR = 2.160, P = .034) as predictive parameters for patient outcome. A higher total visual severity score (+0.134 days; P = .012) and the presence of pleural effusion (+13.985 days, P = 0.005) were predictive parameters for a longer hospitalization duration. Moreover, a higher sensitivity of chest CT (false negatives 10.4%; true positives 78.6%) in comparison to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was obtained. An increasing percentage of lung opacity as well as the presence of crazy paving and a higher age are associated with a worse patient outcome. The presence of a higher total visual severity score and pleural effusion are significant predictors for a longer hospitalization duration.

Although many factors regulate ectodermal organogenesis, there is not any report about their functions in real-time study. Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), a non-invasive, real-time surveillance system, had been used to detect changes in organ cell layer thickness through quantitative monitoring of the impedance of a cell-to-microelectrode interface over time. It was shown to be a good method for identifying significant real-time changes of cells. The purpose of this study is to establish a combined bioengineered organ-ECIS model for investigating the real time effects of fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF-9) on epithelial invagination in bioengineered ectodermal organs. We dissected epithelial and mesenchymal cells from stage E14.5 murine molar tooth germs and identified the real-time effects of FGF-9 on epithelial-mesenchymal interactions using this combined bioengineered organ-ECIS model. RESULTS: Measurement of bioengineered ectodermal organ thickness showed that Fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF-9) accelerates epithelial invagination in reaggregated mesenchymal cell layer within 3 days. Gene expression analysis revealed that FGF-9 stimulates and sustains early Ameloblastin and Amelogenin expression during odontogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first real-time study to show that, FGF-9 plays an important role in epithelial invagination and initiates ectodermal organogenesis. Based on these findings, we suggest FGF-9 can be applied for further study in ectodermal organ regeneration, and we also proposed that the FGF-BMP balancing system is important for manipulating the morphogenesis of ectodermal organs.

Its profile in patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease (CLD) is largely unknown. We studied the liver injury patterns of SARS-Cov-2 in CLD patients, with or without cirrhosis. METHODS: Data was collected from 13 Asian countries on patients with CLD, known or newly diagnosed, with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Altogether, 228 patients [185 CLD without cirrhosis and 43 with cirrhosis] were enrolled, with comorbidities in nearly 80%. Metabolism associated fatty liver disease (113, 61%) and viral etiology (26, 60%) were common. In CLD without cirrhosis, diabetes [57.7% vs 39.7%, OR = 2.1 (1.1-3.7), p = 0.01] and in cirrhotics, obesity, [64.3% vs. 17.2%, OR = 8.1 (1.9-38.8), p = 0.002] predisposed more to liver injury than those without these. Forty three percent of CLD without cirrhosis presented as acute liver injury and 20% cirrhotics presented with either acute-on-chronic liver failure [5 (11.6%)] or acute decompensation [4 (9%)]. Liver related complications increased (p < 0.05) with stage of liver disease; a Child-Turcotte Pugh score of 9 or more at presentation predicted high mortality [AUROC 0.94, HR = 19.2 (95 CI 2.3-163.3), p < 0.001, sensitivity 85.7% and specificity 94.4%).

This is particularly relevant in an intensive care unit (ICU), as the family provides a key communicative and practical link between patient and clinician. Family members have been deemed a positive beneficial influence on ICU care and recovery processes, yet they themselves are often emotionally affected after discharge. There has been no standardised evidenced-based approach which explores research on family member involvement and the range and quality of contributions remain unclear. This project will undertake a systematic review to assess the evidence base for interventions designed to promote patient and family member involvement in adult intensive care settings and develop a comprehensive typology of interventions for use by clinicians, patients and carers. METHODS The following databases will be searched without date restriction: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, as well as the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Joanna Briggs and Cochrane Libraries. Manual searches of recent back issues of leading ICU and patient experience journals will also be undertaken, as will the reference lists of included studies. Unpublished literature will be sought through grey literature databases, including GreyLit and OpenGrey. All evaluation studies that consider intervention activities to promote patient and family member involvement in adult ICUs will be included; all research designs will be eligible. We will seek to include studies that report on a mixture of relevant outcomes for patients and family members. Abstracts and papers will be independently screened by at least two members of the team to determine their inclusion. Included papers will be assessed for methodological rigour using a standard rating approach, which assesses 'quality of study' and 'quality of information'. Quality assessment will be completed by at least two members of the team. Data on interventions, evaluation methods and outcomes will be collated using a predetermined extraction table. These are likely to be heterogeneous in nature, which will mean that the review will follow a narrative approach to synthesis. DISCUSSION The review will provide valuable and rigorous insight into the range and quality of interventions available to promote patient and family member involvement in ICU. This is the first step towards addressing the absence of a synthesis of research for this context, and will, in addition, develop a typology of available interventions that will help service users and clinicians make informed decisions about the approaches to patient and family member involvement which they might want to adopt.

Our objective was to determine if a family's preferred language of Spanish versus English was associated with differences in management of bronchiolitis in the PED. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of children 2 years old diagnosed with bronchiolitis in a PED over a 7-year period. Rates of PED testing, interventions, and disposition among children whose families preferred language was Spanish were compared to children whose families preferred language was English. Primary outcomes were frequencies of chest x-ray and bronchodilator orders. Secondary outcomes were diagnostic testing, medication orders, and disposition. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios after controlling for age, emergency severity index, prior visit, and nesting within attending physicians. RESULTS: A total of 13,612 encounters were included. Spanish-speaking families were more likely to have chest x-rays (35.8% vs 26.7%, P < .0001; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2C1.9), complete blood counts (8.2% vs 4.9%, P < .005; aOR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2C2.5), and blood cultures ordered (8.1% vs 5.0%, P < .05; aOR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2C2.4).

RESULTS: Widespread DNA methylation changes were identified post-treatment in childhood cancer patients, including 146 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), which were consistently altered in the 32 post-treatment samples. Analysis of adult CCS identified matching methylation changes at 107/146 of the DMRs, suggesting potential long-term retention of post-therapy changes. Adult survivors also exhibited epigenetic age acceleration, independent of DMR methylation. Furthermore, altered methylation at the DUSP6 DMR was significantly associated with early mortality, suggesting altered methylation may be prognostic for some late adverse health effects in CCS. CONCLUSIONS: These novel methylation changes could serve as biomarkers for assessing normal cell toxicity in ongoing treatments and predicting long-term health outcomes in CCS.","output":"Anti-cancer therapy is associated with long-term epigenomic changes in childhood cancer survivors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Schools can help to restore confidence in vaccines by providing reliable information to their students. To do this, teachers must be willing to convey a pro-vaccination message. In this context, know the fear and beliefs about vaccination of the teachers may be appropriate. METHODS An online cross-sectional study was carried out, in December 2020, on active teachers from the autonomous community of Catalonia (Spain). The sample included 1507 subjects, men (23.4%) and women (76.6%), aged 21 to 66 years, from preschool (21.1%), primary (41.9%) and secondary (37%) levels. A sociodemographic questionnaire, the Vaccination Fear Scale VFS-6, and a questionnaire on vaccines and vaccination beliefs were administered. Univariate and descriptive data analysis was performed. RESULTS In this study, only 45.3% of the teachers did not show vaccination fear; data consistent with a high proportion of teachers who did not believe they should be vaccinated (27.3%) or who hesitate about the need to do so (24.4%), regardless of the high perception of the disease severity or belonging to a risk group. With high percentages (>50%) of teachers who did not believe, or doubt, about the safety and usefulness of vaccines; and less significant but important percentages that indicated distrust in pharmaceutical companies and in the government. Being a woman, young and a preschool education teacher, followed by primary education, were risk factors for vaccination refusal.

As the epidemic spread rate gradually increased in Turkey, curfews were imposed on individuals aged 65 and over as of March 21, 2020. We thought that both the pandemic and the curfew caused anxiety in the elderly. This study investigated the prevalence of anxiety symptoms by using Geriatric anxiety scale in the elderly during curfew. The change in anxiety level was measured over time. The second purpose of the study is to determine the factors affecting anxiety. Method: We evaluated older peoples anxiety status with an interval of 15 days and 6 months during Covid-19 pandemic by using Geriatric anxiety scale. People aged 65 and over among the enrolled population of the FHC were contacted by telephone. Results: 250 people aged 65 and over were called by phone, 213 people were reached.150 people volunteered to participate in the study. While the mean scores of the first Geriatric anxiety scale were 1.0  2.4, second score applied at the 15th days was 0.5  2.1, the third score applied at the sixth month was 0.3  1.8. There was a significant difference between the three measurements (p = 0.002). Conclusions: Total anxiety scores of our sample were low and there was a significant difference between the three measurements performed 15th days and sixth month was a decrease in anxiety. Contrary to what we expected, the elderly were not affected by curfew, and anxiety levels were found to be significantly decreased over time.

As soon as the initial reports of COVID-19 became public, several entities, including the Brazilian Leprosy Society, warned about the possible impact of COVID-19 on leprosy patients. It has been verified that COVID-19 carriers can be either asymptomatic or present varying degrees of severe respiratory failure in association with cytokine storm and death, among other diseases. Severe COVID-19 patients show increased numbers of neutrophils and serum neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) markers, in addition to alterations in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). The absence of antiviral drugs and the speed of COVID-19 transmission have had a major impact on public health systems worldwide, leading to the almost total collapse of many national and local healthcare services. Leprosy, an infectious neurological and dermatological illness, is widely considered to be the most frequent cause of physical disabilities globally. The chronic clinical course of the disease may be interrupted by acute inflammatory episodes, named leprosy reactions. These serious immunological complications, characterized by cytokine storms, are responsible for amplifying peripheral nerve damage. From 30% to 40% of all multibacillary leprosy (MB) patients experience erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), a neutrophilic immune-mediated condition. ENL patients often present these same COVID-19-like symptoms, including high levels of serum NET markers, altered NLR, and neutrophilia. Moreover, the consequences of a M. lepraeCSARS-CoV-2 coinfection have yet to be fully investigated.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of March 25, 2020, in more than 156 countries, about 664,731 new cases of the disease and 30,892 deaths were reported. Iran is one of the countries with the highest incidence. Although, there is a possibility of occupational accident in all health care provision environments, the offices is the main dangerous health care provider in terms of occupational infections in health systems. Ensuring the safety of employees in offices is not only crucial in protecting them against the virus but also in preventing the transmission of the virus. Protective behaviours are effective in prevention of occurrence of the disease. Protection motivation theory (PMT) helps to understand preventive behaviours better and can be used in occupational injury training programs. Considering the importance of identifying the factors of the preventive behaviours of Covid-19 in the development and implementation of preventive programs, this study was conducted for predicting the preventive behaviour againt Covid-19 based on the PMT among employees in crowded offices in Qom, Iran. Methods: In this cross sectional study, 232 employees in crowded offices in Qom, Iran have been selected using random clustering sampling method. Data collection instrument included demographic characteristics, protective behaviors against Covid-19, and PMT scale. The PMT constructs were assessed by questions composed and 7 subscales as follows: perceived vulnerability(2 items);perceived severity (2 items);perceived fear (2 items);self-efficacy (3 items);response efficacy (3 items);response cost (2 items);and protection motivation (1 items). The items were rated on a five-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). According to the theoretical assumptions, the threat appraisal score is the sum of the perceived susceptibility and severity scores. In addition, the coping appraisal score is the sum of the self-efficacy and response efficacy scores minus the response cost score. Five items scale by a three-point rated always, sometimes and never scored 2, 1 and 0, respectively measured Covid-19 preventive behaviors. The validity of the scale was confirmed using the viewpoints of health-education experts. The reliability of the scale was investigated by calculating internal consistency. Data have been analyzed via descriptive statistics and structural equations through SmartPLS statistical software. In the structural model, path coefficient, and R square were used to measure relationships among constructs. The predictive power of the model was examined by calculating Q2 indexes of behavior. Finally, a goodness of fit (GoF) index was calculated to display the model fit to the model. Results: Mean and standard deviation of participants age has been 39.88.7;and, 90.1% of them have been male. More than half of participants (53.8%) have shown protective behaviors higher than average. There has been a significant relationship between coping appraisal and protection motivation (=0.297 and p-value&lt;0.05). However, there has been no significant relationship between threat appraisal and fear constructs and protection motivation (=0.060 and p-value&gt;0.05). In addition, there has been significant positive relationship between protection motivation and protective behaviors (=0.214 and p-value&lt;0.05). Fit indices of the model have been desirable and the model could predict overall 5% of changes in performing protective behaviors. GoF was 0.503, indicating the model good fit. Conclusion: According to the results, coping appraisals were identified to be the significant positive associations with protection motivation. Contrary to the expectations based on the PMT, it is generally seen that none of the threat appraisals (severity, vulnerability, and fear) predicted protection motivation and preventive behavior against Covid-19. Protection motivation is a predictor factor of the protective behaviors. The results can be used in formulating training programs to optimize protective behaviors among employees working in offices. ? 2020 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

Intraoperative lateral radiographs of the unaffected ankle are often used in clinical practice as a template for anatomic syndesmotic reduction because sagittal plane malreduction is common. However, there is little data to suggest fibular station, or the position of the fibula in the AP plane on the lateral radiograph, is symmetric side-to-side in patients. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Is the position of the fibula in the AP plane (fibular station) on lateral ankle radiographs symmetric in an individual? (2) Do the measurements used to judge the position of the fibula on lateral radiographs have good inter- and intraobserver reliability? METHODS: Over the period from August 2016 to October 2018, we identified 478 patients who presented to an orthopaedic clinic with forefoot and midfoot complaints. Skeletally mature patients with acceptable bilateral lateral ankle radiographs, which are common radiographs obtained for new patients to clinic for any complaint, were included. Based on that, 52% (247 of 478 patients) were included with most (22%, 107 patients) excluded for poor lateral radiographs. The most common diagnosis in the patient cohort was midfoot OA (14%, 35 patients). The median (range) age of the included patients was 54 years (15 to 88), and 65% (159 of 247) of the patients were female. Fibular station, defined as the position of the fibula in the AP plane, and fibular length were measured using a digital ruler and goniometer on lateral radiographs. A paired t-test was used to determine if no difference in fibular station existed between the left and right ankles. With 247 paired-samples, with 80% power and an alpha level of 0.05, we could detect a difference between sides of 0.008 for the posterior ratio, 0.010 for the anterior ratio, and 0.012 for fibular length. Two readers, one fellowship-trained orthopaedic traumatologist and one PGY-4, measured 40 patients to determine the inter- and intraobserver reliability by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: The posterior fibular station (mean right 0.147 [&#963; = 0.056], left 0.145 [&#963; = 0.054], difference = 0.03 [95% CI 0 to 0.06]; p = 0.59), anterior fibular station (right 0.294 [&#963; = 0.062], left 0.299 [&#963; = 0.061], difference = 0.04 [95% CI 0 to 0.08]; p = 0.20), and fibular length (right 0.521 [&#963; = 0.080], left 0.522 [&#963; = 0.078], difference = 0.05 [95% CI 0.01 to 0.09]; p = 0.87) ratios did not differ with the numbers available between ankles. Inter- and intraobserver reliability were excellent for the posterior ratio (ICC = 0.928 and ICC = 0.985, respectively) and the anterior ratio (ICC = 0.922 and ICC = 0.929, respectively) and moderate-to-good for the fibular length ratio (ICC = 0.732 and ICC = 0.887, respectively). CONCLUSION: The use of lateral radiographs of the contralateral uninjured ankle appears to be a valid template for determining the position of the fibula in the sagittal plane. However, further prospective studies are required to determine the efficacy of this method in reducing the syndesmosis over other methods that exists.

By the end of February 2021, more than 100 million SARS-CoV-2 cases had been reported worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be divided into three phases: An early phase with fever and cough (phase I), a pulmonary vascular disease (phase II) and a hyperinflammatory syndrome (phase III). Since viral replication plays a particularly important role in the early stage of the disease and the patient's immune system in the later course of infection, different therapeutic options arise depending on the stage of the disease. The antiviral nucleoside analogue remdesivir is the only antiviral compound with conditional approval in the European Union. Treatment with remdesivir should be initiated early (within the first seven days of symptom onset) in patients receiving supplemental oxygen without invasive ventilation. In turn, the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid dexamethasone should be administered later in the course of disease in patients receiving oxygen therapy. Since autopsies indicate an increased frequency of thromboembolic events due to COVID-19, additional treatment with anticoagulants is recommended. Since the development of novel antivirals may take years, the application of convalescent plasma from patients who recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection for the treatment of COVID-19 is reasonable. However, large-scale studies indicated low efficacy of convalescent plasma. Furthermore, vaccination of the population is essential to control the pandemic. Currently, the mRNA vaccine Tozinameran from BioNTech and Pfizer, the mRNA-1273 vaccine from Moderna as well as the vector vaccine AZD1222 from AstraZeneca are licensed in the European Union. All three vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy in large clinical trials. In addition to these licensed vaccines, many others are being tested in clinical trials.

Studies on the prevalence of COVID-19 among severe cases have shown that comorbidities and risk factors such as obesity, increased aging, and chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases play a role in the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The interactions between such factors and their involvement with the progression of infection and mortality remain unclear. While it is known that SARS-CoV-2 damages the lungs, various morbidities such as acute kidney disease and thyroid dysregulation have recently emerged in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Conditions that alter thyroid hormones, which play a critical role in regulating metabolic pathways, have a role in the level of infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2. The capability of the SARS-CoV-2 to invade and affect any organ system is dependent on its access to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) commonly expressed among various host cells. This binding puts any system at high risk of direct viral injury, inevitably creating an excessively high concentration of anti-inflammatory mediators and cytokines to predispose COVID-19 patients to a state of severe immunosuppression.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the persistence of antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 in recovered patients in Al Madinah region of Saudi Arabia. Materials and methods: A total of 150 recovered COVID-19 patients participated in this study. All the patients tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, using qualitative RT-PCR. An ELISA was used to measure anti-Spike (S) IgG antibodies in serum samples and screen for their persistence at various time points post-infection. Results: The patients were categorized as asymptomatic (27.3%), mild (28%) and moderate (44.7%) according to the disease severity. Amongst them, 35.3% were females (n = 53) and 64.7% were males (n = 97).

Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the plasma levels of 4-HNE between war veterans with PTSD (n = 62) and age-, sex- and ethnicity- matched healthy control subjects (n = 58) in order to evaluate the potential of HNE-modified proteins as blood-based biomarker of PTSD. The genuine 4-HNE-Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (HNE-ELISA), based on monoclonal antibody specific for HNE-histidine (HNE-His) adducts, was used to determine plasma HNE-protein conjugates. Our results revealed significantly elevated levels of 4-HNE in patients with PTSD. Moreover, the accumulation of plasma 4-HNE seems to increase with aging but in a negative correlation with BMI, showing specific pattern of change for individuals diagnosed with PTSD. These findings suggest that oxidative stress and altered lipid metabolism reflected by increase of 4-HNE might be associated with PTSD.

We observed that polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs, but not other MDSC subsets, transiently expanded in severe cases but not in mild or moderate cases. Contrary to previous studies in Europe, this subset selectively expanded in survivors of severe cases and subsided before discharge, but such transient expansion was not observed in non-survivors in Japanese cohort. Analysis of plasma cytokine/chemokine levels revealed positive correlation of PMN-MDSC frequencies with interleukin 8 (IL-8) levels prior to the cell expansion, indicating the involvement of IL-8 on recruitment of PMN-MDSCs to peripheral blood following the onset of severe COVID-19. Thus, our data indicates that transient expansion of the PMN-MDSC subset results in improved clinical outcome. Thus, this myeloid cell subset may be a predictor of prognosis in cases of severe COVID-19 in Japan.","output":"Myeloid cell dynamics correlating with clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19 in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are unclear. In this study, we evaluated the association between use of methylprednisolone and key clinical outcomes. METHODS: Clinical outcomes associated with the use of methylprednisolone were assessed in an unmatched, case-control study; a subset of patients also underwent propensity-score matching. Patients were admitted between March 1 and April 12, 2020. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days by 28 days after admission. Secondary outcomes included extubation, mortality, discharge, positive cultures, and hyperglycemia. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients met inclusion criteria. Propensity matching yielded a cohort of 42 well-matched pairs. Groups were similar except for hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin use, which were more common in patients who did not receive methylprednisolone. Mean ventilator free-days were significantly higher in patients treated with methylprednisolone (6.217.45 versus 3.146.22; P = 0.044). The probability of extubation was also increased in patients receiving methylprednisolone (45% versus 21%; P = 0.021), and there were no significant differences in mortality (19% versus 36%; P = 0.087). In a multivariable linear regression analysis, only methylprednisolone use was associated with higher number of ventilator-free days (P = 0.045). The incidence of positive cultures and hyperglycemia were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Methylprednisolone was associated with increased ventilator-free days and higher probability of extubation in a propensity-score matched cohort.

The long-term effect of mobility showed to have a consistent lag correlation with the weekly number of new COVID-19 positive cases. In our statistical analysis, we also investigated key non-transportation variables. For instance, the mandatory use of masks in public transit resulted in observing a 10% decrease in the number of infected people. In addition, the results confirmed that super-spreading events had significant increases in the number of positive cases. We have also assessed the impact of major events and holidays throughout the study period and analyzed the impacts of mobility patterns in those situations.

This study aims to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 among Syrians in a post-conflict context. METHOD: A cross sectional web-based survey was conducted on the Syrian residents of 16 years and above. It contains questions on knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) with respect to COVID-19. Participants demographic characteristics are recorded and analyzed. The study is conducted during the global outbreak of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 706 participants (female, 444; male, 262) were enrolled. This study included 405 participants aged between 16 and 29, 204 aged between 30 and 49, and 97 aged above 60 years. There were 642 who have a university degree and 61 who have high school degree. Among the participants 253 were students, 316 were employed, 75 work as freelancers, and 62 were unemployed. Results showed that overall knowledge score towards the disease was about 60% (mean score 3.54  1.20; range 0C6). Knowledge scores significantly differed across age groups (P < 0.05), education levels (P = 0.001), and occupations (P < 0.05). Attitude and practice scores were 2.45  0.81 (range 0C4), 5.90  1.52 (range 0C8), respectively. Attitude scores were significantly different between males and females (P < 0.05), whereas practice scores varied significantly across gender (P < 0.05), age groups (P = 0.01), education levels (P = 0.015), occupations (P < 0.05), and according to knowledge score (P = 0.000). Results from multiple linear regression indicated that lower knowledge scores were significantly associated with lower education level (P < 0.05), whereas poor preventive practices were common among male, young and unemployed participants with significance levels of P < 0.01, P = .000, P < 0.01, respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that the Syrian residents demonstrate modest knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 at the time of its global outbreak.

The goals have been two-folded: leasing costs had to be optimized and patients had to be served as soon as possible. Decisions as to when to lease which services at which facility locations shaped the success of these goals. At the heart of these decisions lies a complex optimization problem, which we call the Online Non-metric Facility Service Leasing problem (non-metric OFSL), a generalization of the well-known Online Non-metric Facility Leasing problem (non-metric OFL) in which facility locations are leased for different facility-time durations. In non-metric OFSL, each facility location may provide a number of services leased for different service-time durations. Additionally, each service is associated with a dormant fee that needs to be paid for each day at which the service is not leased. The optimization goal is to minimize the total leasing costs, dormant fees, and the distances between patients and the facilities they are connected to. We develop the first online algorithm for non-metric OFSL, evaluated using the notion of competitive analysis. The latter is a worst-case analysis used to measure the quality of online algorithms, in which the online algorithm's output is compared to the optimal offline solution for all instances of the problem. ? 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

During infection, small subgenomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) are formed inside the infected host cell as a result of incomplete degradation of the viral RNA genome by cellular exoribonuclease XRN1. Although the full extent of sfRNA functions is to be revealed, these non-coding RNAs are key virulence factors and their detrimental effects on multiple cellular processes seem to consistently involve molecular interactions with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Discovery of such sfRNA-binding host-factors has followed established biochemical pull-down approaches skewed towards highly abundant proteins hampering proteome-wide coverage. Yeast three-hybrid (Y3H) systems represent an attractive alternative approach. To facilitate proteome-wide screens for RBP, we revisited and improved existing RNA-Y3H methodology by (1) implementing full-length ORF libraries in combination with (2) efficient yeast mating to increase screening depth and sensitivity, and (3) stringent negative controls to eliminate over-representation of non-specific RNA-binders. These improvements were validated employing the well-characterized interaction between DDX6 (DEAD-box helicase 6) and sfRNA of DENV as paradigm. Our advanced Y3H system was used to screen for human proteins binding to DENV and ZIKV sfRNA, resulting in a list of 69 putative sfRNA-binders, including several previously reported as well as numerous novel RBP host factors.

We hypothesized that a barbed suture tie-over suture to secure skin grafts would be quicker to perform than traditional tie-overs and would also exert a greater downward pressure on the skin graft. METHODS Thirty uniform areas of skin were excised from a cadaver. A pressure transducer was placed on the wound bed and covered with the excised skin along with a mineral oil-soaked wool dressing to act as a bolster. Three different sutures were used to secure the graft in place and the pressure was recorded. The tie-over techniques used were the classic silk tie-over, a running Vicryl Rapide? tie-over and a running barbed tie-over. RESULTS The barbed tie-over exerted the most downward pressure (82.8  7.3 mmHg) compared to the silk (46  4.85 mmHg) and the Vicryl Rapide? (18.6  2.4 mmHg). Furthermore, the barbed tie-over was the quickest to perform (1:45  22 s) when compared to the Vicryl Rapide? (02:57  27 s) and the silk tie-overs (04:26  39 s). CONCLUSION Barbed sutures are a viable option for securing skin grafts. They are quick to perform and provide significantly improved downward pressure on the skin graft. We feel that this technique would be especially suited to the sole operator as it can be carried out without the need of an assistant.","output":"A novel barbed suture tie-over dressing for skin grafts: a comparison with traditional techniques."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to explore socio\\\\ecological predictors of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as a result of the COVD\\\\19 pandemic restrictions. METHOD: A representative sample of 1,055 English\\\\speaking Canadians (18+ years) completed measures of MVPA during the COVID\\\\19 restrictions and reflecting on MVPA prior to these restrictions, as well as demographics, COVID\\\\19\\\\related cognitions and behavior (i.e. perceived threat, social distancing), psychological factors (e.g. personality traits, habit, identity, strategic planning), social factors (e.g. dependent children, co\\\\habitation), home environment affordances (exercise equipment, programming) and the neighborhood environment (e.g. access to outdoor recreation, neighborhood safety). RESULTS: Participants perceived that they had decreased weekly MVPA (p < .01) and the availability of home equipment and strategic planning were critical predictors (p < .01). Profiles by MVPA guidelines, however, showed that 58 per cent of the sample had not changed and 6 per cent had increased MVPA. Identity was the critical predictor of the different MVPA profiles, followed by habit, extraversion, availability of home equipment, and the age of the participant (p < .01).

We explore the potential for OPOs to provide such adaptive capacity to respond to two contemporary issues for organizations: the chronic challenge of environmental sustainability, and the acute challenges emerging from the great COVID-19 homeworking experiment. We apply a socio-technical systems perspective and green ergonomics principles to investigate the relationship between an OPO environment and the occupants working within it. In doing so, we consider the relevant technical and human factors such as green technology and employee green behavior. We also consider how a green OPO might provide non-carbon benefits such as improving occupant wellbeing and supporting the emergence of a green organizational culture. Our investigation highlights several avenues through which an OPO designed with green ergonomic principles could benefit occupants, the organizations they work for, and the natural environment of which they are a part and on which they depend.

In the current study, a reverse genetic approach was used to define the role of the 28-kDa amino-terminal product (nsp1) of the gene 1 polyprotein during replication of the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) in cell culture. To determine whether nsp1 is required for MHV replication and to identify residues critical for protein function, mutant viruses that contained deletions or point mutations within the nsp1-coding region were generated and assayed for defects in viral replication, viral protein expression, protein localization, and RNA synthesis. The results demonstrated that the carboxy-terminal half of nsp1 (residues K(124) through L(241)) was dispensable for virus replication in culture but was required for efficient proteolytic cleavage of nsp1 from the gene 1 polyprotein and for optimal viral replication. Furthermore, whereas deletion of nsp1 residues amino-terminal to K(124) failed to produce infectious virus, point mutagenesis of the nsp1 amino-terminus allowed recovery of several mutants with altered replication and RNA synthesis.

AREAS COVERED: Immune activation and inflammation play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe COVID-19 patients may experience cytokine release syndrome (CRS), leading to alveolar damage, pulmonary fibrinolysis, dysregulated coagulation, and pulmonary injury. Into the systemic circulation, cytokines in excess might leak out of pulmonary circulation, causing systemic symptoms and possibly a multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome. Preexisting comorbidities are also linked to worse COVID-19 outcome: studies suggest that diabetes and hypertension are linked to higher mortality rates. Such comorbidities are more frequent in PLWH, but it is unclear if they have worse outcomes in the case of COVID-19. The literature was searched in PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE, and manually in COVID-19 resources. EXPERT OPINION: A body of evidence shows that HIV and SARS-CoV-2 are able to activate inflammatory pathways, acute in the case of SARS-CoV-2, chronic in the case of HIV, while the comorbidities seem to represent, in the first case, a contributory cause, in the second an effect of the virus-induced damage.","output":"Dangerous liaisons?

By the end of February 2021, more than 100 million SARS-CoV-2 cases had been reported worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be divided into three phases: An early phase with fever and cough (phase I), a pulmonary vascular disease (phase II) and a hyperinflammatory syndrome (phase III). Since viral replication plays a particularly important role in the early stage of the disease and the patient's immune system in the later course of infection, different therapeutic options arise depending on the stage of the disease. The antiviral nucleoside analogue remdesivir is the only antiviral compound with conditional approval in the European Union. Treatment with remdesivir should be initiated early (within the first seven days of symptom onset) in patients receiving supplemental oxygen without invasive ventilation. In turn, the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid dexamethasone should be administered later in the course of disease in patients receiving oxygen therapy. Since autopsies indicate an increased frequency of thromboembolic events due to COVID-19, additional treatment with anticoagulants is recommended. Since the development of novel antivirals may take years, the application of convalescent plasma from patients who recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection for the treatment of COVID-19 is reasonable. However, large-scale studies indicated low efficacy of convalescent plasma. Furthermore, vaccination of the population is essential to control the pandemic. Currently, the mRNA vaccine Tozinameran from BioNTech and Pfizer, the mRNA-1273 vaccine from Moderna as well as the vector vaccine AZD1222 from AstraZeneca are licensed in the European Union. All three vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy in large clinical trials. In addition to these licensed vaccines, many others are being tested in clinical trials.

An efficient way to improve this disease's clinical management would be to characterize patients at higher risk of progressing to critically severe infection using prognostic biomarkers. The telomere length could be used for this purpose. Telomeres are responsible for controlling the number of maximum cell divisions. The telomere length is a biomarker of aging and several diseases. We aimed to compare leukocyte telomere length (LTL) between patients without COVID-19 and patients with different clinical severity of the infection. Were included 53 patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR divided in four groups. The first group was composed by patients with a negative diagnosis for COVID-19 (n = 12). The other three groups consisted of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 divided according to the severity of the disease: mild (n = 15), moderate (n = 17) and severe (n = 9). The LTL was determined by Q-PCR. The severe group had the shortest LTL, followed by the moderate group. The negative and mild groups showed no differences. There is an increase of patients with hypertension (p = 0.0099) and diabetes (p = 0.0067) in moderate and severe groups. Severe group was composed by older patients in comparison with the other three groups (p = 0.0083). Regarding sex, there was no significant difference between groups (p = 0.6279).

This study investigated the impact of a blue whiting-derived protein hydrolysate (BWPH) on aminoacidaemia in vivo and skeletal muscle anabolism in vitro compared with whey protein isolate (WPI) and an isonitrogenous, non-essential amino acid (NEAA) control (0.33 gkg(?1)body mass(?1)) in an ex vivo, in vitro experimental design. Blood was obtained from seven healthy older adults (two males, five females; age: 72  5 years, body mass index: 24.9  1.6 kgm(2)) in three separate trials in a randomised, counterbalanced, double-blind design. C2C12 myotubes were treated with ex vivo human serum-conditioned media (20%) for 4 h. Anabolic signalling (phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1) and puromycin incorporation were determined by immunoblotting. Although BWPH and WPI both induced postprandial essential aminoacidaemia in older adults above the NEAA control, peak and area under the curve (AUC) leucine and essential amino acids were more pronounced following WPI ingestion. Insulin was elevated above baseline in WPI and BWPH only, a finding reinforced by higher peak and AUC values compared with NEAA. Muscle protein synthesis, as measured by puromycin incorporation, was greater after incubation with WPI-fed serum compared with fasted serum (P = 0.042), and delta change was greater in WPI (P = 0.028) and BWPH (P = 0.030) compared with NEAA. Myotube hypertrophy was greater in WPI and BWPH compared with NEAA (both P = 0.045), but was similar between bioactive conditions (P = 0.853). Taken together, these preliminary findings demonstrate the anabolic potential of BWPH in vivo and ex vivo, thus providing justification for larger studies in older adults using gold-standard measures of acute and chronic MPS in vivo.","output":"A Fish-Derived Protein Hydrolysate Induces Postprandial Aminoacidaemia and Skeletal Muscle Anabolism in an In Vitro Cell Model Using Ex Vivo Human Serum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the information and knowledge society, where technology develops rapidly and penetrates deeply into our lives, the discussion about digital competence has become a hot topic today After the emergence of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) and with its huge impact on the education industry, the concern about digital competence has reached a new height This systematic literature review uses Web of science and Scopus as databases to store and analyze the existing research on digital competence in higher education settings The purpose of this review is to provide the scholar community with a current overview of digital competence research from 2015-2021 in the context of higher education regarding the definition of digital competence, dimensions used to evaluate digital competence, research purposes, methodologies, and results and limitations Major findings include that the majority of publications cited both research and EU policy in describing the definition of digital competence The review indicates that most university students and teachers have a basic level of digital competence Besides, the institutions of higher education are encouraged to focus on the development students and teachers digital competence, create relevant learning strategies and use appropriate tools to improve the quality of education","output":"Digital competence in higher education research: A systematic literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The refugees and migrants are not recorded generally and deemed invisible by governments without providing them with identity and welfare services.

This has prompted universities to make huge investments in technology to augment their position in the face of extensive competition and to enhance their students learning experience and efficiency. Numerous studies have been carried out regarding the use of online and mobile phone learning platforms. However, there are very few studies focusing on how university students will accept and adopt smartphones as a new platform for taking examinations. Many reasons, but most recently and importantly the COVID-19 pandemic, have prompted educational institutions to move toward using both online and mobile learning techniques. This study is a pioneer in examining the intention to use mobile exam platforms and the prerequisites of such intention. The purpose of this study is to expand the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by including four additional constructs: namely, content quality, service quality, information quality, and system quality. A self-survey method was prepared and carried out to obtain the necessary basic data. In total, 566 students from universities in the United Arab Emirates took part in this survey. Smart PLS was used to test the study constructs and the structural model. Results showed that all study hypotheses are supported and confirmed the effect of the TAM extension factors within the UAE higher education setting. These outcomes suggest that the policymakers and education developers should consider mobile exam platforms as a new assessment platform and a possible technological solution, especially when considering the distance learning concept.

Tweets from the social media platform were collected during the lockdown and the same periods in 2019. Additionally, subjective responses to outdoor and neighbour noises were collected through a questionnaire survey. Tweets about noise complaints during the lockdown were more than twice of those before introduction of lockdown. A substantial increase in talking/shouting, and TV/music activities were observed among the neighbour noise sources. Similar findings were obtained from the survey. The respondents answered that the perceived outdoor noise level decreased but perceived neighbour noise level increased during the lockdown. The outdoor noise annoyance ratings were revealed to be significantly lower than those before the lockdown. In contrast, neighbour noises were more frequently heard and annoyance ratings increased compared to the pre-lockdown period. In particular, talking/shouting and TV/music were most annoying. Furthermore, neighbour noise was more annoying than outdoor noise during the lockdown. This suggests that neighbour noise is more problematic than outdoor noise during lockdown.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this viewpoint is to describe the development and deployment of an EHR designed to care for displaced populations in low-resource settings. METHODS: Using a human-centered design approach, we conducted in-depth interviews and focus groups with patients, health care providers, and administrators in Lebanon and Jordan to identify the essential EHR features. These features, including modular workflows, multilingual interfaces, and offline-first capabilities, led to the development of the Hikma Health EHR, which has been deployed in Lebanon and Nicaragua. RESULTS: We report the successes and challenges from 12 months of Hikma Health EHR deployment in a mobile clinic providing care to Syrian refugees in Bekaa Valley, Lebanon.

Our main research questions are as follows: (1) To what extent do migrants tend to be located in certain socio-occupational classes? (2) To what extent does the likelihood of belonging to a certain socio-occupational class differ according to immigrants places of origin? (3) Can differences be found in the likelihood of belonging to a certain socio-occupational class according to the places of origin before, during and after the Great Recession? The results show a very unequal distribution of immigrants in the socio-occupational structure according to their origin.

Despite this frightening picture, denialism and noncompliance with public health measures are common in the historical record, for example during the 1918 Influenza pandemic or the 2015 Ebola epidemic. The unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-its high basic reproduction number (R0), time-limited natural immunity and considerable potential for asymptomatic spread-exacerbate the public health repercussions of noncompliance with interventions (such as vaccines and masks) to limit disease transmission. Our work explores the rationality and impact of noncompliance with measures aimed at limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this work, we used game theory to explore when noncompliance confers a perceived benefit to individuals. We then used epidemiological modeling to predict the impact of noncompliance on control of SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that the presence of a noncompliant subpopulation prevents suppression of disease spread. RESULTS: Our modeling demonstrates that noncompliance is a Nash equilibrium under a broad set of conditions and that the existence of a noncompliant population can result in extensive endemic disease in the long-term after a return to pre-pandemic social and economic activity. Endemic disease poses a threat for both compliant and noncompliant individuals; all community members are protected if complete suppression is achieved, which is only possible with a high degree of compliance. For interventions that are highly effective at preventing disease spread, however, the consequences of noncompliance are borne disproportionately by noncompliant individuals. CONCLUSIONS: In sum, our work demonstrates the limits of free-market approaches to compliance with disease control measures during a pandemic. The act of noncompliance with disease intervention measures creates a negative externality, rendering suppression of SARS-CoV-2 spread ineffective. Our work underscores the importance of developing effective strategies for prophylaxis through public health measures aimed at complete suppression and the need to focus on compliance at a population level.","output":"Individually optimal choices can be collectively disastrous in COVID-19 disease control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Nowadays, we are facing a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, known globally as COVID-19, which is considered a threat to global health due to its high contagiousness and rapid spread. Methods: Analytical cross-sectional study in 302 health professionals. An online questionnaire consisting of questions about knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 was applied. Socio-demographic, occupational and comorbidities factors were explored. Simple and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with KAP. Results: Of the total, 25.2%, 31.5% and 37.4% had high levels of knowledge, preventive practices and risk perception attitudes respectively.

Systematic assessment of the syndromic and sentinel surveillance platforms during the pandemic is essential for understanding the value of each platform in the context of an emerging pathogen with rapid global spread. AIM: We aimed to evaluate systematically the performance of various respiratory syndromic surveillance platforms and the sentinel surveillance system in Israel from 1 January to 31 December 2020. METHODS: We compared the 2020 syndromic surveillance trends to those of the previous 3 years, using Poisson regression adjusted for overdispersion. To assess the performance of the sentinel clinic system as compared with the national SARS-CoV-2 repository, a cubic spline with 7 knots and 95% confidence intervals were applied to the sentinel network's weekly percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases. RESULTS: Syndromic surveillance trends changed substantially during 2020, with a statistically significant reduction in the rates of visits to physicians and emergency departments to below previous years' levels. Morbidity patterns of the syndromic surveillance platforms were inconsistent with the progress of the pandemic, while the sentinel surveillance platform was found to reflect the national circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the population. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal the robustness of the sentinel clinics platform for the surveillance of the main respiratory viruses during the pandemic and possibly beyond. The robustness of the sentinel clinics platform during 2020 supports its use in locations with insufficient resources for widespread testing of respiratory viruses.","output":"The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on respiratory syndromic and sentinel surveillance in Israel, 2020: a new perspective on established systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prediction of COVID-19 incidence and transmissibility rates are essential to inform disease control policy and allocation of limited resources (especially to hotspots), and also to prepare towards healthcare facilities demand.

In early fetuses (7-8 weeks), the IO was restricted at an antero-infero-medial angle of the future orbit. In contrast to extraocular recti, the IO appeared to extend along the mediolateral axis and had no definite tendon. At midterm, the IO tendon became evident. Sometimes, the IO muscle belly attached to the inferior rectus or, the IO tendon divided into two laminae to enclose the lateral rectus.

At midterm and late-term, the IO originated not only from the maxilla near the orbicularis oculi origin but also from a vein-rich fibrous tissue around the lacrimal sac. Both origins were muscular without intermittent tendon or ligament.

Early reports of hospitalised COVID-19 cases have shown relatively low frequency of chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but increased risk of adverse outcome. The mechanisms of altered susceptibility to viral acquisition and/or severe disease in at-risk groups are poorly understood. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are widely used in the treatment of COPD but the extent to which these therapies protect or expose patients with a COPD to risk of increased COVID-19 severity is unknown. Here, using a combination of human and animal in vitro and in vivo disease models, we show that ICS administration attenuates pulmonary expression of the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2. This effect was mechanistically driven by suppression of type I interferon as exogenous interferon- reversed ACE2 downregulation by ICS. Mice deficient in the type I interferon-/ receptor (Ifnar1?/?) also had reduced expression of ACE2. Collectively, these data suggest that use of ICS therapies in COPD reduces expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and this effect may thus contribute to altered susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with COPD.","output":"Inhaled corticosteroids downregulate the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in COPD through suppression of type I interferon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous devices and sophisticated strategies have been developed to further increase the number of aneurysms amenable to endovascular treatment.1-4 Despite the superfluity of available neurovascular armamentarium, wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms can still pose a significant technical challenge to the treating clinician.5-7 Neck bridging is a conceptually new approach, which provides increased occlusion rates with lower recurrence and complications rates.8-10 The Nautilus (EndoStream Medical) is an intrasaccular bridging device intended to assist in coil embolization of wide-necked cerebral aneurysms.

Methods This prospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Urology, Bir Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal, from January 2020 to March 2021. Patients undergoing RIRS for renal stones less than 2 cm in diameter were included in the study. Irrigation during the procedure was performed using isotonic normal saline under gravity at 50 cm from the symphysis pubis of patients with intermittent manual compression if required. Lithotripsy was performed with 120-Watt Ho:YAG laser using 200-micron laser fiber. Retrograde pyelogram was performed after the completion of lithotripsy to document the presence or absence of extravasation on fluoroscopic images. A double-J stent was placed at the end in all patients. Patients were observed for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) features. Postoperative abdominal ultrasonography was performed on the first postoperative day to assess the perirenal collection together with complete blood count. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess pain in postoperative period. The preoperative patient's and stone characteristics, hydronephrosis, intraoperative characteristics, and postoperative findings were analyzed. Results A total of 71 patients who underwent RIRS during the study period were analyzed. The mean (SD) stone size was 13.19 (3.12) mm. Intraoperative perirenal extravasation of contrast was noted in eight (11.26%) patients; however, no patient had ipsilateral perirenal collection on ultrasonography obtained on the first postoperative day. No significant differences were observed among patients with or without perirenal extravasation in terms of mean stone size, laser settings, operative duration, and lasing duration. Use of ureteral access sheath (UAS) was associated with lower incidence of extravasation; however, it was not significant. SIRS was documented in eight patients overall, with none of the patients with extravasation having features of SIRS. Patients with extravasation experienced more postoperative flank pain (p<0.05). Conclusion Perirenal extravasation was common during RIRS and was associated with higher postoperative pain scores.

The Prairie Epidemic Strain (PES) has been recently identified in up to 30% of patients at prairie-based CF centres, however, its clinical impact remains to be determined. METHODS: A cohort study of adults with cystic fibrosis from 1981C2014 was conducted and all PA isolates from clinical visits were prospectively collected. PA strain typing at clinic enrolment, and most recent was conducted by PFGE. Patients were divided into one of four cohorts: no PA, transient PA, unique chronic PA, and chronic PES. Random effects and proportional Cox hazard models were conducted for outcome of death, transplantation and FEV1% decline. RESULTS: 204 patients (54% male) with CF were analysed: 38 no PA, 20 transient PA, 103 unique PA, 43 PES. Baseline FEV1% was lowest in the chronic PES group (p = 0.002). Overall rate of FEV1% decline was C1.19%/year (95% CI: C1.41 to C0.97, p<0.001); the chronic PES group had the greatest rate of decline at C1.24%/year (p<0.001). There were a total of 42 deaths and 37 transplants through 1862 and 2050 follow-up years, respectively. The age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death was not different for the PA groups compared to the no PA group. Relative to the no PA group, risk of transplant was increased in those with chronic PES (HR 9.13, CI 1.29C69, p = 0.032) compared to the no PA group. CONCLUSION: Chronic PES infection is significantly associated with a greater rate of FEV1% decline and risk of lung transplantation but not with increased risk of death compared to no PA infection.","output":"65 Clinical outcomes of chronic Prairie Epidemic Strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in adults with cystic fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the greatest modern health challenges to date. The administration of COVID-19 vaccines, rapidly and widely across all communities, is key to halting the spread of the virus. One significant challenge in promoting a large-scale immunization program is the threat of vaccine hesitancy, particularly in underrepresented minority communities (URM). Study Objective: This project aimed to assess reasons for local vaccine hesitancy in an urban emergency department (ED) and to provide targeted education on the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines to patients. Methods: An interprofessional team was formed of medical students, physicians, social works, and community outreach coordinators to develop an educational intervention addressing COVID-19 vaccine safety for eligible patients receiving treatment in the ED at a urban academic affiliated community hospital with over 70% of patients coming from underserved URM backgrounds. A survey was conducted to elucidate their concerns surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine. Upon completion of the survey, up-to-date safety information was provided by trained medical students and a follow up survey was conducted to assess for impact of the education. Surveys were developed using standardized scoring systems from the Oxford OCEANS II study and the Kaiser Foundation COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor. Hesitancy scores before and after education delivery were tabulated to assess the impact of the quality improvement education intervention. Results: A convenience sample of 58 subjects (76% URM) cited a variety of concerns surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine. The three most common reasons for declining vaccines were potential side effects (67.3% of respondents said they were concerned to extremely concerned), the concept that COVID-19 vaccines are neither effective nor safe (64.5% said they were concerned to extremely concerned), and the risk of developing COVID-19 infection from vaccine (38.8% said they were concerned to extremely concerned). While this project remains ongoing, this information was used to address these concerns directly with patients, answer questions, clarify information, and encourage patients to get their vaccines. Through the education program, vaccine hesitancy scores improved by an average of 29% indicating an increased likelihood they will get vaccinated in the future. 38% of patients receiving education agreed to sign up for a vaccine appointment during survey interview. Conclusion: The ED often serves vulnerable patient populations. As such, its role in public health in these communities cannot be underestimated. This pilot quality improvement project is a novel method that hospital systems can use to develop and implement public health education programs to address specific community needs through the ED. These results show that ED health care providers have the ability to provide measurable change in attitudes about vaccine safety.","output":"26 Implementation of a COVID-19 Vaccine Emergency Department Education Program for Underserved Communities: A Pilot Quality Improvement Project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Hyposmia is a common feature of COVID-19 and Parkinsons disease (PD). As parkinsonism has been reported after COVID-19, a link has been hypothesized between SARS-CoV2 infection and PD. We aimed to evaluate brain metabolic correlates of isolated persistent hyposmia after mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and to compare them with metabolic signature of hyposmia in drug-na?ve PD patients. METHODS: Forty-four patients who experienced hyposmia after SARS-COV2 infection underwent brain [(18)F]-FDG PET in the first 6 months after recovery. Olfaction was assessed by means of the 16-item Sniffin Sticks test and patients were classified as with or without persistent hyposmia (COVID-hyposmia and COVID-no-hyposmia respectively). Brain [(18)F]-FDG PET of post-COVID subgroups were compared in SPM12. COVID-hyposmia patients were also compared with eighty-two drug-na?ve PD patients with hyposmia. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify correlations between olfactory test scores and brain metabolism in patients subgroups. RESULTS: COVID-hyposmia patients (n = 21) exhibited significant hypometabolism in the bilateral gyrus rectus and orbitofrontal cortex with respect to COVID-non-hyposmia (n = 23) (p < 0.002) and in middle and superior temporal gyri, medial/middle frontal gyri, and right insula with respect to PD-hyposmia (p < 0.012). With respect to COVID-hyposmia, PD-hyposmia patients showed hypometabolism in inferior/middle occipital gyri and cuneus bilaterally. Olfactory test scores were directly correlated with metabolism in bilateral rectus and medial frontal gyri and in the right middle temporal and anterior cingulate gyri in COVID-hyposmia patients (p < 0.006) and with bilateral cuneus/precuneus and left lateral occipital cortex in PD-hyposmia patients (p < 0.004).

A newly identified ER-membrane-associated protein, DRiP78, binds to this motif. Overexpression or sequestration of DRiP78 leads to retention of D1 receptors in the ER, reduced ligand binding, and a slowdown in the kinetics of receptor glycosylation.

People living with multiple sclerosis (MS) may be more susceptible to physical function deterioration while practicing social distancing. Recent reports have suggested that about 50% of people with MS (pwMS) decreased their leisure physical activity during COVID-19, and upwards of 30% reported decreased physical fitness levels. However, the impact of social distancing on adverse health-related outcomes such as falls has not received much scrutiny. Therefore, we explored the frequency and characteristics of falls experienced by people living with and without MS during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Two-hundred and thirty-nine individuals, including 106 pwMS (median age: 59 years) and 133 people living without MS (median age: 66 years) were recruited for this cross-sectional study. A snowball sampling strategy was used for online recruitment. Participants completed a customized falls questionnaire and the number of falls experienced (if any) during COVID-19 was recorded. Fall-related characteristics such as the timing, locations, activities undertaken before falling and consequences, as well as self-reported physical activity were also recorded. RESULTS: Overall, participants reported 232 falls (1.67 falls/person in pwMS and 0.41 falls/person in non-MS participants). People living with MS (pwMS) had a significantly higher frequency of falls (58.5% vs 21.8%; p< 0.001) and recurrent falls (45.3% vs 9.8%; p< 0.001) compared to non-MS participants. Additionally, pwMS reported a significantly higher proportion of in-home falls (83.9% vs 54.2%; p = 0.004), as well as a higher proportion of overall injuries (44.3% vs 12.5%, p< 0.001), fractures (5.7% vs 0.8%, p = 0.048), and healthcare utilization (9.4% vs 1.6%, p = 0.007) compared to non-MS participants. A similar proportion of pwMS (49.1%) and non-MS participants (52.2%) reported lower physical activity levels during COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This cross-sectional study revealed that pwMS remain at high risk of falls and fall-related outcomes during COVID-19. The high number of falls experienced by pwMS is of clinical concern considering the current strain on the healthcare system. Findings from this study highlight the importance of monitoring falls and the potential for telerehabilitation in persons with MS during COVID-19.","output":"Frequency and characteristics of falls in people living with and without multiple sclerosis during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional online survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bickerstaffs brainstem encephalitis (BBE) is a Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) spectrum disorder associated with predominantly central nervous system predilection Patients exhibit a variable constellation of depressed consciousness, bilateral external ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and long tract signs Although the pathophysiology is not fully understood, it has been associated with anti-GQ1b antibodies in two-thirds of patients We present a patient with clinical features consistent with BBE and positive anti-GM1 and anti-GD1a antibodies A diagnostic approach to the acutely unwell patient with brainstem encephalitis is explored in this clinical context with a literature review of the aforementioned ganglioside antibody significance Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy is highlighted in BBE using up-to-date evidence-based extrapolation from GBS","output":"Bickerstaffs brainstem encephalitis associated with anti-GM1 and anti-GD1a antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is still debated whether prophylactic doses of low-molecular- weight heparin (LMWH) are always effective in preventing Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) and mortality in COVID-19.

In addition, ACE2 has assumed a prominent role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic-causing virus SARS-CoV-2, as it is the very first receptor in the host of the viral spike protein. The binding of the spike protein to ACE2 triggers a cascade of events that eventually leads the virus to enter the host cell and initiate its life cycle. At the same time, SARS-CoV-2 infection downregulates ACE2 expression especially in the lung, altering the biochemical signals regulated by the enzyme and contributing to the poor clinical prognosis characterizing the late stage of the COVID-19 disease. Despite its important biological role, a very limited number of ACE2 activators are known. Here, using a combined in silico and experimental approach, we show that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) derivatives work as ACE2 activators. In detail, we have identified two potent ACE2 ligands, BAR107 and BAR708, through a docking virtual screening campaign and elucidated their mechanism of action from essential dynamics of the enzyme observed during microsecond molecular dynamics calculations. The in silico results were confirmed by in vitro pharmacological assays with the newly identified compounds showing ACE2 activity comparable to that of DIZE, the most potent ACE2 activator known so far. Our work provides structural insight into ACE2/ligand-binding interaction useful for the design of compounds with therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection, inflammation, and other ACE2-related diseases.","output":"Discovery of Bile Acid Derivatives as Potent ACE2 Activators by Virtual Screening and Essential Dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last year, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants have highlighted the importance of screening tools with high diagnostic accuracy for new illnesses such as COVID-19. To that regard, deep learning approaches have proven as effective solutions for pneumonia classification, especially when considering chest-x-rays images. However, this lung infection can also be caused by other viral, bacterial or fungi pathogens. Consequently, efforts are being poured toward distinguishing the infection source to help clinicians to diagnose the correct disease origin. Following this tendency, this study further explores the effectiveness of established neural network architectures on the pneumonia classification task through the transfer learning paradigm. To present a comprehensive comparison, 12 well-known ImageNet pre-trained models were fine-tuned and used to discriminate among chest-x-rays of healthy people, and those showing pneumonia symptoms derived from either a viral (i.e., generic or SARS-CoV-2) or bacterial source. Furthermore, since a common public collection distinguishing between such categories is currently not available, two distinct datasets of chest-x-rays images, describing the aforementioned sources, were combined and employed to evaluate the various architectures. The experiments were performed using a total of 6330 images split between train, validation and test sets. For all models, common classification metrics were computed (e.g., precision, f1-score) and most architectures obtained significant performances, reaching, among the others, up to 84.46% average f1-score when discriminating the 4 identified classes.

Increasing transparency around the representation of these populations in health care professions may encourage efforts to increase diversity that could improve cultural competence among health care professionals and reduce health disparities. Objective: To estimate the racial/ethnic diversity of the current health care workforce and the graduate pipeline for 10 health care professions and to evaluate whether the diversity of the pipeline suggests greater representation of Black, Hispanic, and Native American populations in the future. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used weighted data from the 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) to compare the diversity of 10 health care occupations (advanced practice registered nurses, dentists, occupational therapists, pharmacists, physical therapists, physician assistants, physicians, registered nurses, respiratory therapists, and speech-language pathologists) with the diversity of the US working-age population, and 2019 data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) were used to compare the diversity of graduates with that of the US population of graduation age. Data from the IPEDS included all awards and degrees conferred between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2019, in the US. Main Outcomes and Measures: A health workforce diversity index (diversity index) was developed to compare the racial/ethnic diversity of the 10 health care professions (or the graduates in the pipeline) analyzed with the racial/ethnic diversity of the current working-age population (or average student-age population). For the current workforce, the index was the ratio of current workers in a health occupation to the total working-age population by racial/ethnic group. For new graduates, the index was the ratio of recent graduates to the population aged 20 to 35 years by racial/ethnic group. A value equal to 1 indicated equal representation of the racial/ethnic groups in the current workforce (or pipeline) compared with the working-age population. Results: The study sample obtained from the 2019 ACS comprised a weighted total count of 148 358 252 individuals aged 20 to 65 years (White individuals: 89 756 689; Black individuals: 17 916 227; Hispanic individuals: 26 953 648; and Native American individuals: 1 108 404) who were working or searching for work and a weighted total count of 71 608 009 individuals aged 20 to 35 years (White individuals: 38 995 242; Black individuals: 9 830 765; Hispanic individuals: 15 257 274; and Native American individuals: 650 221) in the educational pipeline. Among the 10 professions assessed, the mean diversity index for Black people was 0.54 in the current workforce and in the educational pipeline. In 5 of 10 health care professions, representation of Black graduates was lower than representation in the current workforce (eg, occupational therapy: 0.31 vs 0.50). The mean diversity index for Hispanic people was 0.34 in the current workforce; it improved to 0.48 in the educational pipeline but remained lower than 0.50 in 6 of 10 professions, including physical therapy (0.33). The mean diversity index for Native American people was 0.54 in the current workforce and increased to 0.57 in the educational pipeline. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that Black, Hispanic, and Native American people were underrepresented in the 10 health care professions analyzed. Although some professions had greater diversity than others and there appeared to be improvement among graduates in the educational pipeline compared with the current workforce, additional policies are needed to further strengthen and support a workforce that is more representative of the population.","output":"Estimation and Comparison of Current and Future Racial/Ethnic Representation in the US Health Care Workforce"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In post COVID-19 era, labor education plays an indispensable part in China's digital economy, while the digital economy will redefine the labor education at the same time From the Marxist theory, latest data and survey results, we portray the logic relationships, mutual impacts between digital economy and labor education Our research indicates that free development of all human beings is the common value shared by the digital economy and labor education Labor education can cultivate the abilities of competition and cooperation, form the proper digital economy values meanwhile, which is essential to hedge the negative impacts of digital economy on labor and employment Labor education comprehensively promotes the digital labor abilities of all laborers in the path with Chinese characteristics The boom in digital economy and the refocusing on labor education will enable China to cope with the rising risks and challenges in a more diversified and flexible way among this highly uncertain world ? 2020 - IOS Press and the authors All rights reserved","output":"Association between China's digital economy and labor education in post-pandemic of COVID-19 based on neural network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper provides a meticulous examination of the impact of COVID-19 on increasing the cost of labor and project prices in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) The ongoing pandemic has led to an unprecedented crisis that has wreaked havoc on the UAE's economic sector and labor market For instance, measures such as total or partial lockdown have resulted in the closing down of companies that has caused job losses to various people The research gathered scholarly resources of different scholars, giving their accounts concerning how the COVID-19 pandemic has grossly affected the economic sector and labor costs in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) The study used purposive sampling techniques to explore the factors contributing to the increase in the cost of labor and project prices The purposive sampling technique's primary aim was to determine how the elements were affected and their impact on the economy of the UAE Also, random online interviews were utilized to demystify the effects of COVID-19 on the UAE's working and non-working citizens The research found that most businesses have remained shut while the few operating ones have employed flexible working schemes such as working from home and reducing employees' numbers However, the research had certain limitations Foremost, it was limited to business organizations and construction projects selected Besides, the provided information was brief and undetailed From conducting the research, it is needful for the researcher to use a qualitative research method for the study in the future The technique will provide detailed information concerning the contractors' and entrepreneurs' perceptions of the impacts of COVID-19 on the economic sector","output":"The impact of covid 19 on increasing the cost of labor and project price in the United Arab Emirates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to empirically examine sexual and gender minority stress among LGBTQ+ populations during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the urinary Cd level was significantly positively associated with only urinary NAG ( = 0.161, 95% CI: 0.027C0.296) in females. This study thus indicates that the effect of exposure to metals (especially Cd) on early renal impairment among young adults in Taiwan is sex-specific. Our study results could contribute toward developing early intervention programs for decreasing the incidence of renal dysfunction. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings and clarify the potential mechanisms involved.

These robots assist first responders by performing tasks that are impractical or impossible for humans. Unfortunately, current disaster robots usually lack the maneuverability to efficiently traverse these areas, which often necessitate extreme navigational capabilities, such as centimeter-scale clearance. Recent work has shown that it is possible to control the locomotion of insects such as the Madagascar hissing cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa) through bioelectrical stimulation of their neuro-mechanical system. This provides access to a novel agent that can traverse areas that are inaccessible to traditional robots. In this paper, we present a data-driven inertial navigation system that is capable of localizing cockroaches in areas where GPS is not available. We pose the navigation problem as a two-point boundary-value problem where the goal is to reconstruct a cockroach's trajectory between the starting and ending states, which are assumed to be known. We validated our technique using nine trials that were conducted in a circular arena using a biobotic agent equipped with a thorax-mounted, low-cost inertial measurement unit. Results show that we can achieve centimeter-level accuracy. This is accomplished by estimating the cockroach's velocity-using regression models that have been trained to estimate the speed and heading from the inertial signals themselves-and solving an optimization problem so that the boundary-value constraints are satisfied.","output":"Localization of Biobotic Insects Using Low-Cost Inertial Measurement Units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: During the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, obesity may contribute to COVID-19 transmission and deterioration. In addition, many patients with COVID-19 infection have suffered liver damage which might contribute to a worse prognosis. We conducted a clinical epidemiological analysis to investigate the association of overweight/obesity and abnormal liver function (ALF) with hospitalized duration in patients infected with COVID-19. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with diagnosed COVID-19 (22 women & 36 men; average age: 49.2  13.1 yr) were included, and their clinical data were collected at The Second Affiliated and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang. Overweight/obesity was determined as body mass index (BMI) &#8805;24 kg/m2, ALF was determined as alanine aminotransferase >40 U/L, and prolonged hospitalization was lasting more than the median value of the hospitalized days (19 days) in this population. RESULTS: The proportions of prolonged hospitalization were elevated in patients with overweight/obesity and ALF compared with those without overweight/obesity (62.1% versus 26.1%, P = 0.010) and those without ALF (70.6% versus 41.5%, P = 0.043). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the hospitalized duration was increased from the patients with neither overweight/obesity nor ALF to those with either overweight/obesity or ALF, and to those with both of overweight/obesity and ALF (mean with 95% confidence interval: 16.4 [14.5-18.3] versus 25.3 [21.6-29.1] versus 28.3 [24.6-32.0], P for trend = 0.001).

OBJECTIVES: Examine the effects of co-occurring fatigue and lymphatic pain on activities of daily living (ADLs), emotional distress, and overall health of breast cancer patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional and observational design was used to enroll 354 breast cancer patients. Valid and reliable instruments were used to assess fatigue, lymphatic pain, ADLs, emotional distress, and overall health. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression models were used for data analysis. RESULTS: After controlling for demographic and clinical factors, patients with co-occurring fatigue and lymphatic pain had higher odds of having impaired ADLs (OR = 24.43, CI = [5.44-109.67], P < .001) and emotional distress (OR = 26.52, CI = [9.64-72.90], P < .001) compared to patients with only fatigue and only lymphatic pain. Patients with co-occurring fatigue and lymphatic pain had 179% increase in impaired ADL scores (B = 8.06, CI = [5.54-10.59]) and 211% increase in emotional distress scores (B = 9.17, CI = [5.52-12.83]) compared to those without co-occurring fatigue and lymphatic pain.

This information is especially important as pneumonia is the single leading cause of death in children worldwide. This Systematic Review aims to elucidate a better understanding of the global impact of COVID-19 on the pediatric population. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to gain insight into pediatric COVID-19 epidemiology. Specifically, Pubmed and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify any relevant article with a focus on Pediatric Covid 19, Pediatric Covid-19, Pediatric SARS-COV-2, and Pediatric Coronavirus 19. References within the included articles were reviewed. All articles that met criteria where analyzed for demographics, clinical, laboratory, radiographic, treatment and outcomes data. RESULTS: Ten studies including two case series and 8 retrospective chart reviews, altogether describing a total of 2914 pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included in this systematic review. Of the patients whose data was available, 56% were male, the age range was 1a?day to 17a?years, 79% were reported to have no comorbidities, and of the 21% with comorbidities, the most common were asthma, immunosupression, and cardiovascular disease. Of pediatric patients that were tested and positive for an infection with SARS-CoV-2, patients were asymptomatic, 14.9% of the time. Patients presented with cough (48%), fever (47%) and sore throat/pharyngitis (28.6%), more commonly than with upper respiratory symptoms/rhinorrhea/sneezing/nasal congestion (13.7%), vomiting/nausea (7.8%) and diarrhea (10.1%). Median lab values including those for WBC, lymphocyte count and CRP, were within the reference ranges with the exception of procalcitonin levels, which were slightly elevated in children with COVID-19 (median procalcitonin levels ranged from 0.07 to 0.5a?ng/mL. Computed tomography (CT) results suggest that unilateral CT imaging findings are present 36% of cases while 64% of pediatric patients with COVID-19 had bilateral findings. Of the studies with age specific hospitalization data available, 27.0% of patients hospitalized were infants under 1a?year of age. Various treatment regimens including interferon, antivirals, and hydroxychloroquine therapies have been trialed on the pediatric population but there are currently no studies showing efficacy of one regimen over the other. The mortality rate of children that were hospitalized with COVID-19 was 0.18%. CONCLUSION: In contrast to adults, most infected children appear to have a milder course and have better outcomes overall. Additional care may be needed for children with comorbidities and younger children. This review also suggests that unilateral CT chest imaging findings were seen in 36.4% pediatric COVID-19 patients. This is particularly concerning as the work-up of pediatric patients with cough may warrant a bronchoscopy to evaluate for airway foreign bodies.

Our findings suggested that combinatorial VC and GA treatment for COVID-19 was associated with elevation of immunity and suppression of inflammatory stress, including activation of the T cell receptor signaling pathway, regulation of Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, ErbB signaling pathway and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway. We also identified 17 core targets of VC + GA, which suggest as antimicrobial function. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our study uncovered the pharmacological mechanism underlying combined VC and GA treatment for COVID-19. These results should benefit efforts to address the most pressing problem currently facing the world.","output":"Integrative pharmacological mechanism of vitamin C combined with glycyrrhizic acid against COVID-19: findings of bioinformatics analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

By using icSHAPE, we determined the structural landscape of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells and from refolded RNAs, as well as the regulatory untranslated regions of SARS-CoV-2 and six other coronaviruses. We validated several structural elements predicted in silico and discovered structural features that affect the translation and abundance of subgenomic viral RNAs in cells. The structural data informed a deep-learning tool to predict 42 host proteins that bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Strikingly, antisense oligonucleotides targeting the structural elements and FDA-approved drugs inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA binding proteins dramatically reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells derived from human liver and lung tumors.

We analyzed changes in uptake since the previous Spanish National Health Interview Survey conducted in 2017 and identified variables associated with vaccine uptake. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study. The primary study variable was the self-reported uptake of influenza vaccine in the previous year. We analyzed sex, age, country of birth, and being an HCW. We identified participants with self-reported respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and cerebrovascular diseases. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to assess changes over time and to identify variables associated with vaccination in target groups. RESULTS: Uptake was 19.2% in 22,072 participants aged 15 years. Uptake was 54.4% for those aged 65 years, 41.6% for those with a high-risk medical condition, and 26.53% among HCWs. Uptake by disease was 52.1% for cerebrovascular diseases, 51.3% for cardiovascular diseases, 48.3% for diabetes, 46.1% for cancer, and 36.2% for respiratory diseases. No significant improvement has been observed since 2017 in any target group, except for participants with cancer, whose uptake increased from 33.2% to 46.1%(p < 0.001). The variables that significantly increased the probability of reporting vaccine uptake were female sex, age 35 years, being born in Spain, self-reported respiratory or cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and being a HCW. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination uptake among target groups in Spain is below desirable levels and has not improved significantly since 2017. Older age, female sex, and being born in Spain are positive predictors of vaccine uptake. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need to implement new strategies to increase influenza vaccine uptake.","output":"Influenza vaccination uptake among high-risk target groups and health care workers in Spain and change from 2017 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are four outcomes to feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection: the development of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP, which is immune-mediated), subclinical infection, development of healthy lifelong carriers and a small minority of cats who resist infection (Addie and Jarrett, Veterinary Record 148 (2001) 649). Examination of the FCoV genome has shown that the same strain of virus can produce different clinical manifestations, suggesting that host genetic factors may also play a role in the outcome of infection. FIP is most prevalent amongst pedigree cats, although how much of this is due to them living in large groups (leading to higher virus challenge and stress which predisposes to FIP) and how much is due to genetic susceptibility is not known. If host genetics could be shown to play a role in disease, it may allow the detection of cats with a susceptibility to FIP and the development of increased population resistance through selective breeding. The feline leucocyte antigen (FLA) complex contains many genes that are central to the control of the immune response. In this preliminary study, we used clonal sequence analysis or reference strand conformational analysis (RSCA) to analyse the class II FLACDRB of 25 cats for which the outcome of FCoV exposure was known. Individual cats were shown to have between two and six FLACDRB alleles. There was no statistically significant association between the number of alleles and the outcome of FCoV infection. No particular allele appeared to be associated with either the development of FIP, resistance to FCoV, or the carrier status. However, the analysis was complicated by apparent breed variation in FLACDRB and the small number of individuals in this study.","output":"Feline leucocyte antigen class II polymorphism and susceptibility to feline infectious peritonitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS This study presents the cost-effectiveness analysis of bariatric surgery in Belgium from a third-party payer perspective for a lifetime and 10-year horizon. MATERIALS AND METHODS A decision analytic model incorporating Markov process was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and adjustable gastric banding against conventional medical management (CMM). In the model, patients could undergo surgery, or experience post-surgery complications, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or die. Transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were derived from the literature. The impact of different surgical methods on body mass index (BMI) level in the base-case analysis was informed by the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry and the Swedish Obese Subject (SOS) study. Healthcare resource use and costs were obtained from Belgian sources. A base-case analysis was performed for the population, the characteristics of which were obtained from surgery candidates in Belgium. RESULTS In the base-case analysis over a 10-year time horizon, the increment in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained from bariatric surgery vs CMM was 1.4 per patient, whereas the incremental cost was 3,788, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 2,809 per QALY. Over a lifetime, bariatric surgery produced savings of 9,332, an additional 1.1 life years and 5.0 QALYs. Bariatric surgery was cost-effective at 10 years post-surgery and dominant over conventional management over a lifetime horizon. LIMITATIONS The model did not include the whole scope of obesity-related complications, and also did not account for variation in surgery outcomes for different populations of diabetic patients. Also, the data about management of patients after surgery was based on assumptions and the opinion of a clinical expert.

As a result, the quantitative detection of COVID-19 with an ultra-high sensitivity (1.66%/nm), a wide detection range, and a diverse measurement environment (gas/liquid) is achieved. In addition, the unique infrared fingerprint recognition characteristics of the sensor also make it an ideal choice for mutant virus screening.

Light-propulsion occurs as consequence of the coupling between the chirality of polymeric particles - left (L)- or right (R)-type - and the circularly-polarized light that irradiates them. Irradiation with light that has the same helicity as the particle material leads to a circular cooperative vortical motion between the chiral Brownian particles. In contrast, opposite circular-polarization does not induce such coupling among the particles but only affects their Brownian motion. The mean angular momentum of each particle has a value and sign that distinguishes between chiral activity dynamics and typical Brownian motion. These outcomes have relevant implications for chiral separation technologies and provide new strategies for optical torque tunability in mesoscopic optical array systems, micro- and nanofabrication of light-activated engines with selective control and collective motion.","output":"Collective motion of chiral Brownian particles controlled by a circularly-polarized laser beam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"2020 has brought a severe impact on the world.

Several new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged globally, of which the most notable and concerning currently are the UK variant B.1.1.7, the South African variant B1.351 and the Brazilian variant P.1. Detecting and monitoring novel variants is essential in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. While there are several tools for assembling virus genomes and performing lineage analyses to investigate SARS-CoV-2, each is limited to performing singular or a few functions separately. RESULTS: Due to the lack of publicly available pipelines, which could perform fast reference-based assemblies on raw SARS-CoV-2 sequences in addition to identifying lineages to detect variants of concern, we have developed an open source bioinformatic pipeline called HAVoC (Helsinki university Analyzer for Variants of Concern). HAVoC can reference assemble raw sequence reads and assign the corresponding lineages to SARS-CoV-2 sequences. CONCLUSIONS: HAVoC is a pipeline utilizing several bioinformatic tools to perform multiple necessary analyses for investigating genetic variance among SARS-CoV-2 samples. The pipeline is particularly useful for those who need a more accessible and fast tool to detect and monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern during local outbreaks.

We recently introduced the ALFA-tag together with two ALFA-specific single-domain antibodies (sdAbs), NbALFA and NbALFA(PE), featuring high or intermediate affinity, respectively. Together, the ALFA system can be employed for a broad range of applications in microscopy, cell biology and biochemistry requiring either extraordinarily stable binding or mild competitive elution at room temperature. In order to further enhance the versatility of the ALFA system, we, here, aimed at developing an sdAb optimized for efficient elution at low temperatures. To achieve this, we followed a stringent selection scheme tailored to the specific application. We found candidates combining a fast capture of ALFA-tagged proteins with an efficient competitive elution at 4 C in physiological buffer. Importantly, by employing a structure-guided semisynthetic library based on well-characterized NbALFA variants, the high specificity and consistent binding of proteins harboring ALFA-tags at either terminus could be maintained. ALFA Selector(CE), a resin presenting the cold-elutable NbALFA(CE), is an ideal tool for the one-step purification of sensitive protein complexes or temperature-labile enzymes.

However, COVID-19 vaccination rates among the Veteran homeless population are currently unknown. This study examines the COVID-19 vaccination rate among homeless Veterans who receive care at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the factors that are associated with vaccine uptake. Using VA administrative and clinical data, bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify the sociodemographic, health-related, and healthcare and housing services utilization factors that influenced COVID-19 vaccine uptake during the first eight months of the vaccine rollout (December 2020CAugust 2021). Of the 83,528 Veterans experiencing homelessness included in the study, 45.8% were vaccinated for COVID-19. Non-white, older Veterans (65+), females, those who received the seasonal flu vaccine, and Veterans with multiple comorbidities and mental health conditions were more likely to be vaccinated. There was a strong association between COVID-19 vaccination and Veterans who utilized VA healthcare and housing services.

CVD is more prevalent among military veterans than nonveterans, and veteran status is associated with higher risk of incident heart disease after controlling for socioeconomic status, other medical diseases, depression, and lifestyle. Many patients seeking care in the Veterans Health Administration, including those who undergo cardiac catheterization, meet the criteria for multimorbidity (defined as  2 chronic diseases). Observations The Heart Disease Reversal Program (HDRP) is a novel interdisciplinary, multicomponent lifestyle program at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Sacramento VA Medical Center. This program is a streamlined adaptation of behavioral/lifestyle interventions aimed at promoting partial reversal (regression) of atherosclerotic heart disease and achievement of comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction. HDRP was developed and implemented within a VA behavioral medicine clinic and successfully adapted for delivery through videoconferencing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient satisfaction survey data indicate a very high level of patient acceptability. We found direct-to-patient clinical outreach an effective method for launching a disease reversal program. Conclusions Beyond the clinical benefits to patients, there is significant value and benefit added to the health care system by offering an intervention within the disease reversal paradigm. Efforts of the health care team to reverse a disease can be considered the highest aim of medicine and health care.","output":"The Design and Implementation of a Heart Disease Reversal Program in the Veterans Health Administration: Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infant and toddler MRI enables unprecedented insight into the developing brain.

This study presents overall levels of perceived stress and general anxiety symptoms and inequalities across each of these outcomes by gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and household income. We also explore potential explanations for these health issues by analyzing baseline qualitative data. RESULTS All students, on average, were suffering from perceived stress and anxiety, with especially high levels in April. We also identified inequalities in college student mental well-being, particularly by gender identity and sexual orientation. Women reported worse well-being compared with men; transgender and gender diverse and sexual minority youths reported worse outcomes than their cisgender, heterosexual peers at both time points. Qualitative data illustrate how the COVID-19 pandemic has generated educational, economic, and environmental stressors that are affecting college students' well-being.

In this manuscript we have described a few nuances of the technique still not properly described in the literature: the presence of three colors clusters; the correlation of the viral load with the color change; and the importance of using an internal control to avoid false-negative results. METHODS: To achieve these findings, we performed colorimetric RT-LAMP assays of 466 SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR validated clinical samples, with color quantification measured at 434 nm and 560 nm. RESULTS: First we determinate a sensitivity of 93.8% and specificity of 90.4%. In addition to the pink (negative) and yellow (positive) produced colors, we report for the first time the presence of an orange color cluster that may lead to wrong diagnosis. We also demonstrated using RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP that low viral loads are related to Ct values > 30, resulting in orange colors. We also demonstrated that the diagnosis of COVID-19 by colorimetric RT-LAMP is efficient until the fifth symptoms day when the viral load is still relatively high. CONCLUSION: This study reports properties and indications for colorimetric RT-LAMP as point-of-care for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic, reducing false results, interpretations and optimizing molecular diagnostics tests application.","output":"Essential properties and pitfalls of colorimetric Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification as a point-of-care test for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients tend to be older and frequently have hypertension, diabetes, or coronary heart disease, but whether these comorbidities are true risk factors (ie, more common than in the general older population) is unclear.

METHODS: UK Biobank (England) participants with baseline assessment 2006C2010, followed in hospital discharge records to 2017 and death records to 2020. Demographic and preexisting common diagnoses association tested with hospitalized laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (March 16 to April 26, 2020), alone or with mortality, in logistic models. RESULTS: Of 269 070 participants aged older than 65, 507 (0.2%) became COVID-19 hospital inpatients, of which 141 (27.8%) died. Common comorbidities in hospitalized inpatients were hypertension (59.6%), history of fall or fragility fractures (29.4%), coronary heart disease (21.5%), type 2 diabetes (type 2, 19. 9%), and asthma (17.6%). However, in models adjusted for comorbidities, age group, sex, ethnicity, and education, preexisting diagnoses of dementia, type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, depression, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension emerged as independent risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization, the first 5 remaining statistically significant for related mortality.

The daily case rate is now declining in many states and there is a need for guidance about the resumption of elective clinical services for patients with lung disease or sleep conditions. Methods: Volunteers were solicited from the Association of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Division Directors and American Thoracic Society. Working groups developed plans by discussion and consensus for resuming elective services in pulmonary and sleep-medicine clinics, pulmonary function testing laboratories, bronchoscopy and procedure suites, polysomnography laboratories, and pulmonary rehabilitation facilities. Results: The community new case rate should be consistently low or have a downward trajectory for at least 14 days before resuming elective clinical services. In addition, institutions should have an operational strategy that consists of patient prioritization, screening, diagnostic testing, physical distancing, infection control, and follow-up surveillance. The goals are to protect patients and staff from exposure to the virus, account for limitations in staff, equipment, and space that are essential for the care of patients with COVID-19, and provide access to care for patients with acute and chronic conditions. Conclusions: Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a dynamic process and, therefore, it is likely that the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community will wax and wane.

We surveyed residents from a national sample of internal medicine (IM) residency programs to describe their experiences with the transition to virtual morning report (MR), a highly valued core educational conference. OBJECTIVE: Assess resident views about virtual MR content and teaching strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Anonymous, web-based survey. PARTICIPANTS: Residents from 14 academically affiliated IM residency programs. MAIN MEASURES: The 25-item survey on virtual MR included questions on demographics; frequency and reason for attending; opinions on who should attend and teach; how the virtual format affects the learning environment; how virtual MR compares to in-person MR with regard to participation, engagement, and overall education; and whether virtual MR should continue after in-person conferences can safely resume. The survey included a combination of Likert-style, multiple option, and open-ended questions. RESULTS: Six hundred fifteen residents (35%) completed the survey, with a balanced sample of interns (39%), second-year (31%), and third-year (30%) residents. When comparing their overall assessment of in-person and virtual MR formats, 42% of residents preferred in-person, 18% preferred virtual, and 40% felt they were equivalent. Most respondents endorsed better peer-engagement, camaraderie, and group participation with in-person MR. Chat boxes, video participation, audience response systems, and smart boards/tablets enhanced respondents' educational experience during virtual MR. Most respondents (72%) felt that the option of virtual MR should continue when it is safe to resume in-person conferences. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual MR was a valued alternative to traditional in-person MR during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although, the direct link between Covid-19 and DSN is still speculative, the hypothetical links are thought to be either a direct neuronal injury of the autonomic pathway or a para/post-infectious immune-induced mechanism. SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced stress may activate the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) leading to neuro-hormonal stimulation and activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines with further development of sympathetic storm. Sympathetic over-activation in Covid-19 is correlated with increase in capillary pulmonary leakage, alveolar damage, and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 can spread through pulmonary mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors to medullary respiratory center in a retrograde manner resulting in sudden respiratory failure. Taken together, DSN in Covid-19 is developed due to sympathetic storm and inhibition of Parasympathetic nervous system-mediated anti-inflammatory effect with development of cytokine storm.

AIMS: This study aimed to determine the feasibility of anodal tDCS as an adjunct to VNeST to improve discourse production in post-stroke chronic aphasia. METHODS: Six people with post-stroke chronic aphasia took part in this double-blinded randomized feasibility study. Participants were randomly allocated to either the experimental group receiving a 6-week block of once weekly VNeST sessions combined with active tDCS over the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) or a control group that received VNeST with sham stimulation. Feasibility outcomes included screening, eligibility, retention, and completion rates, and adverse events.

The content of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was determined by ELISA using a set of tests for human serum or plasma for specific immunoglobulins of class G to the nucleocapsid of the SARS-CoV-2 virus produced by FBUN GNCPMiB Rospotrebnadzor (Obolensk). The results of a research of the humoral immunity of volunteers show that during the period of an epidemic rise in the incidence of COVID-19 in the Irkutsk region, a low level of seroprevalence was formed (stage 1 C 5.8  0.5%, stage 2 C 12,1  0,7%), and in conditions of a long-term maximum increase in the incidence rate ?C 25,91,0% (stage 3). A significant proportion (stage 1 C 81,23,2%, stage 2 C 90.9 1,9%) of asymptomatic forms of infection characterize the high intensity of the latently developing epidemic process in the first two stages. High levels of IgG in reconvalescents of COVID-19 persisted for an average of 3 to 4.5 months. Conclusion. The results of assessing the population immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population of the Irkutsk region indicate that the seroprevalence level at the 3rd stage of the research was 25.9%. After the disease, on average, 41.6% of persons did not detect antibodies. The results obtained should be taken into account when organizing preventive measures, including vaccination, and predicting morbidity. ? 2021, Numikom.

Convalescent plasma has antiviral activity and early observational studies suggested benefit in reducing COVID-19 severity. We investigated the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a population with a high HIV prevalence and where few therapeutic options were available. We performed a double-blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in one private and three public sector hospitals in South Africa. Adult participants with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring non-invasive oxygen were randomized 1:1 to receive a single transfusion of 200 mL of either convalescent plasma or 0.9% saline solution. The primary outcome measure was hospital discharge and/or improvement of  2 points on the World Health Organisation Blueprint Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement by day 28 of enrolment. The trial was stopped early for futility by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. 103 participants, including 21 HIV positive individuals, were randomized at the time of premature trial termination: 52 in the convalescent plasma and 51 in the placebo group. The primary outcome occurred in 31 participants in the convalescent plasma group and and 32 participants in the placebo group (relative risk 1.03 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.38). Two grade 1 transfusion-related adverse events occurred. Participants who improved clinically received convalescent plasma with a higher median anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titre compared with those who did not (298 versus 205 AU/mL). Our study contributes additional evidence for recommendations against the use of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 pneumonia.

However, elderly patients are usually excluded from clinical studies and age is considered as an independent negative prognostic factor for patients with GBM. Therefore, the best treatment method for GBM in elderly patients has remained controversial. Elderly GBM patients ( 60 years old) treated between January 2015 and December 2019 were enrolled in this study. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively, and clinicopathological characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. A total of 68 patients were included, with a median age of 65.5 years (range: 60-79). The median preoperative Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) score was 90 (range 40-100) and median postoperative KPS score was 80 (range 0-90). Univariate analysis results showed that age, gender, comorbidities, preoperative KPS < 90 and MGMT promoter methylation were not significantly associated with PFS and OS. On the other hand, total resection, postoperative KPS  80, Ki67 > 25%, and Stupp-protocol treatment were significantly associated with prolonged PFS and OS. Moreover, multivariate analysis found that postoperative KPS  80, total resection, and Stupp-protocol treatment were prognostic factors for PFS and OS. The findings of this study have suggested that, on the premise of protecting function as much as possible, the more aggressive treatment regimens may prolong survival for elderly patients with GBM. However, further studies, particularly prospective randomized clinical trials, should be conducted to provide more definitive data on the appropriate management of elderly patients, especially for patients with MGMT promoter methylation.","output":"Prognostic and Predictive Factors in Elderly Patients With Glioblastoma: A Single-Center Retrospective Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in February 2003 in Guangdong, China, middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) in September2012 in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the current COVID-19 pandemics in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, are all caused by coronaviruses, and patients primarily died of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Compared with more than 5 years of wreaking havoc from MERS-CoV and Ebor, China successfully contains the SARS-CoV within one year, which shows her advantages in political governance controlling such pandemics Many coronaviruses have been separated and their molecular structures analyzed However, there is no specific anti-coronavirus drug developed in the world since the outbreaks The problems come from not only pharmaceutical technology per se that must treat both coronaviruses and their life-threatening ARDS, but also the small size of patients who could immune against the coronaviruses after infections resulting in pharmaceutical reluctance to invest in the area Facing both the pharmaceutical and social-economic bottlenecks, here, we summarized the current development of anti-coronavirus drugs, and proposed the strategies of repurposing existing drugs and preparing their pharmacological combinations to fight the viruses including COVID-19 based on a well-understanding of how the coronaviruses enter the host and damage our respiratory system","output":"Current status and bottlenecks of global pharmaceutical developments against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fever is one of the most common reasons for unwell children presenting to pharmacists and primary healthcare practitioners. Currently there are no guidelines for assessment and management of fever specifically for community and primary healthcare workers in the sub-Saharan Africa region. This multidisciplinary consensus guide was developed to assist pharmacists and primary healthcare workers in sub-Saharan Africa to risk stratify and manage children who present with fever, decide when to refer, and how to advise parents and caregivers. Fever is defined as body temperature  37.5 C and is a normal physiological response to illness that facilitates and accelerates recovery. Although it is often associated with self-limiting illness, it causes significant concern to both parents and attending healthcare workers. Clinical signs may be used by pharmacy staff and primary healthcare workers to determine level of distress and to distinguish between a child with fever who is at high risk of serious illness and who requires specific treatment, hospitalisation or specialist care, and those at low risk who could be managed conservatively at home. In children with warning signs, serious causes of fever that may need to be excluded include infections (including malaria), non-infective inflammatory conditions and malignancy. Simple febrile convulsions are not in themselves harmful, and are not necessarily indicative of serious infection. In the absence of illness requiring specific treatment, relief from distress is the primary indication for prescribing pharmacotherapy, and antipyretics should not be administered with the sole intention of reducing body temperature. Care must be taken not to overdose medications and clear instructions should be given to parents/caregivers on managing the child at home and when to seek further medical care.","output":"Management of acute fever in children: Consensus recommendations for community and primary healthcare providers in sub-Saharan Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE Most acute kidney injury observed in the hospital is defined by sudden mild or moderate increases in the serum creatinine concentration, which may persist for several days. Such acute kidney injury is associated with lower long-term kidney function. However, it has not been demonstrated that an intervention that reduces the risk of such acute kidney injury better preserves long-term kidney function. OBJECTIVES To characterize the risk of acute kidney injury with an intervention in a randomized clinical trial and to determine if there is a difference between the 2 treatment groups in kidney function 1 year later. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery Off- or On-pump Revascularisation Study (CORONARY) enrolled 4752 patients undergoing first isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery at 79 sites in 19 countries. Patients were randomized to receive CABG surgery either with a beating-heart technique (off-pump) or with cardiopulmonary bypass (on-pump). From January 2010 to November 2011, 2932 patients (from 63 sites in 16 countries) from CORONARY were enrolled into a kidney function substudy to record serum creatinine concentrations during the postoperative period and at 1 year. The last 1-year serum creatinine concentration was recorded on January 18, 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Acute kidney injury within 30 days of surgery (50% increase in serum creatinine concentration from prerandomization concentration) and loss of kidney function at 1 year (20% loss in estimated glomerular filtration rate from prerandomization level). RESULTS Off-pump (n = 1472) vs on-pump (n = 1460) CABG surgery reduced the risk of acute kidney injury (17.5% vs 20.8%, respectively; relative risk, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.72-0.97], P = .01); however, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the loss of kidney function at 1 year (17.1% vs 15.3%, respectively; relative risk, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.95-1.29], P = .23). Results were consistent with multiple alternate continuous and categorical definitions of acute kidney injury or kidney function loss, and in the subgroup with baseline chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Use of off-pump compared with on-pump CABG surgery reduced the risk of postoperative acute kidney injury, without evidence of better preserved kidney function with off-pump CABG surgery at 1 year. In this setting, an intervention that reduced the risk of mild to moderate acute kidney injury did not alter longer-term kidney function.

OBJECTIVES The main objective of the present study is to analyze in the Iberian population the effect of 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with NOA in Han Chinese through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and to establish their possible functional relevance in the development of specific SpF patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS We genotyped 674 Iberian infertile men (including 480 NOA and 194 SO patients) and 1058 matched unaffected controls for the GWAS-associated variants PRMT6-rs12097821, PEX10-rs2477686, CDC42BPA-rs3000811, IL17A-rs13206743, ABLIM1-rs7099208, and SOX5-rs10842262. Their association with SpF, SO, NOA, and different NOA phenotypes was evaluated by logistic regression models, and their functional relevance was defined by comprehensive interrogation of public resources. RESULTS ABLIM1-rs7099208 was associated with SpF under both the additive (OR=0.86, P=0.036) and dominant models (OR=0.78, P=0.026). The CDC42BPA-rs3000811 minor allele frequency was significantly increased in the subgroup of NOA patients showing maturation arrest (MA) of germ cells compared to the remaining NOA cases under the recessive model (OR=4.45, P=0.044). The PEX10-rs2477686 SNP was associated with a negative testicular sperm extraction (TESE) outcome under the additive model (OR=1.32, P=0.034). The analysis of functional annotations suggested that these variants affect the testis-specific expression of nearby genes and that lincRNA may play a role in SpF. CONCLUSIONS Our data support the association of 3 previously reported NOA risk variants in Asians (ABLIM1-rs7099208, CDC42BPA-rs3000811, and PEX10-rs2477686) with different manifestations of SpF in Iberians of European descent, likely by influencing gene expression and lincRNA deregulation.","output":"Effect and in silico characterization of genetic variants associated with severe spermatogenic disorders in a large Iberian cohort."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Respiratory viruses are important etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, the impact of different RVs on the outcomes of CAP is not well elucidated. This study aims to compare the clinical features and severity of influenza (Flu-p) and non-influenza respiratory viruses-related pneumonia (NIRVs-p) onset in the community among immunocompetent adults. METHODS: The data of the patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed RVs-p were retrospectively reviewed from five teaching hospitals in China from January 2013 to May 2019. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes between Flu-p and NIRVs-p.

Acquired somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (clonal hematopoiesis or CH) are common in elderly individuals. Previous studies have shown CH is associated with alterations in immunologic repertoire and function. Here, we investigate whether CH predisposes to severe COVID-19 or other infections. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 39,291 adult cancer patients with non-hematologic malignancies who had their tumor and blood sequenced using a panel of 468 known cancer driver genes. We identified individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 8, 2020 and June 9, 2020. We determined the association between CH and severe COVID-19 (hypoxic event, hospitalization or death) using multivariable logistic regression models. We used an established aggregation schema for ICD-CM codes to identify distinct infection subtypes. The relationship between CH and risk of incident infections was determined using multivariable Cox regression. Results: In the study cohort, 436 patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 165 developed severe COVID-19. COVID-19 patients with CH were more likely to develop severe disease compared to non-severe (OR=1.8; 95% CI: 1.1-2.9; p=0.01). CH was also more common among patients with severe COVID-19 compared to COVID-19 negative individuals (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.4, p=0.01).

The growing costs for diagnosis and management of drug resistance threaten tuberculosis control where the disease is endemic and resources limited. Bacteriophages are viruses that attack bacteria. Phage preparations served as anti-infective agents long before antibiotics were discovered. Though small in size, phages are the most abundant and diverse biological entity on earth. Phages have co-evolved with their hosts and possess all the tools needed to infect and kill bacteria, independent of drug resistance. Modern biotechnology has improved our understanding of the biology of phages and their possible uses. Phage preparations are available to treat meat, fruit, vegetables, and dairy products against parasites or to prevent contamination with human pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus aureus. Such phage-treated products are considered fit for human consumption. A number of recent case reports describe in great detail the successful treatment of highly drug-resistant infections with individualized phage preparations. Formal clinical trials with standardized products are slowly emerging. With its highly conserved genome and relative paucity of natural phage defence mechanisms Mycobacterium tuberculosis appears to be a suitable target for phage treatment. A phage cocktail with diverse and strictly lytic phages that kill all lineages of M. tuberculosis, and can be propagated on Mycobacterium smegmatis, has been assembled and is available for the evaluation of optimal dosage and suitable routes of administration for tuberculosis in humans.

Furthermore, changes and modifications are continuously taking place in hospitals, with no consideration to the important role those changes might play in reducing or encouraging WPV behaviors. OBJECTIVE This research serves as an initial step in offering answers on how the environmental design of an ED can be modified and manipulated to prevent and control WPV. Accordingly, the objective of this research is to identify the environmental features that potentially influence WPV in the ED.

What are the risk factors for COVID-19? What are the differences between this novel coronavirus and other coronaviruses? To answer these questions, a comparative study of three pathogenic coronaviruses that primarily invade the human respiratory system and may cause death, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This review describes the source of origin, transmission, and pathogenicity of these viruses.

Otolaryngologists and supporting health care workers (HCWs) are particularly at high risk of becoming infected while treating patients as many in-office procedures and surgeries are Aerosol Generating Medical Procedures (AGMP). Based on a review of the literature and various guidelines, recommendations are made to mitigate the risk to health care workers of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 while providing clinical care. RECOMMENDATIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic all elective and non-time sensitive Otolaryngology procedures should be deferred to mitigate the risk of transmission of infection to HCWs. For non-AGMPs in all patients, even COVID-19 positive patients Level 1 PPE (surgical mask, gown, gloves and face shield or goggles) is sufficient. If local prevalence is favourable and patients are asymptomatic and test negative for SARS-CoV-2, Level 1 PPE can be used during short duration AGMPs, with limited risk of infected aerosol spread. For AGMPs in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a minimum of Level 2 PPE, with adequate protection of mucosal surfaces, is recommended (N95/FFP2 respirator, gown, double gloves, goggles or face shield and head cover). For long duration AGMPs that are deemed high-risk in COVID-19 positive patients, Level 3 PPE can provide a higher level of protection and be more comfortable during long duration surgeries if surgical hoods or PAPRs are used. It is recommended that these procedures are performed in negative pressure rooms, if available. It is essential to follow strict donning and doffing protocols to minimize the risk of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: By following strict infection prevention recommendations, the risk of HCWs becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 while treating patients can be minimized. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves rapidly, these recommendations should serve as guidance and need to be interpreted based on local factors and availability of healthcare resources.","output":"Guidance for otolaryngology health care workers performing aerosol generating medical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Neurology residents are particularly vulnerable to burnout because of the novel logistical and clinical challenges brought about by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite its implications, knowledge on burnout and its predictors among neurology residents is lacking. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of burnout among neurology residents during the pandemic, to compare burnout subscale scores and sociodemographic and work characteristics, and to explore residents perceptions on how to address burnout. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among all 120 residents from the nine institutions in the Philippines offering neurology residency programs from March to August 2020. We obtained sociodemographic and work characteristics using questionnaire. We measured burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. We performed an inductive thematic analysis to analyze perceptions on how to reduce burnout. RESULTS: The response rate was 71.67% (86/120). The mean age was 30.1  3.1 years. Using predefined subscale critical boundaries, the prevalence of burnout was 94% (95% CI 89, 99). The lack of compensation and number of on-duty days influenced emotional exhaustion scores. The number of on-duty days influenced depersonalization scores. Thematic analysis revealed five themes: increasing manpower; self-care; reducing clerical tasks; improving work environment; and adequate compensation.

Effective mass screening requires robust and sensitive tests that reliably detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections with a low viral count. Currently, the most accurate tests are based on detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR. We developed a method to process COVID-19 specimens that simplifies and increases the sensitivity of viral RNA detection by direct RT-qPCR, performed without RNA purification. In the method, termed Alkaline-Glycol Processing (AG Processing), a SARS-CoV-2-containing biological specimen, such as saliva or a swab-collected suspension, is processed at pH 12.2 to 12.8 for 5 min at room temperature. An aliquot of the AG-processed specimen is used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by direct RT-qPCR. AG processing effectively lyses viruses and reduces the effect of inhibitors of RT-PCR that are present in biological specimens. The sensitivity of detecting viral RNA using AG processing is on par with methods that include a viral RNA purification step. One copy of SARS-CoV-2 virus per reaction, equivalent to 300 copies per ml of saliva, is detectable in the AG-processed saliva. The LOD is 300 viral copies per ml of initial saliva specimen. AG processing works with saliva specimens or swab specimens collected into Universal Transport Medium, is compatible with heat treatment of saliva, and was confirmed to work with a range of CDC-approved RT-qPCR products and kits.

Korean women aged 65 years or over at a senior welfare center were randomly allocated to the control (n = 12) or experimental (n = 19) groups from July to October 2019. The intervention consisted of cognicise (exercise with intensified cognitive activity) and neurofeedback twice a week for 10 weeks. The locus of control and depression were measured via self-reported questionnaires. QEEG alpha asymmetry was measured using BrainMaster. Results: Depression significantly decreased in the experimental group (t = 4.113, p = 0.001), while internality in the locus of control significantly decreased in the control group (t = 3.023, p = 0.012).

We aimed to determine the frequency of secondary bacterial infection, antibiotic use, and clinical characteristics in patients admitted to the ICU with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. This was a retrospective cohort study of adults with severe COVID-19 admitted to two ICUs from March 6 to September 7, 2020 in an academic medical center in Isfahan, Iran. To detect COVID-19, reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed and also typical pattern of CT scan was used for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Data collection included the age, gender, main symptoms, history of underlying disease, demographics, hospital stay, outcomes, and antibiotic regimen of the patient. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out according to the CLSI guidelines. During the study period, 553 patients were referred to the both ICUs for COVID-19 with severe pneumonia. Secondary bacterial infection was detected in 65 (11.9%) patients. The median age was 69.4 (range 21C95) years; 42 (63.6%) were men. Notably, 100% (n = 65) of the patients with superinfection were prescribed empirical antibiotics before first positive culture, predominantly meropenem (86.2%) with a median duration of 12 (range 2C32) days and levofloxacin (73.8%) with a median duration of nine (range 2C24) days. Most prevalent causative agents for secondary bacterial infection were Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 44) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 33). Most patients with secondary bacterial infection showed extensive drug-resistance.

A payoff vector quantifying the incentives provided by a planner for each strategy, after deducting the strategies' intrinsic costs, influences the revision process. An evolutionary dynamics model captures the population's preferences in the revision process by specifying as a function of the payoff vector the rates at which the agents' choices flow toward strategies with higher payoffs.

Framed within a more general model of how the mind works, the PSM model maintains that the p factor can be conceived as the empirical marker of the degree of rigidity of the meaning-makers way of interpreting experience, namely of the dimensions of meanings used to map the environments variability. As to the clinical implications, two main aspects are outlined.

The nitrate removal performance in BER with PPy/AQDS composite cathode was obviously improved, the nitrate removal rate (4.96 mg/Lh) was almost 2.0 times higher than the control BER system, and relatively stabled nitrate removal efficiency (90.0%) was also achieved even as the COD/N of 2.50. Compared with the bare graphite felt, PPy/AQDS coating cathode showed much better electrocatalytic activities, which was more advantageous for in situ production of H2 to support hydrogen autotrophic denitrification process. The PPy-bound AQDS could also act as electron intermediaries, which is beneficial to greatly promote indirect electron process between the denitrifiers and nitrate. Moreover, the PPy/AQDS composite layer formed many particles for improving the specific surface area and bio-attachment site for bacterial attachment, which was conducive for the proliferation of microorganisms and denitrification efficiency. The ratio of biofilm and electrode of PPy/AQDS biocathode was 0.32  0.08, which was 2.46 times than bare electrode (0.13  0.06).

Yet, longitudinal immunological correlates of disease outcome remain unclear. Here, we serially analysed immune responses in 113 COVID-19 patients with moderate (non-ICU) and severe (ICU) disease. Immune profiling revealed an overall increase in innate cell lineages with a concomitant reduction in T cell number. We identify an association between early, elevated cytokines and worse disease outcomes. Following an early increase in cytokines, COVID-19 patients with moderate disease displayed a progressive reduction in type-1 (antiviral) and type-3 (antifungal) responses. In contrast, patients with severe disease maintained these elevated responses throughout the course of disease. Moreover, severe disease was accompanied by an increase in multiple type 2 (anti-helminths) effectors including, IL-5, IL-13, IgE and eosinophils. Unsupervised clustering analysis of plasma and peripheral blood leukocyte data identified 4 immune signatures, representing (A) growth factors, (B) type-2/3 cytokines, (C) mixed type-1/2/3 cytokines, and (D) chemokines that correlated with three distinct disease trajectories of patients. The immune profile of patients who recovered with moderate disease was enriched in tissue reparative growth factor signature (A), while the profile for those with worsened disease trajectory had elevated levels of all four signatures. Thus, we identified development of a maladapted immune response profile associated with severe COVID-19 outcome and early immune signatures that correlate with divergent disease trajectories.","output":"Longitudinal immunological analyses reveal inflammatory misfiring in severe COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seasonality of acute viral respiratory diseases is a well-known and yet not fully understood phenomenon. Several models have been proposed to explain the regularity of yearly recurring outbreaks and the phase-differences observed at different latitudes on Earth. Such models take into account known internal causes, primarily the periodic emergence of new virus variants that evade the host immune response. Yet, this alone, is generally unable to explain the regularity of recurrences and the observed phase-differences. Here we show that seasonality of viral respiratory diseases, as well as its distribution with latitude on Earth, can be fully explained by the virucidal properties of UV-B and A Solar photons through a daily, minute-scale, resonant forcing mechanism. Such an induced periodicity can last, virtually unperturbed, from tens to hundreds of cycles, and even in presence of internal dynamics (host's loss of immunity) much slower than seasonal will, on a long period, generate seasonal oscillations.","output":"Forcing Seasonality of influenza-like epidemics with daily Solar resonance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, one of the strategies used to search for new drugs has been to find inhibitors of the main protease (Mpro) of the virus SARS-CoV-2.

RAB14 acts as molecular switches that shift between a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state and regulates circulation of vesicles between the Golgi and endosomal compartments. In present study, we investigated the roles of RAB14 during oocyte meiotic maturation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microinjection with siRNA and exogenous mRNA for knock down and rescue, and immunofluorescence staining, Western blot and real-time RT-PCR were utilized for the study. RESULTS: Our results showed that RAB14 localized in the cytoplasm and accumulated at the cortex during mouse oocyte maturation, and it was also enriched at the spindle periphery. Depletion of RAB14 did not affect polar body extrusion but caused large polar bodies, indicating the failure of asymmetric division. We found that absence of RAB14 did not affect spindle organization but caused the spindle migration defects, and this might be due to the regulation on cytoplasmic actin assembly via the ROCK-cofilin signalling pathway. We also found that RAB14 depletion led to aberrant Golgi apparatus distribution. Exogenous Myc-Rab14 mRNA supplement could significantly rescue these defects caused by Rab14 siRNA injection.

Analyzing the reported behavior of 87,169 individuals from and 41 countries, we found that in the majority of the countries, the proportion of social gathering-goers was higher in male than female, younger than older, lower-educated than higher educated, and low-income than high-income subgroups of the populations. However, the data showed noteworthy heterogeneity between the countries warranting against generalizing from one country to another. The analysis also revealed that relative to other demographic factors, income was the strongest predictor of avoidance of social gatherings followed by age, education and gender.

However, over time, different ligands both of microbial-derived and endogenous origin have been shown to be recognized by Dectin-1. The outcomes of this recognition are diverse, including pro-inflammatory responses such as cytokine production, reactive oxygen species generation and phagocytosis. Nonetheless, tolerant responses have been also attributed to Dectin-1, depending on the specific ligand engaged. Dectin-1 recognition of their ligands triggers a plethora of downstream signaling pathways, with complex interrelationships. These signaling routes can be modulated by diverse factors such as phosphatases or tetraspanins, resulting either in pro-inflammatory or regulatory responses. Since its first depiction, Dectin-1 has recently gained a renewed attention due to its role in the induction of trained immunity. This process of long-term memory of innate immune cells can be triggered by -glucans, and Dectin-1 is crucial for its initiation. The main signaling pathways involved in this process have been described, although the understanding of the above-mentioned complexity in the -glucan-induced trained immunity is still scarce. In here, we have reviewed and updated all these factors related to the biology of Dectin-1, highlighting the gaps that deserve further research.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared stroke patients admitted to a comprehensive stroke center during the COVID-19 pandemic April 1 2020 to June 30 2020 (COVID-19) to patients admitted April 1 2019 to June 30 2019. We examined stroke admission volume and acute stroke treatment use. RESULTS: There were 637 stroke admissions, 52% in 2019 and 48% during COVID-19, with similar median admissions per day (4 vs 3, P=0.21). The proportion of admissions by stroke type was comparable (ischemic, P=0.69; hemorrhagic, P=0.39; transient ischemic stroke, P=0.10). Acute stroke treatment was similar in 2019 to COVID-19: tPA prior to arrival (18% vs, 18%, P=0.89), tPA treatment on arrival (6% vs 7%, P=0.85), and endovascular therapy (endovascular therapy (ET), 22% vs 25%, P=0.54). The door to needle time was also similar, P=0.12, however, the median time from arrival to groin puncture was significantly longer during COVID-19 (38 vs 43 min, P=0.002).

Rapid antigen test (RAT) could decrease the load of diagnosis. However, the efficacy of RAT is yet to be investigated comprehensively. Thus, the current systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of RAT against RT-PCR methods as the reference standard. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE/Pubmed and Embase databases for the relevant records. The QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess the quality of the studies. Diagnostic accuracy measures [i.e., sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), positive likelihood ratios (PLR), negative likelihood ratios (NLR), and the area under the curve (AUC)] were pooled with a random-effects model. All statistical analyses were performed with Meta-DiSc (Version 1.4, Cochrane Colloquium, Barcelona, Spain). RESULTS: After reviewing retrieved records, we identified 60 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the rapid antigen tests against the reference test (the real-time PCR) were 69% (95% CI: 68C70) and 99% (95% CI: 99C99). The PLR, NLR, DOR and the AUC estimates were found to be 72 (95% CI: 44C119), 0.30 (95% CI: 0.26C0.36), 316 (95% CI: 167C590) and 97%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present study indicated that using RAT kits is primarily recommended for the early detection of patients suspected of having COVID-19, particularly in countries with limited resources and laboratory equipment.

METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 complicated with NTI who were treated at our hospital were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into low TSH and normal TSH groups, as well as low and normal-high FT4 group, according to the reference range of TSH or FT4 levels.

Current in-center hemodialysis machines do not fulfill the requirements needed for self-care home hemodialysis (HHD) treatment. In line with the reviviscence of home therapy, several hemodialysis devices have been developed and deployed for treatment. Physidia S(3) is one of these new dialysis delivery systems featuring an appealing design and functionalities intended for daily HHD treatment. Methods: In this French multicenter proof-of-concept study enrolling 13 training centers, we report our preliminary experience with a special focus on quantifying clinical performances in short daily HHD treatment performed during the training period of the patients. Results: Among the 80 patients included in this study, a total of 249 sessions could be analyzed. Dialysis dose, estimated from weekly standardized Kt/V, was maintained at 2.22 [1.95C2.61] with a normalized protein catabolic rate of 0.93 [0.73C1.18] g/kg/24 h. Furthermore, anemia and nutritional status were adequately controlled as indicated by 11.6  1.4 g/dL of hemoglobin level and 39.4  5.7 g/L of serum albumin as well as electrolyte disorders. Conclusions: The safety and efficacy of the S(3) therapy concept relying on a short daily hemodialysis treatment using a bagged delivery system are in total agreement with daily HHD recommendations. Clinical performances are aligned to the metabolic needs of the vast majority of HHD patients.

A modelling and simulation framework is provided using SARS-CoV-2 as an example, considering applications for both treatment and prophylaxis. METHODS: A target cell-limited model was used to quantify the viral infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a pooled population of 105 infected patients. Parameter estimates from the resulting model were used to simulate and compare the impact of various interventions against meaningful viral load endpoints. RESULTS: Robust parameter estimates were obtained for the basic reproduction number, viral release rate and infected-cell mortality from the infection model. These estimates were informed by the largest dataset currently available for SARS-CoV-2 viral time course. The utility of this model was demonstrated using simulations, which hypothetically introduced inhibitory or stimulatory drug mechanisms at various target sites within the viral life-cycle. We show that early intervention is crucial to achieving therapeutic benefit when monotherapy is administered. In contrast, combination regimens of two or three drugs may provide improved outcomes if treatment is initiated late. The latter is relevant to SARS-CoV-2, where the period between infection and symptom onset is relatively long.

It was hypothesized that Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs would predict each outcome. Additionally, given the politicization of the pandemic in the US, HBM constructs were considered as possible mediators of a relationship between political party affiliation and each outcome. A total of 205 participants completed an online survey, and data from 186 were analyzed using linear and ordinal regressions. Findings indicate that greater perceived response efficacy predicted greater engagement in preventive behaviors and intention to get vaccinated. Other HBM constructs were not significant predictors of either outcome. Mediation analyses indicated that affiliation with the Republican Party predicted reduced engagement in preventive health behaviors and vaccination intention, although effects were fully and partially mediated by lower levels of response efficacy. Understanding the predictors of adherence to recommended strategies is essential to developing effective public health campaigns that address risk factors for non-adherence and target those least likely to adhere. Public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the US should emphasize the efficacy of preventive behaviors and encourage public trust in the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines, particularly among Republicans.","output":"Predicting engagement in behaviors to reduce the spread of COVID-19: the roles of the health belief model and political party affiliation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is a very common condition and mostly of viral origin.

Here, we aim to clarify clinical-pathological and/or molecular features of this tumour subgroup through a systematic review coupled with a comparative analysis with existing databases, also providing indications for a correct approach to the clinical identification of MSI/dMMR pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). DESIGN: PubMed, SCOPUS and Embase were searched for studies reporting data on MSI/dMMR in PDAC up to 30 November 2019. Histological and molecular data of MSI/dMMR PDAC were compared with non-MSI/dMMR PDAC and with PDAC reference cohorts (including SEER database and The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network - TCGA project). RESULTS: Overall, 34 studies with 8323 patients with PDAC were included in the systematic review. MSI/dMMR demonstrated a very low prevalence in PDAC (around 1%C2%). Compared with conventional PDAC, MSI/dMMR PDAC resulted strongly associated with medullary and mucinous/colloid histology (p<0.01) and with a KRAS/TP53 wild-type molecular background (p<0.01), with more common JAK genes mutations. Data on survival are still unclear. CONCLUSION: PDAC showing typical medullary or mucinous/colloid histology should be routinely examined for MSI/dMMR status using specific tests (immunohistochemistry, followed by MSI-PCR in cases with doubtful results).

The GDS-5 was used to measure the level of depressive symptoms. Among the participants, 25 participants (13%) scored higher than 2, indicating the presence of depression. Using a hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the equation explained 42.4 % of the variance (adjusted R square =.382) in levels of depression (F (3,176) = 9.973, p <.000). Variance inflation factor (VIF) values were smaller than 10, indicating that multicollinearity among the correlates was not an issue. The correlates of the level of depression were: level of education, overall physical health, level of loneliness, perceived ease of technology use, attitude toward technology use, and intent to purchase new technology for older people. Results indicate that a positive attitude toward technology use might be inversely associated with depression levels. This shows how quality of life related to mental health may be improved by a change in attitude in favor of technology use. Participants were interested in learning to use new technology, and would like more opportunities to do so.

Cellular senescence is the primary ageing process at cell level, associated with loss of proliferative capacity, mitochondrial dysfunction and significantly altered patterns of expression and secretion of bioactive molecules. Intervention experiments have proven cell senescence as a relevant cause of ageing in many organs. In case of skin, accumulation of senescence in all major compartments with ageing is well documented and might be responsible for most, if not all, the molecular changes observed during ageing. Incorporation of senescent cells into in-vitro skin models (specifically 3D full thickness models) recapitulates changes typically associated with skin ageing. However, crucial evidence is still missing.

METHODS: RAMIC is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, allocation-concealed, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy of treatment with ramipril 2.5 mg orally daily compared to placebo for 14 days. The study population includes adult patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to a hospital or assessed in an emergency department or ambulatory clinic. Key exclusion criteria include ICU admission or need for mechanical ventilation at screening, use of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor-II blocker within 7 days, glomerular filtration rate < 40 mL/min or a systolic blood pressure (BP) < 100 mmHg or diastolic BP < 65 mmHg.

Pre-pandemic studies suggest a high prevalence of common mental disorders, including anxiety and depression in South Asian countries, which may aggravate during this pandemic. This systematic meta-analytic review was conducted to estimate the pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression in South Asian countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: We systematically searched for cross-sectional studies on eight major bibliographic databases and additional sources up to October 12, 2020, that reported the prevalence of anxiety or depression in any of the eight South Asian countries. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled proportion of anxiety and depression. Results: A total of 35 studies representing 41,402 participants were included in this review. The pooled prevalence of anxiety in 31 studies with a pooled sample of 28,877 was 41.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 34.7-48.1, I2 = 99.18%). Moreover, the pooled prevalence of depression was 34.1% (95% CI: 28.9-39.4, I2 = 99%) among 37,437 participants in 28 studies. Among the South Asian countries, India had a higher number of studies, whereas Bangladesh and Pakistan had a higher pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression.

Patients receiving maintenance dialysis are at high risk for COVID-19, and higher case rates have been reported relative to the general population. To better understand infection patterns, we performed a seroprevalence study among maintenance dialysis patients at a large dialysis organization in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We measured IgG antibodies in an IRB-approved study of remnant serum samples collected for routine laboratory screenings in a national sample of 12,932 maintenance dialysis patients (27 May-01 Jul 2020). EXPOSURE: State, sex, age, and race. OUTCOMES: Seropositivity; ratio of seropositivity to known COVID-19 case rate. ANALYTIC APPROACH: Seropositivity was calculated overall and by state, sex, age, and race. Ratio of seropositivity to known COVID-19 cases was calculated overall and by state. RESULTS: Overall, 747 (5.8%) of samples were seropositive. Seroprevalence varied by state and was lowest in Kentucky (1.0%) but highest in New York (23.6%). Seroprevalence was similar among men and women. Among samples from patients < 70 years, 6.0%-6.5% were seropositive; whereas 5.2% and 3.9% of samples from patients 70-79 and  80 years, respectively, were seropositive. Samples from Black and Hispanic patients were 7.3% and 7.7% positive, respectively, compared to 2.8% of samples from White patients. After adjustment, risk differences among racial groups were lower, but not eliminated. During the study period, the known COVID-19 case rate was 3.3%. The ratio of seropositivity to known COVID-19 cases was 1.7. LIMITATIONS: Imperfect assay sensitivity; results represent infections occurring before July 2020; deidentification prevented comparison of antibodies to previous COVID-19 status for individual patients; may not generalize to patients dialyzing with other providers or in other countries. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence was 5.8% among dialysis patients as of 01 July 2020. This indicates the actual number of infections was 1.7-times greater than reported cases.

However, the precise clinical and biochemical variables associated with AKI progression in patients with severe COVID-19 remain unclear. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on 278 hospitalized patients who were admitted to the ward and intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020, at the University Hospital, S?o Paulo, Brazil. Patients aged &#8805; 18 years with COVID-19 confirmed on RT-PCR were included. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. We evaluated the incidence of AKI, several clinical variables, medicines used, and outcomes in two sub-groups: COVID-19 patients with AKI (Cov-AKI), and COVID-19 patients without AKI (non-AKI). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: First, an elevated incidence of AKI (71.2%) was identified, distributed across different stages of the KDIGO criteria. We further observed higher levels of creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the Cov-AKI group than in the non-AKI group, at hospital admission. On univariate analysis, Cov-AKI was associated with older age (>62 years), hypertension, CRP, MCV, leucocytes, neutrophils, NLR, combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin treatment, use of mechanical ventilation, and vasoactive drugs. Multivariate analysis showed that hypertension and the use of vasoactive drugs were independently associated with a risk of higher AKI in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we preferentially found an altered erythrocyte and leukocyte cellular profile in the Cov-AKI group compared to the non-AKI group, at hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the development of AKI in patients with severe COVID-19 was related to inflammatory blood markers and therapy with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, with vasopressor requirement and hypertension considered potential risk factors.

AIM The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acute post-surgical pain on the levels of endocannabinoids in the cerebral cortex. METHODS Quantitation of endocannabinoids in the rat cerebral cortex was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the cerebral cortical levels of anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) between the sham and surgery experimental groups. However, there were lateralized differences in the levels of these endocannabinoids between the right and left cerebral cortices irrespective of the two groups. The concentrations of AEA and 2-AG were significantly higher in the right cerebral cortex compared to the contralateral cerebral cortex. CONCLUSION Acute post-surgical pain did not induce significant alterations in the cerebral cortical levels of endocannabinoids in this study, but the phenomenon of lateralization of the cerebral cortical AEA and 2-AG levels was observed; this latter finding may be related to the role played by endocannabinoids in fear conditioning.","output":"Characterization of cerebral cortical endocannabinoid levels in a rat inguinal surgery model using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We evaluated our experience with segmental radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the small saphenous vein (SSV), a less common procedure than great saphenous vein ablation, and developed a classification system and algorithm for endovenous heat-induced thrombus (EHIT), based on modifications of our prior algorithm of EHIT following great saphenous ablation. METHODS Endovenous ablation was performed on symptomatic patients with incompetent SSVs following a minimum of 3 months of compression therapy. Demographic data, risk factors, CEAP classification, procedure details, and follow-up data were recorded. A four-tier classification system and treatment algorithm was developed, based on EHIT proximity to the popliteal vein. RESULTS Eighty limbs (in 76 patients) were treated with RFA of the SSV between January 2008 and August 2012. Duplex ultrasound was performed between 24 and 72 hours postprocedure in all patients. Ablation was successful in 98.7% (79/80) of procedures. Sixty-eight (85%) patients had level A closures ( 1 mm caudal to popliteal vein) and 10 patients (13%) had level B closures (flush with popliteal vein) and were observed. Two limbs (3%) had EHIT extending into the popliteal vein (level C) and were treated with outpatient low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulation. Thrombus retracted to the level of the saphenopopliteal junction in both patients following a short course of anticoagulation. No patient developed an occlusive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (level D). Mean follow-up period was 6.2 months; no patient had small saphenous recanalization, occlusive DVT, or pulmonary embolus. The presence or absence of the Giacomini vein was not predictive of level B and C closure. CONCLUSIONS RFA of the SSV in symptomatic patients has a high success rate with a low risk of DVT. A classification system and treatment protocol based on the level of EHIT in relation to the saphenopopliteal junction is useful in managing patients. The approach to patients with thrombus flush with the popliteal vein or bulging has not been previously defined; our outcomes were excellent, using our treatment algorithm.","output":"Management of endovenous heat-induced thrombus using a classification system and treatment algorithm following segmental thermal ablation of the small saphenous vein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE: A 17-year-old adolescent boy presented with continued knee pain, swelling, and mechanical symptoms after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with partial meniscectomy.

METHODS Patients with HCC between 3 and 5 cm treated with TACE monotherapy or combination TACE + MWA at a single institution between 2007 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-four HCCs (median diameter 3.8 cm) in 16 patients (13 males; median age 64 years) were treated using TACE monotherapy. Combination TACE + MWA was used to treat 23 HCCs (median diameter 4.2 cm) in 22 patients (18 males; median age 61 years). Microwave ablation was performed at a target time of two weeks following TACE. Individual tumors were followed by serial contrast-enhanced CT or MR. Response to treatment was evaluated on a tumor-by-tumor basis using mRECIST criteria with the primary outcome being local tumor progression (LTP). Data were analyzed using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables. Time to LTP was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS Relative to TACE monotherapy, TACE + MWA provided a trend toward both a lower rate of LTP (34.8% vs. 62.5%, p = 0.11) and a higher complete response rate (65.2% vs. 37.5%; p = 0.12). Time to LTP (22.3 months vs. 4.2 months; p = 0.001) was significantly longer in the TACE + MWA group compared to TACE monotherapy.

Time from castration to presentation, diagnostic procedures, surgical complications, bacterial culture and ancillary testing, and survival to discharge were collected. Long-term follow-up was obtained by owner survey when possible. Descriptive statistics were used to report results. RESULTS Horses ranged in age from 2 to 14 years (mean age 4.1) and presented 33 days (median; range, 12-3561) after castration. Five of 23 horses required revision surgery because of hemorrhage (2) or persistent infection (3). All horses survived to discharge.

A major challenge confronting people with mental illnesses and their families is the stigma that they endure. In this study, empirical literature was reviewed to assess policies and interventions that seek to reduce familial mental illness stigma across four countries. We used Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework, and a qualitative content analysis was employed to augment the descriptive data extracted. Seven studies published between 2000 and 2020 were analyzed. We propose herein three themes that align with interventions to reduce familial mental illness stigma: transformative education, sharing and disclosure, and social networking and support. The findings indicate that persuasive and purposeful education directed at the public to correct misconceptions surrounding mental illness, with attention to language, may help in reducing familial mental illness stigma. Disclosure of mental illness is encouraged among persons with mental illnesses and their families as a strategy to enhance mutual understanding. Social sharing also affords persons with mental illnesses opportunities to engage with their peers at different levels within the public sphere. Apart from these recommendations, we have noted a paucity of broad governmental-level policies and interventions to comprehensively address the negative attitudes of families toward their relatives. Future work must address this gap to identify effective interventions to create healthier and supportive environments that address familial mental illness stigma.","output":"Policies and Interventions to Reduce Familial Mental Illness Stigma: A Scoping Review of Empirical Literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: the incidence of novel coronavirus disease (COVID19) is elevated in areas with heightened socioeconomic vulnerability. Early reports from US hospitals also implicated social disadvantage and chronic disease history as COVID19 mortality risk factors. However, the relationship between race and COVID19 mortality remains unclear. METHODS: we examined in-hospital COVID19 mortality risk factors in a multi-hospital tertiary health care system that serves greater Detroit, Michigan, a predominantly African American city with high rates of poverty and chronic disease. Consecutive adult patients who presented to emergency departments and tested positive for COVID19 from 3/11/2020 through 4/18/2020 were included. Using log-binomial regression, we assessed the relationship between in-hospital mortality and residence in census tracts that were flagged for extreme socioeconomic vulnerability, patient-level demographics, and clinical comorbidities. FINDINGS: a total of 1,015 adults tested positive for COVID19 during the study period; 80% identified as Black people, 52% were male and 53% were  65 years of age. The median body mass index was 30?4 and the median Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 4. Patients from census tracts that were flagged for vulnerability related to socioeconomic status had a higher mortality rate than their peers who resided in less vulnerable census tracts ( 0.26, standard error (SE) 0.11, degrees of freedom (df) 378, t-value (t) 2.27, exp() 1.29, p-value 0.02). Adjustment for age category, Black race, sex and/or the Charlson Comorbidity Index score category reduced the magnitude of association by less than 10% [exp() 1.29 vs. 1.21]. Black race [p = 0.38] and sex [p = 0.62] were not associated with mortality in this sample. INTERPRETATION: people who lived in areas flagged for extreme socioeconomic vulnerability had elevated mortality risk in our predominantly African-American cohort of COVID19 patients who were able to seek hospital care during the so-called first wave of the pandemic.

However, numerous uncertainties exist regarding the pros and cons of vaccination, especially in patients with (immune-mediated) kidney diseases on immunosuppressive drugs. Here, members of the Immunonephrology Working Group (IWG) of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) discuss thirteen frequently-asked questions regarding safety and efficacy of the most promising vaccine candidates. Post-marketing surveillance should be performed to estimate the rate of vaccine response (humoral and cellular) of different vaccine platforms, and surveillance of disease activity following administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Some of the candidates induce signaling pathways which also promote autoimmune kidney diseases, e.g. type I interferons in systemic lupus erythematosus. Efficacy estimates would thus far favor the use of selected COVID-19 vaccines, such as BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 or Gam-COVID-Vac. Humoral immune response after vaccination should be monitored using appropriate assays. Even in the absence of neutralizing antibodies patients might be protected by a sufficient cellular immune response capable to reduce severity of COVID-19. A reduced vaccine response after the use of CD20-depleting agents is anticipated, and it is particularly important to discuss strategies to improve vaccine response with these patients.

Here, we present the first genome of the P. larvata, comprising 22 chromosomes assembled using single-tube long fragment read (stLFR) and Hi-C technologies. The genome length is 2.41 Gb with a scaffold N50 of 105.6 Mb. We identified the 107.13 Mb X chromosome and one 1.34 Mb Y-linked scaffold and validated them by resequencing 45 P. larvata individuals. We predicted 18,340 protein-coding genes, among which 18,333 genes were functionally annotated. Interestingly, several biological pathways related to immune defenses were found to be significantly expanded. Also, more than 40% of the enriched pathways on the positively selected genes (PSGs) were identified to be closely related to immunity and survival. These enriched gene families were inferred to be essential for the P. larvata for defense against the pathogens. However, we did not find a direct genomic basis for its adaptation to omnivorous diet despite multiple attempts of comparative genomic analysis. In addition, we evaluated the susceptibility of the P. larvata to the SARS-CoV-2 by screening the RNA expression of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2/TMPRSS4 genes in 16 organs. Finally, we explored the genome-wide heterozygosity and compared it with other animals to evaluate the population status of this species.

We aimed to evaluate rates of child abuse, neglect, and inadequate supervision during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients 5 years old admitted to a level one pediatric trauma center between 3/19/20-9/19/20 (COVID-era) were compared to a pre-COVID cohort (3/19/19-9/19/19). The primary outcome was the rate of child abuse, neglect, or inadequate supervision, determined by Child Protection Team and Social Work consultations. Secondary outcomes included injury severity score (ISS), mortality, and discharge disposition. RESULTS: Of 163 total COVID-era pediatric trauma patients, 22 (13.5%) sustained child abuse/neglect, compared to 17 of 206 (8.3%) pre-COVID era patients (p=0.13). The ISS was similar between cohorts (median 9 pre-COVID vs. 5 COVID-era, p=0.23). There was one mortality in the pre-COVID era and none during COVID (p=0.45). The rate of discharge with someone other than the primary caregiver at time of injury was significantly higher pre-COVID (94.1% vs. 59.1%, p = 0.02).

Informed by a model of identity leadership (Haslam, Reicher & Platow, 2020), this review argues that leaders ability to do these things is grounded in their ability to represent and advance the shared interests of group members and to create and embed a sense of shared social identity among them (a sense of us\\\\ness). For leaders, then, this sense of us\\\\ness is the key resource that they need to marshal in order to harness the support and energy of citizens. The review discusses examples of the successes and failures of different leaders during the pandemic and organizes these around five policy priorities related to the 5Rs of identity leadership: readying, reflecting, representing, realizing, and reinforcing.

For these reasons it represents the prime target for Covid-19 vaccines. In recent months, variants of this protein have started to emerge. Their ability to reduce or evade recognition by S-targeting antibodies poses a threat to immunological treatments and raises concerns for their consequences on vaccine efficacy. To develop a model able to predict the potential impact of S-protein mutations on antibody binding sites, we performed unbiased multi-microsecond molecular dynamics of several glycosylated S-protein variants and applied a straightforward structure-dynamics-energy based strategy to predict potential changes in immunogenic regions on each variant. We recover known epitopes on the reference D614G sequence. By comparing our results, obtained on isolated S-proteins in solution, to recently published data on antibody binding and reactivity in new S variants, we directly show that modifications in the S-protein consistently translate into the loss of potentially immunoreactive regions. Our findings can thus be qualitatively reconnected to the experimentally characterized decreased ability of some of the Abs elicited against the dominant S-sequence to recognize variants. While based on the study of SARS-CoV-2 Spike variants, our computational epitope-prediction strategy is portable and could be applied to study immunoreactivity in mutants of proteins of interest whose structures have been characterized, helping the development/selection of vaccines and antibodies able to control emerging variants.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Mutations and Escape from Antibodies: a Computational Model of Epitope Loss in Variants of Concern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background During the COVID19 pandemic, physician focus shifted from continuity of care to pandemic duties. However, patients still required in-person visits for acute or chronic complaints. Specially trained pharmacists were utilized to alleviate Family Medicine Walk-in (FMWI) provider shortages. Objective To describe the innovative practice utilizing diagnostic pharmacists in FMWI, evaluate their impact on provider time, compare workload to traditional advanced practice providers (APP), and evaluate type of visits and medications prescribed. Practice Description Pharmacists at an Indian Health Service medical center staffed FMWI 2.5 days per week to alleviate provider shortages during the COVID19 pandemic. The privileged pharmacist had a diagnostic scope like APPs. Non-privileged pharmacists provided care to patients utilizing current protocols and were required to present all new complaints to providers. Practice Innovation The facility utilized pharmacists that have completed, or progressing through, the local diagnostic training program to alleviate provider shortages. Evaluation Methods The absolute number of visits by pharmacists was determined and the number of provider hours shifted to pharmacy estimated. The number of visits by provider type was calculated and compared. ICD-10 codes were evaluated for purpose of visits. New prescriptions written by pharmacists were categorized and reimbursement rates determined. Results Pharmacists were responsible for 677 visits during 88 clinic days with an estimated 338 provider hours shifted to pharmacists. Pharmacists saw 5.8 patients per day, APPs 5.2, and physicians 5.7. Pharmacists primarily evaluated hypertension, diabetes, musculoskeletal, and infectious disease complaints. New prescription categories included pain management, endocrine, cardiovascular, and infectious disease. The single billable pharmacist was reimbursed $77,945. Conclusion Diagnostic pharmacists in FMWI have allowed providers to shift to other pandemic duties and demonstrate similar workload as APPs.

However, the effects of LH suppression on INSL3 secretion are unknown in domestic animals. Here, we examined the effects of a long-acting GnRH antagonist (degarelix acetate; 4 mg/kg) on the secretions of plasma INSL3 and testosterone in two phases, an immediate and a long-term phase in male goats (n = 6; aged, 13-16 months). During the immediate phase, blood was taken at 15-minute intervals for 8 hours on Days -5, 0, and 3. The GnRH antagonist was administered after 2-hour sampling of Day 0. Moreover, a daily blood sample was taken from Day 0 to Day 7, followed by twice a week until 9 weeks and finally at week 10. The scrotal circumference was recorded before treatment and continued biweekly until week 10. Concentrations of LH, INSL3, and testosterone in plasma were determined by EIA and the pulsatile nature of secretion analyzed using pulse XP software. The mean concentrations, pulse frequency (per hour), and pulse amplitude (peak-nadir) of plasma LH and testosterone reduced from pretreatment to posttreatment Day 0 and Day 3 (P < 0.05). A decline in mean concentrations, pulse frequency, and pulse amplitude of INSL3 was exhibited on posttreatment Day 3 compared with pretreatment (P < 0.01). During long-term sampling, a decline (P < 0.01) in plasma testosterone and INSL3 concentrations was observed 1 day after treatment and remained lower until 8.5 weeks after treatment, and thereafter returned to pretreatment levels. A reduction in scrotal circumference was recorded 4 weeks after treatment and remained lower until 10 weeks after treatment (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the acute regulation of INSL3 by LH was confirmed by reduction of plasma INSL3 levels within 3 days after GnRH antagonist treatment in male goats. Although the onset of suppression of testosterone was more rapid than that of INSL3, the low levels persisted for 8.5 weeks for both hormones, and subsequently the concentrations returned to pretreatment levels. A significant reduction in testicular size was also observed. The quick, long-lasting, and transient suppression of testosterone and INSL3 after a single injection implies a potential application of this antagonist in reversible long-term chemical castration in male goats.","output":"Effects of long-acting GnRH antagonist, degarelix acetate, on plasma insulin-like peptide 3, testosterone and luteinizing hormone concentrations, and scrotal circumference in male goats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The business environment and entrepreneurship are important elements in the economic growth of each country. The better the business environment a given country offers, the more attractive the country is for small and large companies as well as for private entrepreneurs.

Many institutions focus on the measurement of the business environment using indices to evaluate its quality. The main goal of the present study is to evaluate the quality of the business environment through multicriteria analysis. For the period from 2018 to 2020, the data were analysed by using seven selected indices of the weighted sum approach (WSA) and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods. The research sample included all EU countries that joined the EU at the same time in 2004. The processing of analytical data was gradually implemented by using descriptive statistics and multicriteria evaluation methods. The methods used in the multicriteria evaluation of variants determined the rankings of the individual variants in terms of the selected criteria using entropy. We concluded that the efficiency of the business environments in Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia are below the EU average.

METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted in acute appendicitis-treated patients from 13.03.19 to 13.05.19 and from 13.03.20 to 13.05.20, respectively. RESULTS: This study included 150 patients (110 patients in 2019; 40 patients in 2020 (during COVID-19 pandemic)). The patients were named as Group A (Normal period) and Group B (Pandemic period), respectively. The groups were comparable as there was no significant difference between the mean age, mean BMI, and mean length of stay. There is a significant difference between the comorbidities of Group A and Group B (p=0.033). There was no significant difference between the laboratory and radiological findings of Group A and Group B. There was a significant difference between the perforation number of Group A and Group B (p=0.029). There was no significant difference between the needs of ICU and conversion from laparoscopic to conventional appendectomy of Group A and Group B.

This study aims to investigate the impact of three pre-COVID-19 interventions and of the COVID-19 UK-epidemic and the first UK national lockdown on overcrowding within University College London Hospital Emergency Department (UCLH ED). The three interventions: target the influx of patients at ED (A), reduce the pressure on in-patients beds (B) and improve ED processes to improve the flow of patents out from ED (C). METHODS: We collected overcrowding metrics (daily attendances, the proportion of people leaving within 4 h of arrival (four-hours target) and the reduction in overall waiting time) during 01/04/2017C31/05/2020. We then performed three different analyses, considering three different timeframes. The first analysis used data 01/04/2017C31/12C2019 to calculate changes over a period of 6 months before and after the start of interventions A-C. The second and third analyses focused on evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, comparing the first 10 months in 2020 and 2019, and of the first national lockdown (23/03/2020C31/05/2020). RESULTS: Pre-COVID-19 all interventions led to small reductions in waiting time (17%, p < 0.001 for A and C; an 9%, p = 0.322 for B) but also to a small decrease in the number of patients leaving within 4 h of arrival (6.6,7.4,6.2% respectively A-C,p < 0.001). In presence of the COVID-19 pandemic, attendance and waiting time were reduced (40% and 8%; p < 0.001), and the number of people leaving within 4 h of arrival was increased (6%,p < 0.001). During the first lockdown, there was 65% reduction in attendance, 22% reduction in waiting time and 8% increase in number of people leaving within 4 h of arrival (p < 0.001). Crucially, when the lockdown was lifted, there was an increase (6.5%,p < 0.001) in the percentage of people leaving within 4 h, together with a larger (12.5%,p < 0.001) decrease in waiting time. This occurred despite the increase of 49.6%(p < 0.001) in attendance after lockdown ended. CONCLUSIONS: The mixed results pre-COVID-19 (significant improvements in waiting time with some interventions but not improvement in the four-hours target), may be due to indirect impacts of these interventions, where increasing pressure on one part of the ED system affected other parts. This underlines the need for multifaceted interventions and a system-wide approach to improve the pathway of flow through the ED system is necessary. During 2020 and in presence of the COVID-19 epidemic, a shift in public behaviour with anxiety over attending hospitals and higher use of virtual consultations, led to notable drop in UCLH ED attendance and consequential curbing of overcrowding. Importantly, once the lockdown was lifted, although there was an increase in arrivals at UCLH ED, overcrowding metrics were reduced. Thus, the combination of shifted public behaviour and the restructuring changes during COVID-19 epidemic, maybe be able to curb future ED overcrowding, but longer timeframe analysis is required to confirm this.","output":"Exploring overcrowding trends in an inner city emergence department in the UK before and during COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The diagnosis of pregnancy in the domestic dog (Canis familiaris) often employs specialized equipment, experienced staff, and the cooperation of the bitch. These procedures can be challenging when the subject is a wild canid, particularly in a field setting. In addition, reproductive hormone assays are unreliable as a diagnostic tool because the estrous profiles of pregnant and pseudopregnant canines are similar. However, research has demonstrated that the hormone relaxin can be detected in maternal blood after embryonic implantation, but remains negligible in non-pregnant females. We investigated the use of relaxin as a diagnostic marker of pregnancy in the coyote (C. latrans). A commercially available canine relaxin enzyme immunoassay (ReproCHEK?) was used to test plasma collected from 124 female coyotes over four consecutive breeding seasons. Mating activities of the captive females were observed; then peripheral blood samples were collected at intervals throughout pregnancy, as well as after parturition. Results demonstrated that relaxin could be detected in the plasma of pregnant coyotes after 28 days of gestation, and in some cases as early as 23 days, while non-pregnant females and male coyotes consistently tested negative. Relaxin also remained detectable in the plasma of the majority of females tested 10C12 weeks after parturition. This qualitative assay for relaxin proved to be a reliable diagnostic tool for pregnancy in the coyote.

While most patients with COVID-19 present with mild illness, some patients develop pneumonia, an important risk factor for mortality, at early stage of viral infection, putting these patients at increased risk of death. So far, little has been known about differences in the T cell repertoires between COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we aimed to investigate T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire profiles and patient-specific SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR clusters between COVID-19 patients with mild disease (no sign of pneumonia) and pneumonia. The TCR sequencing was conducted to characterize the peripheral TCR repertoire profile and diversity. The TCR clustering and CDR3 annotation were exploited to further discover groups of patient-specific TCR clonotypes with potential SARS-CoV-2 antigen specificities. Our study indicated a slight decrease in the TCR repertoire diversity and a skewed CDR3 length usage in patients with pneumonia compared to those with mild disease. The SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR clusters enriched in patients with mild disease exhibited significantly higher TCR generation probabilities and most of which were highly shared among patients, compared with those from pneumonia patients. Importantly, using similarity network-based clustering followed by the sequence conservation analysis, we found different patterns of CDR3 sequence motifs between mild disease- and pneumonia-specific SARS-CoV-2-associated public TCR clusters. Our results showed that characteristics of overall TCR repertoire and SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR clusters/clonotypes were divergent between COVID-19 patients with mild disease and patients with pneumonia.

In vitro studies show that immunotherapy could be an effective strategy. However, these studies include strategies to enrich HBV-specific CD8 T cells, which could alter the expression of the anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 antibody targets. Our aim was to determine the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade ex vivo. METHODS: HBV-specific CD8 T cells were characterized ex vivo by flow cytometry for the simultaneous analysis of six immune populations and 14 activating and inhibitory receptors. Ex vivo functionality was quantified by ELISpot and by combining peptide pool stimulation, dextramers and intracellular flow cytometry staining. RESULTS: The functionality of HBV-specific CD8 T cells is associated with a higher frequency of cells with low exhaustion phenotype (LAG3(-)TIM3(-)PD-1(+)), independently of the clinical parameters. The accumulation of HBV-specific CD8 T cells with a functionally exhausted phenotype (LAG3(+)TIM3(+)PD-1(+)) is associated with lack of ex vivo functionality. PD-L1 blockade enhanced the HBV-specific CD8 T cell response only in patients with lower exhaustion levels, while response to PD-L1 blockade was abrogated in patients with higher frequencies of exhausted HBV-specific CD8 T cells. CONCLUSION: Higher levels of functionally exhausted HBV-specific CD8 T cells are associated with a lack of response that cannot be restored by blocking the PD-1:PD-L1 axis. This suggests that the clinical effectiveness of blocking the PD-1:PD-L1 axis as a monotherapy may be restricted.

In this work, we present an effective model for assessing the direct contagion risk associated with these pathogen-laden droplets. In particular, using the most recent studies on multi-phase flow physics, we develop an effective yet simple framework capable of predicting the infection risk associated with different respiratory activities in different ambient conditions. We start by describing the mathematical framework and benchmarking the model predictions against well-assessed literature results. Then, we provide a systematic assessment of the effects of physical distancing and face coverings on the direct infection risk. The present results indicate that the risk of infection is vastly impacted by the ambient conditions and the type of respiratory activity, suggesting the non-existence of a universal safe distance. Meanwhile, wearing face masks provides excellent protection, effectively limiting the transmission of pathogens even at short physical distances, i.e. 1 m.","output":"Modelling the direct virus exposure risk associated with respiratory events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Neonatal diarrhoea represents a major disease problem in the early stages of animal production, increasing significantly pre-weaning mortality and piglets weaned below the target weight. Enteric diseases in newborn piglets are often of endemic presentation, but may also occur as outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of different pathogens involved in cases of recurrent neonatal diarrhoea in Spain. RESULTS: A total of 327 litters from 109 sow farms located in Spain with neonatal recurrent diarrhoea were sampled to establish a differential diagnosis against the main enteric pathogens in piglets. In total, 105 out of 109 (96.3%) case submissions were positive to one of the examined enteric organisms considered potentially pathogenic (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens types A and C, Transmissible gastroenteritis virus [TGEV], Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus [PEDV] or Rotavirus A [RVA]). Fifty-eight out of 109 (53.2%) submissions were positive for only one of these pathogens, 47 out of 109 (43.1%) were positive for more than one pathogen and, finally, 4 out of 109 (3.7%) were negative for all these agents. Escherichia coli strains were isolated from all submissions tested, but only 11 of them were classified into defined pathotypes. Clostridium perfringens type A was detected in 98 submissions (89.9%) and no C. perfringens type C was found. Regarding viruses, 47 (43.1%) submissions were positive for RVA, 4 (3.7%) for PEDV and none of them for TGEV.

The genome was predicted to encode small T antigen, large T antigen, and three capsid proteins: VP1, VP2, and VP3. Phylogenetic analysis clearly revealed that the WU virus was divergent from all known polyomaviruses. Screening of 2,135 patients with acute respiratory tract infections in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, and St. Louis, Missouri, United States, using WU virusCspecific PCR primers resulted in the detection of 43 additional specimens that contained WU virus.

Over one years time period, the scientific community has produced a large bulk of knowledge about this disease and countless reports about its immune-pathological aspects. This knowledge, including data obtained in postmortem studies, points unequivocally to a hypercoagulability state. However, the name COVID-19 tells us very little about the true meaning of the disease.

Thus, we found irrefutable evidence in the current literature that COVID-19 is the first viral disease that can be branded as a viral thrombotic fever. This manuscript points out that SARS-CoV-2 goes far beyond pneumonia or SARS. COVID-19 infections promote remarkable interactions among the endothelium, coagulation, and immune response, building up a background capable of promoting a thrombotic storm, much more than a cytokine storm. The importance of a viral protease called main protease (Mpro) is highlighted as a critical component for its replication in the host cell. A deeper analysis of this protease and its importance on the coagulation system is also discussed for the first time, mainly because of its similarity with the thrombin and factor Xa molecules, as recently pointed out by structural comparison crystallographic structures.","output":"Should COVID-19 be branded to viral thrombotic fever?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dengue virus (DV) is a member of the family Flaviviridae.

Despite its possible role as an antagonist of the interferon-induced antiviral response, this protein may play an additional more direct role for viral replication. In this study we determined the subcellular localization, membrane association, and membrane topology of DV NS4B. We found that NS4B resides primarily in cytoplasmic foci originating from the endoplasmic reticulum. NS4B colocalizes with NS3 and double-stranded RNA, an intermediate of viral replication, arguing that NS4B is part of the membrane-bound viral replication complex. Biochemical analysis revealed that NS4B is an integral membrane protein, and that its preceding 2K signal sequence is not required for this integration. We identified three membrane-spanning segments in the COOH-terminal part of NS4B that are sufficient to target a cytosolic marker protein to intracellular membranes. Furthermore, we established a membrane topology model of NS4B in which the NH2-terminal part of the protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, whereas the COOH-terminal part is composed of three trans-membrane domains with the COOH-terminal tail localized in the cytoplasm.

In addition, despite the Covid 19 pandemic environment, various online tools are being used to efficiently cooperate globally. The contents of this project are to design, model, and package an innovative future mobility design and engineering concept. In November of 2020, the program was launched with a general announcement of this years assignments. In December, team composition started, and the entire student team formation was completed and the collaboration started in March. It was easier for students to focus on conducting the project during the team collaboration phase 1, when all universities around the world were offering classes. The teams had to select a megacity. Then they would develop ideas and define concepts for the future mobility, appropriate for their selected metropolitan area. The midterm presentation took place on May 14th, and the purpose of this presentation was to determine how well cooperation among participating students have been progressing. Students will carry out user-needs research, industrial design and the engineering specifications and develop a soft precision mock-up and a CAD model of their final solution. They will present a series of development processes and their virtual mock up on the final presentation, scheduled to be on July 26C27.

RESULTS: The best performing criteria of model exclusion and selection were different across the different datasets. Model averaging over the three models with the lowest three AIC (Akaike information criteria) values (MA-3) did not produce the worst performance, and MA-3 without model exclusion produced the best results among the model averaging.

In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about bacterial and viral co-infections of the respiratory tract and focus on potential experimental models suitable for mimicking this disease. Transmission of IAV and pneumonia is mainly modeled by mouse infection. Few studies utilizing ferrets, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and non-human primates are also available. The knowledge gained from these studies led to important discoveries and advances in understanding these infectious diseases. Nevertheless, mouse and other infection models have limitations, especially in translation of the discoveries to humans. Here, we suggest the use of human engineered lung tissue, human ex vivo lung tissue, and porcine models to study respiratory co-infections, which might contribute to a greater translation of the results to humans and improve both, animal and human health.","output":"Port dEntre for Respiratory Infections C Does the Influenza A Virus Pave the Way for Bacteria?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison).

In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them.

From a cohort of 1352 consecutive patients admitted with Covid-19 to Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, Italy, between February and April 2020, we selected and studied hypertensive patients to assess whether antecedent (prior to hospitalization) use of RASIs might affect mortality from Covid-19 according to age. METHODS AND RESULTS Arterial hypertension was present in 688 patients. Overall mortality (in-hospital or shortly after discharge) was 35% (N = 240). After adjusting for 26 medical history variables via propensity score matching, antecedent use of RASIs (N = 459, 67%) was associated with a lower mortality in older hypertensive patients (age above the median of 68 years in the whole series), whereas no evidence of a significant effect was found in the younger group of the same population (P interaction = 0.001). In an analysis of the subgroup of 432 hypertensive patients older than 68 years, we considered two RASI drug subclasses, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs, N = 156) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs, N = 140), and assessed their respective effects by taking no-antecedent-use of RASIs as reference. This analysis showed that both antecedent use of ACEIs and antecedent use of ARBs were associated with a lower Covid-19 mortality (odds ratioACEI = 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.36--0.91, P = 0.018) (odds ratioARB = 0.49, 95% confidence interval 0.29--0.82, P = 0.006).

As projective curves flattened, administrators and surgeons sought to develop strategies to safely resume non-emergent surgery. This article reviews challenges and solutions specific to a children's hospital related to the resumption of elective pediatric surgeries. We present our tiered reentry approach for pediatric surgery as well as report early data for surgical volume and tracking COVID-19 cases during reentry. METHODS: The experience of shutdown, protocol development, and early reentry of elective pediatric surgery are reported from Levine's Children's Hospital (LCH), a free-leaning children's hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina. Data reported were obtained from de-identified hospital databases. RESULTS: Pediatric surgery experienced a dramatic decrease in case volumes at LCH during the shutdown, variable by specialty. A tiered and balanced reentry strategy was implemented with steady resumption of elective surgery following strict pre-procedural screening and testing. Early outcomes showed a steady thorough fluctuating increase in elective case volumes without evidence of a surgery-associated positive spread through periprocedural tracking. CONCLUSION: Reentry of non-emergent pediatric surgical care requires unique considerations including the impact of COVID-19 on children, each children hospital structure and resources, and preventing undue delay in intervention for age- and disease-specific pediatric conditions. A carefully balanced strategy has been critical for safe reentry following the anticipated surge. Ongoing tracking of resource utilization, operative volumes, and testing results will remain vital as community spread continues to fluctuate across the country.","output":"Pediatric Surgical Reentry Strategy Following the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Tiered and Balanced Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective The aim of this cross-sectional web-based study was to examine self-reported mental distress, psychosocial burdens, working conditions and potential risk and protective factors for depressive and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in health care workers (HCW). Methods In the largest survey on mental health of HCW conducted during the first wave of COVID-19 in Europe (N = 8071 HCW), we investigated depressive (Patient Health Questionnaire-2, PHQ-2), and anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2, GAD-2), working conditions, and psychosocial burden of 3678 HCW of three health care professions in hospitals: physicians (n = 1061), nurses (n = 1275), and medical technical assistants (MTA, n = 1342). Results The prevalence of clinically significant levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 17.4% and 17.8% for physicians, 21.6% and 19.0% for nurses, and 23.0% and 20.1% for MTA, respectively. All three professions demonstrated significantly elevated PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores, when compared with general German population before the pandemic, but lower scores in relation to that during the pandemic. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with insufficient recovery during leisure time, increased alcohol consumption, and less trust in colleagues in difficult situations. In addition, elevated anxiety scores were related to increased fear of becoming infected with COVID-19. Conclusion During the pandemic HCW demonstrated a lower burden of mental distress compared to the general population. Nevertheless, a high percentage of HCW demonstrates psychosocial distress, so that the establishment of regular mental health screening and prevention programmes for HCW is indicated.","output":"Psychosocial burden and working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany: The VOICE survey among 3678 health care workers in hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging infectious diseases are of great concern to public health, as highlighted by the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are two countries that have witnessed mass gatherings due to the arrival of Syrian refugees and the annual Hajj season. The mass migration of people not only brings exotic diseases to these regions but also brings new diseases back to their own countries, e.g., the outbreak of MERS in South Korea.

Some of those bat species are known to carry viruses that cause deadly diseases in other parts of the world, such as the rabies virus and coronaviruses. However, little is known about bats and the pathogens they carry in Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

Twenty-one trained collegiate sprint hurdlers and sprinters were recruited for the study (Hurdlers: 4M, 7F; Sprinters: 8M, 2F), average age (years) hurdlers: 20  1.2; sprinters: 20.4  1.9, height (cm) hurdlers: 172.6  10.2; sprinters: 181.7  4.5, and weight (kg) hurdlers: 67.6  12.0; sprinters: 73.9  5.6. Using real-time ultrasound, panoramic images of the internal oblique (IO) and external oblique (EO) were obtained at rest and contracted (flexion and rotation) in a seated position for both right and left sides of the trunk. While wearing a specially crafted shoulder harness, participants performed three maximal voluntary trunk rotational contractions (MVC). The three attempts were then averaged to obtain an overall MVC score for trunk rotation strength. Average MVC trunk rotational strength to the right was greater among all participants, p < 0.001. The IO showed greater and significant thickness changes from resting to contracted state than the EO, this was observed in all participants. The IO side asymmetry was significantly different between groups p < 0.01.

In this study, a 7.5 kb fragment of the BRV-1 genome that bracketed the genes for the structural proteins of BRV was amplified by long RT-PCR and the amplicon purified and sequenced directly. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of four open reading frames (ORF) corresponding to the peplomer (S), envelope (M), and nucleocapsid (N) genes, and an ORF for a novel 1.2 kb gene located between the M and N genes. This new gene was identical in nucleotide sequence to the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene of BRV-2. With the exception of this new ORF, BRV-1 manifests 80% nucleotide sequence identity with the torovirus prototype, Berne virus (BEV) in the 7.5 kb region from the 3 end of the genome that contains the genes for the structural proteins. A 504 base segment containing the ORF for the BRV-1 N gene was amplified by RT-PCR, and cloned into an Escherichia coli expression system. The resulting protein was purified by SDS-PAGE and used to immunize guinea pigs. Hyperimmune serum was reactive with bovine torovirus (BTV) and human torovirus (HTV) antigens. By immunoelectron microscopy, it was shown to aggregate broken but not intact torovirus particles from BTV-positive fecal specimens. By immunoblot, the hyperimmune serum reacted specifically with the 20 kD N proteins of both BTV and HTV, as well as with the expressed N protein.

The risk perception was equal between those diagnosed with COVID-19 or had a family member diagnosed compared to those without such exposure in most questions. Also, no significant difference was observed in risk perception between those students with serious underlying medical conditions and those without one regarding most items. Lastly, major and grade were the most significant demographic contributors to the risk perception. Moderate risk was perceived overall among the cases in which major and grade were the only remarkable demographic contributors. Unexpectedly, underlying medical history was not significantly correlated with the perceived risk. Lastly, previous COVID-19 exposure merely altered the curability and preventability perception.

Although schistosomiasis and other NTDs have been proposed to influence susceptibility to COVID-19, no study has looked into this. This study investigated the impact of schistosomiasis on the transmission of COVID-19, and also evaluated the role of Praziquantel (PZQ) treatment coverage on COVID-19 outcomes in African countries. The schistosomiasis endemicity and the preventive chemotherapy (PCT) coverage index statuses were obtained from the WHO databank. The COVID-19 data was obtained from COVID-19 Worldometers report. The data were adjusted and the percentage COVID-19 confirmed, active cases, recovery, and deaths were computed. The COVID-19 outcomes were evaluated relative to schistosomiasis endemicity and treatment coverage. COVID-19 outcomes, especially, the active cases and recovery rates were significantly improved in schistosomiasis non-endemic African countries (p < 0.05). While COVID-19 confirmed cases were significantly higher in countries with > 75% schistosomiasis PCT coverage index (p <0.05), improved COVID-19 outcomes were observed relative to active cases and recovery in countries with > 75% PCT coverage index (p >0.05). This study showed that schistosomiasis endemicity could be associated with negative COVID-19 outcomes and higher PZQ treatment coverage could reduce COVID-19 active cases and improve the recovery rate.","output":"Assessment of schistosomiasis endemicity and preventive treatment on coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Radical nephrectomy is widely accepted as the default management option for patients with T3 renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, it may require a certain time before surgery for various reasons. There are concerns that the delay in surgery may affect postoperative outcomes. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of surgical wait time on survival in patients with T3 RCC. Methods: We retrospectively selected 138 patients with T3 RCC who underwent radical surgery between July 2009 and December 2019. Surgical wait time was defined as the period from initial imaging diagnosis to surgery. Patients were divided into the following 2 groups according to wait time: short-wait group(60 days), and long-wait group (>60 days). The clinical and pathological characteristics were evaluated. The overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of each group were calculated and compared. Age, gender, interval, tumor size, pathological grade, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), surgical approach, year of surgery, and pathological type were included in the multivariable model. Results: This study included 91 male (65.9%) and 47 female (34.1%) patients. The median age of all patients was 60 years (interquartile range [IQR] 52-68 years). The median body mass index is 22.2 kg/m(2) (IQR 18.9-24.7 kg/m(2)). There were 128 patients (92.8%) with pT3a disease and 10 patients (7.3%) with pT3b disease. The median surgical wait time for all patients was 16 days (IQR 10-77 days). The median surgical wait time of the short- and long-wait groups was 12 days (IQR 8-16 days) and 92 days (IQR 79-115 days), respectively. Until the last follow-up, 54 patients died. Among them, 49 patients (90.7%) died of tumor-related causes, and 5 patients (9.3%) died of other causes. There are 1 and 4 cases in the short-wait and long-wait groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in gender, ECOG PS, American society of anesthesiologists score, Charlson comorbidity index, clinical T stage, clinical N stage, and body mass index. And there were no significant differences in tumor size, surgical approach, year of surgery, pathological type, tumor grade, pathological T stage, pathological N stage, and venous involvement between the 2 groups. OS, CSS, and RFS were compared. The 5-year OS of the short- and long-wait time groups were 65.0% and 40.9%, respectively (P = .030). The 5-year CSS rates of the short- and long-wait time groups were 68.7% and 51.5%, respectively (P = .012). The 5-year RFS rates of the short- and long-wait time groups were 61.5% and 46.8%, respectively (P = .119). Multivariable analysis revealed that surgical wait time interval and tumor size were independent risk factors for OS and that wait time was also an independent risk factor for CCS. Conclusion: Delay in radical surgery beyond 60 days can negatively affect OS in patients with T3 RCC.","output":"Mortality Increases When Radical Nephrectomy is Delayed More Than 60 Days for T3 Renal Cell Carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systematic reviews involve the application of scientific methods to reduce bias in review of literature. The key components of a systematic review are a well-defined research question, comprehensive literature search to identify all studies that potentially address the question, systematic assembly of the studies that answer the question, critical appraisal of the methodological quality of the included studies, data extraction and analysis (with and without statistics), and considerations towards applicability of the evidence generated in a systematic review. These key features can be remembered as six A; Ask, Access, Assimilate, Appraise, Analyze and Apply. Meta-analysis is a statistical tool that provides pooled estimates of effect from the data extracted from individual studies in the systematic review. The graphical output of meta-analysis is a forest plot which provides information on individual studies and the pooled effect. Systematic reviews of literature can be undertaken for all types of questions, and all types of study designs.

However, multiple barriers prevent patients from accessing this treatment option. Objective: To determine if a quality improvement intervention provided in chronic kidney disease (CKD) programs (vs. usual care) enables more patients with no recorded contraindications to kidney transplant to complete more steps toward receiving a kidney transplant. Design: This protocol describes a pragmatic 2-arm, parallel-group, open-label, registry-based, cluster-randomized clinical trialthe Enhance Access to Kidney Transplantation and Living Kidney Donation (EnAKT LKD) trial. Setting: All 26 CKD programs in Ontario, Canada, with a trial start date of November 1, 2017. The original end date of March 31, 2021 (3.4 years) has been extended to December 31, 2021 (4.1 years) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants: During the trial, the 26 CKD programs are expected to care for more than 10 000 adult patients with CKD (including patients approaching the need for dialysis and patients receiving dialysis) with no recorded contraindications to a kidney transplant. Intervention: Programs were randomly allocated to provide a quality improvement intervention or usual care. The intervention has 4 main components: (1) local quality improvement teams and administrative support;(2) tailored education and resources for staff, patients, and living kidney donor candidates;(3) support from kidney transplant recipients and living kidney donors;and (4) program-level performance reports and oversight by program leaders. Primary Outcome: The primary outcome is the number of key steps completed toward receiving a kidney transplant analyzed at the cluster level (CKD program). The following 4 unique steps per patient will be counted: (1) patient referred to a transplant center for evaluation, (2) at least one living kidney donor candidate contacts a transplant center for an intended recipient and completes a health history questionnaire to begin their evaluation, (3) patient added to the deceased donor transplant wait list, and (4) patient receives a kidney transplant from a living or deceased donor. Planned Primary Analysis: Study data will be obtained from Ontarios linked administrative healthcare databases. An intent-to-treat analysis will be conducted comparing the primary outcome between randomized groups using a 2-stage approach. First stage: residuals are obtained from fitting a regression model to individual-level variables ignoring intervention and clustering effects. Second stage: residuals from the first stage are aggregated at the cluster level as the outcome. Limitations: It may not be possible to isolate independent effects of each intervention component, the usual care group could adopt intervention components leading to contamination bias, and the relatively small number of clusters could mean the 2 arms are not balanced on all baseline prognostic factors. Conclusions: The EnAKT LKD trial will provide high-quality evidence on whether a multi-component quality improvement intervention helps patients complete more steps toward receiving a kidney transplant.

The purpose of this study is to identify medications associated with altered disease outcomes in COVID-19. A retrospective cohort comprised of all adult inpatient admissions to our centre with COVID-19 was analysed. Data concerning all antecedent prescriptions were collected and agents brought forward for analysis if prescribed to at least 20 patients in our cohort. Forty-two medications and 22 classes of medication were examined. Groups were propensity score matched and analysed by logistic and linear regression. The majority of medications did not show a statistically significant relationship with altered disease outcomes. Lower mortality was associated with use of pregabalin (p = 0.049, HR = 0.10 [0.01-0.92]), inhalers of any type (p = 0.015, HR = 0.33 [0.14-0.80]) and specifically beclomethasone (p = 0.032, HR = 0.10 [0.01-0.82]), tiotropium (p = 0.035, HR = 0.07 [0.01-0.83]) and steroid containing inhalers (p = 0.013, HR = 0.35 [0.15-0.79]). Gliclazide (p = 0.020, HR = 4.37 [1.26-15.18]) and proton pump inhibitor (p = 0.028, HR = 1.72 [1.06-2.79]) use was associated with greater mortality. Diuretic (p = 0.002, HR = 0.07 [0.01-0.37]) and statin (p = 0.006, HR = 0.35 [0.17-0.73]) use was associated with lower rates of critical care admission. Our data lends confidence to observing usual practice in COVID-19 patients by continuing antecedent prescriptions in the absence of an alternative acute contraindication. We highlight potential benefits in investigation of diuretics, inhalers, pregabalin and statins as therapeutic agents for COVID-19 and support further assessment of the safety of gliclazide and PPIs in the acute illness.

Treatment has changed in recent decades from open surgery to management with flexible endoscopy, resulting in lower morbidity and mortality. The goal of this study was to present the largest series, with the longest follow-up, of patients with Zenker's diverticulum receiving outpatient treatment with flexible endoscopy using a diverticuloscope and Ligasure (Covidien, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States), a device that allows tissue sealing and coagulation of vessels before cutting the septum between the diverticulum and esophagus. Patients and methods We performed 79 diverticulotomies in 69 patients (65.2 % male, mean age 73.4 years). The mean diverticulum size was 2.8 cm. In three cases with a diverticulum  1.5 cm, the diverticuloscope could not be placed. Results The technical success was 95.83 % and the clinical success 96.7 %: 84 % of the 56 patients followed for a mean of 34.6 months (24 - 64 months) had no dysphagia. The recurrence rate was 10.4 %, with a good response to a second diverticulotomy at 12 months (IQR: 11.5 - 17) in most cases. The most severe complications were two microperforations, resolved with conservative treatment, and one case of delayed bleeding endoscopically-controlled with a clip. Conclusions Diverticulotomy of the esophageal-diverticular septum with Ligasure is an outpatient endoscopic technique that is simple, effective in the long term and very safe for the treatment of patients with Zenker's diverticulum.

DESIGN Longitudinal. SETTING The Hemodialysis Study (HEMO Study) was a randomized, clinical trial of the effects of HD dose and membrane flux on mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing chronic dialysis. PARTICIPANTS Secondary analysis of the HEMO Study. MEASUREMENTS Participants completed the Index of Well-Being (IWB) and the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Long Form (KDQOL-LF), which also includes the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Questionnaire (SF-36) annually. Changes in subjects those aged 70 and older were compared with changes in subjects aged 55 to 69 and 18 to 54. RESULTS At baseline, 1,813 (98%) of HEMO participants completed HRQOL surveys. Their mean age was 58, 56% were female, 64% were black, and mean duration of dialysis was 3.8 years. In subjects with HRQOL data at the first three annual assessments, there were no substantial mean declines in the SF-36 Physical or Mental Component Summary scales over 3 years. In models incorporating effects of attrition, the differences in average change over 3 years between patients undergoing HD aged 70 and older and the younger cohorts were small in magnitude. There were high rates of adverse HRQOL events in all age groups and significantly higher composite event rates of death or clinically significant decline in HRQOL over 3 years was found in subjects aged 70 and older. CONCLUSION Although HRQOL was impaired in the population undergoing HD, HRQOL scores at baseline reflect a better-preserved multidimensional quality of life in respondents in the HEMO Study aged 70 and older than in younger patients undergoing HD. There was no substantial relationship between age and average decline in HRQOL score over 3 years in participants in the HEMO Study.","output":"The influence of age on changes in health-related quality of life over three years in a cohort undergoing hemodialysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2) has dislocated clinical services and postgraduate training.

Based on our analysis, two of our main results deserve attention. First, at the global level, the pace of generation of new green technologies as measured by patent data is slowing down in recent years. This trend, if not inverted, casts some doubts on the economic sustainability of the ambitious environmental targets set by the EC. Second, the current EU technological positioning with respect to green areas appears to be problematic in terms of technological sovereignty, with serious risks of potential technological dependences from other countries.

We do not know if this approach is likely to increase or decrease health inequalities. The aim of the study was to determine if the purchase and consumption of zero and low alcohol beers differs by demographic and socio-economic characteristics of consumers. Based on British household purchase data from 79,411 households and on British survey data of more than 104,635 adult (18+) respondents, we estimated the likelihood of buying and drinking zero (ABV = 0.0%) and low alcohol (ABV > 0.0% and  3.5%) beer by a range of socio-demographic characteristics. We found that buying and consuming zero alcohol beer is much more likely to occur in younger age groups, in more affluent households, and in those with higher social grades, with gaps in buying zero alcohol beer between households in higher and lower social grades widening between 2015 and 2020. Buying and drinking low alcohol beer had less consistent relationships with socio-demographic characteristics, but was strongly driven by households that normally buy and drink the most alcohol. Common to many health-related behaviours, it seems that it is the more affluent that lead the way in choosing zero or low alcohol products. Whilst the increased availability of zero and low alcohol products might be a useful tool to reduce overall ethanol consumption in the more socially advantageous part of society, it may be less beneficial for the rest of the population. Other evidence-based alcohol policy measures that lessen health inequalities, need to go hand-in-hand with those promoting the uptake of zero and low alcohol beer.","output":"Is Buying and Drinking Zero and Low Alcohol Beer a Higher Socio-Economic Phenomenon?

Of the 34,041 participants surveyed, 18,810 (55.3%) were willing to get vaccinated, 13,736 (40.3%) were hesitant, and 1495 (4.4%) were resistant. Rates of vaccine acceptance increased over time, with geographical discrepancies in vaccine hesitancy and resistance between provinces in China. Vaccine safety was the greatest concern expressed by most participants (24,461 [71.9%]), and the major reason for participants refusing vaccination (974 [65.2%]).

Compared with vaccination acceptance, female, young and middle-aged, high income, and perceived low-risk of infection were associated with vaccine hesitancy. Histories of allergic reactions to other vaccines and depression symptoms were related to vaccine resistance. Common factors that influenced vaccine hesitancy and resistance were residing in cities and perceiving less protection with vaccines than with other protective measures. The results indicate that the rate of vaccine resistance is relatively low, but vaccine hesitancy is common. Individuals who are female, young and middle-aged, with a high income, and residing in cities are more likely to be hesitant for vaccination and should be the target populations for vaccination campaigns.

In semi-rural areas of low-middle-income-countries (LMICs), where occupational activity is the main source of PA, changes in PA associated with COVID-19 restrictions are unknown. We investigated the impact of Movement Control Order (MCO) restrictions in a semi-rural region of Malaysia. METHODS: The South East Asia Community Observatory (SEACO) is a dynamic prospective community cohort. We contacted a random sample of 1007 adults (18+) who had previously provided PA data in 2018. We asked about PA during the MCO (March-May 2020) and at the time of interview (June 2020). RESULTS: During the MCO, PA reduced by a mean of 6.7 hours/week (95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.3, 8.0) compared to 2018, with the largest reductions among those in employment. By June, PA was 3.4 hours/week (95% CI = 2.0, 4.8) less than 2018, leaving 34% of adults currently inactive (20% in 2018). Reductions in occupational PA were not replaced with active travel or activity at home. Despite these observed reductions, most participants did not think the MCO had affected their PA. CONCLUSIONS: Movement restrictions are associated with lower PA lasting beyond the period of strict restrictions; such longer-term reductions in PA may have a detrimental impact on health. Future MCOs should encourage people to be active, but may additionally need targeted messaging for those who dont necessarily realise they are at risk.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), rotavirus (BoRV) and coronavirus (BoCV) are the main enteric pathogens involved. NCD is a major health challenge that impacts on farm profitability, calf welfare and antimicrobial usage. Thus, a key part of prevention is optimisation of preventive programs for NCD such as vaccinating cows to increase passive immunity transfer for their offspring during the neonatal period. In this study, it was demonstrated that dam vaccination against NCD is an excellent tool to increase specific immunity; how different vaccines differ in their specific immune response and, consequently, in the amount of specific passive transfer of antibodies to their calves. One of the most relevant findings is the importance of inducing a specific immune response for the three NCD pathogens. ABSTRACT: Neonatal calf diarrhoea (NCD) is a major health challenge with a negative impact on farm profitability, calf welfare and antimicrobial use. Neonatal calves are particularly sensitive to enteric infections. Thus, a key point for prevention is minimising infectious pressure and maximising specific immune responses. An amount of 120 dams not previously vaccinated against NCD were randomly allocated to one of three study groups: negative control versus two vaccinated groups (A and B). In the control group, the average level of antibodies was significantly low for both BoCV and ETEC (15.6 and 13.9% in the colostrum samples, respectively), demonstrating the importance of dam vaccination. Indeed, the level of specific immunity was significantly increased for BoCV and ETEC with dam vaccination using both one-shot vaccines versus the control group. Moreover, the statistical analysis revealed a significantly higher level of antibodies for BoCV and ETEC in colostrum samples in vaccine A versus vaccine B and the control group. In accordance, the calf serum demonstrated a significantly higher level and greater homogeneity of antibodies against BoCV and ETEC in the Vaccine A group versus other experimental groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study demonstrated a different specific immune response for the pathogens depending on the vaccine used to control NCD in cows.","output":"The Specific Immune Response after Vaccination against Neonatal Calf Diarrhoea Differs between Apparent Similar Vaccines in a Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is resistant to neutralizing antibodies, it retains susceptibility to cellular immunity. Here, we characterized vaccine-induced T cells specific for various SARS-CoV-2 variants and identified HLA-A*24:02-restricted CD8+ T cells that strongly suppressed Omicron BA.1 replication. Mutagenesis analyses revealed that a G446S mutation, located just outside the N-terminus of the cognate epitope, augmented TCR recognition of this variant. In contrast, no enhanced suppression of replication was observed against cells infected with the prototype, Omicron BA.2, and Delta variants that express G446. The enhancing effect of the G446S mutation was lost when target cells were treated with inhibitors of tripeptidyl peptidase II, a protein that mediates antigen processing. These results demonstrate that the G446S mutation in the Omicron BA.1 variant affects antigen processing/presentation and potentiates antiviral activity by vaccine-induced T cells, leading to enhanced T cell immunity towards emerging variants.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 spike G446S potentiates HLA-A*24:02-restricted T cell immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in significant global morbidity and mortality and there are a lack of effective therapies There is a need for treatment which could be available for all in the global community, as well as within hospital, which is efficacious, affordable and safe Xanthohumol from hop extract has been shown in vitro and in vivo to have antiviral properties against RNA and DNA viruses but also importantly anti-inflammatory properties against severe respiratory syndrome via inhibition of NF kappa B dependent pathways We review the evidence for xanthohumol to be considered as a treatment for SARS-CoV- 2 infection We need an economic and globally available therapy and thinking beyond the traditional is important;thus, studies are warranted to assess efficacy of xanthohumol against SARS-CoV-2","output":"The Potential Role of Xanthohumol in SARS-CoV-2 Treatment-Globally Accessible and Economically Viable"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to examine the impact of lockdown on sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnoses and access to a public sexual health service in the COVID-19 pandemic in Melbourne, Australia. METHODS: The operating hours of Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC) remained the same during the lockdown. We examined the number of consultations and STI at MSHC between January and June 2020 and stratified the data into pre-lockdown (3-February to 22-March), lockdown (23-March to 10-May) and post-lockdown (11-May to 28-June) with seven weeks in each period. Incidence rate ratio (IRR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: The total number of consultations dropped from 7,818 in pre-lockdown to 4,652 during lockdown (IRR=0.60;95%CI:0.57-0.62) but increased to 5,347 in the post-lockdown period (IRR=1.15;95%CI:1.11-1.20). There was a 68% reduction in asymptomatic screening during lockdown (IRR=0.32; 95%CI:0.30-0.35) but it gradually increased in the post-lockdown period (IRR=1.59;95%CI:1.46-1.74). STI with milder symptoms showed a marked reduction, including non-gonococcal urethritis (IRR=0.60;95%CI:0.51-0.72), and candidiasis (IRR=0.61;95%CI:0.49-0.76) during lockdown compared with pre-lockdown. STI with more marked symptoms did not change significantly, including pelvic inflammatory disease (IRR=0.95;95%CI:0.61-1.47) and infectious syphilis (IRR=1.14;95%CI:0.73-1.77). There was no significant change in STI diagnoses in post-lockdown compared to lockdown.

Power relations and inequities experienced by people because of social markers, e.g., gender, age, education, ethnicity, and race, intersect leading to poverty and associated health challenges. Concurrent to the growing body of literature exploring the impact of these intersecting axes of inequity in FASP settings, there is a need to identify actions promoting gender, equity, and justice (GEJ). Gender norms that emphasise toxic masculinity, patriarchy, societal control over women and lack of justice are unfortunately common throughout the world and are exacerbated in FASP settings. It is critical that health policies in FASP settings consider GEJ and include strategies that promote progressive changes in power relationships. ReBUILD for Resilience (ReBUILD) focuses on health systems resilience in FASP settings and is underpinned by a conceptual framework that is grounded in a broader view of health systems as complex adaptive systems. The framework identifies links between different capacities and enables identification of feedback loops which can drive or inhibit the emergence and implementation of resilient approaches. We applied the framework to four different country case studies (Lebanon, Myanmar, Nepal and Sierra Leone) to illustrate how it can be inclusive of GEJ concerns, to inform future research and support context responsive recommendations to build equitable and inclusive health systems in FASP settings.","output":"Health systems resilience in fragile and shock-prone settings through the prism of gender equity and justice: implications for research, policy and practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: There is limited evidence about the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 in infected patients.

Metformin mainly activates adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the liver which leads to suppression of fatty acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis. Metformin activates AMPK in skeletal muscle as well, which increases translocation of glucose transporter 4 to the cell membrane and thereby increases glucose uptake. Further, metformin suppresses glucagon signaling in the liver by suppressing adenylate cyclase which leads to suppression of gluconeogenesis. In addition, metformin reduces autophagy failure observed in pancreatic ?-cells under diabetic conditions. Furthermore, it is known that metformin alters the gut microbiome and facilitates the transport of glucose from the circulation into excrement. It is also known that metformin reduces food intake and lowers body weight by increasing circulating levels of the peptide hormone growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). Furthermore, much attention has been drawn to the fact that the frequency of various cancers is lower in subjects taking metformin. Metformin suppresses the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) by activating AMPK in pre-neoplastic cells, which leads to suppression of cell growth and an increase in apoptosis in pre-neoplastic cells. It has been shown recently that metformin consumption potentially influences the mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19).

To understand exosome-mediated improvement in cardiac function we examined the proteomic alternations in the MSC exosome-treated mice hearts subjected to left coronary artery (LCA) ligation, with particular emphasis on peri-infarct areas. At 7 days after LCA ligation, left ventricular end systolic thickness, infarct size and survival of mice were studied. Mass spectrometric analysis of infarct and peri-infarct areas was carried out. Expression of inflammatory markers (LOX-1 and NLRP3) and cell death markers (Bax, Bcl-2, Caspases 1 and 3 and GSDMD) were investigated by Western blots and immunofluorescence. Proteomic analysis of the infarct and peri-infarct areas in saline-treated hearts revealed differentially expressed proteins involved in inflammation and apoptotic cell death, while showing depletion of processes governing cell death. Exosome treatment significantly improved the proteomic profile in both infarct and peri-infarct areas, more so in the peri-infarct areas. The infarct size was smaller (9  1%), and cardiac contractile function (fractional shortening) was preserved in the exosome-treated mice (28  2%). Survival of exosome-treated mice was also better.

The pooled prevalence of fecal RNA in patients with detectable respiratory RNA was estimated. The days of shedding and days to loss of fecal and respiratory RNA from presentation were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies (N = 1,636) met criteria. The pooled prevalence of fecal RNA in COVID-19 patients was 43% (95% confidence interval [CI] 34%-52%). Higher proportion of patients with GI symptoms (52.4% vs 25.9%, odds ratio = 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.7) compared with no GI symptoms, specifically diarrhea (51.6% vs 24.0%, odds ratio = 3.0, 95% CI 1.9-4.8), had detectable fecal RNA.

We further show here that high levels of AXL and EMT were frequently expressed in subsets of both treatment-na?ve and treatment-relapsed NSCLC. Previously, we and others have demonstrated a role for AXL in mediating DNA damage repair (DDR) as well as resistance to inhibition of WEE1, a replication stress response kinase. Here, we show that BGB324 (bemcentinib), a selective small-molecule AXL inhibitor, caused DNA damage and induced replication stress, indicated by ATR/CHK1 phosphorylation, more significantly in TP53-deficient NSCLC cell lines. Similar effects were also observed in large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) cell lines. High AXL protein levels were also associated with resistance to ATR inhibition. Combined inhibition of AXL and ATR significantly decreased cell proliferation of NSCLC and LCNEC cell lines. Mechanistically, combined inhibition of AXL and ATR significantly increased RPA32 hyper-phosphorylation and DNA double strand breaks and induced markers of mitotic catastrophe. Notably, NSCLC cell lines with low levels of SLFN11, a known predictive biomarker for platinum and PARP inhibitor sensitivity, were more sensitive to AXL/ATR co-targeting. These findings demonstrate a novel and unexpected role for AXL in replication stress tolerance, with potential therapeutic implications. Implications: These findings demonstrate that the combination of AXL and ATR inhibitors could be a promising therapeutic combination for NSCLC, LCNEC and other cancers.","output":"AXL inhibition induces DNA damage and replication stress in non-small cell lung cancer cells and promotes sensitivity to ATR inhibitors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the spatial mobility of a major part of the population in many countries For most people, this was an extremely disruptive shock, resulting in loss of income, social contact and quality of life However, forced to reduce human physical interaction, most businesses, individuals and households developed new action lines and routines, and were gradually learning to adapt to the new reality Some of these changes might result in long-term changes in opportunity structures and in spatial preferences for working, employment or residential location choice, and for mobility behavior In this paper we aim to extend the time-geographic approach to analyzing peoples spatial activities, by focusing on health-related geographical mobility patterns during the pandemic in Sweden Starting from a micro-approach at individual level and then looking at an aggregate urban scale, we examine the space-time geography during the coronavirus pandemic, using H?gerstrands time-geography model We utilize a massive but (location-wise) fuzzy dataset to analyze aggregate spatiotemporal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using a contemporary time-geographical approach First, we address micro-level behavior in time-space to understand the mechanisms of change and to illustrate that a temporal drastic change in human mobility seems to be plausible Then we analyze the changes in individuals mobility by analyzing their activity spaces in aggregate using mobile phone network data records Clearly, it is too early for predicting long-term spatial changes, but a clear heterogeneity in spatial behavior can already be detected It seems plausible that the corona pandemic may have long-lasting effects on employment centers, city roles and spatial mobility patterns","output":"Mobility during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Data-Driven Time-Geographic Analysis of Health-Induced Mobility Changes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A fully integrated, flexible, and functional sensing device for exhaled breath analysis drastically transforms conventional medical diagnosis to non-invasive, low-cost, real-time, and personalized health care. 2D materials based on MXenes offer multiple advantages for accurately detecting various breath biomarkers compared to conventional semiconducting oxides.

While blockade of such PPIs with small molecules is more challenging than with antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) might offer alternatives that are less strain- and mutation-sensitive, suitable for oral or inhaled administration, and more controllable / less immunogenic. Here, we report the identification of SMIs of this PPI by screening our compound-library that is focused on the chemical space of organic dyes. Among promising candidates identified, several dyes (Congo red, direct violet 1, Evans blue) and novel drug-like compounds (DRI-C23041, DRI-C91005) inhibited the interaction of hACE2 with the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV with low micromolar activity in our cell-free ELISA-type assays (IC50s of 0.2-3.0 M); whereas, control compounds, such as sunset yellow FCF, chloroquine, and suramin, showed no activity. Protein thermal shift assays indicated that the SMIs identified here bind SARS-CoV-2-S and not ACE2. Selected promising compounds inhibited the entry of a SARS-CoV-2-S expressing pseudovirus into ACE2-expressing cells in concentration-dependent manner with low micromolar IC50s (6-30 M). This provides proof-of-principle evidence for the feasibility of small-molecule inhibition of PPIs critical for coronavirus attachment/entry and serves as a first guide in the search for SMI-based alternative antiviral therapies for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by coronaviruses in general and COVID-19 in particular.","output":"Small-Molecule In Vitro Inhibitors of the Coronavirus Spike C ACE2 Protein-Protein Interaction as Blockers of Viral Attachment and Entry for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have a suboptimal antibody response following vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) and lower seroconversion rates following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) compared with healthy individuals.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and mechanisms of action of vitamin D(3) (Vit. D) on the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in vitro and in vivo with or without tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-) treatment. Pretreatment with Vit. D reduced the expression of ICAM-1 and leukocyte adhesion in TNF--treated A549 cells. TNF- increased the accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), while Vit. D reduced this effect. Pretreatment with Vit. D attenuated TNF--induced mitochondrial fission, as shown by the increased expression of mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), phosphorylated dynamin-related protein 1 (p-DRP1), and mitophagy-related proteins (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3, Bnip3) in A549 cells. Inhibition of DRP1 or Mff significantly decreased ICAM-1 expression. In addition, we found that Vit. D decreased TNF--induced ICAM-1 expression, mitochondrial fission, and mitophagy via the AKT and NF-B pathways. Moreover, ICAM-1 expression, mitochondrial fission, and mitophagy were increased in the lung tissues of TNF--treated mice, while Vit. D supplementation reduced these effects. In this study, we elucidated the mechanisms by which Vit. D reduces the expression of adhesion molecules in models of airway inflammation. Vit.

Therefore, we conducted an NMA to assess the effectiveness of these four respiratory strategies in patients with de novo AHRF. METHODS: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Ichushi databases were searched. Studies including adults aged 18 years with AHRF and RCTs that compared two different oxygenation techniques (SOT, NIV, HFNO, or IMV) were selected. A frequentist-based approach with multivariate random-effects meta-analysis was used. The outcomes were mortality and intubation rates. RESULTS: Among the 14,263 records initially identified, 25 studies (3302 patients) were included. In the analysis of mortality, compared to SOT, NIV (risk ratio [RR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61C0.95) reduced mortality; however, IMV (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.57C1.78) and HFNO (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.66C1.20) did not. For assessments of the intubation incidence, compared to SOT, NIV use (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.51C0.79) was associated with a reduction in intubation, but HFNO (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.61C1.11) was not significant.

METHODS: HCP and patients with cancer at the Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna were included between 21 March and 4 June and tested for total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 employing the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Reactive samples were confirmed or disproved by the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test. Additionally, a structured questionnaire regarding basic demographic parameters, travel history and COVID-19-associated symptoms had to be completed by HCP. RESULTS: 146 subjects (62 HCP and 84 patients with cancer) were enrolled. In the oncological HCP cohort, 20 (32.3%) subjects were medical oncologists, 28 (45.2%) nurses at our ward and 14 (22.6%) fulfil other functions such as study coordinators. In the patient cohort, most individuals are on active anticancer treatment (96.4%). 26% of the HCP and 6% of the patients had symptoms potentially associated with COVID-19 since the end of February 2020. However, only in 2 (3.2%) HCP and in 3 (3.6%) patients, anti-SARS-Cov-2 total antibodies were detected.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the willingness of adults to use different specimen collection modalities for themselves and children as part of a COVID-19 research study. METHODS: Between March 27 and April 1, 2020, we recruited 1435 adults aged 18 years or older though social media advertisements. Participants completed a survey that included 5-point Likert scale items stating how willing they were to use the following specimen collection testing modalities as part of a research study: home collection of a saliva sample, home collection of a throat swab, home finger-prick blood collection, drive-through site throat swab, clinic throat swab, and clinic blood collection. Additionally, participants indicated how the availability of home-based collection methods would impact their willingness to participate compared to drive-through and clinic-based specimen collection. We used Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman rank correlations to assess if willingness to use each testing modality differed by demographic variables and characteristics of interest. We compared the overall willingness to use each testing modality and estimated effect sizes with Cohen d. RESULTS: We analyzed responses from 1435 participants with a median age of 40.0 (SD=18.2) years and over half of which were female (761/1435, 53.0%). Most participants agreed or strongly agreed that they would be willing to use specimens self-collected at home to participate in research, including willingness to collect a saliva sample (1259/1435, 87.7%) or a throat swab (1191/1435, 83.1%). Willingness to collect a throat swab sample was lower in both a drive-through setting (64%) and clinic setting (53%). Overall, 69.0% (990/1435) of participants said they would be more likely to participate in a research study if they could provide a saliva sample or throat swab at home compared to going to a drive-through site; only 4.4% (63/1435) of participants said they would be less likely to participate using self-collected samples. For each specimen collection modality, willingness to collect specimens from children for research was lower than willingness to use on oneself, but the ranked order of modalities was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants were willing to participate in a COVID-19 research study that involves laboratory testing; however, there was a strong preference for home specimen collection procedures over drive-through or clinic-based testing.

We compared the total testing costs under two hypothetical scenarios in South Korea. We also simulated country\\\\specific circumstances in India, South Africa, South Korea, the UK, and the USA. RESULTS: At extreme PRs of 0.01% and 10%, simple pooling was the most economic option and resulted in cost reductions of 98.0% (pool size 80) and 36.7% (pool size = 3), respectively. At moderate PRs of 0.1%, 1%, 2%, and 5%, the matrix pooling strategy was the most economic option and resulted in cost reductions of 97.0% (pool size 88), 86.1% (pool size = 22), 77.9% (pool size = 14), and 59.2% (pool size = 7), respectively. In both hypothetical scenarios of South Korea, simple pooling costs less than matrix pooling. However, the preferable options for achieving cost savings differed depending on each country's cost per test and PRs.

Sequence databases are an abundant resource from which to extract biologically relevant and clinically actionable information. As the pandemic has gone on, SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly evolved, involving complex genomic changes that challenge current approaches to classifying SARS-CoV-2 variants. Deep sequence learning could be a potentially powerful way to build complex sequence-to-phenotype models. Unfortunately, while they can be predictive, deep learning typically produces black box models that cannot directly provide biological and clinical insight. Researchers should therefore consider implementing emerging methods for visualizing and interpreting deep sequence models.

Reducing the hospital length of stay (LOS) reduces patient and hospital burden. Given that adverse drug reactions are known to prolong LOS, unmanaged pharmacogenomic risk and drug interactions among COVID-19 patients may be a risk factor for longer hospital stays. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine if pharmacogenomic and drug interaction risks were associated with longer lengths of stay among high-risk patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Design: Retrospective cohort study of medical and pharmacy claims Setting: Administrative database from a large U.S. health insurance company Participants: Medicare Advantage members with a first COVID-19 hospitalization between January 2020 and June 2020, who did not die during the stay. Exposures: (1) Pharmacogenetic interaction probability (PIP) of []25% (low), 26%-50% (moderate), or >50% (high), which indicate the likelihood that one or more clinically actionable gene-drug or gene-drug-drug interactions would be identified with testing; (2) drug-drug interaction (DDI) severity of minimal, minor, moderate, major, or contraindicated, which indicate the severity of an interaction between two or more active medications. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was hospital length of stay. Results were stratified by hierarchical condition categories (HCC) counts and chronic conditions. Results: A total of 6,025 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were included in the study. Patients with moderate or high PIP were hospitalized for 9% (CI: 4%-15%; p < 0.001) and 16% longer (CI: 8%-24%; p < 0.001), respectively, compared to those with low PIP, whereas RAF score was not associated with LOS. High PIP was significantly associated with 12%-22% longer lengths of stay compared to low PIP in patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or COPD. Finally, among patients with 2 or 3 HCCs, a 10% longer length of stay was observed among patients with moderate or more severe DDI compared to minimal or minor DDI. Conclusions and Relevance: Proactively mitigating pharmacogenomic risk has the potential to reduce length of stay in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 especially those with COPD, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.","output":"Pharmacogenomic and drug interaction risk associations with hospital length of stay among Medicare Advantage members with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many of the emerging infectious diseases, including those caused by bioterrorist agents, are zoonoses.

Older adults have been especially vulnerable to adverse effects from the pandemic including higher mortality and more severe disease complications. At the same time, social isolation, malnutrition and physical inactivity are serious concerns among older adults. The pandemic and associated restrictions may serve to exacerbate these issues, presenting increased risks to physical and mental health. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore how community-living older people in the UK experienced the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and how it impacted their health and well-being, and associated behaviours.MethodsQualitative data were collected by conducting serial telephone interviews, with an interval of approximately three months. Participants were from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study, all aged over 80 years. Discussions were audio-recorded, information related to the COVID-19 pandemic was transcribed verbatim and transcripts analysed thematically. Interviews were conducted from March to October 2020.ResultsTwelve participants were included in the study (7 men and 5 women). Data from a total of 35 qualitative interviews were used, comprising two or three timepoints per participant. Preliminary analysis identified five overarching themes: 1) shopping strategies and food accessibility, 2) limitations on activities and going out, 3) disruption to healthcare, 4) social and psychological repercussions, and 5) coping strategies. Initial findings highlight challenges associated with accessing shops, healthcare, and usual activities due to restrictions. Findings emphasize the issue of loneliness and isolation for some of the participants, especially those living alone, as well as fear of the virus, with restrictions leading to a loss of purpose for some, along with related effects on mental health (e.g. worry, anxiety). For some, these issues appeared to link to a reprioritisation of their behaviours (for example, exercise and diet were deprioritised). Coping strategies used by participants included finding ways to keep busy and to do physical activity safely, maintaining social contact online or by telephone, and having an optimistic or positive outlook, a do what you can attitude.ConclusionAnalysis is ongoing and will further aim to explore how older peoples experiences and behaviours might have changed over the duration of the pandemic.

The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) has a demonstrated role in shaping innate and adaptive antiviral immunity by inducing the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and mediating signals downstream of IFN-. Although ectopic expression experiments have suggested an inhibitory function of IRF-1 against infection of alphaviruses in cell culture, its role in vivo remains unknown. Here, we infected Irf1 -/- mice with two distantly related arthritogenic alphaviruses, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Ross River virus (RRV), and assessed the early antiviral functions of IRF-1 prior to induction of adaptive B and T cell responses. IRF-1 expression limited CHIKV-induced foot swelling in joint-associated tissues and prevented dissemination of CHIKV and RRV at early time points. Virological and histological analyses revealed greater infection of muscle tissues in Irf1 -/- mice than in wild-type mice. The antiviral actions of IRF-1 appeared to be independent of the induction of type I IFN or the effects of type II and III IFNs but were associated with altered local proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses and differential infiltration of myeloid cell subsets. Collectively, our in vivo experiments suggest that IRF-1 restricts CHIKV and RRV infection in stromal cells, especially muscle cells, and that this controls local inflammation and joint-associated swelling.IMPORTANCE Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of a broad range of antiviral host defense genes.

Our studies show that IRF-1 controlled alphavirus replication and swelling in joint-associated tissues within days of infection. Detailed histopathological and virological analyses revealed that IRF-1 preferentially restricted CHIKV infection in cells of nonhematopoietic lineage, including muscle cells.

Most neurobiological accounts of altered motivation in older adults assume that these deficits are caused by a gradual decline in brain tissue, while some psychological theories posit a switch from gain orientation to loss avoidance in motivational goals. Here, we contribute to reconcile the psychological and neural perspectives by providing evidence that the frontopolar cortex (FPC), a brain region involved in costCbenefit weighting, increasingly underpins effort avoidance rather than engagement with age. Using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation together with effortCreward trade-offs, we find that the FPCs function in effort-based decisions remains focused on costCbenefit calculations but appears to switch from reward-seeking to cost avoidance with increasing age. This is further evidenced by the exploratory, independent analysis of structural brain changes, showing that the relationship between the density of the frontopolar neural tissue and the willingness to exert effort differs in young vs older adults.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study that involved reviewing medical records of COVID-19 Malaysian patients aged 12 and above who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and received treatment in 18 COVID-19 hospitals from February to April 2020. A minimum sample of 375 patients was required. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with antibiotic usage. Variables with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 4043 cases were included for analysis. The majority of the patients (87.6%) were non-smokers, male (65.0%), and had at least one comorbidity (37.0%). The median age was 35 years (IQR: 38). The prevalence of antibiotic usage was 17.1%, with 5.5% of them being prescribed with two or more types of antibiotics.

METHODS: Interferon-gamma (INF-?3) production was measured in the heparinized blood of convalescent and unexposed subjects after stimulation for 24 h with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein, the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) protein or the Nucleocapsid (NP) protein, respectively. The presence of IgG-RBD protein antibodies in both study groups was determined with an \\"in-house\\" ELISA.

However, complete remission is observed in less than half of the cases, and the majority need comprehensive medical management. This study aimed to evaluate the serum levels of the acute phase protein alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) in cats with FCGS and to examine whether dental extractions contribute to a significant decrease in the systemic inflammatory response at two postoperative time points. RESULTS: AGP serum concentrations in the cats with FCGS were significantly higher at all time points than that in the control groups and were significantly correlated with the global caudal stomatitis score at day 0 but not at day 30 or 60. A significant improvement of some clinical scores, such as perceived comfort and global caudal stomatitis, was observed 60 days after the dental extraction. However, the levels of AGP did not significantly change over time. CONCLUSIONS: Cats with FCGS were more likely to have a systemic inflammatory response compared with age- and dental disease-matched controls.

MERS-CoV is closely related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. Evasion of the innate antiviral response might contribute significantly to MERS-CoV pathogenesis, but the mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we characterized MERS-CoV 4a protein as a novel immunosuppressive factor that antagonizes type I interferon production. MERS-CoV 4a protein contains a double-stranded RNA-binding domain capable of interacting with poly(I  C). Expression of MERS-CoV 4a protein suppressed the interferon production induced by poly(I  C) or Sendai virus. RNA binding of MERS-CoV 4a protein was required for IFN antagonism, a property shared by 4a protein of bat coronavirus HKU5 but not by the counterpart in bat coronavirus HKU4. MERS-CoV 4a protein interacted with PACT in an RNA-dependent manner but not with RIG-I or MDA5. It inhibited PACT-induced activation of RIG-I and MDA5 but did not affect the activity of downstream effectors such as RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, TBK1, and IRF3. Taken together, our findings suggest a new mechanism through which MERS-CoV employs a viral double-stranded RNA-binding protein to circumvent the innate antiviral response by perturbing the function of cellular double-stranded RNA-binding protein PACT. PACT targeting might be a common strategy used by different viruses, including Ebola virus and herpes simplex virus 1, to counteract innate immunity. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging and highly lethal human pathogen. Why MERS-CoV causes severe disease in human is unclear, and one possibility is that MERS-CoV is particularly efficient in counteracting host immunity, including the sensing of virus invasion. It will therefore be critical to clarify how MERS-CoV cripples the host proteins that sense viruses and to compare MERS-CoV with its ancestral viruses in bats in the counteraction of virus sensing. This work not only provides a new understanding of the abilities of MERS-CoV and closely related bat viruses to subvert virus sensing but also might prove useful in revealing new strategies for the development of vaccines and antivirals.","output":"Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus 4a protein is a double-stranded RNA-binding protein that suppresses PACT-induced activation of RIG-I and MDA5 in the innate antiviral response."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Taking a social identity approach to health behaviors, this research examines whether experimentally activating the human identity is an effective public-health strategy to curb the spread of COVID-19.

Some of the biological effects of nicotine are well documented in in vitro and in vivo systems; however, data are scarce concerning the time-dependent changes on protein and phosphorylation events in response to nicotine. Here, we profiled the proteomes of SH-SY5Y and A549 cell lines subjected to acute (15 min, 1 h and 4 h) or chronic (24 h, 48 h) nicotine exposures. We used sample multiplexing (TMTpro16) and quantified more than 9000 proteins and over 7000 phosphorylation events per cell line. Among our findings, we determined a decrease in mitochondrial protein abundance for SH-SY5Y, while we detected alterations in several immune pathways, such as the complement system, for A549 following nicotine treatment. We also explored the proposed association between smoking (specifically nicotine) and SARS-CoV2. Here, we found several host proteins known to interact with viral proteins that were affected by nicotine in a time dependent manner. This dataset can be mined further to investigate the potential role of nicotine in different biological contexts. SIGNIFICANCE: Smoking is a major public health issue that is associated with several serious chronic, yet preventable diseases, including stroke, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and susceptibility to infection. Tobacco smoke is a complex mixture of thousands of different compounds, among which nicotine is the main addictive compound. The biological effects of nicotine have been reported in several models, however very little data are available concerning the temporal proteomic and phosphoproteomic changes in response to nicotine.

Due to the severity of this condition, it is estimated that over 11 million people die from sepsis each year. Despite intensive research in the field, there is still no specific therapy for sepsis. Many sepsis patients show a marked deficiency of vitamin C. 9 out of 10 sepsis patients have a hypovitaminosis C, and every third patient even shows a clinical deficiency in the scurvy range. In addition, low vitamin C levels of intensive care sepsis patients correlate with a higher need for vasopressors, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, and increased mortality. Based on this observation and the conducted clinical trials using vitamin C as sepsis therapy in intensive care patients, the aim of the present ex vivo study was to evaluate the effects of high-dose vitamin C alone and in a triple combination supplemented with vitamin B1 (thiamine) and hydrocortisone on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy human donors. We found that all corticosteroid combinations strongly reduced the cytokine response on RNA- and protein levels, while high-dose vitamin C alone significantly diminished the PBMC mediated secretion of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-10, IL-23, and monocyte chemo-attractant protein (MCP-1), which mediate the inflammatory response. However, vitamin C showed no enhancing effect on the secretion of further cytokines studied. This data provides important insights into the possible immunomodulatory function of vitamin C in an ex vivo setting of human PBMCs and the modulation of their cytokine profile in the context of sepsis. Since vitamin C is a vital micronutrient, the restoration of physiologically adequate concentrations should be integrated into routine sepsis therapy, and the therapeutic effects of supraphysiological concentrations of vitamin C in sepsis patients should be further investigated in clinical trials.","output":"Ex Vivo Evaluation of the Sepsis Triple Therapy High-Dose Vitamin C in Combination with Vitamin B1 and Hydrocortisone in a Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exploring the protein-folding problem has been a long-standing challenge in molecular biology.

COVID-19 infects the host by the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2r), which is expressed in endothelial cells too. Thus, COVID-related thrombotic events might be due to endothelial dysfunction. IL-6 is one of the main cytokines involved in the COVID-19 inflammatory storm. Some evidence indicates that Vitamin D (VitD) has a protective role in COVID-19 patients, but the molecular mechanisms involved are still debated. Thus, we investigated the effect of VitD on Tissue Factor and adhesion molecules (CAMs) in IL-6-stimulated endothelial cells (HUVEC). Moreover, we evaluated levels of the ACE2r gene and proteins. Finally, we studied the modulation of NF-kB and STAT3 pathways. Methods: HUVEC cultivated in VitD-enriched medium were stimulated with IL-6 (0.5 ng/mL). The TF gene (RT-PCR), protein (Western blot), surface expression (FACS) and procoagulant activity (FXa generation assay) were measured. Similarly, CAMs soluble values (ELISA) and ACE2r (RT-PCR and Western blot) levels were assessed. NF-kB and STAT3 modulation (Western blot) were also investigated. Results: VitD significantly reduced TF expression at both gene and protein levels as well as TF-procoagulant activity in IL-6-treated HUVEC. Similar effects were observed for CAMs and ACE2r expression. IL-6 modulates these effects by regulating NF-B and STAT3 pathways. Conclusions: IL-6 induces endothelial dysfunction with TF and CAMs expression via upregulation of ACE2r. VitD prevented these IL-6 deleterious effects. Thus, it might be speculated that this is one of the hypothetical mechanism(s) by which VitD exerts its beneficial effects in COVID-19 infection.","output":"Vitamin D Inhibits IL-6 Pro-Atherothrombotic Effects in Human Endothelial Cells: A Potential Mechanism for Protection against COVID-19 Infection?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A liquid chromatographic method was developed for the simultaneous quantification of four major active components in tobacco (Nicotiana tobaccum L.) wastes.

DESIGN: This mixed methods study used the Medical Research Council framework for process evaluations of complex interventions. SETTING: This study was set in disadvantaged communities in urban Agra, rural Uttar Pradesh and tribal Jharkhand in India. PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from 86 facilitators, implementers, parents and teens who participated in the Parwarish intervention among 239 families. INTERVENTION: Couples from target communities facilitated groups of parents and teens over the 14-module structured, interactive Parwarish intervention which focused on building communication, reducing harsh parenting and building family budgeting skills. OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed relevance, acceptability and feasibility of the intervention using mixed methods. Qualitative data collected included semistructured interviews and focus group discussions with implementers, facilitators, parents and young people who were transcribed, translated and thematically analysed to develop themes inherent in the data. Quantitative data which assessed attendance, fidelity to the intervention and facilitator training and coaching were analysed descriptively. RESULTS: Findings were grouped under the three domains of facilitation, community engagement and programme support with the following seven themes: (1) community-based facilitators increased contextual validity of the intervention; (2) gender relations were not only influenced by Parwarish implementation but were also influenced and transformed by Parwarish; (3) facilitator responsiveness to group concerns increased participation; (4) participation gathered momentum; (5) Parwarishs strong core and porous periphery allowed adaptations to local contexts; (6) technology that included Skype and WhatsApp enhanced implementation and (7) critical reflection with community trained coaches strengthened facilitation quality and programme fidelity. CONCLUSION: This study found Parwarish engaging, feasible and acceptable in three diverse, low-income communities, although constrained by patriarchal gender relations.

Therefore, it is necessary to identify and catalogue the potentially emerging zoonotic viruses that are carried by rodents. Here, viral metagenomic sequencing was used for zoonotic virus detection and virome characterization on 32 Great gerbils of Rhombomys opimus, Meriones meridianus, and Meiiones Unguiculataus species in Xinjiang, Northwest China. In total, 1848 viral genomes that are potentially pathogenic to rodents and humans, as well as to other wildlife, were identified namely Retro-, Flavi-, Pneumo-, Picobirna-, Nairo-, Arena-, Hepe-, Phenui-, Rhabdo-, Calici-, Reo-, Corona-, Orthomyxo-, Peribunya-, and Picornaviridae families. In addition, a new genotype of rodent Hepacivirus was identified in heart and lung homogenates of seven viscera pools and phylogenetic analysis revealed the closest relationship to rodent Hepacivirus isolate RtMm-HCV/IM2014 that was previously reported to infect rodents from Inner Mongolia, China. Moreover, nine new genotype viral sequences that corresponded to Picobirnaviruses (PBVs), which have a bi-segmented genome and belong to the family Picobirnaviridae, comprising of three segment I and six segment II sequences, were identified in intestines and liver of seven viscera pools. In the two phylogenetic trees that were constructed using ORF1 and ORF2 of segment I, the three segment I sequences were clustered into distinct clades. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis showed that PBV sequences were distributed in the whole tree that was constructed using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of segment II with high diversity, sharing 68.42C82.67% nucleotide identities with other genogroup I and genogroup II PBV strains based on the partial RdRp gene. By RNA sequencing, we found a high degree of biodiversity of Retro-, Flavi-, Pneumo-, and Picobirnaridae families and other zoonotic viruses in gerbils, indicating that zoonotic viruses are a common presence in gerbils from Xinjiang, China. Therefore, further research is needed to determine the zoonotic potential of these viruses that are carried by other rodent species from different ecosystems and wildlife in general.","output":"Metagenome-Assembled Viral Genomes Analysis Reveals Diversity and Infectivity of the RNA Virome of Gerbillinae Species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cryptocurrency history begins in 2008 as a means of payment proposal.

METHODS We tested a nonmyeloablative regimen of mAb S5 and 200 cGy TBI with postgrafting MMF/CSP in 44 DLA-haploidentical recipients using eight different regimens. Ten dogs also received escalating doses of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) alone or with pentostatin to convert to complete donor chimerism. RESULTS All dogs achieved initial engraftment between one to two weeks after HCT with peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) donor chimerism ranging from 2% to 98% (median 37%) on day +35. Twenty-five (57%) dogs rejected their donor grafts at a median of seven (range; 1-19) weeks after HCT. Low levels of PBMC donor chimerism at three weeks predicted graft rejection. DLI neither facilitated conversion to full donor chimerism after HCT nor prevented rejection. Higher total nucleated cells, CD4+, CD8+, and CD14+ cell subset numbers in the PBMC graft were associated with stable full donor engraftment. Dogs given higher cell subset doses of infused PBMC achieved longer duration of mixed chimerism. CONCLUSIONS Nonmyeloablative conditioning with 200 cGy TBI and anti-CD44 mAb was sufficient for initial uniform engraftment across DLA haplotype-mismatched barriers. However, sustained donor engraftment was seen in only 43% of recipients. Graft composition and donor-dominant chimerism early after HCT may be the most important factors for sustained donor engraftment.","output":"Dog leukocyte antigen-haploidentical stem cell allografts after anti-CD44 therapy and nonmyeloablative conditioning in a preclinical canine model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The resonance-point for Comirnaty is shown and a possible therapy for post-COVID-problems is given.","output":"DER RESONANZPUNKT VON COVID-19 AM OHRL?PPCHEN UND THERAPIEVORSCHLAG"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in marked as the highest pathogenic coronavirus that has crossed from the hosts to the human population in the twenty-first century.

While the pandemic lockdown can be distressing, times of crisis can also provide people with the opportunity to think divergently and explore different activities. Novelty seeking, where individuals explore novel and unfamiliarly stimuli and environments, may enhance the creativity of individuals to solve problems in a way that allows them to adjust their emotional responses to stressful situations. This study employs a longitudinal design to investigate changes in novelty seeking and mental health outcomes (namely, stress, anxiety, and depression) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, among a group of students (final N = 173; M(age) = 19.81; SD(age) = 0.98; 135 females and 38 males) from a university in southeast China. Participants were surveyed at three points: November, 2019 (prior to the COVID-19 pandemic); between February and March, 2020 (during the peak of the pandemic and intense lockdown in China); and between May and June, 2020 (after lockdown had been lifted in China). Cross-sectionally, correlation analysis indicated that greater novelty seeking was associated with lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression at all three time points. Univariate latent curve modeling (LCM) indicated a growth trajectory in which novelty seeking increased over time and then remained high during the post-lockdown period. Stress, anxiety, and depression all showed V-shaped growth trajectories in which these variables decreased during lockdown, before increasing in the post-lockdown period. Multivariate LCM indicated the growth trajectory for novelty seeking was associated with the growth trajectories for stress, anxiety, and depression. This suggests that the observed decreases in stress, anxiety, and depression during the lockdown period may be attributable to the samples observed increase in novelty seeking. These findings are valuable in that they challenge the notion that lockdown measures are inherently detrimental to mental health. The findings indicate the important role of novelty seeking in responding to crises. It may be possible for future public health measures to incorporate the promotion of novelty seeking to help individuals respond to stressful situations and maintain good mental health in the face of crises.","output":"Novelty Seeking and Mental Health in Chinese University Students Before, During, and After the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown: A Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: As of April 5, 2020, the World Health Organization reported over one million confirmed cases and more than 62,000 confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) deaths affecting 204 countries/regions.

We intend to investigate the adjusted effects of the HLA-DRB1 alleles and socioeconomic determinants including gross domestic product per capita (GDP cap) and health expenditure per capita (HE cap) in fatality of COVID-19 during the early phase of epidemic in a group of countries. METHODS: As an ecological study, early exposure to epidemics was defined as having more than 5000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from 1 March 2020 to 1 April 2020. Poisson regression was used to report adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) for case fatality rate in this constant time period. RESULTS: Fourteen countries were eligible. Among the alleles, DR7 showed the strongest risk factor (IRR=112.535, P<0.001). Having GDP cap more than 40000$ or having HE cap more than 3000$ was a protecting factor (IRR=0.899, P<0.001, adjusted with allele DR7). Having GDP cap more than 40000$ along with having HE cap more than 3000$ was a protecting factor (IRR=0.471, P<0.001, adjusted with allele DR7).

Various simulation-based studies have been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of these measures. While those studies unanimously confirm the mitigating effect of social distancing on disease spread, the reported effectiveness varies from 10% to more than 90% reduction in the number of infections. This level of uncertainty is mostly due to the complex dynamics of epidemics and their time-variant parameters. However, real transactional data can reduce uncertainty and provide a less noisy picture of the effectiveness of social distancing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to integrate multiple transactional data sets (GPS mobility data from Google and Apple as well as disease statistics from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) to study the role of social distancing policies in 26 countries and analyze the transmission rate of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic over the course of 5 weeks. METHODS: Relying on the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and official COVID-19 reports, we first calculated the weekly transmission rate (?) of COVID-19 in 26 countries for 5 consecutive weeks. Then, we integrated these data with the Google and Apple mobility data sets for the same time frame and used a machine learning approach to investigate the relationship between the mobility factors and ? values. RESULTS: Gradient boosted trees regression analysis showed that changes in mobility patterns resulting from social distancing policies explain approximately 47% of the variation in the disease transmission rates. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with simulation-based studies, real cross-national transactional data confirms the effectiveness of social distancing interventions in slowing the spread of COVID-19. In addition to providing less noisy and more generalizable support for the idea of social distancing, we provide specific insights for public health policy makers regarding locations that should be given higher priority for enforcing social distancing measures.","output":"No Place Like Home: Cross-National Data Analysis of the Efficacy of Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Now the attention of the whole world is focused on the developing pandemic of the coronavirus infection COVID-19 This article discusses mortality patterns of the deadliest epidemic in the last 120 years - the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 Statistical sources from Italy and the USA, published shortly after the pandemic, were analyzed The analysis was carried out for mortality from all causes, since in this case inaccuracies associated with establishing the causes of death are minimized Despite the fact that the first cases of the Spanish flu appeared in the United States as early as March 1918, this first wave of epidemic practically did not affect the total mortality rate The main peak of mortality in 1918 occurred in October 1918 both in the USA and Italy, with a gradual decrease in mortality over several months Analysis of age-specific mortality demonstrates a significant increase in mortality at middle ages (20-50 years) in 1918 compared with 1917 Analysis of mortality trends using the method of latent variables shows a significant increase in the background mortality factor in 1918, which turned out to be higher for Italy than the mortality losses during the Second World War The Spanish flu pandemic differs from the current coronavirus pandemic, because of significant increase in mortality of middle-aged people, while the COVID-19 pandemic causes a more marked increase in mortality among the elderly With this, the COVID-19 pandemic is more like the recent flu epidemics than the earlier Spanish flu pandemic","output":"Patterns of mortality during pandemic: An example of Spanish flu pandemic of 1918"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Police organisations have a wealth of experience in responding to emergencies, but COVID-19 is unprecedented in terms of the speed, scale and complexity of developing doctrine and its implementation by officers The crisis also threw into sharp relief the fact that police policy and, crucially, practice are always implemented within wider social, political and economic contexts Using online survey data collected from 325 police officers based at forces operating across different UK contexts (cities, conurbations, towns and rural areas), we seek to understand officer experiences and perceptions of policing COVID-19 In particular, we examine whether (internally) organisational climate and (externally) the UK governments response to COVID-19 were important to (a) officers support for police use of force at times of emergency, (b) officers support for procedurally just policing at times of emergency, and (c) their health and well-being;and whether identification and perceptions of self-legitimacy mediate the associations between these variables We show that a positive organisational climate was associated with less support for police use of force, more support for procedurally just policing and increased police officer health and well-being Our results, however, suggest potential negative correlates of police officer self-legitimacy: higher levels of self-legitimacy were associated with poorer police officer health and well-being and increased support for police use of force These results have important implications for our understanding of police officer well-being and police officers commitment to democratic modes of policing when faced with policing a pandemic [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Policing & Society is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Policing the COVID-19 pandemic: police officer well-being and commitment to democratic modes of policing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug-induced delayed multi-organ hypersensitivity syndrome (DIDMOHS), also known as drug reaction (or rash) with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS), or drug hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS) is a rare, potentially fatal, drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction characterized by cutaneous eruption, fever, lymphadenopathy, hematologic abnormalities, and visceral manifestations. Anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital as well as allopurinol and sulfonamides, are the most common causes of DIDMOHS. Impaired drug detoxification and herpes virus reactivation play a key role in DIDMOHS pathogenesis. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes also contribute.

In this study, we assess the Potential Years of Life Lost (PYLL) to COVID-19 across different regions. METHODS: We used age-group and sex-specific weekly COVID-19 deaths (from January to August 2020) from national primary sources of 17 countries from the C-MOR consortium (Australia, Brazil, Cape Verde, Colombia, Cyprus, France, Georgia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Peru, Norway, England & Wales, Scotland, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United States). PYLL were calculated by summing up the numbers of deaths in each age group multiplied by the remaining years of life up to age 80. Age-standardized PYLL rates (per 100,000 population), using the World (WHO 2000-2025) Standard population as the reference population, were estimated to facilitate comparison across countries. RESULTS: Countries in South America displayed the highest PYLL rates (567-1,377 PYLL/100,000). Countries in Asia & Middle East (besides Kazakhstan), Australia, and some European countries (Georgia, Norway, and Slovenia) observed <50 PYLL/100,000.

KEY MESSAGES: Up to August 2020, COVID-19 was a cause of premature mortality in all the participating countries, with South America and males to be more affected. The timing of the pandemic, seasonal trends, the control measures enforced, and underlying social conditions are probable explanations for the differences observed among countries.","output":"Potential life years lost to COVID-19 in 17 countries during the pandemic period, up to August 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the end of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) caused by the novel coronavirus (2019\\\\nCoV) posed a serious threat to human health and life.

Prevalences and prevalence ratios were estimated according to socio-demographic variables and factors related to family, school, friends, and health. Brazilian adolescents often felt sad (32.4%) and nervous (48.7%). Higher prevalences of these feelings were related to: being female; aged 15C17 year; from families with financial difficulties; having learned little or nothing with remote education; missing friends; having few friends; family disagreements; having regular/bad health before the pandemic; and worsened health and sleep during the pandemic. Higher prevalence of nervousness was also found in adolescents who worked before the pandemic and those who reported lack of concentration and not knowing if they had COVID-19. Sadness and nervousness in Brazilian adolescents is high and the need for action by the government, schools, health services, and parents to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the physical and mental health of adolescents.

As it remains unclear when we will emerge from the shadow of COVID\\\\19, a critical analysis of the evidence base on both the assessment and mitigation of risk is vital for ENT departments worldwide. This article presents a systematic review of the literature examining articles which consider either the quantification of risk or strategies to mitigate risk specifically in the setting of rhinological surgery. DESIGN: Systematic literature review. RESULTS: The literature search yielded a total of 3406 returns with 24 articles meeting eligibility criteria. A narrative synthesis stratified results into two broad themes: (1) those which made an assessment as to the aerosolisation of droplets during sinus surgery, further sub\\\\divided into work which considered macroscopically visible droplets and that which considered smaller particles; (2) and those studies which examined the mitigation of this risk. CONCLUSION: Studies considering the aerosolisation of both droplets and smaller particles suggest endonasal surgery carries significant risk. While results both highlight a range of innovative adjunctive strategies and support suction as an important intervention to reduce aerosolisation, appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be considered mandatory for all healthcare professionals involved in rhinological surgery. Studies have demonstrated that close adherence to PPE use is effective in preventing COVID\\\\19 infection.","output":"One year into the COVID\\\\19 pandemic: What do we know so far from studies assessing risk and mitigation of droplet aerosolisation during endonasal surgery?

In this review, we outline recent advances in HSCT that have made this possible, general setbacks, and their effects on the landscape of HSCT trials in older adults. RECENT FINDINGS Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens and a more physiological approach to transplant candidate selection have given older patients an opportunity to participate in HSCT trials. However, difficulties in allogeneic donor selection, post-transplant complications, and the misalignment of trial goals with patient goals may pose challenges for future trial recruitment and success. While increasing amounts of evidence show that older adults may benefit from participation in HSCT trials, clinicians, investigators, and patients must carefully weigh the benefits with potential repercussions.","output":"Pitfalls and Successes in Trials in Older Transplant Patients with Hematologic Malignancies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Sarcopenia is an emerging disease that adversely impacts outcomes of older adults across the spectrum of fragility fractures. Few studies have examined sarcopenia in upstream fragility fractures such as the distal radius. Understanding the state of current evidence is essential in defining a research agenda in this critical area of sentinel distal radius fractures and sarcopenia. OBJECTIVES The aim of this scoping review was to summarize existing literature on sarcopenia in distal radius fracture in older adults, and to identify research areas and gaps to guide future studies. METHODS We utilized the 5-stage framework of Arksey and O'Malley. We searched studies from 2010 to 2020 relating to ?Sarcopenia? and ?Distal radius fractures? in major databases. Two reviewers independently screened articles for inclusion and conducted full text reviews of shortlisted articles. We extracted data on research areas, key findings, and study limitations. RESULTS Thirteen studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. They covered the areas of epidemiology (N=9), risk factors (N=4), basic science (N=2), outcomes (N=1), and diagnostic modalities (N=1). There were no studies on screening/case finding, prognostic scoring, intervention, or health economics. Identified limitations included the lack of clear definition and diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia, and lack of, or inappropriate, control group. Majority of studies were retrospective or cross-sectional in study design. CONCLUSIONS This scoping review on sarcopenia in distal radius fractures highlighted gaps in research areas and in the rigor of studies conducted, and the need for more prospective cohort and interventional studies. Building upon current consensus criteria, we propose setting a research agenda along the timeline of sarcopenia management, from screening through to intervention and follow-up, which will inform future research in this early disease cohort of fragility fractures.","output":"Sarcopenia in Distal Radius Fractures: A Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The agricultural sector is one of the aspects that was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study aims to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on agroforestry farmers' livelihoods in rural areas. It was carried out in Tasikmalaya Regency, East Priangan, where mixed garden agroforestry farming supports part of the economic life of the community. The data used were collected between August and September 2021 by interviewing 33 farmer households. A coding and descriptive analysis were carried out to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on agroforestry farmers and their strategies. Subsequently, the cost-income, revenue cost ratio, and labor productivity analyses were used to assess the feasibility of agroforestry farming before and during the pandemic. The results showed that government policies related to handling the pandemic in form of Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) and the Implementation of Community Activity Restrictions (PPKM) significantly affected the lives of farmers. These include decreased demand and commodity selling prices, difficulties in marketing agroforestry products, and a decrease in farmers' incomes by 38.45%. The agroforestry business has become less viable due to a reduction in farm productivity from R/C 1.1 before the pandemic to 0.85 during the pandemic, while farmer labor productivity decreased from US$ 3.00 to US$ 2.10. The farmers used direct cash assistance from the government and processed agroforestry products for sale and consumption as a survival strategy during the pandemic. Meanwhile,the government can help agroforestry farmers by increasing road access to rural areas, providing fertilizer and superior seeds, and also optimizing the role of livestock farmer groups.","output":"The Nexus of COVID-19 Pandemic and Rural Agroforestry Farmers' Livelihoods in Tasikmalaya Regency, East Priangan, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had overwhelmed the healthcare system and forced many patients to be treated at home with oxygen, antibiotics, and steroids, particularly during the second wave.

Historically, it has been especially prized during times of crisis. This is clearly demonstrated today as the current Coronavirus crisis is unfolding; there are many different dimensions of flexibility, ranging from versatility, agility, and resilience, to hedging, robustness and liquidity. For convenience, we fuse these terms together under the conceptual umbrella of super-flexibility. We define super-flexibility as a dynamic capability to simultaneously withstand turbulence AND adapt to fluid reality. Our field research has focused on how companies in Silicon Valley embrace uncertainty and drive adaptation.

SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 causing COVID\\\\19 actively replicates in the throat, unlike SARS\\\\CoV, and shows high pharyngeal viral shedding even in patients with mild symptoms of the disease. HCoV\\\\229E is one of four coronaviruses causing the common cold. In this study, the efficacy of ColdZyme? (CZ\\\\MD), a medical device mouth spray, was tested against SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and HCoV\\\\229E in vitro. The CZ\\\\MD provides a protective glycerol barrier containing cod trypsin as an ancillary component. Combined, these ingredients can inactivate common cold viruses in the throat and mouth. The CZ\\\\MD is believed to act on the viral surface proteins that would perturb their entry pathway into cells. The efficacy and safety of the CZ\\\\MD has been demonstrated in clinical trials on the common cold. METHOD OF STUDY: The ability of the CZ\\\\MD to inactivate SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 and HCoV\\\\229E was tested using an in vitro virucidal suspension test (ASTM E1052).

Methods: 322 SARS-COV-2 infection patients were respectively enrolled. The univariable and multivariable analysis were computed to identify the independent predictors of severe progression, and the prediction model was established based on independent predictors. The areas under the ROC curves (AUROCs) were used to evaluate the diagnostic performances. Results: Of 322 confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection patients, 11 were diagnosed as severe cases on admission, 15 developed to severe cases after admission, and 296 were non-severe cases. The multivariable analysis identified age (OR=1.061, p =0.028), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (OR=1.006, p =0.037), and CD4 count (OR=0.993, p =0.006) as the independent predictors of severe progression. Consequently, the age-LDH-CD4 algorithm was derived as (ageLDH)/CD4. The AUROC of the age-LDH-CD4 model was significantly higher than that of single CD4 count, LDH, or age (0.92, 0.85, 0.80, and 0.75, respectively).

The importance of each repetitive DNA type depends on many factors: structural and functional roles, positions, lengths and numbers of these repetitions are clear examples. Conserving such DNA sequences or not in different locations in the chromosome remains a challenge for researchers in biology. Detecting their location despite their great variability and finding novel repetitive sequences remains a challenging task. To side-step this problem, we developed a new method based on signal and image processing tools. In fact, using this method we could find repetitive patterns in DNA images regardless of the repetition length. This new technique seems to be more efficient in detecting new repetitive sequences than bioinformatics tools. In fact, the classical tools present limited performances especially in case of mutations (insertion or deletion). However, modifying one or a few numbers of pixels in the image doesnt affect the global form of the repetitive pattern. As a consequence, we generated a new repetitive patterns database which contains tandem and dispersed repeated sequences. The highly repetitive sequences, we have identified in X and Y chromosomes, are shown to be located in other human chromosomes or in other genomes.

Existing habitat-based models do not consider interspecies pathogen transmission, a primary route for emergence of new infectious diseases and reservoirs in wildlife and man. The modeling of interspecies transmission has the potential to provide more accurate predictions of disease persistence and emergence dynamics. The new models are motivated by our recent work on hantavirus in rodent communities in Paraguay. Our Paraguayan data illustrate the spatial and temporal overlap among rodent species, one of which is the reservoir species for Jabora virus and others which are spillover species. Disease transmission occurs when their habitats overlap. Two mathematical models, a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model, are developed for spread of hantavirus between a reservoir and a spillover species. Analysis of a special case of the ODE model provides an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number, ?(0), such that if ?(0) < 1, then the pathogen does not persist in either population but if ?(0) > 1, pathogen outbreaks or persistence may occur. Numerical simulations of the CTMC model display sporadic disease incidence, a new behavior of our habitat-based model, not present in other models, but which is a prominent feature of the seroprevalence data from Paraguay. Environmental changes that result in greater habitat overlap result in more encounters among various species that may lead to pathogen outbreaks and pathogen establishment in a new host.","output":"A Habitat-Based Model for the Spread of Hantavirus Between Reservoir and Spillover Species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has convulsed human communities across the globe like no previous event in history.

Sensitivity increased to 74.6%, 66.2%, 66.2% and 64.8% for Exdia, Standard Q(?), Panbio(TM) and BD Veritor?, respectively, for viral loads above 10(5) copies/mL, to 100%, 97.8%, 96.6% and 95.6% for viral loads above 10(6) copies/mL and 100% for viral loads above 10(7) copies/mL. Sensitivity was significantly higher for patients with symptoms onset within four days (74.3%, 69.2%, 69.2% and 64%, respectively) versus patients with the evolution of symptoms longer than four days (36.8%, 21.1%, 21.1% and 23.7%, respectively). Among COVID-19 asymptomatic patients, sensitivity was 33%. All Immunoglobulin-A-positive patients resulted negative for RAT. The RAT might represent a useful resource in selected clinical settings as a complementary tool in RT-PCR for rapid patient triaging, but the lower sensitivity, especially in late presenters and COVID-19 asymptomatic subjects, must be taken into account.","output":"Implementing SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Testing in the Emergency Ward of a Swiss University Hospital: The INCREASE Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Book reviewed in this article: Dogs and Cats in the Urban Environment:AHandbook of Municipal Pet Management, 2nd edition, RW Murray and HE Penridge Consultations in Feline Internal Medicine 3, JR August, WB Saunders Co, Distributed by Harcourt Brace Co Animal Health Strategies, B Jones, FT Pharmaceuticals & Healthcare Publishing","output":"BOOK REVIEWS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and inflammasomes are a key part of the anti-viral innate immune system as they detect conserved viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). A successful host response to viral infections critically depend on the initial activation of PRRs by viruses, mainly by viral DNA and RNA. The signalling pathways activated by PRRs leads to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, to recruit immune cells, and type I and type III interferons which leads to the induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISG), powerful virus restriction factors that establish the \\"antiviral state\\". Inflammasomes contribute to anti-viral responses through the maturation of interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18 and through triggering pyroptotic cell death. The activity of the innate immune system along with the adaptive immune response normally leads to successful virus elimination, although disproportionate innate responses contribute to viral pathology. In this review we will discuss recent insights into the influence of PRR activation and inflammasomes on viral infections and what this means for the mammalian host. We will also comment on how specific PRRs and inflammasomes may be relevant to how SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic, interacts with host innate immunity.","output":"Detection of Viral Infections by Innate Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses particular challenges for migrant workers around the world.

Preliminary evidences from literature have shown that obesity is a risk factor for higher mortality occurrence.Thus, we wanted to assess the nutritional status of patients admitted to our COVID-19 Unit. We aimed also to verify the possible correlation between nutritional status, inflammatory status and mortality. Method(s): we prospectively studied patients admitted to the COVID-19 Unit of San Benedetto General hospital. All the patients had biochemical, antropometric, HRCT chest scan and nutritional assessments at the time of admission and, at 15 days interval follow-up. Result(s): we studied 65 consecutive patients (mean age 65.8+/-2.5 years, BMI 23.2 Kg/m2). Main comorbidities were: diabetes (type 1 6%, type 2 35%), hypertension (45%), chronic ischemic heart disease (22 %), COPD (22%), anxiety (30%) and depression (20%). Moderate to severe overweight was present in 13% of patients;Onodera index (23.000+/-0.976), suggestive of malnutrition, was present in 20% of patients. Both PCR (C-reactive protein) and IL-6 values significantly correlated with worse radiologic pneumonitis progression (r=0.79 and r=0-72, respectively). After 15 days upon admission, we recorded 6 deaths (mean age 75.5+/-3.1 years, BMI 26.0 Kg/m2). Increased PCR and IL-6 values significantly correlated with exitus occurrence (r=0.78 and 0.75, respectively). Moreover, both overweight and malnutrition significantly correlated with exitus occurrence (r= 0.67 and r=0.70, respectively). Conclusion(s): we confirmed that higher inflammatory indexes significantly correlate with both worse radiological findings and fatal COVID-19 evolution. Interestingly, overweight and malnutrition, but not diabetes, significantly correlated with mortality. These results, if confirmed by larger perspective studies, can suggest a role for systemic micro-inflammation, related to both obesity and malnutrition, in worse disease evolution.

These environmental and socio-political stressors have been accompanied by the spread of problematic psychological and behavioural tendencies, such as the growing polarisation of opinions and values, online radicalisation and extremism, deepening xenophobia and nationalism, the proliferation of irrational beliefs and conspiracy theories, and resistance to rational public policy measures. Here we argue that although they fall outside the scope of psychopathology, they nevertheless currently constitute a major challenge for psychiatry as a research domain and a clinical practise. To substantiate this claim, we outline the mechanisms by which media-transmitted stressors impact mental well-being and possibly psychopathology. The common denominator of these global problems and the media's construction of reality is the increase in uncertainty, unpredictability, and uncontrollability, which prompts defensive responding and, in predisposed individuals, functions as a potent source of chronic stress. These contribute to cognitive inflexibility, a strong predisposing factor for the development of rigid beliefs and attitudes, which to varying degrees underlie the adverse psychological and behavioural tendencies mentioned above. We suggest that the tightening of beliefs and ideas that is the result of cognitive rigidity may correspond to the clinical characteristics of induced delusional disorder. This can be seen as a (ultimately maladaptive) defensive strategy for coping with a high degree of uncertainty and unpredictability.

There is a paucity of reports of heart transplantation in this challenging and growing subset of patients from our part of the world. The purpose of the article is to briefly review our experience in the subgroup and compare it with the available literature. METHODS: This was a single-institution retrospective observational study of 16 patients with single ventricle physiology who were transplanted between 2016 and 2019 and their outcomes. The study groups were divided into those with ventricular dysfunction (group 1), who fare substantially better than those with normal ventricular function (group 2) whose short-term outcomes were poorer. Worsening cyanosis, poor candidature for completion Fontan procedure due to severe atrioventricular valve regurgitation or pulmonary artery anatomy, protein-losing enteropathy, plastic bronchitis, and worsening systemic venous congestion are indications in those with normal ventricular function. RESULTS: Patients with ventricular dysfunction as the main indication had excellent early survival with no early mortality compared to 40% mortality in patients with normal ventricular function. Patients who survived to leave the hospital had however similar long-term outcomes. Two patients with protein-losing enteropathy resolved completely by one month. Normal ventricular function, pulmonary artery stenting, early Fontan failure (6 months), ascites, and need for desensitization were risk factors for early mortality. After the early acute phase of increased risk, the mortality risk plateaued off. CONCLUSION: Transplantation in patients with single ventricle and ventricular dysfunction can be offered with a good early and late outcome.

In this work, using the porcine long bones, the 3-point bending tests were conducted to explore the bone fracture behaviors under the rigid impactor. The bone fracture dynamic process was recorded by high-speed photography and the fracture surface profile was observed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Based on the CT scanning, their cross-section properties were calculated by a homemade MATLAB script for correlating with their strengths. Also, a subject-specific finite element (FE) model was developed to identify the influence on simulation. Findings led to conclusions as follows: 1) The tension fracture came with fracture path deflection, which was caused by the bone indentation induced mesoscale crack-opening. Due to this damage before the whole bone fracture, a bone fracture moment correction was defined to compensate experimental data. 2) The plastic indentation caused the impact force fluctuation. 3) The bone failure moment is higher correlated with the inertial moment of the bone cross-section than the traditional cross-section area. 4) In the subject-specific simulation, the indentation caused compression fracture and a much lower failure force. To reject the element erosion on impact location during only validation was verified as a good option to solve this issue.","output":"Study On the Long Bone Failure Behaviors Under the Impactor Rigid-Contact by Experiment Analysis and Subject-Specific Simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The preclinical stages of dementia include subtle neurocognitive changes that are not easily detected in standard clinical evaluations. Neuropsychological evaluation is important for the classification and prediction of deterioration in all the phases of dementia.

METHODS: We evaluated 94 older adults with a clinical protocol which included general measures of mental, emotional and functional state. The neuropsychological protocol included tasks of memory, executive function, attention, verbal fluency and visuoconstructional abilities. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce variables dimensionality on neuropsychological evaluation. RESULTS: 33(35%) participants had a normal cognitive function, 35(37%) had subjective cognitive decline and 26(28%) had a mild cognitive impairment. The PCA showed seven factors: processing speed, memory, visuoconstruction, verbal fluency and executive components of cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control and working memory. ANOVA had shown significant differences between the groups in the memory (F=4.383, p=0.016, 2p=0.087) and visuoconstructional components (F=5.395, p=0.006, 2p=0.105). Post hoc analysis revealed lower memory scores in MCI than SCD participants and in visuospatial abilities between MCI and SCD and MCI and Normal participants.

METHODS Reported cases of xenobiotic exposures from 1 March to 30 April in 2018, 2019, and 2020 were extracted from the French National Database of Poisonings. The collected data included call, patient, and exposure characteristics for both general calls and for calls involving sentinel xenobiotic categories related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 exposures were compared to 2018-2019 exposures by using simple logistic models in order to provide effect size with odds ratios. RESULTS From March to April 2020, 32,182 exposures were reported to French PCCs with an overall increase of 5.6% compared to exposures in the same time frame in 2018-2019. A similar increase in calls was observed in non-epidemic and epidemic COVID-19 areas with an increase in calls from the public (+13.6%) while calls from health-professionals decreased (-7.5%). Despite the increase in exposures, the incidence of symptomatic exposures remained stable (-0.4%) with a decrease in severity (moderate/severe -17.2%). A significant increase in exposures to home cleaning products containing biocides, essential oils, and alcohol-based hand sanitizers (odds ratio >1.3, p < .0001) was observed.

The multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted to examine the association between SBP and clinical outcomes. Restricted cubic splines were used to examine the non-linear associations. RESULTS: The 4,564 patients had a mean age of 65.3  13.5 years and 37.9% were female. The average SBP was 123.2  19.0 mmHg. One-year all-cause death and HF readmission were 16.9 and 32.7%, respectively. After adjustment, patients with SBP < 110 mmHg had a higher risk of all-cause death compared with those with SBP of 130C139 mmHg (HR 1.71; 95% CI: 1.32C2.20). Patients with SBP < 110 mmHg (HR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.14C1.64) and SBP  150 mmHg (HR 1.26; 95% CI: 1.01C1.58) had a higher risk of HF readmission, and the association between SBP and HF readmission followed a J-curve relationship with the nadir SBP around 130 mmHg. These associations were consistent regardless of age, sex, left ventricular ejection fraction, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and medications for HF. CONCLUSION: In patients hospitalized for HF, lower SBP in a stable phase during hospitalization portends an increased risk of 1-year death, and a J-curve association has been observed between SBP and 1-year HF readmission. These associations were consistent among clinically important subgroups.","output":"Systolic Blood Pressure and 1-Year Clinical Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized for Heart Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a key role in downregulation of RIG-I pathways and interacts with 40 S ribosome. Recently, the cryo-EM structure in complex with 40S ribosome is deciphered. However, the structure of full length NSP1 without any partner has not been studies. Also, the conformation of NSP1-C terminal region in isolation is not been studied. In this study, we have investigated the conformational dynamics of NSP1C-terminal region (NSP1-CTR; amino acids 130-180) in isolation and under different solvent environments. The NSP1-CTR is found to be intrinsically disordered in aqueous solution. Further, we used alpha helix inducer, trifluoroethanol, and found induction of alpha helical conformation using CD spectroscopy. Additionally, in the presence of SDS, NSP1-CTR is showing a conformational change from disordered to ordered, possibly gaining alpha helix in part. But in presence of neutral lipid DOPC, a slight change in conformation is observed. This implies the possible role of hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction on the conformational changes of NSP1. The changes in structural conformation were further studied by fluorescence-based studies, which showed significant blue shift and fluorescence quenching in the presence of SDS and TFE. Lipid vesicles also showed fluorescence-based quenching. In agreement to these result, fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence anisotropy decay suggests a change in conformational dynamics. The zeta potential studies further validated that the conformational dynamics is mostly because of hydrophobic interaction. In last, these experimental studies were complemented through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation which have also shown a good correlation and testify our experiments. We believe that the intrinsically disordered nature of the NSP1-CTR will have implications in disorder based binding promiscuity with its interacting proteins.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 C-terminal region (residues 130-180) is an intrinsically disordered region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is triggered by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and has rapidly developed into a worldwide pandemic.

This occurrence has been rarely reported in the literature and described only in very few case reports. During the surge of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in our region, we noted an increase in the simultaneous occurrence of cardio-cerebral infarction. This led us to explore the possible mechanisms and pathophysiology that could contribute to this increase. The retrospective nature of the study limited us from drawing any conclusion about causation. Rather, we aimed to formulate a hypothesis for future, more rigorous studies. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present an overview of 5 cases of simultaneous cardio-cerebral infarction that we encountered in our emergency department within 1 month. DIAGNOSIS: In all cases, diagnosis was confirmed using an electrocardiogram, assessment of laboratory cardiac markers, and imaging. INTERVENTIONS: In all cases, dual antiplatelet therapy was started and thrombolysis was held, as the condition was considered high risk in most of the patients. Cardiac catheterization lab was not activated either because the patient was unstable or the risk of COVID-19 in staff outweighed the benefit added in patient treatment. OUTCOMES: Two out of 5 patients died because of early complications that lasted for few days. The remaining 3 were discharged from the hospital in moderate functionality for extensive therapy and rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: Early recognition and immediate treatment is important in different scenarios leading to thrombosis as the outcome. Additionally, addressing the unknown risks that could contribute to our traditional understanding of these causative mechanisms is important. The hypothesis of exacerbated damage caused by inflammatory and immunological endothelial systemic damage should further be explored to be able to delineate new possibilities in managing these conditions.","output":"Simultaneous cardio-cerebral infarction in the coronavirus disease pandemic era: A case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Malaysia, the shifting balance between market and state has many nuances. Never a significant welfare state in the usual mold, the Malaysian state nonetheless has been a dominant social and economic presence dictated by its affirmative action-type policies, which eventually metamorphosed into state-led indigenous capitalism. Privatisation is also intimately linked with emergence of an indigenous bourgeoisie with favored access to the vast accumulation of state assets and prerogatives. Internationally, it is conditioned by the fluid relationships of converging alliances and contested compromise with international capital, including transnational health services industries. As part of its vision of a maturing, diversified economy, the Malaysian government is fostering a private-sector advanced health care industry to cater to local demand and also aimed at regional and international patrons. The assumption is that, as disposable incomes increase, a market for such services is emerging and citizens can increasingly shoulder their own health care costs. The government would remain the provider for the indigent. But the key assumption remains: the growth trajectory will see the emergence of markets for an increasingly affluent middle class.

METHOD: TriNetX, a large research network, is used to collect real-time electronic medical data. Data on utilization of acute ischemic stroke service was collected for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 for variables including overall stroke volume and the number of patients that received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and mechanical thrombectomy (MT). RESULT: We found a 13.2C15.4% decrease in total number of AIS patients in 2020 (n 77231) compared with the years 2018 and 2019 (n 88948 and 91270 respectively, p ?< ?0.001). In the year 2020 Stroke volume was significantly lower in Q4 comparing to Q1 (Q1 vs Q4, p ?< ?0.01, while there were no significant differences in stroke volume between Quarters 2, 3, and 4 in 2020 (Q2 vs Q3, p ?= ?0.39, Q2 vs Q4, p ?= ?0.61, Q3 vs Q4, p ?= ?0.18).

We aimed to examine the periprocedural outcomes of PFO closure retrospectively, using fluoroscopic guidance in patients with cryptogenic stroke, with provisional ICE guidance driven by anatomic and procedural factors. METHODS A retrospective chart review of consecutive patients who underwent PFO closure in a single centre using the Amplatzer PFO occluder (AGA Medical Corporation, Plymouth, Minnesota) for cryptogenic stroke was conducted. Outcomes analyzed included procedural data, periprocedural complications, length of stay, and factors contributing to the use of intraprocedural imaging. RESULTS Between 2006 and 2017, 467 patients underwent PFO closure for cryptogenic stroke with the Amplatzer PFO occluder; 381 patients underwent closure with fluoroscopy alone, and 86 with ICE and fluoroscopic guidance. Periprocedural arrhythmic complications occurred in 1.3% in the fluoroscopy group and 1.2% in the ICE group (P = 1.000). Vascular complications occurred in 0.5% in the fluoroscopy group and 2.3% (P = 0.323) in the ICE group. One device embolized requiring surgical intervention. There was no in-hospital mortality or stroke. Same-day discharge occurred in 97.6% of patients. CONCLUSION Our single-centre experience suggests that PFO closure can be safely conducted under fluoroscopic guidance alone with provisional adjunctive ICE use limited to specific anatomic situations.","output":"Periprocedural Outcomes of Fluoroscopy-Guided Patent Foramen Ovale Closure With Selective Use of Intracardiac Echocardiography."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents results from a comparative and qualitative discourse-historical analysis of governmental crisis communication in Austria, Germany, France, Hungary and Sweden, during the global COVID-19 pandemic lockdown from March 2020 to May 2020 (a discourse strand). By analysing a sample of important speeches and press conferences by government leaders (all performing as the face of crisis management), it is possible to deconstruct a range of discursive strategies announcing/legitimising restrictive measures in order to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic where everybody is in danger of falling ill, regardless of their status, position, education and so forth. I focus on four frames that have been employed to mitigate the dread of death (Bauman, 2006) and counter the denial of death (Becker, 1973/2020): a religious frame, a dialogic frame, a frame emphasising trust, and a frame of leading a war. These interpretation frameworks are all embedded in renationalising tendencies, specifically visible in the EU member states where even the Schengen Area was suddenly abolished (in order to keep the virus out) and borders were closed.

We report characteristics of COVID-19 cases and vaccination status in ofatumumab-treated relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) patients. METHODS: COVID-19 data analyzed were from the ongoing, open-label, long-term extension phase 3b ALITHIOS study from December 2019 (pandemic start) and post-marketing cases from August 2020 (ofatumumab first approval) up to 25 September 2021. COVID-19 cases, severity, seriousness, outcomes, vaccination status, and breakthrough infection were evaluated. RESULTS: As of 25 September 2021, 245 of 1703 patients (14.3%) enrolled in ALITHIOS receiving ofatumumab (median exposure: 2.45 years) reported COVID-19 (confirmed: 210; suspected: 35). Most COVID-19 was of mild (44.1%) or moderate (46.5%) severity, but 9% had severe/life-threatening COVID-19. There were 24 serious cases (9.8%) with 23 patients were hospitalized; 22 recovered and 2 died. At study cut-off, 241 patients (98.4%) had recovered or were recovering or had recovered with sequelae and 2 (0.8%) had not recovered. Ofatumumab was temporarily interrupted in 39 (15.9%) patients. Before COVID-19 onset, IgG levels were within the normal range in all COVID-19Caffected patients, while IgM was < 0.4 g/l in 23 (9.4%) patients. No patient had a reinfection. Overall, 559 patients were vaccinated (full, 476; partial, 74; unspecified, 9). Breakthrough infection was reported in 1.5% (7/476) patients, and 11 reported COVID-19 after partial vaccination. As of 25 September 2021, the Novartis Safety Database (~ 4713 patient-treatment years) recorded 90 confirmed COVID-19 cases receiving ofatumumab. Most cases were non-serious (n = 80), and ten were serious (1 medically significant, 9 hospitalized, 0 deaths). Among 36 of 90 cases with outcomes reported, 30 recovered and 6 did not recover. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 in RMS patients on ofatumumab was primarily of mild/moderate severity and non-serious in these observational data. Most recovered from COVID-19 without treatment interruption. Two people died with COVID-19. Breakthrough COVID-19 despite being fully/partially vaccinated was uncommon.

The aim of this study was to examine the presence and significance of bacteria and viruses in the upper respiratory tract of healthcare workers (HCWs), and association with respiratory symptoms. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in China and 223 HCWs were recruited from fever clinics and respiratory, paediatric, emergency/Intensive medication wards. Participants were followed over 4 weeks (7th May 2015 to 4th June 2015) for development of clinical respiratory illness (CRI). Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained at baseline and at the end of the study. The primary endpoints were laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonisation and viral respiratory infection. Rates of the following infections in symptomatic and asymptomatic participants were compared at the start or end of the study; 1) all bacterial/viral infections, 2) bacterial infection and bacterial-viral co-infections, excluding virus only infections, and 3) only bacterial infections. RESULTS: Bacterial colonisation was identified in 88% (196/223) of participants at the start or end of the study. Among these participants, 66% (148/223) had only bacterial colonisation while 22% (48/223) had co-infection with a virus. Bacteria were isolated from 170 (76.2%) participants at baseline and 127 (57%) participants at the end of the study. Laboratory confirmed viral infections were identified in 53 (23.8%) participants - 35 (15.7%) at the baseline and 20 (9.0%) at the end of the study. CRI symptoms were recorded in 12 participants (4.5%) and all had a positive bacterium isolation at baseline (n = 11) or end of the study (n = 1). Among asymptomatic participants, 187 (87%) had bacterial colonisation or bacterial/viral co-infection at baseline or end of the study. Viruses were also isolated from 5 (2.4%) asymptomatic cases. Rates of all infection outcomes were higher in symptomatic participants, however differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: We isolated high rates of bacteria and viruses in the upper respiratory tract of hospital HCWs, which may reflect greater exposure to respiratory infections in the hospital. Although respiratory infections are mostly symptomatic, the association between bacterial colonization and symptomatic illness is not clear. In the healthcare setting, HCWs may acquire and transmit infection to patients and other HCWs around them.

PEDV is associated with the most severe pathogenesis in one-week-old piglets, with mortality rates reaching 100%. A PEDV strain was isolated from the intestinal tract of diarrheic piglets from a pig farm in Jiangsu Province in March 2016, termed the JS201603 isolate. The isolated virus was confirmed to be PEDV via RT-PCR, electron microscopy, a cytopathic effect assay and sequence analysis. The S and ORF3 genes of the JS201603 isolate were sequenced, revealing that the S gene was associated with a 15-base insertion at 167 nt, 176 - 186 nt, and 427 - 429 nt, as well as a six-base deletion in 487 - 492 nt, indicating that it was a current epidemic variant compared with the classical strain, CV777. No deletion occurred between 245 - 293 nt of the ORF3 gene in the JS201603 isolate compared with the vaccine isolates YY2013 and SQ2014. An experimental infection model indicated that the piglets in the challenge group successively developed diarrhea, exhibiting yellow-colored loose stools with a foul odor. The piglets in the JS201603 isolate challenge group displayed reduced food consumption, lost weight, and in severe cases even died. No abnormalities were observed in the control group. The JS201603 variant isolated in this study contributes to the evolutionary analysis of diarrhea virus.

Long-term glucose control has been recognized as a risk factor for postoperative complications. In the foot and ankle literature, long-term glycemic control as a potential perioperative risk factor is not well studied. Our goal was to investigate whether hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was independently associated with postoperative complications in a retrospective cohort study. METHODS Three hundred twenty-two patients with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus were enrolled in the study to assess risk factors associated with postoperative foot and ankle surgery complications. RESULTS Bivariate analyses showed that HbA1c level and having at least one comorbidity were associated with postoperative infections. However, after adjusting for other covariates, the only significant factor was HbA1c level, with each increment of 1% increasing the odds of infection by a factor of 1.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-1.99). For postoperative wound-healing complications, bivariate analyses showed that body mass index, having at least one comorbidity, and HbA1c level were significant factors. After adjusting for other covariates, the only significant factors for developing postoperative wound complications were having at least one comorbidity (odds ratio, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.22-3.37) and HbA1c level (each 1% increment) (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.02-1.53).

STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed 4 state policies, 2 COVID-related state executive orders, and clinic-level survey data on medication abortion provision from fourteen abortion facilities in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia from December 2019 to December 2020. We calculated the percent of medication abortions provided at these facilities during the study period by state, to assess changes in medication abortion use during the pandemic. RESULTS: We ascertained that COVID-19-executive orders in Ohio and West Virginia that limited procedural abortion in Spring 2020 coincided with an increase in the overall number and proportion of medication abortions in this region, peaking at 1613 medication abortions (70%) in April 2020. Ohio and West Virginia, which had executive orders limiting procedural abortion, saw relatively greater increases in April compared to Kentucky. Despite temporary lifting of the mifepristone REMS, prepandemic regulations banning telemedicine abortion in Kentucky and West Virginia and requiring in-person clinic visits for medication abortion distribution in Ohio limited clinics' ability to adapt to offer medication abortion by mail. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate how restrictive medication and telemedicine abortion policies in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia created additional obstacles for patients seeking medication abortion during the pandemic. Permanently lifting federal regulations on in-clinic distribution of mifepristone would only advantage abortion seekers in states without restrictive telehealth and medication abortion policies. State policies that limit access to comprehensive abortion services should be central in larger efforts toward dismantling barriers that impinge upon reproductive autonomy. IMPLICATION STATEMENT: We find that abolishing the REMS on mifepristone would not be enough to expand access to patients in abortion-restrictive states with telemedicine and medication abortion laws. While the REMS is a barrier, it represents one of several hindrances to the expansion of telemedicine abortion distribution across the United States.","output":"Federal, state, and institutional barriers to the expansion of medication and telemedicine abortion services in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The majority of research on the fear of missing out (FOMO) has focused on understanding how social media posts about attractive unattended experiences taking place in the physical world (e.g., a friend's vacation) influence individuals' affective states. With quarantine measures in place, and in the absence of travel and party photos on social media, do individuals feel they are missing out on enjoyable experiences? The current work shows that FOMO has not disappeared during the pandemic, even when socially distancing at home, but has been replaced by feelings towards new online activities (e.g., online concerts, virtual gatherings). As a consequence, we find that FOMO threatens well-being by causing important psychological and health issues, such as sleep deprivation, loss of focus, declined productivity, and finding relief in knowing that others have difficulty keeping up with abundant digital content.

We searched six electronic databases for studies published from January 1, 2007 through November 30, 2017 (PROSPERO CRD42018084384).

There was limited geographic distribution of the studies, with a paucity of research in several counties and states where HIV incidence/prevalence is a concern.

OBJECTIVE Study responses to a modified HCT, encompassing various body positions and light physical activity, reflecting relevant activities of children during flight, with a view to challenge the evidence of the current cut-off. METHODS Oxygenation, heart rate and ventilation were observed in 34 healthy schoolchildren (17 boys) undergoing a modified HCT, alternating between breathing room air and 15% oxygen in nitrogen while seated, supine, standing and walking at 3 km/h and 5 km/h. RESULTS Nadir SpO2 <90%, median (range), occurred in 9 subjects sitting, 89% (78-89%); 6 supine, 88.5% (87-89%); 9 standing, 89% (85-89%); 23 walking 3 km/h, 87% (74-89%); and 21 walking 5 km/h, 86% (74-89%).

Here, we propose an innovative in situ modification strategy for constructing ultrapure BiVO4 nanosheets on graphene (u-BVG) toward the accelerated photocatalytic water oxidation reaction. Considering the Mott-Schottky heterojunctions at the contact interface in u-BVG, the feasible electron transfer from excited BiVO4 to graphene facilitates the holes to migrate onto the BiVO4 surface for the water oxidation reaction. Compared with the conventional synthesis strategies, our strategy avoids the introduction of Cl impurities. This modification allows for not only a ca. 0.1 eV deeper valence band edge position to generate holes with a stronger oxidation potential but the extraction of the impurity level to suppress the carrier recombination. And density functional theory calculations are in accordance with the above results. Impressively, these merits endow the u-BVG with ca. 16.8 times growth in the amount of BOH radicals derived from OH-/H2O oxidation, an over 260% enhancement in O2 yield and a 1.6-fold increase in the apparent quantum efficiency relative to the impure counterpart.

ABSTRACT: There are long-standing and ongoing concerns about the welfare of animals in the Australian live export trade by sea. However, scrutiny of animal welfare on board vessels is generally hindered by a lack of independent reporting. Cattle voyages from Australia to China have concerned animal welfare advocates due to their long duration and lack of consistent veterinary oversight. In April 2018, following a media expos of animal cruelty and declining public trust, the Australian government installed Independent Observers on some live export voyages. Summaries of Independent Observer (IO) reports by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (DAWR) provided a new and independent source of information about management of animals in the live export trade. The IO summaries on live cattle export voyages to China for the period July 2018 to December 2019 (n = 37) were reviewed. The IO summaries detailed voyages that carried 147,262 slaughter, feeder or breeder cattle which included both dairy and beef breeds. The long-haul voyages averaged 20 days in duration, generally departing the ports of Fremantle and Portland and discharging at ports in northern China. Key animal welfare risk factors identified in the IO summaries included: hunger, thirst, exposure to extreme temperatures, poor pen conditions, health issues, absence of veterinarians, rough seas, poor ship infrastructure, mechanical breakdown and mismanagement at discharge.","output":"Animal Welfare Risks in Live Cattle Export from Australia to China by Sea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present information on ozone concentration in the surface air layer in the second half of 2020.

Remdesivir was reported by World Health Organization (WHO) as the most promising drug currently available for the treatment of COVID-19. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation methods to study the inhibition mechanism of remdesivir to its target SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In the absence of a crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, we first construct the homology model of this polymerase based on a previously available structure of SARS-CoV NSP12 RdRp (with a sequence identify of 95.8%). We then build the putative binding mode by aligning the remdesivir + RdRp complex to the ATP bound poliovirus RdRp. The putative binding structure is further optimized with molecular dynamics simulations and demonstrated to be stable, indicating a reasonable binding mode for remdesivir. The relative binding free energy of remdesivir is calculated to be -8.28 0.65 kcal/mol, much stronger than the natural substrate ATP (-4.14 0.89 kcal/mol) which is needed for the polymerization. The ~800-fold improvement in the Kd from remdesivir over ATP indicates an effective replacement of APT in blocking of the RdRp binding pocket. Key residues D618, S549 and R555 are found to be the contributors to the binding affinity of remdesivir. These findings demonstrate that remdesivir can potentially act as a SARS-CoV-2 RNA-chain terminator, effectively stopping its RNA reproduction, with key residues also identified for future lead optimization and/or drug resistance studies.","output":"Binding Mechanism of Remdesivir to SARS-CoV-2 RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Preoccupied with the diagnosis of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in a SARS outbreak, doctors tend to overlook other endemic diseases, such as tuberculosis.

Little however is known about its early precursors. This study examined the predictive effects of childhood personality and parental behaviors (i.e., overreactive discipline and warmth) for general self-efficacy in young adulthood. Furthermore, it was examined whether personality and parenting behaviors interacted and whether these interactions supported the diathesis-stress or differential susceptibility model. These aims were examined in an 11-year prospective study of 336 participants (M(age) at T1 = 10.83 years, range = 9C12 years, 53.9% girls). Personality and parental behaviors were reported at T1 by both mothers and fathers, whereas self-efficacy was self-reported at T2 11 years later. Hypotheses were tested in Mplus using multilevel structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Results revealed that (only) emotional stability, and not parenting, predicted higher self-efficacy 11 years later. Benevolence functioned as a susceptibility marker in the association between overreactivity and self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that childhood emotional stability is an important long-term predictor of self-efficacy, even into emerging adulthood.

When lifting certain mandatory measures for an economic restart, robust surveillance must be established and implemented, with nucleic acid detection for SARS-CoV-2 as an essential component. METHODS: We tried to develop a one-tube detection platform based on RT-RPA (Reverse Transcription and Recombinase Polymerase Isothermal Amplification) and DNA Endonuclease-Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter (DETECTR) technology, termed OR-DETECTR, to detect SARS-CoV-2. We designed RT-RPA primers of the RdRp and N genes following the SARS-CoV-2 gene sequence. We optimized reaction components so that the detection process could be carried out in one tube. Specificity was demonstrated by detecting nucleic acid samples from pseudoviruses from seven human coronaviruses and Influenza A (H1N1). Clinical samples were used to validate the platform and all results were compared to rRT-PCR. RNA standards and pseudoviruses diluted by different gradients were used to demonstrate the detection limit. Additionally, we have developed a lateral flow assay based on OR-DETECTR for detecting COVID-19. RESULTS: The OR-DETECTR detection process can be completed in one tube, which takes approximately 50 min. This method can specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 from seven human coronaviruses and Influenza A (H1N1), with a low detection limit of 2.5 copies/l input (RNA standard) and 1 copy/l input (pseudovirus). Results of six samples from SARS-CoV-2 patients, eight samples from patients with fever but no SARS-CoV-2 infection, and one mixed sample from 40 negative controls showed that OR-DETECTR is 100% consistent with rRT-PCR. The lateral flow assay based on OR-DETECTR can be used for the detection of COVID-19, and the detection limit is 2.5 copies/l input.

However, in this emerging field, most studies are small and based on student populations outside of a clinical setting. The current study aims to determine the feasibility and acceptability of using smartphones and wearable devices to collect behavioural and clinical data in people undergoing therapy for depressive disorders and establish the extent to which they can be potentially useful biomarkers of depression and recovery after treatment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an observational, prospective cohort study of 65 people attending psychological therapy for depression in multiple London-based sites. It will collect continuous passive data from smartphone sensors and a Fitbit fitness tracker, and deliver questionnaires, speech tasks and cognitive assessments through smartphone-based apps. Objective data on sleep, physical activity, location, Bluetooth contact, smartphone use and heart rate will be gathered for 7 months, and compared with clinical and contextual data. A mixed methods design, including a qualitative interview of patient experiences, will be used to evaluate key feasibility indicators, digital phenotypes of depression and therapy prognosis.

Among them, patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders are disproportionately burdened. A number of recent studies have highlighted that patients with schizophrenia are particularly at risk from COVID-19. The aim of this systematic review is to clarify whether patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders are at greater risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of the literature following the PRISMA guidelines, using PubMed, PsycINFO (via Ovid) and Scopus as databases, to identify all studies which investigated infection and/or mortality rate from SARS-CoV-2 in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Following a formal screening process, seven studies met our inclusion criteria. The results of these seven studies were reported using odds ratios or adjusted odds ratios. The collective results indicated a moderate, but statistically significant effect for higher infection rates, and a strong statistically significant effect for higher mortality rates in patients with schizophrenia. Our findings indicate that people with schizophrenia have a high risk of being infected by the new coronavirus and have a significantly higher mortality rate than the general population. There are contradictory findings concerning other outcomes, including the frequency of intensive care unit admissions for this group. Collectively, these results indicate that people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders may be more vulnerable to being infected and more likely to die due to COVID-19, and yet their access to Intensive Care Units does not seem to be higher. We conclude that patients with schizophrenia constitute a vulnerable group for COVID-19 related infection and mortality, consequently there is a necessity for this vulnerable group of people to have better access to healthcare, including priority in nationwide COVID-19 vaccination programs and expedited intensive care treatment. Our conclusion adds to the ongoing debate arguing for equitable access to healthcare for people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.","output":"Do patients with schizophrenia have higher infection and mortality rates due to COVID-19?

Hierarchy and stereotypes may affect interprofessional (IP) learner-to-learner feedback. The aim was to assess the efficacy of an educational module for IP learners in delivering effective feedback during trauma simulations. METHODS: Multiple simulation events designed to improve teamwork and leadership skills during trauma simulations included IP learners (residents and nurses). Participants completed a pre-course educational module on IP peer feedback. The Trauma Team Competence Assessment-24 tool structured feedback. Learners completed pre/post-assessments utilizing IP Collaborative Competencies Attainment Survey (ICCAS). RESULTS: Twenty-five learners participated in the trauma simulations (13 general surgery and 5 emergency residents, 3 medical students, 4 nurses). The majority of learners had either not received any previous training in how to effectively deliver peer feedback (40%) or had engaged in self-directed learning only (24%). Most learners (64%) had delivered peer feedback less than ten times. Learner knowledge and confidence in delivering feedback to fellow IP learners improved after simulations. All learners felt the feedback received was useful to their daily practice (68% agree, 32% strongly agree). All participants agreed that the simulation achieved each of the ICCAS competencies. CONCLUSIONS: Formal education on IP peer feedback is rare. This pilot work demonstrates educational modules with a foundation in validated tools can be effective in improving learner knowledge and confidence in the process.

In this study, daily PM(10) filters were collected from selected automated stations operated in Rome by the regional network of air quality monitoring: their magnetic properties C including magnetic susceptibility, hysteresis parameters and FORC (first order reversal curves) diagrams - were compared during and after the lockdown, for outlining the impact of the COVID-19 measures on airborne particulate matter. In urban traffic sites, the PM(10) concentrations did not significantly change after the end of the lockdown, when vehicular traffic promptly returned to its usual levels; conversely, the average volume and mass magnetic susceptibilities approximately doubled, and the linear correlation between volume magnetic susceptibility and PM(10) concentration became significant, pointing out the link between PM(10) concentrations and the increasing levels of traffic-related magnetic emissions. Magnetite-like minerals, attributed to non-exhaust brakes emissions, dominated the magnetic fraction of PM(10) near urban traffic sites, with natural magnetic components emerging in background sites and during exogenous dusts atmospheric events. Magnetic susceptibility constituted a fast and sensitive proxy of vehicular particulate emissions: the magnetic properties can play a relevant role in the source apportionment of PM(10), especially when unsignificant variations in its concentration levels may mask important changes in the traffic-related magnetic fraction.

Early data point to a milder disease course following omicron VOC infection in vaccinated individuals. Thus, these data suggest that alternate vaccine induced immunity, beyond neutralization, may continue to attenuate omicron disease, such as antibody-Fc-mediated activity. However, whether vaccine induced antibodies raised in pregnancy continue to bind and leverage Fc-receptors remains unclear.

EXPERIENCES OF EARLY USERS OF DAA When we surveyed 52 early users of DAA, 83% reported that using DAA was either very or somewhat easy; 71% are very or somewhat likely to use DAA in the future; and 87% are very or somewhat likely to recommend that others use DAA in the future. DISCUSSION DAA, a user-friendly software for linking abstracted data with their exact source, is likely to be a very useful tool in the toolbox of systematic reviewers. DAA facilitates verification of abstracted data and provides an audit trail that is crucial for reproducible research.","output":"Features and functioning of Data Abstraction Assistant, a software application for data abstraction during systematic reviews."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Trillions of microbes exist in the human body, particularly the gastrointestinal tract, coevolved with the host in a mutually beneficial relationship.

Intestinal microbiota can prevent pathogen colonization through the mechanism of colonization resistance. A wide range of resistomes are present in both beneficial and pathogenic microbes. Giving antibiotic exposure to the intestinal microbiome (both beneficial and hostile) can trigger a resistome response, affecting colonization resistance. The following review provides a mechanistic overview of the intestinal microbiome and the impacts of antibiotic therapy on pathogen colonization and diseases. Further, we also discuss the epidemiology of immunocompromised patients who are at high risk for nosocomial infections, colonization and decolonization of multi-drug resistant organisms in the intestine, and the direct and indirect mechanisms that govern colonization resistance to the pathogens.","output":"The Intestinal Microbiota: Impacts of Antibiotics Therapy, Colonization Resistance, and Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Delayed death has been identified as a key welfare concern for the U.K. horse population, leading to prolonged suffering. Previous studies have identified common reasons for delaying euthanasia, including financial cost, emotional attachment, peer pressure, negative attitudes towards killing and poor recognition of behavioural indicators of equine pain and stress. The Five Freedoms is a welfare framework that can be used to assess quality of life. We used this framework to create a survey, compiling a list of hypotheticalyet commonscenarios that would have an impact on the overall quality of life of a horse. Participants were asked to indicate to what extent each scenario would have a bearing on an overall decision whether or not to euthanise a horse, or whether it would have had no bearing at all. Participants were also asked if they had had a horse euthanised and to give the reason for such a decision. We received responses from 160 participants and found that the predominant attitude was that most scenarios had no bearing on a decision to euthanise. Principal Component Analysis collected the scenarios into a series of factors that could be labeled according to their themes, the most prominent of which were Ethology-informed Management, Traditional Management, Emotional issues and Physical Issues. Participants were most likely to consider euthanasia for physical issues and this was supported by the experiences of participants who had had their horses euthanised. Only a small number of responses also included consideration of affective and/or ethological factors, suggesting that welfare issues concerning affective state and/or behaviour are at risk of being omitted from an end-of-life decision. ABSTRACT: A key welfare concern for the equine population in the U.K. has been identified as delayed death, leading to prolonged suffering of horses. Reasons why some horse owners fail to have their horses euthanised include financial cost, emotional attachment, peer pressure, negative attitudes towards killing and poor recognition of behavioural indicators of equine pain and stress. The Five Freedoms framework of welfare was used to build a Likert-style survey to investigate the factors underlying attitudes of horse owners towards welfare measures in an end-of-life decision. Participants were asked to respond to hypothetical welfare scenarios and to give details of any horses they had had euthanised. The survey was conducted predominantly via equestrian Facebook groups and obtained 160 participant responses. Reliability of the scale was acceptable, with Cronbachs [Formula: see text]. Principal Component Analysis was used to load the hypothetical scenarios onto seven factors containing 62.2% of the variance. The first four factors could be categorized according to Ethology-informed Management, Traditional Horse Management, Emotional Issues and Physical Issues. Participants were more likely to consider euthanasia for physical issues, compared with issues relating to affective state and/or ethology, although it was not clear whether this was due to disregard for welfare issues relating to mental health or failure to recognise them as such. A large number of responses stated that the scenario had no bearing on whether a horse should be euthanised, again suggesting a lack of recognition of welfare issues and their implications. When asked to state their reasons for euthanising their horses, participants cited almost exclusively physical reasons, with the exception of those citing dangerous behaviour. Only a small number of responses also included consideration of affective and/or ethological factors, suggesting that welfare issues concerning affective state and/or behaviour are at risk of omission from end-of-life decisions.","output":"Attitudes of the Equestrian Public towards Equine End-of-Life Decisions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. The initial epidemiological investigations showed that COVID-19 occurred more likely in adults, with patients younger than 10 years old accounting for less than 1% of the total number of confirmed cases, and infant infections were more rare. In our case, we present an infant who was only 35 days old when he was tested positive for COVID-19. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this report, a 35 day-old male infant with atypical symptoms had close contact with 2 confirmed patients of COVID-19 who were his grandmother and mother. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed as COVID-19 after his oropharyngeal swab tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. INTERVENTIONS: The therapeutic schedule included aerosol inhalation of recombinant human interferon -2b and supportive therapy. OUTCOMES: Two consecutive (1 day apart) oropharyngeal swabs tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; then, the patient was discharged on February 27, 2020. LESSONS: Strengthening infants virus screening in families with infected kins is important for early diagnosis, isolation, and treatment when symptoms are atypical. The infectivity of infants with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 should not be ignored because this may be a source of transmission in the community.","output":"An infant with coronavirus disease 2019 in China: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a deadly disease afflicting millions. The pandemic continues affecting population due to nonavailability of drugs and vaccines. The pathogenesis and complications of infection mainly involve hyperimmune-inflammatory responses. Thus, therapeutic strategies rely on repurposing of drugs aimed at reducing infectivity and inflammation and modulate immunity favourably. Among, numerous therapeutic targets, the endocannabinoid system, particularly activation of cannabinoid type-2 receptors (CB2R) emerged as an important one to suppress the hyperimmune-inflammatory responses. Recently, potent antiinflammatory, antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of CB2R selective ligands of endogenous, plant, and synthetic origin were showed mediating CB2R selective functional agonism. CB2R activation appears to regulate numerous signaling pathways to control immune-inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, prostanoids, and eicosanoids. Many CB2R ligands also exhibit off-target effects mediating activation of PPARs, opioids, and TRPV, suggestive of adjuvant use with existing drugs that may maximize efficacy synergistically and minimize therapeutic doses to limit adverse/ side effects. We hypothesize that CB2R agonists, due to immunomodulatory, antiinflammatory, and antiviral properties may show activity against COVID-19. Based on the organoprotective potential, relative safety, lack of psychotropic effects, and druggable properties, CB2R selective ligands might make available promising candidates for further investigation.","output":"CB2 receptor-selective agonists as candidates for targeting infection, inflammation, and immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of Variants of Concern (VOCs) of SARS-CoV-2 with increased transmissibility, immune evasion properties, and virulence poses a great challenge to public health.

We test the consistency of these two possible paths with the observed dynamics, focusing on the clustered emergence of the first three VOCs, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, in late 2020, following a period of relative evolutionary stasis. We consider a range of possible fitness landscapes, in which the VOC phenotypes could be the result of single mutations, multiple mutations that each contribute additively to increasing viral fitness, or epistatic interactions among multiple mutations that do not individually increase viral fitness--a \\"fitness plateau\\".

This study compares the effect of synchronous telemedicine versus in-person primary care visits on patient clinical outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review of studies published in PubMed and Web of Science between 1996 and January 2021 was performed using keywords related to telemedicine, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Included studies compared synchronous telemedicine versus in-person visits with a primary care clinician, and examined outcomes of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure, and/or lipid levels. RESULTS: Of 1724 citations screened, 7 publications met our inclusion criteria. Included studies were published between 2000 and 2018. Three studies were conducted in the United States, 2 in Spain, 1 in Sweden, and 1 in the United Kingdom. The telemedicine interventions investigated were multifaceted. All included synchronous visits with a primary care provider through videoconferencing and/or telephone, combined with other components such as asynchronous patient data transmission. Five studies reported on HbA1c changes, 5 on blood pressure changes, and 3 on changes in lipid levels. Compared to usual care with in-person visits, telemedicine was associated with greater reductions in HbA1c at 6 months and similar HbA1c outcomes at 12 months. Telemedicine conferred no significant differences in blood pressure and lipid levels compared to in-person clinic visits. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic review of the literature found few studies comparing clinical outcomes resulting from synchronous telemedicine versus in-person office visits, but the existing literature showed that in the primary care setting, telemedicine was not inferior to in-person visits for the management of diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia. These results hold promise for continued use of telemedicine for chronic disease management.

Frequency and expenditure variables were derived from these datasets. RESULTS The annual scintigraphy use rate in Taiwan was 13.57/1000 people from 2001-2005. On average, expenditures for scintigraphy accounted for 0.24% of National Health Insurance expenditures, 0.13% of the nation's total health expenditures and 0.00008% of the gross domestic product of Taiwan. The ratio of scintigraphy to computed tomography use was 0.37 and the scintigraphy to magnetic resonance imaging ratio was 1.14. The ratio of expenditures for scintigraphy and computed tomography was 0.23 and that for scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging was 0.36.

Unfortunately, a treatment agent specific for SARS-CoV-2 has not been developed yet. Favipiravir is one of the antiviral agents used experimentally in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to determine the frequency of side effects seen in patients hospitalized in our hospital and received favipiravir at any stage of their treatment. Methods: Our study is a retrospective observational study. Definite and probable COVID-19 cases hospitalized in our hospital between March 23, 2020, May 31, 2020 were determined, and those receiving favipiravir as initial or secondary therapy were included in the study. The demographic data, laboratory tests, observed side effects of the patients were recorded and analyzed statistically. Results: A total of 134 patients, 37.3% using favipiravir at the beginning and 62.7% as secondary, were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 66.815.7 years. 38.1% (n=51) of the group were female. Side effects were detected in 17 (13%) patients in the whole group. Hepatotoxicity (4.5%), increased serum uric acid (4.5%), nephrotoxicity (1.5%), gastro-intestinal side effects (1.5%), cardiac side effects (0.7%) were detected. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of adverse events between the patients who received favipiravir initially or later on disease course. Conclusions: Although some results support the short-term safety of favipiravir, more studies are needed for its long-term effects. Studies on hyperuricemia, QTc prolongation, use in pregnancy, use during lactation and use in children are insuf-ficient.

Spectral data between 270 and 329 nm are used for the retrieval. A recalibration of the measured radiances is done using ozone profiles from MLS/Aura. Studies with synthetic spectra show that individual profiles in the stratosphere can be retrieved with an uncertainty of about 10 %. In the troposphere, the retrieval errors are larger depending on the a priori profile used. The vertical resolution above 18 km is about 6C10 km, and it degrades to 15C25 km below. The vertical resolution in the troposphere is strongly dependent on the solar zenith angle (SZA). The ozone profiles retrieved from TROPOMI with the TOPAS algorithm were validated using data from ozonesondes and stratospheric ozone lidars. Above 18 km, the comparison with sondes shows excellent agreement within less than 5 % for all latitudes. The standard deviation of mean differences is about 10 %. Below 18 km, the relative mean deviation in the tropics and northern latitudes is still quite good, remaining within 20 %. At southern latitudes, larger differences of up to +40 % occur between 10 and 15 km. The standard deviation is about 50 % between 7C18 km and about 25 % below 7 km.

the interpretation by a clinician or anyone else [1] Recently, there has been a growing interest in the integration of PROs as part of data collection about toxicity and symptoms experienced by patients with cancer This integration could have relevant implications not only for a more accurate reporting of adverse events and definition of quality of life (QoL) within clinical trials [2], but also for a better patients management in routine clinical practice [3] Many tools and questionnaires have been validated to properly measure QoL and symptoms in patients with lung cancer The inclusion of these measures in clinical trials has several important advantages It allows providing a patient-focused assessment of the burden and the impact of disease Moreover, it allows completely assessing the clinical benefit of a therapy, by complementing the information provided by commonly used efficacy endpoints, including overall survival, and the traditional description of safety based on physicians assessment Furthermore, the availability of QoL data from trials could allow a more accurate patient-physician communication about the treatment strategies offered in clinical practice However, a systematic review that we performed in order to evaluate the adoption of QoL among endpoints in randomized phase III trials conducted in lung cancer, published between 2012 and 2018 in 11 major journals, showed quite disappointing findings [4] Beyond the importance in clinical trials, PROs can play an important role in clinical practice Several studies have demonstrated a clear benefit in terms of patients QoL [5,6] Our experience, focused on the adoption of PROs in patients receiving active anticancer treatment at Mauriziano Hospital in Turin, showed that the introduction of PROs, thanks to an active role of nurses, was feasible, produced high patients satisfaction and a significant QoL improvement compared to the traditional modality of visit [6] In details, we compared 2 groups: patients in the control group underwent usual visits, while patients in the PRO group received a paper questionnaire by a dedicated nurse before each visit, in order to provide information about symptoms and toxicities After 1 month, mean change from baseline of global QoL was significantly better in the PRO group, and significantly higher proportion of patients obtained a clinically significant improvement in global QoL score In addition to QoL benefit, several studies have shown a significant improvement in overall survival with the adoption of electronic PROs in patients with lung cancer [7-9] In a pivotal randomized trial involving US patients with different solid tumors (including lung cancer) undergoing chemotherapy, patients assigned to the control arm received usual care, while subjects assigned to experimental arm could report their symptoms remotely from home, using tablet computers or computer kiosks [5,7] Doctors received a report of symptoms referred by patients during visits, and nurses received email alerts when patients reported severe or worsening symptoms Beyond the QoL improvement (the primary endpoint of the trial), a significantly longer life expectancy in the experimental arm (median 31 2 months) compared to the usual care arm (26 0 months) was reported [7] A French randomized trial, conducted in lung cancer patients without evidence of disease progression after or during initial treatment, compared a web-mediated follow-up algorithm (experimental arm), based on weekly self-scored patient symptoms, with routine follow-up with CT scans scheduled every 3-6 months according to the disease stage (control arm) [8] In the experimental arm, the oncologist received automatically an alert email when self-scored symptoms matched predefined criteria Notably, a significant improvement in overall survival was found in patients assigned to experimental arm [9] The adoption of electronic PROs in clinical practice could have many advantages [10] Regular discussion of PROs questionnaires, filled out electronically by patients and received by nurses or doctors, could allow a systematic check of the clinical trend of symptoms and side-effects The early, proactive identification of worsening symptoms and toxicities could help prevent the occurrence of severe adverse events needing ER access and hospitalization Adoption and discussion of PROs would reasonably have a positive psychological impact on patients, increasing their satisfaction with healthcare services While the adoption of electronic PROs could initially appear as a challenging organizational effort, we believe that their benefits will definitely be evident in the long-term The use of PROs may allow a significant benefit in terms of patients QoL, and

In this study, we sought to compare the single-port hybrid technique, which we originally reported in 2012, with the conventional 4-port approach, in regards of complications, outcome, operative time and cost. METHODS A retrospective, single-center comparison of hybrid single-port versus conventional 4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in 98 consecutive pediatric patients between January 2010 and October 2014. Patient characteristics, intra- and postoperative outcomes, operative costs, and total hospitalization costs were compared between the 2 approaches using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS The single-port technique was utilized in 56 (57%) pediatric patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The operative time for single-port procedures was shorter than that of the conventional technique (median, 85 minutes vs 114 minutes; P = .003). Patients with single-port procedures were less likely to have a cholangiogram compared to patients who underwent 4-port cholecystectomy. (9% vs 40%; P < .001). No statistically significant differences between the 2 cohorts were observed for intra- or postoperative outcomes. Although the 2 groups shared nearly the same median duration of hospitalization (22 hours vs 21 hours; P = .70), the single-port group demonstrated a lower total cost of hospitalization (median cost, $7438 vs $8783; P = .030) and lower operative cost (median, $3918 vs $4647; P < .001). CONCLUSION Hybrid single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy in children with uncomplicated gallbladder disease is feasible and equally safe, with similar intra- and postoperative outcomes compared with the conventional 4-port approach.

Conversely, the impact of another method largely used a couple of years ago in a laboratory of pathology, the electron microscopy (EM), is currently limited. EM is a difficult, quite expensive and long method, which requires technicians with a high qualification. Therefore, EM is currently rarely available at the hospital in a laboratory of pathology and is essentially established in research centers. However, EM is still an essential tool for the surgical pathologist. This method allows in some circumstances to confirm or, more rarely, to make the diagnosis of a couple of tissular and cellular lesions observed in human pathology. EM is also an interesting method to better understand the etiopathogenesis of emerging human diseases, in particular of emerging infectious diseases.

There are few options for pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of propofol for children under two years old. We performed an external validation of the Kim model for children under two years old to evaluate whether the model is applicable to this age group. METHODS Twenty-four children were enrolled. After routine anesthetic induction, a continuous infusion of 2% propofol and remifentanil was commenced using the Kim model. The target effect-site concentration of propofol was set as 2, 3, 4, and 5 g/mL, followed by arterial blood sampling after 10 min of each equilibrium. Population estimates of four parameters-pooled bias, inaccuracy, divergence, and wobble-were used to evaluate the performance of the Kim model. RESULTS A total of 95 plasma concentrations were used for evaluation of the Kim model. The population estimate (95% confidence interval) of bias was -0.96% (-8.45%, 6.54%) and that of inaccuracy was 21.0% (15.0%-27.0%) for the plasma concentration of propofol. CONCLUSION The pooled bias and inaccuracy of the pharmacokinetic predictions are clinically acceptable. Therefore, our external validation of the Kim model indicated that the model can be applicable to target-controlled infusion of propofol in children younger than 2 years, with the recommended use of actual bispectral index monitoring in clinical settings that remifentanil is present.

Several studies about the metabolome of COVID-19 patients have revealed metabolic disorders and some potential diagnostic markers during disease progression. However, the longitudinal changes of metabolomics in COVID-19 patients, especially their association with disease progression, are still unclear. Here, we systematically analyzed the dynamic changes of the serum metabolome of COVID-19 patients, demonstrating that most of the metabolites did not recover by 1C3 days before discharge. A prominent signature in COVID-19 patients comprised metabolites of amino acids, peptides, and analogs, involving nine essential amino acids, 10 dipeptides, and four N-acetylated amino acids. The levels of 12 metabolites in amino acid metabolism, especially three metabolites of the ornithine cycle, were significantly higher in severe patients than in mild ones, mainly on days 1C3 or 4C6 since onset. Integrating blood metabolomic, biochemical, and cytokine data, we uncovered a highly correlated network, including 6 cytokines, 13 biochemical parameters, and 49 metabolites. Significantly, five ornithine cycle-related metabolites (ornithine, N-acetylornithine, 3-amino-2-piperidone, aspartic acid, and asparagine) highly correlated with cytokine storms and coagulation index. We discovered that the ornithine cycle dysregulation significantly correlated with inflammation and coagulation in severe patients, which may be a potential mechanism of COVID-19 pathogenicity. Our study provided a valuable resource for detailed exploration of metabolic factors in COVID-19 patients, guiding metabolic recovery, understanding the pathogenic mechanisms, and creating drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Longitudinal Metabolomics Reveals Ornithine Cycle Dysregulation Correlates With Inflammation and Coagulation in COVID-19 Severe Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a potential threat to patients with autoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Such patients are usually treated with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive agents, which may tamper with the organism's normal response to infections. Currently, no consensus has been reached on how to manage MS and NMOSD patients during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE To discuss strategies to manage those patients. METHODS We focus on how to 1) reduce COVID-19 infection risk, such as social distancing, telemedicine, and wider interval between laboratory testing/imaging; 2) manage relapses, such as avoiding treatment of mild relapse and using oral steroids; 3) manage disease-modifying therapies, such as preference for drugs associated with lower infection risk (interferons, glatiramer, teriflunomide, and natalizumab) and extended-interval dosing of natalizumab, when safe; 4) individualize the chosen MS induction-therapy (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, alemtuzumab, and cladribine); 5) manage NMOSD preventive therapies, including initial therapy selection and current treatment maintenance; 6) manage MS/NMOSD patients infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS In the future, real-world case series of MS/NMOSD patients infected with COVID-19 will help us define the best management strategies.

It triggered the enormous challenges for the global health system, forcing doctors and patients to adapt to new realities and the field of rheumatology was not an exclusion. Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze articles covering interconnection between COVID-19 and rheumatic diseases;to investigate the common features of papers in this category and indicate the most influential among them;to determine which rheumatic nosologies were most represented. Methods: For retrieving of literature data, we applied the bibliometric database Scopus and conducted our search on 12th of January using following keywords: rheumatoid arthritis OR systemic lupus erythematosus OR systemic sclerosis OR vasculitis OR myositis OR rheumatology AND COVID-19. All selected articles were analyzed according to various aspects: type of document, authorship, journal, citations score, rheumatology field, country of origin, language, and keywords. We have built the visualizing keywords network (Figure 1) with the help of software tool VOSviewer version 1.6.15 (the minimum keyword occurrence threshold was set at 5). Results: A total of 844 literature items were obtained. After screening of title, abstract and keywords we excluded 106 records as they were not emphasized the rheumatological perspective on COVID-19 and as a result were inapplicable for this study. The 738 retrieved articles were mostly (86.8%) open access publications. The top five journals that contributed most to the coverage of this topic were: Annals Of The Rheumatic Diseases (n=59), Clinical Rheumatology (n=41), Lancet Rheumatology (n=24), Arthritis And Rheumatology (n=20) and Rheumatology International (n=19). The origin of most studies was not surprisingly from those countries, which belong to the top ten according to the total cases of COVID-19 [1] (USA -167;Italy -148;UK -76;India -60 and Spain -58). Most items were written in English but articles in German (n=12), Spanish (n=11), Russian (n=5) and Chinese (n=2) could also be found. Analyzed studies were designed in the form of Original Articles (41.2%), Reviews (23.7%), Letters (21.8), Notes (6.9%), Editorials (5.1%). According to the citations scores, articles of highest interest were dedicated to clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune pathologies. The other highly cited studies were about cytokine storm and perspective usage of biological drugs for severe cases of COVID-19. Our analysis of keywords showed that the most widely discussed rheumatic disease in the view of COVID-19 was systemic lupus erythematosus (n=188), followed by vasculitis (n=132), rheumatoid arthritis (n=90), systemic sclerosis (n=32) and psoriatic arthritis (24).

Conclusion: As far as we know, it is the first bibliometric overview of studies dedicated to interrelation between COVID-19 and rheumatic pathology. The high number of open access items contributes to the increase of research visibility in this emergently developing research field and facilitates the process of scientific data sharing.

In late 2020, several variants of concern emerged globally, including the UK variant (B.1.1.7), South Africa variant (B.1.351), Brazil variants (P.1 and P.2), and two related California variants of interest (B.1.429 and B.1.427). These variants are believed to have enhanced transmissibility. For the South Africa and Brazil variants, there is evidence that mutations in spike protein permit it to escape from some vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Based on our extensive genome sequencing program involving 20,453 COVID-19 patient samples collected from March 2020 to February 2021, we report identification of all six of these SARS-CoV-2 variants among Houston Methodist Hospital patients residing in the greater metropolitan area. Although these variants are currently at relatively low frequency (aggregate of 1.1%) in the population, they are geographically widespread. Houston is the first city in the United States in which active circulation of all six current variants of concern has been documented by genome sequencing.

METHOD: Topic guides explored the perspectives and experiences of general practice staff on the implementation and delivery of group consultations. Data analysis adopted principles of the Framework Method underpinned by Normalisation Process Theory. RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 8 GPs, 8 practice nurses, 1 nurse associate, 1 practice pharmacist, 1 deputy practice manager, and 1 healthcare assistant. Four themes were identified: sense making of group consultations; the work associated with initiating group consultations; the experiences of operationalising group consultations; and sustaining change. Group consultations made sense to participants as a mechanism to reduce burden on primary care, enhance multidisciplinary working, and provide patient-centred care. Implementation required strong leadership from a champion, and a facilitator had a pivotal role in operationalising the approach. The associated workload was often underestimated. Barriers to embedding change included achieving whole practice buy-in, competing practice priorities, and system-level flexibility. CONCLUSION: General practice clinicians enjoyed group consultations, yet significant work is required to initiate and sustain the approach. An implementation plan considering leadership, roles and responsibilities, and wider organisational support is required at the outset.

A cross-sectional, professional pharmacy organization listserver-based online survey of a target group of health-system pharmacists across the United States was conducted. The survey was sent out through professional organization listservers and was anonymous and voluntary. The survey questionnaire included items regarding demographics and employment characteristics, COVID-19-related questions, a survey of respondents' perceptions of the prevalence and severity of burnout, and the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL). The ProQOL assessed respondents for compassion satisfaction (subcategorized as burnout and STS) and compassion fatigue. Descriptive statistics was used to assess the prevalence of burnout and STS. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-four health-system pharmacists completed the survey. Based on respondents' self-ratings of burnout, 47% were identified as having current burnout and 81% as having a history of burnout. Based on ProQOL scoring, 65.3% of respondents were identified as having a moderate or high likelihood of burnout, which was a prevalence higher than that indicated by respondents' self-ratings. Additionally, 51.4% of respondents were identified as having a moderate or high probability of STS and 99.4% as having a moderate or high probability of compassion satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The survey found that over half of health-system pharmacists were affected with burnout, half with STS, and three-fourths with compassion satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, the development of burnout and STS in these health-system pharmacists may lead to several work-related consequences (eg, increase risk of medical errors, depression); therefore, addressing burnout and STS is crucial.

METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted between December 2020 and January 2021 involving 1,382 Bangladeshi adults (aged  18-years) in randomly selected urban and rural areas from all eight divisions in Bangladesh. Descriptive data analysis was conducted to highlight the challenges for preventive practices and risk communications for COVID-19. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the sociodemographic groups vulnerable to these challenges. RESULTS Lack of availability of protective equipment (44.4%), crowded living situations/workspaces (36.8%), inadequate information on the proper use of protective measures (21.9%), inadequate hand washing and sanitation facilities (17.6%), and negative influences of family/friends (17.4%) were identified as barriers to COVID-19 preventive practices.

PURPOSE: To describe the epidemiology of LBIs in collegiate female volleyball athletes over a 5-year period from the academic years 2009 to 2010 and 2013 to 2014. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: The incidence and characteristics of spine injuries were identified utilizing the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program database. Rates of injury were calculated as the number of injuries by the total number of athlete-exposures (AEs). AEs were defined as any student participation in any single NCAA-sanctioned practice or competition. The injury rate was computed as the number of injuries per the total number of AEs and reported as a ration of injuries per 10,000 exposures. The ratio was then reported as overall number as well as stratified for event, time of season, and athletic NCAA division. Incidence rate ratios were then calculated to compare rates between event type. Results with 95% CIs that did not include 1.0 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: An estimated 3384 LBIs occurred in NCAA female volleyball players during this 5-year time frame. These LBIs occurred at a rate of 4.89 injuries per 10,000 AEs. LBIs were 2.76 times more likely in preseason when compared with regular season. More injuries occurred in practice (85%) when compared with competition (15%). The outside hitter and middle blocker were the most commonly position to sustain an LBI. Almost 70% of injuries were new injuries, and another 29% were recurrent injuries. The most common mechanism of injury was equally split between contact (50.4%) and overuse (45.5%) injuries, whereas the remaining mechanisms of injury were secondary for unknown reasons (4.14%). Most players returned to play within 24 hours (72.3%) followed by 1 to 6 days (16.4%), and finally 7 to 12 days (11.3%). No patient required surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: The rate of LBIs was high (4.89/10,000 AEs) and injuries commonly recurred (29.2%). Most injuries were new, with most athletes returning to play with 24 hours.","output":"Lower Back Injuries in NCAA Female Volleyball Athletes: A 5-Year Epidemiologic Characterization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prevention of nosocomial infections is particularly important for the control of COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a field study and performed extensive numerical simulations of infection transmission in a fever clinic during pandemic through an agent-based model with pedestrian dynamic and an infection transmission model. Furthermore, we evaluated the cross-infection risk of the patients influenced by the patient inject flow, medical service capability and plane layout. The service capability of fever clinic is determined by the least efficient medical session. When patient inject flow exceeded the service capability, the average dwell time, contact time, exposure dose, and risk of infection of patients all increased dramatically. With the patient inject flow exceeding the service capability, the growth rate of the contact time between patients and the cross-infection risk increased by 11.5-fold and 29.5-fold, respectively. The plane layout of the fever clinic affected the exposure dose and risk of infection. The waiting areas in the fever clinic had the highest risk, where the cumulative exposure dose of virus occupied up to 66.5% of the total.

DESIGN Systematic review with network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and CINAHL from database inception to 31 January 2021. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION Randomised controlled trials comparing psychological interventions with any comparison intervention in adults with chronic, non-specific low back pain. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and confidence in the evidence. Primary outcomes were physical function and pain intensity. A random effects network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach was performed at post-intervention (from the end of treatment to <2 months post-intervention); and at short term (2 to <6 months post-intervention), mid-term (6 to <12 months post-intervention), and long term follow-up (12 months post-intervention). Physiotherapy care was the reference comparison intervention. The design-by-treatment interaction model was used to assess global inconsistency and the Bucher method was used to assess local inconsistency. RESULTS 97 randomised controlled trials involving 13 136 participants and 17 treatment nodes were included. Inconsistency was detected at short term and mid-term follow-up for physical function, and short term follow-up for pain intensity, and were resolved through sensitivity analyses. For physical function, cognitive behavioural therapy (standardised mean difference 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.44), and pain education (0.62, 0.08 to 1.17), delivered with physiotherapy care, resulted in clinically important improvements at post-intervention (moderate quality evidence). The most sustainable effects of treatment for improving physical function were reported with pain education delivered with physiotherapy care, at least until mid-term follow-up (0.63, 0.25 to 1.00; low quality evidence). No studies investigated the long term effectiveness of pain education delivered with physiotherapy care. For pain intensity, behavioural therapy (1.08, 0.22 to 1.94), cognitive behavioural therapy (0.92, 0.43 to 1.42), and pain education (0.91, 0.37 to 1.45), delivered with physiotherapy care, resulted in clinically important effects at post-intervention (low to moderate quality evidence). Only behavioural therapy delivered with physiotherapy care maintained clinically important effects on reducing pain intensity until mid-term follow-up (1.01, 0.41 to 1.60; high quality evidence). CONCLUSIONS For people with chronic, non-specific low back pain, psychological interventions are most effective when delivered in conjunction with physiotherapy care (mainly structured exercise). Pain education programmes (low to moderate quality evidence) and behavioural therapy (low to high quality evidence) result in the most sustainable effects of treatment; however, uncertainty remains as to their long term effectiveness. Although inconsistency was detected, potential sources were identified and resolved.

METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted between April 28 and June 3, 2020 with 45 adolescents using one-on-one semi-structured phone interviews. RESULTS: The \\"natural experiment\\" caused by the shutdown of schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a 2-h shift in the sleep of typically developing adolescents, longer sleep duration, improved sleep quality, and less daytime sleepiness compared to those experienced under the regular school-time schedule. DISCUSSION: These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that delaying high school start times could be an effective way to extend sleep duration, improve sleep quality, reduce daytime sleepiness and lower adolescents' stress during the school year. As many countries look for ways to reduce the number of interactions between students in schools so that physical distancing is feasible, following teens' delayed sleep biology could offer an affordable solution. For example, staggering arrival times by delaying school start time for older adolescents compared with younger adolescents can reduce the total number of students attending school at the same time. This strategy offers a practical means to reduce school density and the number of interactions between students which are needed to reduce the potential transmission of COVID-19 in schools, while improving adolescents sleep health.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 related school shutdown on sleep in adolescents: a natural experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm is thought to be the cause of inflammatory lung damage, worsening pneumonia and death in patients with COVID-19.

However, no studies have documented the oral hygiene features present in patients who present with dysphagia. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe the oral hygiene problems of adults admitted to a sub-acute rehabilitation hospital and who presented with dysphagia. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was conducted, during which 40 participants C 57.5% (n = 23) male and 42.5% (n = 17) female C underwent a clinical swallow evaluation using the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (MASA) augmented with cervical auscultation (CA) and pulse oximetry (PO), an oral hygiene assessment using an adapted version of the Oral Health Assessment Tool (OHAT), followed by microbiology laboratory analysis of buccal swab samples to detect bacteria not considered part of the normal oral flora. RESULTS: Results indicated that poor oral hygiene status was a common feature amongst all participants who presented with dysphagia. The most prevalent oral hygiene issues were related to abnormalities concerning saliva (60%), oral cleanliness (82.5%), the tongue (80%) and the use of dentures (71.4%). A high prevalence, 62.5% (n = 25), of opportunistic bacteria was found. The most commonly occurring bacteria groups were: (1) Candida albicans (47.5%) and (2) respiratory pathogens (37.5%) such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: Persons with dysphagia have poor oral hygiene which creates favourable environments for bacteria to flourish and increases the prevalence of pathogenic oral bacteria associated with the development of aspiration pneumonia. The management of oral health issues for persons with dysphagia should receive greater attention during hospitalisation.","output":"Pathogenic oral bacteria in hospitalised patients with dysphagia: The silent epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely contagious and cognitive disease that could cause immense hypoxemia. The rise in critically ill patients in epidemic regions has put enormous pressure on hospitals. There is a need to define extreme COVID-19 clinical determinants to optimize clinical diagnosis and the management system is strong. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is linked to a rapidly increasing risk of death rates in population pneumonia. In this research, a network of protein-protein interaction (PPI) was developed using constructed datasets of COVID-19 and COPD genes to define the interrelationship between COVID-19 and COPD, how it affects each other, and the genes that are responsible for the process. The PPI network shows the top 10 common overlapping genes, which include IL10, TLR4, TNF, IL6, CXCL8, IL4, ICAM1, IFNG, TLR2, and IL18. These are the genes that COVID-19 and high-risk COPD patients are known to be expressed.

Therefore, in this research, the objective is to identify the role of RFID technology in healthcare-related activities before, during, and after disasters in terms of application areas and phases of the disaster management cycle (DMC). A Delphi approach was used in this research. Two rounds of questionnaires were administered to a panel of experts to evaluate the actual and potential use of RFID applications for healthcare within DMC. The Delphi participants were the field experts in the areas of disaster management, disaster medicine, and information systems. Based on the Delphi results, RFID applications were seen to be most useful in the response and recovery phases of disasters. RFID was seen as being most helpful for health-related supply management and casualty information. There were concerns that privacy and security may be barriers to adoption and use. Other applications identified by this study include identifying and tracking medical resources (including clinicians and first responders) and their accurate coordination in the response missions, determining idle resources, and maximising their utilisation during response activities. In this research, 35 potential scenarios of RFID applications for healthcare purposes within DMC and Disaster e-Health (DEH) were evaluated with the Delphi participants. RFID technologies could play an important role in DMC and DEH to provide more reliable and timely information to support healthcare during disasters.

The extent to which PM pollution contributed to COVID-19 diffusion is needing further clarification. We aimed to investigate the particular matter (PM) pollution and its correlation with COVID-19 incidence across four Italian cities: Milan, Rome, Naples, and Salerno, during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods. METHODS: We performed a comparative analysis followed by correlation and regression analyses of the daily average PM10, PM2.5 concentrations, and COVID-19 incidence across four cities from 1 January 2020 to 8 April 2020, adjusting for several factors, taking a two-week time lag into account. RESULTS: Milan had significantly higher average daily PM10 and PM2.5 levels than Rome, Naples, and Salerno. Rome, Naples, and Salerno maintained safe PM10 levels. The daily PM2.5 levels exceeded the legislative standards in all cities during the entire period. PM2.5 pollution was related to COVID-19 incidence. The PM2.5 levels and sampling rate were strong predictors of COVID-19 incidence during the pre-lockdown period. The PM2.5 levels, population's age, and density strongly predicted COVID-19 incidence during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Italy serves as a noteworthy paradigm illustrating that PM2.5 pollution impacts COVID-19 spread.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, community leaders expressed frustration and bewilderment about PB. Psychological explanatory concepts, including those from social learning theory and the concept of the behavioral immune system, along with recent research, suggests the following account of pandemic-related PB. PB arises when people are told to go into self-isolation as part of pandemic containment interventions. Empirically, episodes of PB typically last 7-10 days and are likely initiated by highly fearful people. PB by an anxious minority of shoppers leads to fear contagion among other shoppers, amplified by widespread dissemination, via social media, of images and videos of PB and empty shelves in stores. Thus, a snow-balling effect arises where fear of scarcity creates real but short-term scarcity. People who are highly frightened of infection tend to have heightened disgust proneness. Toilet paper is a means of escaping disgust stimuli, and for this and other reasons, toilet paper became a target of PB for people frightened of contracting COVID-19.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed by distributing a multidimensional survey to spine surgeons worldwide. Questions addressed demographics, impacts and perceptions of COVID-19, and the presence of surgeon comorbidities, which included cancer, cardiac disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, respiratory illness, renal disease, and current tobacco use. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify specific comorbidities that influenced various impact measures. Results: Across 7 global regions, 36.8% out of 902 respondents reported a comorbidity, of which hypertension (21.9%) and obesity (15.6%) were the most common. Multivariate analysis noted tobacco users were more likely to continue performing elective surgery during the pandemic (odds ratio [OR], 2.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46C4.72; p = 0.001) and were less likely to utilize telecommunication (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31C0.86; p = 0.011), whereas those with hypertension were less likely to warn their patients should the surgeon become infected with COVID-19 (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37C0.91; p = 0.017).

Such gradient was characterized with the relative percent change (PC) in drinking measures per year of education from generalized linear regression models after adjusting for age, year, region, marital status and immigration status. Among men, the PCs were significantly positive (p < 0.05) for prevalence of <21 g alcohol/day (2.9%) and 1C3 HED days (1.4%), and they were negative for prevalences of 21C40 g/day (?1.1%), >40 g/day (?6.0%) and 4 HED days (?3.2%), while among women they ranged from 3.6% to 5.7%. The gradient in prevalences of >40 g/day (men) and >20 g/day (women) was greatly attenuated after additionally adjusting for HED, while that of 4 HED days was only slightly attenuated after additionally adjusting for drinking amount.

This trial investigates whether the use of face masks in the community will reduce wearers' risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This study will be a two-arm, unblinded, randomised controlled trial. We will include adults (>18 years of age) without prior confirmed COVID-19 or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, who spend more than three hours per day outside the home with exposure to other people. A total of 6,000 participants are randomly assigned 1:1 to use face masks or not for a 30-day period during the pandemic. Participants will perform self-testing; quick test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG)) (the Livzon lateral flow test) and oropharyngeal/nasal swabs for viral detection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

We sought to determine whether neighborhood-level health, demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics in Southeastern Pennsylvania were associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality at the zip code and municipality level, thereby establishing whether neighborhood-level disparities mirror individual-level ones. Methods: Cumulative zip code- and municipality-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths were obtained from the public data hubs of 5 counties in Southeast Pennsylvania, and those of individual long-term care facilities (LTCFs) were obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of Health. For corresponding geographic areas, demographic and socioeconomic status variables were obtained from the American Community Survey, and data on the health status and behaviors of local residents were obtained from the Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey. COVID-19 cases and deaths reported by LTCFs were excluded from area-aggregated counts. Multivariable quasi-Poisson models with offsets for population counts were created to determine whether neighborhood-level variables were associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Before adjusted incidence rate ratios were calculated, such models included individual predictors that were significantly associated (p&lt;0.05) with COVID-19 outcomes and excluded highly collinear terms as determined by having variance inflation factors greater than 3. Results: Among 208 zip codes and municipalities that had complete data, the COVID-19 cumulative incidence through July 24, 2020 ranged from 0 to 331.9 per 10,000 residents, and the COVID-19 mortality rate ranged from 0 to 1.0 per 10,000 residents.

Understanding the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 and how this varies between countries should inform the design of possible strategies to shield or vaccinate those at highest risk. METHODS: We estimated the number of individuals at increased risk of severe disease (defined as those with at least one condition listed as \\"at increased risk of severe COVID-19\\" in current guidelines) by age (5-year age groups), sex, and country for 188 countries using prevalence data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 and UN population estimates for 2020. The list of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 was determined by mapping the conditions listed in GBD 2017 to those listed in guidelines published by WHO and public health agencies in the UK and the USA. We analysed data from two large multimorbidity studies to determine appropriate adjustment factors for clustering and multimorbidity. To help interpretation of the degree of risk among those at increased risk, we also estimated the number of individuals at high risk (defined as those that would require hospital admission if infected) using age-specific infection-hospitalisation ratios for COVID-19 estimated for mainland China and making adjustments to reflect country-specific differences in the prevalence of underlying conditions and frailty. We assumed males were twice at likely as females to be at high risk. We also calculated the number of individuals without an underlying condition that could be considered at increased risk because of their age, using minimum ages from 50 to 70 years. We generated uncertainty intervals (UIs) for our estimates by running low and high scenarios using the lower and upper 95% confidence limits for country population size, disease prevalences, multimorbidity fractions, and infection-hospitalisation ratios, and plausible low and high estimates for the degree of clustering, informed by multimorbidity studies. FINDINGS: We estimated that 17 billion (UI 10-24) people, comprising 22% (UI 15-28) of the global population, have at least one underlying condition that puts them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 if infected (ranging from <5% of those younger than 20 years to >66% of those aged 70 years or older). We estimated that 349 million (186-787) people (4% [3-9] of the global population) are at high risk of severe COVID-19 and would require hospital admission if infected (ranging from <1% of those younger than 20 years to approximately 20% of those aged 70 years or older). We estimated 6% (3-12) of males to be at high risk compared with 3% (2-7) of females. The share of the population at increased risk was highest in countries with older populations, African countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence, and small island nations with high diabetes prevalence. Estimates of the number of individuals at increased risk were most sensitive to the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory disease. INTERPRETATION: About one in five individuals worldwide could be at increased risk of severe COVID-19, should they become infected, due to underlying health conditions, but this risk varies considerably by age. Our estimates are uncertain, and focus on underlying conditions rather than other risk factors such as ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and obesity, but provide a starting point for considering the number of individuals that might need to be shielded or vaccinated as the global pandemic unfolds.

This situation has revived the debate around the place and role of the relational entourage in caring for the elderly. The relevance of family ties in supporting the narcissistic and objectal cathexis of the elderly has thus gained recognition. There is, however, the risk of an emerging form of uniformization and idealization, which the present article seeks to address by highlighting some aspects of the intrapsychic and inter-relational dynamics that drive the inherent complexity of those bonds. Method: The authors seek to identify the psychic processes involved in varying forms of presence and of motivation of \\"natural caregivers\\" and \\"professional caregivers.\\" Their approach is based on a psychodynamic analysis of the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic and the changes induced in the links between the patient or elderly resident and his or her entourage. Complex movements fueling the dynamics involved in these links are revealed. A clinical vignette based on research in clinical psychology and psychopathology is provided. Results: The pandemic context showed the creative strategies devised by relatives and carers to maintain forms of presence and links \\"at a distance\\" with isolated and confined elderly people. However, the various configurations of these arrangements also highlighted the tensions, sometimes tinged with rivalry, in the negotiations that inform the respective places and roles of family members and professionals around the subjects concerned. The caregiver's position is not self-evident and presupposes an involvement that cannot be construed on a merely functional and behavioral level. Rather, it requires a need for psychic work drawing on the identificatory and projective movements inevitably mobilized in closeness with the subject, without alienating oneself. Ambivalence, empathy, and support can then be deployed, where excessive control, covert hostility, and over-excitement are constant threats to such a necessarily close relationship. This disposition in the caregiver also encounters a singular psychic disposition on the part of the person being helped, informed by a lively conflictuality. This sometimes takes on surprising undertones, as in the case of Georges, an 86-year-old patient, where the caregiver as a \\"close-human-being\\" was fully recognized only on the condition that the relationship of help and care supported, sustained, and nourished unconscious masochistic needs. Discussion: These perspectives are an invitation to ponder the plurality of figures of the \\"close-human-being\\" and to find one's place in a psychic and relational economy where the self-preserving and psychosexual registers are in constant interplay. They also underline the need to focus on working, individually and collectively, on the quality of the entourage's presence. This is all mediated by a complex organizational pattern anchored in the potential for reciprocal support between the family group, the caregiving group, and the institutional setting. Conclusion: These various propositions help clarifythe components of the psychic conflictuality implied, on the one hand, in the horizontal tensions existing between the various members of the familial and professional circle and, on the other hand, in the vertical tensions inherent in intergenerational dynamics. The elderly are far from being passive objects in this and their contribution is essential. The concern to ensure the close involvement of the elderly person's relatives and foster the quality of the ensuing exchanges is laudable, indeed vital. This should not, however, lead us to downplay the crucial and singular place the elderly subjects themselves occupy in individual, family, and societal dynamics, as full citizens, members of their relatives' entourage, and essential figures in the establishment of the great psychic organizing functions that structure the difference in generations and the psychic processes of identification.","output":"Ambivalence, emprise, soutien.

There were 1058 individuals surveyed using a validated questionnaire (response rate of 93.9%). The self-reported prevalence rates were as follows (95% CI): gluten sensitivity (GS), 10.30% (8.53C12.29); non-celiac GS (NCGS), 5.19% (3.94C6.71); physician-diagnosed celiac disease (PD-CD), 3.11% (2.15C4.35); wheat allergy (WA), 2.07% (1.30C3.13); and adherence to GFD, 15.69% (13.55C18.02). Excluding CD, more women than men met the criteria for GRDs, adverse food reactions, and GFD (p < 0.05). Eight respondents reported the coexistence of NCGS with PD-CD and/or WA. Most cases on a GFD indicated medical/dietitian advice for following the diet (68.07%). Non-self-reported GS individuals indicated weight control (46.4%) and the notion that the GFD is healthier (20.2%) as the main motivations for following the diet. GRDs are not uncommon in Paraguayan adult population.

Pre-incubation of isolated feline peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in vitro with either 10(4) or 10(3) International Units (U) of rHuIFN- for 24 h significantly suppressed (P<0.001 and 0.01, respectively) blastogenic responses to the phytomitogens concanavalin A (Con A) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Lower doses of IFN (range, 10C10(?3) U/ml) neither suppressed nor enhanced mitogenesis. In the absence of phytomitogens, incubation of PBL with 10(4)C10(2) U (P<0.001) or 10 U (P<0.05) of rHuIFN-/ml resulted in a significant decrease in incorporation of [methyl-(3)H] thymidine into newly synthesized cellular DNA. Cultures of PBL exposed continuously for 4 days to rHuIFN- doses of 10(4) U/ml or less did not demonstrate specific reductions in cell viability, indicating that the observed antiproliferative actions of IFN apparently were independent of any direct cytotoxic effects. To investigate the dose-response effects of rHuIFN- in vivo on lymphocyte blastogenesis, individual groups of cats were evaluated on 3 consecutive days before and then 24 h after each cat was inoculated intramuscularly with either a high dose (10(6) U/kg), moderate dose (10(4) U/kg), or a relatively low dose (10(2) U/kg) of rHuIFN-. Cats inoculated with 10(6) U ofrHuIFN-/kg had significantly reduced (P=0.037) blastogenic responses to Con a at 24 h postinoculation compared to preinoculation values; mean PWM responses were also decreased, but this effect was not statistically significant.

METHODS: The new seven-channel aethalometer model (AE-33), PM(2.5), and meteorological data were collected in the dry season (OctoberCMay) from 2019 to 2020, to quantify BC emissions in urban Shenzhen. Explored the source allocation of BC based on Potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) model. RESULTS: We revealed that the mean BC concentration was 2672  1506 ng/m(3) in the dry season, with values of 4062  1182 ng/m(3), 2519  1568 ng/m(3), and 1900  776 ng/m(3) in autumn, winter, and spring, respectively. Additionally, we found that fossil fuels have higher contributions to BC concentrations (86.3% to 86.8% in autumn and spring) in the dry season than biomass fuels (16% to 20% in autumn, spring and winter), which is different from Beijing, Nanjing and other large economic zones in China. The diurnal variation in BC and the contribution of fossil fuels indicate that there is a significantly greater increase in BC during peak traffic hours in urban Shenzhen than in other cities. Finally, meteorological parameters and PM(2.5) data provided supporting evidence that BC is sourced mainly from local vehicle emissions and industry-related combustion in the western and northeastern/southeastern parts of the study area.

We used 16 S rRNA sequencing to characterize the nasal microbiome of infants with RSV infection. We used RNA sequencing to interrogate the transcriptome of CD4(+) T cells obtained from the same set of infants. After dimension reduction through principal component (PC) analysis, we performed an integrative analysis to identify significant co-variation between microbial clade and gene expression PCs. We then employed LIONESS (Linear Interpolation to Obtain Network Estimates for Single Samples) to estimate the clade-gene association patterns for each infant. Our network-based integrative analysis identified several clade-gene associations significantly related to the severity of RSV infection. The microbial taxa with the highest loadings in the implicated clade PCs included Moraxella, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus. Interestingly, many of the genes with the highest loadings in the implicated gene PCs are encoded in mitochondrial DNA, while others are involved in the host immune response.

However, in sub-Saharan Africa, a low prevalence and mortality have been observed so far. METHODS: We collected data on individuals social contacts in the South West Shewa Zone (SWSZ) of Ethiopia across geographical contexts characterized by heterogeneous population density, work and travel opportunities, and access to primary care. We assessed how socio-demographic factors and observed mixing patterns can influence the COVID-19 disease burden, by simulating SARS-CoV-2 transmission in remote settlements, rural villages, and urban neighborhoods, under school closure mandate. RESULTS: From national surveillance data, we estimated a net reproduction number of 1.62 (95% CI 1.55C1.70). We found that, at the end of an epidemic mitigated by school closure alone, 10C15% of the population residing in the SWSZ would have been symptomatic and 0.3C0.4% of the population would require mechanical ventilation and/or possibly result in a fatal outcome. Higher infection attack rates are expected in more urbanized areas, but the highest incidence of critical disease is expected in remote subsistence farming settlements. School closure contributed to reduce the reproduction number by 49% and the attack rate of infections by 28C34%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the relatively low burden of COVID-19 in Ethiopia observed so far may depend on social mixing patterns, underlying demography, and the enacted school closures.

For this, we conduct a simulation study comparing the following two zero-cell corrections under the ordinary random-effects model: (i) adding 1 2 to all cells of all the individual studies' 2  2 tables independently of any zero-cell occurrences and (ii) adding 1 2 to all cells of only those 2  2 tables containing at least one zero cell. The main finding is that correction (i) performs worse than correction (ii). Thus, we strongly discourage the use of correction (i). This article is protected by copyright.

There is scarce data on rural populations' knowledge of MI, even though they are disadvantaged in access to medical emergency services. Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the rural patients' awareness of MI risk factors, symptoms, necessity of calling an ambulance in response to MI symptoms, and its determinants. Materials and Methods: An anonymous and voluntary survey was conducted among 194 patients and their caregivers with median age 68 years at a rural non-public healthcare facility in Poland. R e s u l t s: 60.3% perceive their knowledge of MI as insufficient. Only 26.3% were able to recognise all suggested MI risk factors. 44.8% did not know whether they are at risk of MI. Furthermore, 78% of respondents who had at least three MI risk factors were unaware of being at risk. 45.4% recognised at least three out of four suggested MI symptoms. 76.2% would call an ambulance in response to chest pain suggesting they have MI. Merely 80% were able to provide the emergency phone number. Moreover, among respondents who declared they would not call an ambulance, 38.7% were afraid of in-hospital COVID-19 infection or healthcare system collapse. C o n c l u s i o n s: Rural patients' knowledge of MI risk factors, symptoms, and proper response to them is insufficient. The problem is exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

We demonstrate the application of one such simple automated machine learning algorithm to a dataset obtained about COVID-19 spread in South Korea to better understand the disease dynamics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from 20th January 2020 (when the first case of COVID-19 was detected in South Korea) to 4th March 2020 was accessed from Korea's centre for disease control (KCDC). A future time-series of specified length (taken as 7 days in our study) starting from 5th March 2020 to 11th March 2020 was generated and fed to the model to generate predictions with upper and lower trend bounds of 95% confidence intervals. The model was assessed for its ability to reliably forecast using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as the metric. RESULTS: As on 4th March 2020, 145,541 patients were tested for COVID-19 (in 45 days) in South Korea of which 5166 patients tested positive. The predicted values approximated well with the actual numbers. The difference between predicted and observed values ranged from 4.08% to 12.77% . On average, our predictions differed from actual values by 7.42% (MAPE) over the same period. CONCLUSION: Open source and automated machine learning tools like Prophet can be applied and are effective in the context of COVID-19 for forecasting spread in na?ve communities.

The aim of our study was to contribute to the ongoing discussion regarding gastrointestinal complications related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. After reviewing the current literature, ours appears to be the first detailed case series on the topic. Materials and methods: A retrospective filtered search of all patients admitted to our hospital for SARS-CoV-2 infection, who developed severe gastrointestinal complications, was performed. All relevant data on hospital patient management, before and after surgery, were collected from the medical records. Results: Of the 905 patients admitted to our hospital due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as of August 26, 2020, ten of them developed severe gastrointestinal complications. Seven of those patients were men. There were four cases of perforation of the proximal jejunum, three cases of perforations of the ascending colon, one case of concomitant perforation of the sigmoid colon and terminal ileum, one case of massive intestinal necrosis, and one preoperative death. Three right colectomies, four intestinal resections, one Hartmanns procedure with bowel resection, and one primary repair of the small bowel were performed. The mortality rate of the patients analyzed was 50%. Conclusion: Spontaneous bowel perforations and acute mesenteric ischemia are emerging as severe, life-threatening complications in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Although recent reports suggest that lopinavir exhibits in vitro efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, it is a highly protein-bound drug and it remains unknown if it reaches adequate in vivo unbound (free) concentrations in lung tissue. We built a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model of lopinavir/ritonavir in white and Chinese populations. Our aim was to perform pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic correlations by comparing simulated free plasma and lung concentration values achieved using different dosing regimens of lopinavir/ritonavir with unbound half-maximal effective concentration (EC50,unbound ) and unbound effective concentration 90% values of lopinavir against SARS-CoV-2. The model was validated against multiple observed clinical datasets for single and repeated dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir. Predicted pharmacokinetic parameters, such as the maximum plasma concentration, area under the plasma concentration-time profile, oral clearance, half-life, and minimum plasma concentration at steady-state were within two-fold of clinical values for both populations. Using the current lopinavir/ritonavir regimen of 400/100 mg twice daily, lopinavir does not achieve sufficient free lung concentrations for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Although the Chinese population reaches greater plasma and lung concentrations as compared with whites, our simulations suggest that a significant dose increase from the current clinically used dosing regimen is necessary to reach the EC50,unbound value for both populations. Based on safety data, higher doses would likely lead to QT prolongation and gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), thus, any dose adjustment must be carefully weighed alongside these safety concerns.","output":"Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling to Predict the Clinical Efficacy of the Coadministration of Lopinavir and Ritonavir against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo Objetivo: Analisar as evidncias cientficas sobre a insero dos cuidados paliativos no cenrio da pandemia de COVID-19.

Although the canalith repositioning maneuver (CRM) is the standard of care, the most effective method to deliver it in the ED has been poorly studied. OBJECTIVE: To compare two protocols of the Epley maneuver for the treatment of PC-BPPV. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively recruited 101 patients with unilateral PC-BPPV on physical examination, randomizing them to either a single Epley maneuver (EM) (n = 46) or multiple maneuvers (n = 55) on the same visit. Measured outcomes included presence/absence of positional nystagmus, resolution of vertigo, and score on the dizziness handicap inventory (DHI) at follow-up evaluations. The DHI was stratified into mild (30) and moderate-severe (>30). RESULTS: Normalization of the Dix-Hallpike maneuver at day 5 was observed in 38% of the single EM group and 44.4% in the multiple EM group (p = 0.62). The DHI showed reduction from 42.2 (SD 18.4) to 31.9 (SD 23.7) in the single EM group and from 43.7 (SD 22.9) to 33.5 (SD 21.5) in the multiple EM group (p = 0.06). A higher number of patients improved from moderate-severe to mild DHI (p = 0.03) in the single EM group compared to the multi-EM group (p = 0.23). CONCLUSION: There was no statistically significant difference between performing a single EM versus multiple EMs for treatment of PC-BPPV in the emergency department. The single EM approach is associated with shorter physical contact between patients and examiner, which is logically safer in a pandemic context.","output":"A comparative study of two methods for treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in the emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infections caused by metallo--lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas are increasingly reported worldwide and are usually associated with high mortality rates (>30%).

However, since many MBL-producing strains co-produce enzymes that could hydrolyze aztreonam (e.g., AmpC, ESBL), a robust -lactamase inhibitor such as avibactam could be given as a partner drug. We performed a systematic review including 35 in vitro and 18 in vivo studies on the combination aztreonam + avibactam for infections sustained by MBL-producing Gram-negatives. In vitro data on 2209 Gram-negatives were available, showing the high antimicrobial activity of aztreonam (MIC  4 mg/L when combined with avibactam) in 80% of MBL-producing Enterobacterales, 85% of Stenotrophomonas and 6% of MBL-producing Pseudomonas. Clinical data were available for 94 patients: 83% of them had bloodstream infections. Clinical resolution within 30 days was reported in 80% of infected patients.

As it is a novel disease, we have less experience in its possible appearances. Predominantly affecting the respiratory tract, about 20-43% patients also present with extrapulmonary manifestations such as coagulation disorders with thrombotic angiopathy. CASE PRESENTATION: In our institution, a patient presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain which was caused by portal vein thrombosis. As a COVID-19 nasopharyngeal antigen swab few days earlier was negative, we performed several tests to find out its etiology. After all tests were inconclusive and the patient suffered flu-like symptoms 2 weeks before, we repeated COVID-19 molecular testing and received a positive test result. The patient was treated symptomatically and received therapeutic anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: A COVID-19 infection can also be present without typical pulmonary symptoms. In patients with severe abdominal pain and new diagnosed portal vein thrombosis, it is important to think of a COVID-19 infection. Also, the reliability of antigen nasopharyngeal swab should be considered critically, especially if performed wrongly. We recommended to perform molecular tests when in doubt. After the diagnosis of portal vein thrombosis, immediate anticoagulation is recommended to reduce the risk of further complications like intestinal infarction.","output":"Portal vein thrombosis in COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We introduce unprecedented tools to infer approximate evolution features of the COVID19 outbreak when these features are altered by containment measures.

PURPOSE: The study aims to examine the ethical sensitivity levels of physicians and nurses working in surgical units during the Covid-19 pandemic and the associating factors. METHOD: The sample of this cross-sectional online questionnaire-based study consists of 161 healthcare workers working at the surgical units in Turkish hospitals. The data were collected using the \\"Nurse Descriptive Information Form\\" developed by the researchers and the \\"Ethical Sensitivity Questionnaire.\\" ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Approval was granted by the ethics committee. Verbal and written consent was received from the healthcare workers. RESULTS: Ethical sensitivity in the dimension of conflict was found to be higher in healthcare workers who had ethical issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, who were married, who were nurses, who worked more than 45 h, and who had a work experience of 7-10 years (p < 0.05). Healthcare workers with a family member diagnosed with Covid-19 had high ethical sensitivity in the dimension of conflict (p = 0.008), while those who reported being fully competent and ready (p = 0.038) about Covid-19 were found to have low ethical sensitivity.

This population experiences a higher proportion of respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses than the general population and has been shown to have a high morbidity and mortality in relation to COVID-19. Methods We examined the number of hospital discharges to all Welsh adult care homes and the subsequent outbreaks of COVID-19 occurring over an 18 week period 22 February and 27 June 2020. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the impact of time-dependent exposure to hospital discharge on the incidence of the first known outbreak, over a window of 7-21 days after discharge, and adjusted for care home characteristics (including size, type of provision and health board). Results A total of 1068 care homes were monitored; 330 homes experienced an outbreak of COVID-19, and 511 homes received a discharge from hospital over the study period. The exposure to discharge from hospital was not associated with a significant increase in the risk of a new outbreak (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% CI 0.89, 1.49, p = 0.28), after adjusting for care home size, which was by far the most significant predictor. Hazard ratios (95% CI) in comparison to homes of <10 residents were: 3.4 (2.0, 5.8) for 10-24 residents; 8.3 (5.0, 13.8) for 25-49 residents; and 17.3 (9.6, 31.1) for homes of 50+ residents. When stratified for care home size, the outbreak rates were very similar for periods when homes were exposed to a hospital discharge, in comparison to periods when homes were unexposed. Conclusion Our analyses showed that large homes were at considerably greater risk of outbreaks throughout the epidemic, and after adjusting for care home size, a discharge from hospital was not associated with a significant increase in risk.

Additionally, the protection efficacy of several commercially available masks from such aerosols was assessed in a pilot study. METHODS: Twenty-six subjects were debonded during aerosol sampling, by using an innovative collection system to harvest bonding dust liberated during debonding. Dark-field microscopy, gram-stain microscopy, and chemical identification were used to determine speciation of the collected aerosol from 23 subjects. Three additional subjects were used to test 3 commercial dental or protective masks to determine whether they provide effective protection from the aerosol. RESULTS: Twenty-one species of oral bacteria were identified by the new sampling technique. Two of the 3 masks that were tested offered no protection against the aerosolized bacteria.

CASE REPORT: A 49-year-old man with a history of uncontrolled diabetes presented to the hospital with multiple generalized tonic clonic seizures. He had recently been diagnosed with mild COVID-19 and was treated at home with supportive care only. He was found to have cerebritis in the right frontal lobe along with right fronto-ethmoid sinusitis. He underwent extensive testing with nasal endoscopy with gram stain and culture, cryptococcal studies, 1C3-Beta-D glucan, blood cultures, fungal CSF studies, Lyme disease, HIV, Fungitell assay, and galactomannan studies, which were all negative. He was started on i.v. antibacterial therapy with cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole along with amphotericin B. After 2 weeks, his repeat imaging revealed progression of cerebritis along with new early abscess. Given these findings, his antibiotics were changed to meropenem and the amphotericin B dose was increased. He was recommended debridement and sinus surgery but refused. During the course of treatment, he developed acute kidney injury and was switched to Posaconazole. Unfortunately, the patient decided to leave against medical advice 6 weeks into admission. He was advised to continue Posaconazole and levofloxacin but he could only afford levofloxacin. He was then recommended long-term levofloxacin. He has since recovered, with resolution of cerebritis noted in follow-up imaging 1 year later. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient had mild COVID-19 infection and presented with secondary infective complications, which are usually associated with an immunocompromised state, despite receiving no immunosuppressives.

METHODS: At one hospital, health care workers received the vaccination between February and May 2021. A survey using questionnaires and spike-specific IgG antibody tests (Abbott) was conducted in 293 participants who had been vaccinated at least once and consented to this study at the time of medical checkups between April and May 2021. We calculated the antibody titer in each age group and days post-vaccination. We examined whether antibody titers of 4,000 AU/mL or higher (probability of high titer: approximately 95%, Abbott) were associated with adverse reactions after vaccination. In addition (1), the antibody titers at approximately 100 days after the second vaccination in 11 participants were remeasured. Furthermore (2), the antibody titers at approximately 260 days after the second vaccination in 13 participants were remeasured and compared with the initial measurements. RESULTS: Of the participants, 276 were post-2 doses (A), 14 were post-1 dose (B), and 3 discontinued the second vaccination (C) at the time of health checkup. The median antibody titer was 11,045.8 AU/mL (50.7-40,000) in group A, 122.7 AU/mL (2.6-1,127.0) in group B, 27,099.3 AU/mL in one of group C who had recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and 574.2 AU/mL (283.3 and 865.1) in the other two of group C. The median antibody titer was the highest in those in their 20s, and there was a significant difference between those under and above 40 years of age. The median titer was the highest in 2 weeks to 1 month after the second vaccination. After the second dose, fatigue ( moderate) was associated with antibody titers of 4,000 AU/mL or higher. The antibody titers of 11 and 13 participants at approximately 100 and 260 days after the second vaccination were significantly lower than those at the first measurement, with median values of 2,838.0 AU/mL (832.9-5,698.6) and 512.0 AU/mL (154.0-1,220.0), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Antibody titers were higher in participants under 40 years of age than those 40 years or older. In addition, the percentage of high antibody titer (a? 4,000 AU/mL) was higher in those who had severe fatigue after the second vaccination. The peak of antibody titer after the second dose was approximately 1 month, and the titer may decline gradually.","output":"[Survey of spike-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies at approximately 3 months and 9 months after vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) in health care workers]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) incidence can increase during outbreaks of infectious illnesses.

The true prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is most likely underestimated, as asymptomatic children are less frequently tested. Serologic surveys indicate that half of children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 report no symptoms. Anosmia/ageusia is not frequent in children but it is the strongest predictor of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.

OBJECTIVE To survey physicians currently using e-mail with their patients daily to understand their experiences. METHODS In-depth phone interviews of 45 physicians currently using e-mail with patients were audio taped and transcribed verbatim. Two investigators independently qualitatively coded comments. Differences were adjudicated by group consensus. RESULTS Almost all of the 642 comments from these physicians who currently use e-mail with patients daily could be grouped into 1 of 4 broad domains: (1) e-mail access and content, (2) effects of e-mail on the doctor-patient relationship, (3) managing clinical issues by e-mail, and (4) integrating e-mail into office processes. The most consistent theme was that e-mail communication enhances chronic-disease management. Many physicians also reported improved continuity of care and increased flexibility in responding to nonurgent issues. Integration of e-mail into daily workflow, such as utilization of office personnel, appears to be a significant area of concern for many of the physicians. For other issues, such as content, efficiency of e-mail, and confidentiality, there were diverging experiences and opinions. Physicians appear to be selective in choosing which patients they will communicate with via e-mail, but the criteria for selection is unclear. CONCLUSION These physician respondents did perceive benefits to e-mail with a select group of patients. Several areas, such as identifying clinical situations where e-mail communication is effective, incorporating e-mail into office flow, and being reimbursed for online medical care/communication, need to be addressed before this mode of communication diffuses into most practices.","output":"Doctors who are using e-mail with their patients: a qualitative exploration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hemodialysis (HD) patients exhibit poor functional capacity and reduced quality of life as a result of the complications associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

SUMMARY: We created a pharmacy dashboard to monitor workload and key performance indicators during the dynamic COVID-19 crisis. The dashboard accessed the prescribing workload from our clinical information system and filled prescriptions from robotic prescription dispensing systems. The aggregated data was visualized using modern tools. The dashboard presents performance data in near real time and is updated every 15 minutes. After validation during the early weeks of the COVID-19 crisis, the dashboard provided reliable data and served as a great decision support aid in calculating the backlog of prescribed but unfilled prescriptions. It also aided in adjusting manpower, identifying prescribing and dispensing patterns, identifying trends, and diverting staff resources to appropriate locations. The dashboard has been useful in clearing the backlog in a timely manner, staff planning, and predicting the next coming surge so that we can proactively minimize accumulation of backlogged prescriptions.

To this end, we developed tissue microarrays (TMA) composed of respiratory tissues from various farm animals including cattle, domestic pigs, sheep, goats, and horses. Protein histochemical staining of farm animal respiratory tissue-microarrays with HEF proteins showed that cattle have receptors present over the entire respiratory tract while receptors are only present in the nasal and pharyngeal epithelium of pigs, sheep, goats, and horses. No differences in tropism for tissues and animals were observed between clades, while hemagglutination assays showed that D/OK has a 2-fold higher binding affinity than D/660 for receptors on red blood cells. The removal of O-acetylation from receptors via saponification treatment confirmed that receptor-binding of both clades was dependent on O-acetylated sialic acids.","output":"Tissue Microarrays to Visualize Influenza D Attachment to Host Receptors in the Respiratory Tract of Farm Animals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Impact-driven research is a EU priority and, increasingly, for universities around Europe.

In our study, we have modeled the selected processes in a patient with essential hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffering from COVID-19, emphasizing the function of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system. The model has been built in the language of Petri nets theory. Using the systems approach, we have analyzed how COVID-19 may affect the studied organism, and we have checked whether the administration of selected anti-hypertensive drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)) may impact the severity of the infection. Besides, we have assessed whether these drugs effectively lower blood pressure in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection affecting essential hypertensive patients. Our research has shown that neither the ACEIs nor the ARBs worsens the course infection. However, when assessing the treatment of hypertension in the active SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have observed that ARBs might not effectively reduce blood pressure; they may even have the slightly opposite effect. On the other hand, we have confirmed the effectiveness of arterial hypertension treatment in patients receiving ACEIs. Moreover, we have found that the simultaneous use of ARBs and ACEIs averages the effects of taking both drugs, thus leading to only a slight decrease in blood pressure.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether PLI would benefit cognitive and behavioral outcomes and functional brain connectivity in older adults with milder forms of cognitive impairment. METHODS: Participants (55 y) with subjective memory decline (SMD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were assessed with tests of cognitive and physical function, self-report questionnaires, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) on a 3 Tesla scanner before and after participating in twice weekly PLI classes for 12 weeks at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center. RESULTS: Eighteen participants completed the pre-post intervention pilot trial. We observed significant improvements on the Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog; effect size 0.34, p = 0.002) and enhanced functional connections between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and other nodes of the default mode network (DMN) after PLI. Improvements (i.e., lower scores) on ADAS-cog were significantly correlated with enhanced functional connectivity between the mPFC and left lateral parietal cortex (Spearmans = C0.74, p = 0.001) and between the mPFC and right hippocampus (Spearmans = C0.83, p = 0.001). After completing PLI, participants reported significant reductions in feelings of social isolation and improvements in well-being and interoceptive self-regulation. CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings of post-PLI improvements in DMN functional connectivity, cognition, interoceptive self-regulation, well-being and reduced feelings of social isolation warrant larger randomized, controlled trials of PLI in older adults with SMD and MCI.","output":"Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLI): A Pilot Trial in Older Adults with Subjective Memory Decline and Mild Cognitive Impairment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Pandemic of COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 motivated the scientific community to work together in order to gather, organize, process and distribute data on the novel biomedical hazard.

The aim of this study was to assess the quality of the information flow and scientific collaboration, two factors we believe to be critical for finding new solutions for the ongoing pandemic. The RISmed R package, and a custom Python script were used to fetch metadata on articles indexed in PubMed and published on Rxiv preprint server.

Along with liposome, other materials are being developed for mRNA delivery that can ensure both the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, and also facilitate its storage and transportation. In this study, we investigated the polyglucin:spermidine conjugate as a carrier of an mRNA-RBD vaccine encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The conditions for the self-assembling of mRNA-PGS complexes were optimized, including the selection of the mRNA:PGS charge ratios. Using dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering it was shown that the most monodisperse suspension of nanoparticles was formed at the mRNA:PGS charge ratio equal to 1:5. The average hydrodynamic particles diameter was determined, and it was confirmed by electron microscopy. The evaluation of the zeta potential of the investigated complexes showed that the particles surface charge was close to the zero point. This may indicate that the positively charged PGS conjugate has completely packed the negatively charged mRNA molecules. It has been shown that the packaging of mRNA-RBD into the PGS envelope leads to increased production of specific antibodies with virus-neutralizing activity in immunized BALB/c mice.

METHODS: From a serosurvey of adult NYC residents (May 13-July 21, 2020), we calculated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies stratified by participant demographics, symptom history, health status, and employment industry. We used multivariable regression models to assess associations between participant characteristics and seropositivity. RESULTS: Seroprevalence among 45,367 participants was 23.6% (95% CI, 23.2%-24.0%). High seroprevalence (>30%) was observed among Black and Hispanic individuals, people from high poverty neighborhoods, and people in health care or essential worker industry sectors. COVID-19 symptom history was associated with seropositivity (adjusted relative risk=2.76; 95% CI, 2.65-2.88). Other risk factors included sex, age, race/ethnicity, residential area, employment sector, working outside the home, contact with a COVID-19 case, obesity, and increasing numbers of household members. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a large serosurvey in a single U.S. jurisdiction, we estimate that just under one-quarter of NYC adults were infected in the first few months of the COVID-19 epidemic.

The overall cleaning process involves mobile base motion, door-handle detection, and control of the HSR manipulator for the completion of the cleaning tasks. The detection part exploits a deep-learning technique to classify the image space, and provides a set of coordinates for the robot. The cooperative control between the spraying and wiping is developed in the Robotic Operating System. The control module uses the information obtained from the detection module to generate a task/operational space for the robot, along with evaluating the desired position to actuate the manipulators.

We tested peritoneal flexible endoscopy through a port placed in the abdominal wall in the early postoperative course, as a new diagnostic method for detection of this complication and evaluated the suggested method for safety, feasibility, and accuracy. METHODS Ten swine were randomized into 2 groups: group A, colorectal anastomosis without leakage; and group B, colorectal anastomosis with leakage. A button gastrostomy feeding tube was inserted percutaneously into the peritoneal cavity. Colorectal anastomosis (with or without defect) was created 48 hours after the first operation. The swine were examined by peritoneal flexible endoscopy 8 and 24 hours after the colonic operation, by a consultant surgeon who was blinded to both the presence and the allocated location of the of the anastomotic defect. RESULTS None of the animals showed signs of illness 48 hours after the intraperitoneal gastrostomy tube placement. More than half of the anastomosis circumference was identified in 60 and 10% of the animals at endoscopy 8 and 24 hours, respectively, after the anastomosis was created. Excessive adhesion formation was observed in all animals, irrespective of AL. The sensitivity and specificity of endoscopy in detecting peritonitis 24 hours after AL were both 60%. CONCLUSIONS Peritoneal endoscopy is a safe and simple procedure. Visualization of the peritoneal cavity in the early postoperative course was limited due to adhesion formation.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 inoculated primary broncho-epithelial cells (pBECs) from COPD patients support greater infection, and elucidate the effects and mechanisms involved. METHODS: We performed single cell (sc)RNA-sequencing analysis on differentiated pBECs from healthy and COPD patients 7 days after SARS-CoV-2 inoculation. We correlated changes with viral titres, pro-inflammatory responses and interferon production. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: scRNA-sequencing revealed that COPD pBECs had 24-fold greater infection than healthy cells, which was supported by plaque assays. Club/Goblet and Basal cells were the predominant populations infected and expressed mRNAs involved in viral replication. Proteases involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry/infection (TMPRSS2, CTSB) were increased and protease inhibitors (Serpins) were downregulated more so in COPD. Inflammatory cytokines linked to COPD exacerbations and severe COVID-19 were increased, while interferon responses were blunted. Co-expression analysis revealed a prominent population of Club/Goblet cells with high type 1/2 interferon responses that were important drivers of immune responses to infection in both healthy and COPD pBECs. Therapeutic inhibition of proteases and inflammatory imbalances reduced viral titres and cytokines responses, particularly in COPD pBECs. CONCLUSIONS: COPD pBECs are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to increases in co-receptor expression and protease imbalances, and have greater inflammatory responses. A prominent cluster of IFN responsive Club/Goblet cells emerges during infection which may be important drivers of immunity.

In particular, antiviral treatment used for the treatment of several viral infections (eg, hepatitis C, HIV, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus) are today used with a mild or moderate effect on the lung injury. In fact, ALI seems to be related to the inflammatory burst and release of proinflammatory mediators that induce intra-alveolar fibrin accumulation that reduces the gas exchange. Therefore, an add-on therapy with drugs able to reduce inflammation, edema, and cell activation has been proposed as well as a treatment with interferon, corticosteroids or monoclonal antibodies (eg, tocilizumab).

Splittable compounds (SCs) in Chinese are typically verbs composed of two constituents with limited separability. The separable property of SCs and their vague morpho-syntactic status are supposed to cause difficulties for L2 Chinese learners in recognizing the compounds. Especially for those whose native language manifests lexical integrity, the split presentation of the compounds may invite the L2 Chinese readers to process them with a mechanism different from that for their non-split forms. To the best of our knowledge, the efforts on investigating this issue are insufficient. In this study, 27 Spanish speaking L2 Chinese learners were invited to complete tasks including reading and interpreting 6 selected SCs in the split and non-split forms, rating their familiarities with each SC and reporting the syntactic category of the SCs based on their existing linguistic knowledge. The results, showed that the split presentation of SCs did cause challenges for L2 Chinese learners in recognizing the compounds in the reading process, regardless of their Chinese proficiencies.

RESULTS: A novel duplication PHEX variant c.574dupG (p.A192GfsX20) was identified in a family with XLH. Its pathogenicity was confirmed by the co-segregation assay and online bioinformatics database. The preoperative plan was made with the help of the PLA model. Then, arch osteotomy and transverse osteotomy were performed under the guidance of the previous simulation. The appearance of the surgical-intervened leg was satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a novel PHEX variant and showed that 3D printing tech is a very promising approach for corrective osteotomies.","output":"Genetic analysis combined with 3D-printing assistant surgery in diagnosis and treatment for an X-linked hypophosphatemia patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Telemedicine is an effective means of delivering health care in Southeast Asian (SEA) countries.

Because patients in these settings may be opioid-na?ve, the study was conducted to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple dose administration of fentanyl sublingual spray in an opioid-na?ve population. METHODS Fentanyl sublingual spray (100 mcg, 200 mcg, and 400 mcg) and fentanyl citrate intravenous (IV; 50 mcg) were administered every 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 h for up to three doses per cohort in opioid-na?ve subjects (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02641340). Eight subjects in each cohort were randomly assigned (six subjects received fentanyl sublingual spray; two subjects received fentanyl citrate IV). Pharmacokinetic and safety-related pharmacodynamic assessments were performed through 24 h post-first dose. Safety assessments were collected through Day 7. RESULTS Ninety-six opioid-na?ve subjects, aged 20-55 years, with a body mass index of 18.7-31.5 kg/m2, participated in the study. Multiple doses of fentanyl sublingual spray (100, 200, and 400 mcg) were generally well tolerated. Hypoxia, observed in the 200-mcg and 400-mcg dose groups, increased with increasing doses and higher dosing frequency, but was readily managed by nasal cannula oxygenation. Overall, nausea increased with increasing doses, and 52.6% (10 out of 19) cases of nausea that occurred at the highest dose of 400 mcg were treated with concomitant medication. Overall, the reported adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of fentanyl. CONCLUSION Fentanyl sublingual spray (100 mcg, 200 mg, and 400 mcg) administered every 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h was generally well tolerated in an opioid-na?ve population. The results suggest that doses of 200 mcg or lower may be safe for use in an opioid-na?ve population.","output":"Pharmacokinetics and safety of fentanyl sublingual spray and fentanyl citrate intravenous: a multiple ascending dose study in opioid-na?ve healthy volunteers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our aim was to assess the tomographic presence of diabetic macular edema in type 2 diabetes patients screened for diabetic retinopathy with color fundus photographs and an artificial intelligence algorithm.

Objective We investigated the incidence, clinical characteristics, risk factors and outcomes of ACS in patients with COVID-19 attending the emergency department (ED). Methods We retrospectively reviewed all COVID-19 patients diagnosed with ACS in 62 Spanish EDs during March-April 2020 (first wave of COVID-19). We formed two control groups: COVID-19 patients without ACS (control A) and non-COVID-19 patients with ACS (control B). Unadjusted comparisons between cases and controls were performed regarding 58 characteristics and outcomes. Results We identified 110 ACS in 74,814 patients with COVID-19 attending the ED (1.48, 95%CI=1.21-1.78). This incidence was lower than that observed in non-COVID-19 patients (3.64, 95%CI=3.54-3.74; OR=0.40, 95%CI=0.33-0.49). The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients associated with a higher risk of presenting ACS were: previous coronary artery disease, age 60 years, hypertension, chest pain, raised troponin, and hypoxemia. Need for hospitalisation and admission to intensive care and in-hospital mortality were higher in cases than in control group A (adjusted OR [aOR] 6.36 [95%CI=1.84-22.1], aOR 4.63 [95%CI=1.88-11.4], aOR 2.46 [95%CI=1.15-5.25]).

However, U-Net applies skip connections to merge semantically different low- and high-level convolutional features, resulting in not only blurred feature maps, but also over- and under-segmented target regions. To address these limitations, we propose a simple, yet effective end-to-end depthwise encoder-decoder fully convolutional network architecture, called Sharp U-Net, for binary and multi-class biomedical image segmentation. The key rationale of Sharp U-Net is that instead of applying a plain skip connection, a depthwise convolution of the encoder feature map with a sharpening kernel filter is employed prior to merging the encoder and decoder features, thereby producing a sharpened intermediate feature map of the same size as the encoder map. Using this sharpening filter layer, we are able to not only fuse semantically less dissimilar features, but also to smooth out artifacts throughout the network layers during the early stages of training. Our extensive experiments on six datasets show that the proposed Sharp U-Net model consistently outperforms or matches the recent state-of-the-art baselines in both binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, while adding no extra learnable parameters. Furthermore, Sharp U-Net outperforms baselines that have more than three times the number of learnable parameters.","output":"Sharp U-Net: Depthwise Convolutional Network for Biomedical Image Segmentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns in 2020 negatively impacted high school students, with increased depression and anxiety especially in athletes who participated in team sports. For adolescents with disabilities, physical activity provides physical and mental health benefits; however, the impact of COVID-19 related adaptive sports cancellations have not been thoroughly investigated. HYPOTHESIS: Adaptive athletes with lower activity levels during a period of COVID-19 related restrictions will have worse scores of depression, anxiety, and quality of life. METHODS: Institutional Review Board (IRB) exemption was granted. Adaptive athletes ages 12-21 were identified through Midwestern adaptive athletic associations. Athletes completed a survey between June 2020 and January 2021 including Patient Health Questionairre-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) anxiety, Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for activity level, and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. PFABS and PedsQL were modified as appropriate to adaptive athletes. Univariate analysis was performed using chi-square tests to assess the association between activity and mental health. Student T-tests were used for multivariate analysis to assess the role of sex, grade in school, and individual vs team sport participation on quality of life. RESULTS: Twenty-four respondents completed the survey in its entirety, with majority from Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Illinois. Demographics are shown in Table 1. There was no significant association between physical activity levels and GAD-7 (R(2)=-0.040), PHQ-9 (R(2)=-0.020) or PedsQL (R(2)=-0.043). Activity levels of adaptive sports athletes did not differ by gender, sport type or school grade (Table 1). DISCUSSION: Unlike previous work in able-bodied adolescents, we found no correlation between physical activity and scores related to depression and anxiety among adolescent adaptive sports athletes during COVID-19. Additionally, there were no difference in activity levels nor mental health scores by gender, sport type nor school grade, a proxy for age. While, the sample size in this study was a fraction of those used in previous work, adaptive athletes are a small proportion of adolescent athletes. Adaptive athletes, who face greater challenges in society on a daily basis, may have had lower quality of life measures at baseline or more sophisticated coping mechanisms already in place providing fortitude in mental health in the face of the pandemic.

Expression profiles represent snapshots of combined genetic, socio-environmental (including socioeconomic and environmental factors), and physiological effects on the molecular phenotype. As such, they have potential to improve biological understanding of differences among populations, and provide therapeutic biomarkers and environmental mitigation strategies. Here, we undertook a large-scale assessment of patterns of gene expression between African Americans and European Americans, mining RNA-Seq data from 25 non-diseased and diseased (tumor) tissue-types. We observed the widespread enrichment of pathways implicated in COVID-19 and integral to inflammation and reactive oxygen stress. Chemokine CCL3L3 expression is up-regulated in African Americans. GSTM1, encoding a glutathione S-transferase that metabolizes reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics, is upregulated. The little-studied F8A2 gene is up to 40-fold more highly expressed in African Americans; F8A2 encodes HAP40 protein, which mediates endosome movement, potentially altering the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2. African American expression signatures, superimposed on single cell-RNA reference data, reveal increased number or activity of esophageal glandular cells and lung ACE2-positive basal keratinocytes. Our findings establish basal prognostic signatures that can be used to refine approaches to minimize risk of severe infection and improve precision treatment of COVID-19 for African Americans.

Here we describe a strategy utilizing pan-family viral assays to improve early accessibility of large-scale nucleic acid testing. METHODS: Coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 were used as a case-study for assessing utility of pan-family viral assays during the early stages of a novel pandemic. Specificity of a pan-coronavirus (Pan-CoV) assay for a novel pathogen was assessed using the frequency of common human coronavirus (HCoV) species in key populations. A reported Pan-CoV assay was assessed to determine sensitivity to 60 reference coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The resilience of the primer target regions of this assay to mutation was assessed in 8893 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes to predict ongoing utility during pandemic progression. RESULTS: Due to common HCoV species, a Pan-CoV assay would return false positives for as few as 1% of asymptomatic adults, but up to 30% of immunocompromised patients with respiratory disease. Half of reported Pan-CoV assays identify SARS-CoV-2 and with small adjustments can accommodate diverse variation observed in animal coronaviruses. The target region of one well established Pan-CoV assay is highly resistant to mutation compared to species-specific SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays. CONCLUSIONS: Despite cross-reactivity with common pathogens, pan-family assays may greatly assist management of emerging pandemics through prioritization of high-resolution testing or isolation measures. Targeting highly conserved genomic regions make pan-family assays robust and resilient to mutation.

Lactulose-hydrogen breath testing for concomitant small intestinal bacterial overgrowth was performed at baseline and repeated at week 24, together with the urea breath test. RESULTS: A total of 310 patients were screened for eligibility and 80 were randomly assigned, of whom 67 were included in the full-analysis set (32 treatment group patients, 35 placebo patients). HP eradication did not improve MDS-UPDRS motor scores at week 12 (mean difference 2.6 points in favor of placebo, 95% confidence interval: -0.4 to 5.6, P = 0.089).

Such support should be informed by patient preferences and needs. The objective of this study was to gather information from individuals with tinnitus living in Europe to inform stakeholders of the (a) support they needed in relation to changes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and (b) suggestions regarding tinnitus care for the future. METHODS: A cross-sectional mixed method study design was used using closed and open-ended questions via an online survey. Data were gathered from 710 adults experiencing tinnitus in Western Europe, with the majority living in The Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Those with tinnitus indicated the following support needs during the pandemic (a) support for tinnitus, (b) support for hearing-related difficulties, (c) social support and (d) pandemic-related support. Five directions for future tinnitus care were provided, namely, (a) need for understanding professional support and access to multidisciplinary experts, (b) greater range of therapies and resources, (c) access to more information about tinnitus, (d) prioritising tinnitus research and (e) more support for hearing protection and hearing loss prevention. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to the need for accessible (remote), patient-centred, suitable and evidence-based tinnitus care.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, extensively explored as clinical agents for COVID-19, have multiple cellular effects including alkalizing lysosomes and blocking autophagy as well as exhibiting dose-limiting toxicities in patients. To identify an alternative lysosome-based drug repurposing opportunity we evaluated additional lysosomotropic compounds . We found that six of these compounds blocked the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values ranging from 2.0 to 13 ?M and selectivity indices (SIs;SI = CC50/EC50) ranging from 1.5- to &gt;10-fold. We demonstrate how the compounds (1) blocked lysosome functioning and autophagy, (2) prevented pseudotyped particle entry, (3) increased lysosomal pH, and (4) that ROC-325 reduced viral titers in the EpiAirway 3D tissue model. Consistent with these findings, the siRNA knockdown of ATP6V0D1 blocked the HCoV-NL63 cytopathic effect in LLC-MK2 cells. Moreover, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cell lysate revealed significant dysregulation of autophagy and lysosomal function, suggesting a contribution of the lysosome to the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2.

Therefore, we aimed to describe the distribution of these risk factors across Europe. Subject and methods: Prevalence of risk factors for severe COVID-19 was identified based on interviews from 73,274 Europeans aged 50+ participating in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) in 2017. Burden of disease was estimated using population data from Eurostat. Results: A total of 75.3% of the study population (corresponding to approx. 60 million European men and 71 million women) had at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19, 45.9% (approx. 36 million men and 43 million women) had at least two factors, and 21.2% (approx. 17 million men and 20 million women) had at least three risk factors.

Secondarily, the report highlights the importance of assessing cognitive and emotional health in patients with postCCOVID syndrome. METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): A 37-year-old woman tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and developed mild COVID-19 disease but did not require supplemental oxygen or hospitalization. The patient experienced persistent symptoms including dyspnea, headaches, and cognitive fog. On day 62, she participated in an outpatient physical therapist evaluation that revealed deficits in exercise capacity, obtaining 50% of her age-predicted 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). She had minor reductions in muscle strength and cognitive function. Self-reported quality of life (QoL) was 50, and she scored above established cut-off scores for provisional diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). RESULTS: The patient participated in biweekly physical therapist sessions for 8 weeks, which included aerobic training, strengthening exercises, diaphragmatic breathing techniques, and mindfulness training. Metabolic equivalent for task (METS) levels increased with variability over the course of the program. The patients muscle strength, physical function, and exercise capacity improved. 6MWD increased by 199 m, equating to 80% of her age-predicted distance. QoL and PTSD scores did not improve. At evaluation after physical therapy, the patient was still experiencing migraines, dyspnea, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. CONCLUSION: This case report described the clinical presentation and physical therapist management of a person with postCCOVID syndrome, a novel health condition for which little evidence exists to guide rehabilitation examination and interventions. Physical therapists should consider cognitive function and emotional health in their plan of care for patients with postCCOVID syndromes.

As a consequence, several measures have been taken to mitigate the virus spread worldwide. In the city of Florianpolis, in southern Brazil, a strict lockdown was implemented on 16 March 2020. Although commercial activities were allowed to resume 21 April, a complete lockdown of municipal public buildings (e.g., administrative buildings and schools) lasted up to 5 August 2020. Reports in the literature emphasize the influence of occupant presence and actions on energy use in buildings. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the electric energy use of municipal buildings in Florianpolis. A large database with monthly electric energy use data was provided by the City Hall and analyzed. Firstly, the consumer units were grouped into three categories: systems, services and buildings. This revealed that buildings were directly affected by the lockdown measures, but systems and services were not. Therefore, an in-depth evaluation of health centers, administrative buildings, elementary schools and nursery schools was conducted and mean electric energy reductions of 11.1%, 38.6%, 50.3%, and 50.4%, respectively, were observed. Although it may initially seem unexpected, municipal health centers had a small electric energy use reduction, because they were not directly responsible for COVID-19 treatment, as patients were forwarded to specific facilities. Walkthroughs and energy audits were performed in an administrative building, an elementary school, and a nursery school, to gain a deeper understanding of the consumption trends. It was observed that municipal buildings present a basal energy use intensity even when the buildings are unoccupied. Energy audits verified that stand-by loads and vital loads, such as lighting for safety and computer servers, play a key role in this share of energy use.","output":"Addressing the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on energy use in municipal buildings: a case study in Florianpolis, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: Employment and Return to Work (RTW) rates following spinal cord injury/disease (SCI/D) are low due to individual and impairments characteristics, secondary health conditions, social and environmental barriers, prior work experience, workplace supports and resources, and physical or psychosocial work demands. To improve RTW, the SCI-High Project team developed a set of Employment structure, process, and outcome indicators for adults with SCI/D in the first 18 months after rehabilitation admission. METHODS: A pan-Canadian Working Group of diverse stakeholders: (1) defined the Employment construct; (2) conducted a systematic search of available outcomes measures; (3) constructed a Driver diagram summarizing factors associated with employment. Subsequent facilitated meetings allowed for the creation of structure and process indicators, and the selection of outcome indicators. RESULTS: The structure indicator is the proportion of SCI/D rehabilitation programs with an employment resource center. The process indicator is the proportion of SCI/D rehabilitation inpatients who receive an employment assessment during inpatient rehabilitation. The intermediary and final outcome measures are the Readiness for Return-to-Work Scale (RRTW) and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI). Scale A of the RRTW for those who are unemployed and Scale B of RRTW and WPAI will be used for those who are employed. CONCLUSION: This framework of Employment indicators intends to support the RTW needs of persons with SCI/D by ensuring that rehabilitation professionals provide opportunities to explore RTW within the first 18 months after rehab admission.

Baseline data were compared with re-audit data following pathway adoption to assess the impact on anaemia, ferritin levels and blood transfusion. Methods: Following local audit approval, anonymous data collection was performed using the electronic maternity database (Euroking), blood bank and electronic patient records. Haemoglobin (Hb) and ferritin results in the month of May (baseline data) and November (Nov, re-audit) were compared, in addition to red blood cell transfusion data. Booking (10C14 weeks gestation), 28 week (27C30 weeks gestation) and term bloods (37 weeks onwards) were collected. Categorical data were analysed using chi-squared test and continuous data compared using unpaired students T-test (Microsoft Excel). Results: Mean Hb results are summarised in the Table. Term Hb was recorded in [Formula presented]8% of women in both audits. The number of women with Hb [Formula presented]05g/L at term was 9.1% in May vs 7.1% in Nov ([Formula presented]= 0.37), whilst blood transfusion was administered in 3.4% vs 2.6% ([Formula presented]= 0.66).

We sought to investigate how the pandemic scenario impacted the quality of a long-established enhanced recovery protocol colorectal surgery program in 2 referral centers, designated as colorectal surgery hubs, located in the epicentral Italian regions hardest hit by the pandemic. METHODS: We compared short-term outcomes of patients undergoing major colorectal surgery with a long-established enhanced recovery protocol during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak occurred in 2020 (group A) with the correspondent timeframe of 2019 (group B). Primary outcomes were morbidity and mortality, duration of stay, and readmission rate. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six patients underwent major colorectal surgery in group A and 173 in group B. Postoperative complications and readmission rate were comparable between the 2 groups. Oncologic case-log was predominant in group A compared with group B (73.5 vs 61%; P = .01). A significantly shorter overall duration of stay was found in group A (P < .001).

ACE2 expression may be associated with COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. Routinely prescribed drugs that up- or down-regulate ACE2 expression are, therefore, of critical research interest as agents that might promote or reduce risk of COVID-19 infection in a susceptible population. AIM: To collate evidence on routinely prescribed drug treatments in the UK that could up- or down-regulate ACE2, and thus potentially affect COVID-19 infection. DESIGN & SETTING: Systematic review of studies published in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception to 1 April 2020. METHOD: A systematic review will be conducted in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Inclusion criteria will be: (1) assesses the effect of drug exposure on ACE2 level of expression or activity; (2) the drug is included in the British National Formulary (BNF) and, therefore, available to prescribe in the UK; and (3) a control, placebo, or sham group is included as comparator. Exclusion criteria will be: (1) ACE2 measurement in utero; (2) ACE2 measurement in children aged <18 years; (3) drug not in the BNF; and (4) review article.

Methods We collected the data during February to April 2020 by reviewing the contents of Essential Information of Community Health Professionals in Beijing legally reported to Beijing Municipal Health Commission We analyzed the trend of changes in the quantity,structure,post attraction and distribution inequality(using Gini coefficient) of incumbent CPH professionals during 10 consecutive years(2010-2019) using descriptive analysis Results: The annual growth rate of the number of CPH professionals was 5 58%(from 2 139 in 2010 to 3 488 in 2019),which was higher than that of community

Primary evaluation of male factor infertility includes a semen analysis (SA). The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria is widely used to interpret SA. However, the current normative values seen in WHO criteria have led to research showing racial disparities in prevalence of abnormal SA. OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship between different self-reported racial groups and rates of abnormal SA. MATERIALS & METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a single large tertiary care facility. All men who underwent a SA for evaluation of suspected male infertility, unexplained infertility, intrauterine insemination, and in vitro fertilization between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019, were considered for inclusion in the study. Exclusion criteria were unreported race or ethnicity, SA for fertility preservation only, history of varicocele or testicular surgery, chromosomal abnormalities, congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens, prior testosterone use, or prior exposure to chemotherapy and/or radiation. Samples obtained via testicular sperm extraction or postejaculatory urine collection, or those analyzed 1 hour from ejaculation, were also excluded. RESULTS 872 SAs were identified, of which 615 met inclusion criteria, yielding 384 normal and 231 abnormal results. Only race (p<0.0001) and age (p=0.002) were statistically significant. Black men had the highest rate of abnormal SA (54%) and were significantly more likely to have lower semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count, percent motile sperm, and total motile sperm (p<0.05). In a logistic regression model, controlling for age and using White Non-Hispanic as the referent group, only Blacks had lower odds for a normal SA (OR=0.41, 95% CI 0.28, 0.60). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Black men are more likely to have an abnormal SA based on the 2010 WHO criteria. Black men seeking infertility treatment should be educated on the incidence of abnormal SA and actively seek infertility evaluation.","output":"Investigation of racial disparities in semen parameters among White, Black, and Asian men."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Much progress has been made since plasma was discovered in the early 1900s.

Plasma began to be used mainly for environmental problems, such as water purification and wastewater treatment, and subsequent research on plasma and liquid interaction led to the birth of plasma-activated liquid (PAL). PAL is currently used in the fields of environment, food, agriculture, nanoparticle synthesis, analytical chemistry, and sterilization.

The practical challenges, however, have often led to testing only symptomatic individuals and their close contacts. As many countries plan for a cautious relaxation of social restrictions, more effective approaches for widescale testing are increasingly important. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratories in several countries demonstrated the feasibility of detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection by pooled testing, which combines the specimens from several individuals. Since no further testing is needed for individuals in a negative pool, there is potential for greater efficiency of testing. Despite validations of the accuracy of the results and the efficiency in testing specific groups, the benefits of pooling are less acknowledged as a population surveillance strategy that can detect new disease outbreaks without posing restrictions on entire societies. Pooling specimens from natural clusters, such as school classes, sports teams, workplace colleagues and other social networks, would enable timely and cost-effective widescale testing for SARS-CoV-2. The initial result would be readily translatable into action in terms of quarantine and isolation policies. Clusters of uninfected individuals would be quickly identified and immediate local lockdown of positive clusters would be the appropriate and sufficient action while retesting those individuals. By adapting to the social networks of a population, pooled testing offers a cost-efficient surveillance system that is synchronized with quarantine policies that are rational, risk-based and equitable.","output":"Pooled testing for SARS-CoV-2, options for efficiency at scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, the world is experiencing a pandemic crisis due to the spread of COVID-19, a novel coronavirus disease.

These trends were compared to the same timeframe from 2017 to 2019. RESULTS: Between 1st March and 12th September 2020, there was a 23% reduction in cancer diagnoses compared to the same time period in the preceding 3 years.

Objectives: We aimed to study the clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological results, treatment aspects and clinical outcomes of kidney transplant patients with COVID-19. Patient and Methods: Twenty consecutive kidney transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from two tertiary care centers from India were retrospectively studied from July 1 to Oct 31, 2020. Results: Of 20 patients, 18 required admission;mean age was 42.89.39 years and 18 out of 20 (90%) were male. Symptom onset to testing time was a mean of 3.051.47 days. All patients were on triple immunosuppression. The median time since transplantation to COVID-19 was 3.75 years (IQR 2.37-5.41). Fever, cough and breathlessness were the most common presenting symptoms. Nine out of twenty (45%) had severe COVID-19 while six out of 20 (30%) required intensive care. Twelve (60%) patients had lymphopenia. Additionally mycophenolate was withheld in seventeen out of twenty (85 %) and enoxaparin and intravenous methylprednisolone were administered in all hospitalized patients while remdesivir was prescribed in 16 out of 20 (80%). Moreover, acute kidney injury (AKI) was seen in five out of 20 (25%) since one of died (5%). After a median hospital stay of 8.5 days (IQR 6.75-15.5), seventeen patients were discharged from the hospital. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant recipients is usually a moderate-severe form. COVID-19 should be a differential diagnosis for fever in this high-risk population however lymphopenia may not be seen in all. Antimetabolite withdrawal, intravenous steroid, anticoagulation and early remdesivir were all found to be safe and effective strategies for improving outcomes.

This impact was marked for individuals with long-term health conditions and comorbid depression and anxiety. Many face-to-face mental health services switched to remote delivery or paused therapeutic input entirely, despite the lack of research on the efficacy of switching between modalities mid-therapy or having breaks in therapy. This paper presents the case of a patient with long-term health conditions who experienced both breaks in therapy and a switch in modalities from face-to-face to telephone delivery. The intervention used was based on transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy and self-report measures were completed at the beginning and end of the twelve sessions. Despite the shift in modalities, the patient experienced clinically significant recovery on all measures, indicating the efficacy of therapy was not greatly affected by the shift in modalities. Long breaks in therapy were linked to deterioration in mental health, although this could be due to the deterioration in physical health that necessitated these breaks. This case highlights the benefits and challenges of a shifting modality of therapy during treatment and in response to a pandemic for a shielding population. From the work presented here, it seems beneficial for services to be able to work across multiple modalities to suit the needs of the patients and ensure continuity of treatment. It also indicates that pauses in therapy may risk deterioration.

In case of major intra-operative bleeding in patients likely to have therapeutic or supra-therapeutic levels of anticoagulation, specific reversal agents/antidotes would be of value but are currently lacking.

The rapid speed of COVID-19 vaccine development, utilization of novel technology, and an atmosphere of politicized misinformation have created a perfect storm for vaccine hesitancy. As early adopters of vaccination, HCWs set an example for the general population; as trusted sources of medical information, they educate and inform. However, comparatively little work has investigated HCWs' attitudes toward vaccination and how those attitudes drive their recommendation behavior. METHODS: We surveyed hospital employees about their personal reasons for hesitancy and beliefs about patient hesitancies and randomly assigned them to see one of three messages aimed at increasing vaccine confidence. Message themes included an appeal to return to normal life (Normalcy), a risk comparison between vaccinating or not (SDT), and an explanation of the speed of safe and effective vaccine development (Process). RESULTS: Of the 674 NC hospital employees who completed our survey in February 2021, 98% had been offered the COVID-19 vaccine, and 80% had already accepted. For the 20% who had not received the vaccine, the top reasons for hesitancy involved the speed of development and testing, and concerns of vaccine safety and effectiveness. We also found differences in susceptibility to misinformation and vaccine hesitancy across political affiliation, which was higher in Republicans compared to Democrats. HCWs were generally very comfortable recommending the COVID-19 vaccine to patients and supported the idea of sharing the message they read. Although the risk comparison message was most trusted personally, the process message was rated as both the most helpful to patients and the most likely to be shared with them (see Figure 1). This suggests that what is most appealing on a personal level is not necessarily what a HCW would recommend to their patients. Rating of personal opinions of the passages.

This chart shows the average message ratings across the board when answering whether they thought the passages were understandable, helpful, correct, believable, and trustworthy. (Error bars are 95% CI) There was no significant difference across the messages. The Process message is seen as most helpful and is most likely to be shared with patient than the other messages [Image: see text] On left, the average answer on a scale from 1 to 5 for Do you think the passage you just read would help your patients feel more comfortable about getting the vaccine? and on right, the average answer for Would you share this passage with your patients?

We investigated changes in perceived diet quality and cooking practices during the lockdown in comparison with the preceding period. Between June 9 and 30, 2020, 2422 participants were recruited and completed a questionnaire regarding the evolution of their overall diet and cooking habits during the lockdown. Descriptive analyses showed that 41.5% of participants described dietary changes with a similar proportion reporting positive or negative changes (22.0% and 19.5%, respectively). The exceptional circumstances of the lockdown provided a positive opportunity for some people to improve their diet quality by spending more time cooking (54.8% of those reporting a positive change) or eating more fresh products, including fruits and vegetables (47.4%). By contrast, other participants reported a decline in their diet quality, mainly caused by poorer dietary choices due to the consumption of comfort food (50.3% of those reporting a negative change), snacking (40.1%), or food supply issues (35.9%). The lockdown led to a massive rise in home cooking with 42.0% of all participants cooking more frequently (vs 7.0% cooking less), as barriers such as time constraints were reduced. Using multivariate analyses, we found that this change in cooking frequency varied among population subgroups, especially in regard to financial situation, as individuals in financial difficulty tended to cook less. As home cooking has already been linked to better diet quality and thus health status, our results suggest that the lockdown increased social health inequalities.

However, many diseases are not yet preventable by vaccination, and vaccines have not been fully exploited for target populations such as elderly and pregnant women. This review focuses on the state of the art of recent clinical trials of vaccines for major unmet medical needs such as HIV, malaria, TB, and cancer. In addition, we describe the innovative technologies currently used in vaccine research and development including adjuvants, vectors, nucleic acid vaccines, and structure\\\\based antigen design. The hope is that thanks to these technologies, more diseases will be addressed in the 21st century by novel preventative and therapeutic vaccines.","output":"Vaccines for the 21st century"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine associations among instructional approaches, school start times, and sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large, nationwide sample of U.S. adolescents. METHODS: Cross-sectional, anonymous self-report survey study of a community-dwelling sample of adolescents (grades 6C12), recruited through social media outlets in October/November 2020. Participants reported on instructional approach (in-person, online/synchronous, online/asynchronous) for each weekday (past week), school start times (in-person or online/synchronous days), and bedtimes (BT) and wake times (WT) for each identified school type and weekends/no school days. Sleep opportunity was calculated as BT-to-WT interval. Night-to-night sleep variability was calculated with mean square successive differences. RESULTS: Respondents included 5,245 racially and geographically diverse students (~50% female). BT and WT were earliest for in-person instruction; followed by online/synchronous days. Sleep opportunity was longer on individual nights students did not have scheduled instruction (>1.5 h longer for online/asynchronous than in-person). More students obtained sufficient sleep with later school start times. However, even with the same start times, more students with online/synchronous instruction obtained sufficient sleep than in-person instruction. Significantly greater night-to-night variability in sleep-wake patterns was observed for students with in-person hybrid schedules versus students with online/synchronous + asynchronous schedules. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide important insights regarding the association between instructional approach and school start times on the timing, amount, and variability of sleep in U.S. adolescents. Given the public health consequences of short and variable sleep in adolescents, results may be useful for education and health policy decision-making for post-pandemic secondary schools.","output":"COVID-19 instructional approaches (in-person, online, hybrid), school start times, and sleep in over 5,000 U.S. adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Despite considerable progress in the understanding of clinical pertussis, the contemporary emergence of antimicrobial resistance for Bordetella pertussis and an evolution of concerns with acellular component vaccination have both sparked a renewed interest. Although simian models of infection best correlate with the observed attributes of human infection, several animal models have been used for decades and have positively contributed in many ways to the related science. Nevertheless, there is yet the lack of a reliable small animal model system that mimics the combination of infection genesis, variable upper and lower respiratory infection, systemic effects, infection resolution, and vaccine responses. This narrative review examines the history and attributes of non-primate animal models for pertussis and places context with the current use and needs. Emerging from the latter is the necessity for further such study to better create the optimal model of infection and vaccination with use of current molecular tools and a broader range of animal systems. KEY POINTS: ? Currently used and past non-primate animal models of B. pertussis infection often have unique and focused applications. ? A non-primate animal model that consistently mimics human pertussis for the majority of key infection characteristics is lacking. ? There remains ample opportunity for an improved non-primate animal model of pertussis with the use of current molecular biology tools and with further exploration of species not previously considered.

Further studies showed that for non-thiolated DNA/RNA the conjugation is poly (T/U) tag dependent. Spectroscopy, test strip hybridization, and loading counting experiments indicate that low-affinity poly (T/U) tag mediates the formation of a standing-up conformation, which is distributed in the outer layer of such a SNA structure. In further applications study, CRISPR/Cas9-sgRNA (135 bp), RNA from Nucleocapsid (N) gene of SARS-CoV-2 (1279 bp), and rolling circle amplification (RCA) DNA products (over 1000 bp) could be successfully attached on AuNPs, which overcomes the routine methods in long-chain nucleic acid-AuNP conjugation, exhibiting great promise in novel biosensing and nucleic acids delivery strategy.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the proportion of hematological cancer patients with the SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A comprehensive literature review was performed on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EKB SciELO, SID, CNKI and Wanfang databases to retrieve all relevant publications up to January 31, 2021. Observational studies, consecutive case-series and case-control studies were included. The proportion for hematological cancer patients with COVID-19 was estimated using the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (95% CIs). RESULTS: Fourteen studies with a total of 3,770 infected cancer patients and 685 hematological cancer cases with COVID-19 were selected. Combined data revealed that the overall proportion of hematological cancer patients with COVID-19 was 16.5% (95% CI 0.130 - 0.208, p  0.001). The stratified analysis by ethnicity showed that the proportion was 18.8% and 12.4% in Caucasian and Asian hematological cancer patients with COVID-19, respectively. Moreover, subgroup analysis by country of origin showed that its proportion was the highest in the United Kingdom (22.5%), followed by France (17.1%) and China (8.2%). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis result indicated that the proportion of hematological cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic was 16.5%.

To mobilize sustainable funding for global CGH, it is critical first to understand existing financing flowing to different types of global CGH. In this study, we estimate trends in international spending for global CGH in 2013, 2015, and 2017, encompassing the era before and after the Ebola epidemic. We use a measure of international funding that combines official development assistance (ODA) for health with additional international spending on R&D for diseases of poverty, a measure called ODA+. We classify ODA+ into funding for three global functions-provision of global public goods, management of cross-border externalities, and fostering of global health leadership and stewardship-and country-specific aid. International funding for global functions increased between 2013 and 2015 by $1.4 billion to a total of $7.3 billion in 2015. It then declined to $7.0 billion in 2017, accounting for 24% of all ODA+ in 2017. These findings provide empirical evidence of the reactive nature of international funders for global CGH. While international funders increased funding for global functions in response to the Ebola outbreak, they failed to sustain that funding.

During the first semester of the first year, medical students take a combined Biochemistry, Cell Biology and Histology block (called BCT) after successfully finishing an anatomy block. Historically, the medical students have had difficulties in both assimilating the amount of content presented and in appreciating how the topics covered in BCT help them better understand the pathophysiology and treatment of diseases. Further, because the COVID-19 environment prompted a change from a categorical to a Pass/Fail grading system and shifted the delivery of didactic material from in-person to remote learning, retention of student engagement became a priority. It has been demonstrated by others that using clinical correlations to teach basic science concepts is an effective way to enhance student engagement and retention of basic science knowledge. The primary hypothesis for this study was that student engagement and interest in basic science knowledge would be enhanced by the incorporation of a clinically oriented, case-based exercise. A second hypothesis was that students would be able to apply information provided during lectures to successfully complete it. The BCT block is 8 weeks long and consists of 3 units primarily focused on medical biochemistry (unit 1), cell biology (unit 2) and histology (unit 3). The case study, focused on diabetes, was designed to run as a ?thread? through all of the units and build in complexity with each unit in order to better understand the pathophysiology of this disease. The case was revealed progressively in three units, each of which consisted of a portion of an hypothetical scenario and a matched, five-question quiz that was offered both at the beginning and the end of each unit. The correct answers were given to the students after completion of each post-quiz. To enhance student participation, 2% was added to their grade after successful completion of at least 3 quizzes. Comparison of the pre- and post-quiz data revealed that for units 1 and 3, students scored significantly higher on post-quizzes as compared to pre-quizzes (unit 1- 86% vs 48%, a 78% change, and unit 3- 66% vs 61%, an 8.9% change). For unit 2, there was a trend toward significance;however, the average post-quiz score (87% vs 83%, a 4.5% change) was not significantly different from the pre-quiz score (p=0.07). Students responded favorably to the exercise (as reported in an end-of-block survey), wherein it was ranked higher as a learning resource than any of the recommended textbooks or atlases. Collectively, these data reveal that addition of a case study effectively enhances students' learning of the didactic material as well as their ability to apply basic science knowledge to a clinical case-based scenario.","output":"Incorporation of a clinically oriented case study into a multi-subject medical school block increased student engagement in a remote learning environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the pandemic of COVID-19, people around the world increasingly work from home.

Hyperproliferative cells eventually obstruct the lung vasculature, leading to irreversible lesions that collectively drive pulmonary pressure to life-threatening levels. Although the primary cause of PAH is not fully understood, several studies have indicated it results from chronic pulmonary inflammation, such as observed in response to pathogens' infection. Curiously, infection by the intravascular parasite Schistosoma mansoni recapitulates several aspects of the widespread pulmonary inflammation that leads to development of chronic PAH. Globally, >200 million people are currently infected by Schistosoma spp., with about 5% developing PAH (Sch-PAH) in response to the parasite egg-induced obliteration and remodeling of the lung vasculature. Before their settling into the lungs, Schistosoma eggs are released inside the mesenteric veins, where they either cross the intestinal wall and disturb the gut microbiome or migrate to other organs, including the lungs and liver, increasing pressure. Spontaneous or surgical liver bypass via collateral circulation alleviates the pressure in the portal system; however, it also allows the translocation of pathogens, toxins, and antigens into the lungs, ultimately causing PAH.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 416 Rohingya older adults aged 60 years and above residing in Rohingya refugee camps situated in the Coxs Bazar district of Bangladesh and was conducted in October 2020. A purposive sampling technique was followed, and participants perceived difficulties in accessing medicines and routine medical care were noted through face-to-face interviews. Binary logistic regression models determined the association between outcome and explanatory variables. RESULTS: Overall, one-third of the participants reported difficulties in accessing medicines and routine medical care. Significant factors associated with facing difficulties accessing medicine included feelings of loneliness (adjusted OR (AOR) 3.54, 95% CI 1.93 to 6.48), perceptions that older adults were at the highest risk of COVID-19 (AOR 3.35, 95% CI 1.61 to 6.97) and required additional care during COVID-19 (AOR 6.89, 95% CI 3.62 to 13.13). Also, the notable factors associated with difficulties in receiving routine medical care included living more than 30 min walking distance from the health centre (AOR 3.57, 95% CI 1.95 to 6.56), feelings of loneliness (AOR 2.20, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.87), perception that older adults were at the highest risk of COVID-19 (AOR 2.85, 95% CI 1.36 to 5.99) and perception that they required additional care during the pandemic (AOR 4.55, 95% CI 2.48 to 8.35).

A node embedding is universal if it is designed to be used by and benefit various downstream tasks. This work introduces PanRep, a graph neural network (GNN) model, for unsupervised learning of universal node representations for heterogenous graphs. PanRep consists of a GNN encoder that obtains node embeddings and four decoders, each capturing different topological and node feature properties. Abiding to these properties the novel unsupervised framework learns universal embeddings applicable to different downstream tasks. PanRep can be furthered fine-tuned to account for possible limited labels. In this operational setting PanRep is considered as a pretrained model for extracting node embeddings of heterogenous graph data. PanRep outperforms all unsupervised and certain supervised methods in node classification and link prediction, especially when the labeled data for the supervised methods is small. PanRep-FT (with fine-tuning) outperforms all other supervised approaches, which corroborates the merits of pretraining models. Finally, we apply PanRep-FT for discovering novel drugs for Covid-19.

Huoxin pill (HXP), a Chinese herbal prescription, is widely applied in the treatment of cardiovascular disease (CAD). Its mechanism, however, is unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study investigated the mechanism of action for Huoxin pill in the treatment of CH, an important stage of CAD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 rats were injected with isoprenaline (ISO) to establish a model of CH. Echocardiography and histopathologic evaluation were performed to evaluate the disease severity, whereas ELISAs were conducted to determine the expression of oxidative stress. Network pharmacology and metabolomic analyses were conducted to identify the key compounds, core targets and pathways that mediate the effects of HXP against CH. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to test apoptosis protein levels. RESULTS: HXP administration in ISO-treated rats decreased hypertrophy indices, alleviated cardiac pathological damage, and downregulated oxidative stress levels when compared to those of rats subjected to ISO treatment only. Moreover, network pharmacology results suggested that the PI3K-Akt pathway is a main mechanism by which HXP inhibits cardiac hypertrophy, and experimental verification showed that HXP inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis via activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway. The results of metabolomic analysis identified 21 differential metabolites between the HXPH group and ISO group, which were considered to be metabolic biomarkers of HXP in the treatment of CH. Among them, 6 differential metabolites were significantly upregulated, and 15 were significantly downregulated.

Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association of APOC3 polymorphisms and NAFLD risk were calculated using fixed and random-effects models. Results A total of twelve studies from eleven articles were included. Of them, eight studies (1750 cases and 2181 controls) reported the strong association of variant rs2854116 with NAFLD and six studies (1523 cases and 1568 controls) found the association of rs2854117 polymorphism with NAFLD. Overall, a statistically significant association between rs2854116 polymorphism of APOC3 gene and NAFLD risk was found only under dominant model.

However, little has been documented about challenges and experiences of this minority ethnic group-Chinese nurses-who have been working as registered nurses in New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study used an anonymous online questionnaire and a thematic approach to establishing understandings of the experiences of New Zealand registered nurses of Chinese ethnicity in working through the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 51 Chinese nurses completed this survey. A self-explanatory checklist for reporting results of Internet e-surveys (CHERRIES) was used for the purpose of the quality of this online survey. RESULTS: The result showed that 47.06% participants (n = 24) reported negative experiences including racial discrimination, workplace bullying and judgement, while 52.94% (n = 27) participants reported positive working experiences including supports received in the workplace and positive recognition by the pubic in New Zealand. CONCLUSION: Ethnic minority nurses are key assets to the New Zealand health system. It is important to understand their experiences and challenges, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic to make sure they are supported and protected from any physical and emotional injury. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: COVID-19 has brought additional challenges and concerns to nurses who are working on the front line of health services. Having knowledge of nurses' working experiences will help with their job satisfaction and has potential implications for the sustainability of the New Zealand nursing workforce and retention strategies to address nursing workforce shortages which is foreseeable in New Zealand.","output":"Experiences of New Zealand registered nurses of Chinese ethnicity during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In our emergency department (ED), we found one interesting case that had dramatic deterioration.

A mixed model, calculations of Spearman , Lins Concordance Coefficient (CC), and MannCWhitney U test were used for the statistical analyses. The MEDAS score was significantly negatively correlated with periodontal inflammation (BOP: CoE ?0.391, p < 0.001; GI ?0.407, p < 0.001; PISA ?0.348, p = 0.001) and positively correlated with poly unsaturated fatty acids/total fat, vitamin C, and fiber intake estimates obtained from the FFQ and 24dr ( 0.38C0.77). The FFQ and 24dr produced heterogeneously comparable intake results for most nutrients (CC 0C0.79, Spearman  0.16C0.65). Within the limitations of this study, the MEDAS was able to indicate nutritional habits associated with different levels of periodontal inflammation. Accordingly, the MEDAS can be a sufficient and useful diet screener in dental studies.

Drug development from naturally-sourced pharmacological constituents may be a fruitful approach to COVID-19 therapy. OBJECTIVE: Most of the published literature has focussed on medicinal plants, while less attention has been given to biodiverse sources such as animal, marine, and microbial products. This review focuses on highlighting natural products and their derivatives that have been evaluated for antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. METHODS: We searched electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct and Springer Link to gather raw data from publications up to March 2021, using terms such as natural products, marine, micro-organism, and animal, COVID-19. We extracted a number of documented clinical trials of products that were tested in silico, in vitro, and in vivo which paid specific attention to chemical profiles and mechanisms of action. RESULTS: Various classes of flavonoids, 2 polyphenols, peptides and tannins were found, which exhibit inhibitory properties against viral and host proteins, including 3CLpro, PLpro, S, hACE2, and NF-B, many of which are in different phases of clinical trials. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The synergistic effects of logical combinations with different mechanisms of action emphasizes their value in COVID19 management, such as iota carrageenan nasal spray, ermectin oral drops, omega-3 supplementation, and a quadruple treatment of zinc, quercetin, bromelain, and vitamin C. Though in vivo efficacy of these compounds has yet to be established, these bioproducts are potentially useful in counteracting the effects of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"The vital role of animal, marine, and microbial natural products against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The focus of this study is to monitor the effect of lockdown on the various air pollutants due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and identify the ones that affect COVID-19 fatalities so that measures to control the pollution could be enforced.

It occurs when the human biological rhythms are out of synch with respect to the day-night cycle at the country destination. Its effect in psoriasis is missing. We aimed to evaluate the effect of Jet-lag in psoriatic patients' management. Methods: This is a prospective observational study that enrolled psoriatic patients that underwent a flight: patients who experienced jet-lag were compared to patients who did not experience jet-lag. Before the flight, a dermatologist recorded clinical and demographical data with particular attention to Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) and Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA). Patients performed Self-Administered Psoriasis Area Severity Index (SAPASI), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and the pruritus Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores. After the flight, patients completed the SAPASI, DLQI and pruritus-VAS scores. Results: The sample recruited comprised of 70 psoriatic patients aged 42.4  9.7 years (median 42.5 years). Thirty (42.9%) were males, mean BMI was 25.5  2.2 kg/m2. Average disease duration was 15.2  7.1 years, and 20 (28.6%) subjects had developed PsA.

Twenty (7.6%) episodes resulted in transfer to hospital and 136 patients provided responses to feedback surveys and reported their experience as very good (61.7%, n=87) or good (34.8%, n=49). Implementation success was high, with the model widely accepted and adopted across the health service. The service delivery model was considered to be low-cost in comparison to inpatient hospital-based care.ConclusionsOverall, as a rapidly developed and implemented low-tech model of care, the virtual ward was found to provide an effective, accessible and low-cost solution to managing low-acuity COVID-19-positive patients in the community. This model should be considered in future pandemics as a hospital-avoidance response, with the ability to minimise patient-to-healthcare worker transmission, reduce personal protective equipment use and enhance patient adherence with isolation requirements. Targeted remote telemonitoring should be considered as a future modification to improve patient care.What is known about this topic?Virtual wards aim to reduce hospital demand by providing hospital-level care in community settings such as the patients' home. The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a rapid increase in the utilisation of virtual wards as an acute healthcare response that facilitates contactless care of infectious patients. Despite this rapid adoption, there is limited literature on the effectiveness of virtual ward models of care in a pandemic context.What does this paper add?This study provides a detailed description of the implementation of a virtual ward in a large metropolitan health service. It evaluates the effectiveness of the virtual ward as a COVID-19 response strategy and identifies opportunities for improvement and future applicability. This study contributes to the growing body of literature on the COVID-19 healthcare response and virtual wards.What are the implications for practitioners?This study details the implementation of a virtual ward and highlights potential facilitators and barriers to successful implementation and sustained applicability. Findings provide a comparative benchmark for other health services implementing virtual wards as a pandemic response strategy.","output":"Implementation of a virtual ward as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study investigated whether the crypto market is a safe haven.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D over early clinical outcome and serum cytokine levels in patients with moderate to severe brain injury. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who were admitted to the ICU unit were recruited into the study. Subjects were randomly allocated to a treatment regimen comprising either a one-time oral dose of 120,000 IU (two tablets of 60,000 IU each) of vitamin D (n = 20) or 8 mg of saccharide (two tablets of 4 g each) as placebo (n = 15). The main parameters evaluated included duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and cytokine levels (interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-, interferon (IFN)-, IL-2). RESULTS: The results indicated an improvement in the level of consciousness after 7 days in the vitamin D-treated group compared with placebo. An elevation in GCS score by 3.86 units in the vitamin D-treated group with a 0.19-unit descent in the control group was recorded. Duration of mechanical ventilation was reduced in the vitamin D-treated group compared with the control group (4.7 days vs. 8.2 days, p value 0.0001).

Method An online self-administered cross-sectional survey was distributed to healthcare students for the period between April 2020 to June 2020. The study included students from different universities in Saudi Arabia. Knowledge and perception of COVID-19 and the experience of distance learning during the pandemic period were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Psychological effect was evaluated using Four-Item Patient Health Questionnaire for Anxiety and Depression (PHQ-4). Results A total of 721 students completed the survey with the majority being females. Around 25% of students had experienced anxiety, while 35% had depression. Severe anxiety and depression were noted in over 6% of the participants. Younger age and female gender were more affected psychologically. Students with higher scores in PHQ-4 were strongly disagreeing that hand gloves and surgical masks may help in preventing COVID-19 transmission. Students with normal psychological assessment were more likely to favor DL, while students with moderate to severe anxiety and depression disagreed. Conclusion Healthcare students have alarmingly high levels of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. General knowledge of the pandemic is not associated with the psychological impact.

First, we analyzed the solutions of system in the case where the impact of the temperature on the virus is neglected. Second, we carried out the mathematical analysis of the solutions of the system in the non-autonomous case. Mathematical analyzes have enabled us to establish that the temperature and proportion of persons who respect the barrier rules can affect the spread of COVID-19.

These RBD mutations essentially contribute to antibody resistance of current immune approaches. During global spillover, combinations of RBD mutations may exist and synergistically contribute to antibody resistance in fact. Using three geographic-stratified genome wide association studies (GWAS), we observed that RBD combinations exhibited a geographic pattern and genetical associated, such as five common mutations in both UK and USA Omicron, six or two specific mutations in UK or USA Omicron. Although the UK specific RBD mutations can be further classified into two separated sub-groups of combination based on linkage disequilibrium analysis. Functional analysis indicated that the common RBD combinations (fold change, -11.59) alongside UK or USA specific mutations significantly reduced neutralization (fold change, -38.72, -18.11). As RBD overlaps with angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2) binding motif, protein-protein contact analysis indicated that the common RBD mutations enhanced ACE2 binding accessibility and were further strengthened by UK or USA-specific RBD mutations. Spatiotemporal evolution analysis indicated that UK-specific RBD mutations largely contribute to global spillover.

The test results of 220 students studying in different groups of the online course were compared using linear models of mixed effects, some students did not use a proctoring system, and the rest were forced to use online proctoring software. Students scored an average of 11 points less and spent less time on online tests that used proctoring software compared to tests without a proctoring system. A significant difference in grades and different use of time was in different exams, both for sections of the same course, and in the fact that some students used software for testing, while others were absent. The necessity of introducing the use of a proctoring program for online learning and distance education is justified. The necessity of using innovative tools in the field of education, in particular in online learning, is actualized. The introduction of proctoring systems increases the reliability of the assessment of educational results in the online mode. It is necessary to further develop the capabilities of proctoring technology and its wide implementation in all universities of the country. The use of this software system will allow educational organizations to improve the quality of the results of distance education provided.","output":"The Influence of the Proctoring System on the Results of Online Tests in the Conditions of Distance Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies investigated for use in patients with COVID-19 have failed to show any mortality benefit.

The impact of this cessation of pain treatment may have unintended consequences of increased pain, reduced function, increased reliance on opioid medications and potential increased morbidity, due to the systemic impact of untreated disease burden. This may include decreased mobility, reduction in overall health status and increase of opioid use with the associated risks. METHODS: The article is the work of the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) COVID-19 Task Force to evaluate the policies set forth by federal, state, and local agencies to reduce or eliminate elective procedures for those patients with pain from spine, nerve and joint disease. The impact of these decisions, which were needed to reduce the spread of the pandemic, led to a delay in care for many patients. We hence review an emergence plan to reinitiate this pain-related care. The goal is to outline a path to work with federal, state, and local authorities to combat the spread of the pandemic and minimize the deleterious impact of pain and suffering on our chronic pain patients.

A number of potential therapeutic agents have been explored over the past year or two. However, numerous drugs that were expected to prove highly effective, such as lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir, have been found to have little benefit in large clinical trials. Interleukin-6 receptor antagonists, glucocorticoids, Janus kinase inhibitors, and some antivirals have been found to provide significant benefits in terms of reducing viral load, reducing the time of nucleic acid conversion, or improving survival. For example, bamlanivimab and etesevimab, which are newly designed monoclonal antibodies against the surface spike protein S1 subunit receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, have a significant effect on reducing the viral load and the hospitalization rate of patients with mild COVID-19. Several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been widely administered worldwide and have provided good protection. Nevertheless, the increasingly hardy variants of the virus have raised the requirements for vaccine design. Perhaps RBD-based vaccines are a viable way to defend against variants, but this still needs to be verified in a large sample. Therefore, this paper provides an update on the treatment options for COVID-19 based on three previously proposed dimensions of drug screening: standard assays of existing broad-spectrum antivirals, screening of chemical libraries, and redevelopment of new, specific drugs.","output":"Update: Drug treatment options for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, genetically engineering using recombinant DNA techniques has been applied to design new viral vaccines in order to reduce some problems which present viral vaccines have.

Comparatively, Sweden applied the herd immunity model. The aim of this study is to analyze the Swedish model compared to the lockdown model based in other countries to understand the impact of these models on public health, health economics and overall economy of the respective countries. Based on the findings, the paper aims to shed light on which model proves to be more effective to cope with the pandemic and provide recommendations for other countries to follow accordingly. Our methodology was a narrative review that synthesizes current literature obtained from searches on various databases, authoritative texts, and hand searches. While it is too early to determine the long term effects of both models, it seems that Sweden's herd immunity model is more effective considering aspects of overall public health, health economic factors, and the overall economy. The major cons of the Swedish model was a failure in controlling infection spread in elderly nursing homes, as half the death toll comprises individuals belonging to this community. While Sweden was able to soften the effect of COVID-19 impact on its economy without a lockdown, the manufacturing industry was impacted due to lack of availability of required parts to be supplied by other countries. Thus from our review, we found that Herd-immunity model is more effective, but it depends on other factors of the country such as population density, as it is not plausible for countries such as Spain, the US or Germany, which need to expose high numbers of people to COVID-19 to attain herd immunity.","output":"Fighting Covid-19 Pandemic: Analysis of the Swedish Model vs. Lockdown Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted via airborne aerosols.

Air samples were drawn using an artificial lung from outside the room from the head and belly position of the simulated patient. The radioactivity from these air samples was determined in % of the minute-by-minute release of aerosol by the simulated patient. The samples were taken with the windows closed, with the windows open and with two different air purification systems in different locations. Opening the windows while the fan was working did not reduce the cumulative mass of sampled particles during ongoing nebulization. Only the more powerful air purifier was able to decrease cumulative sampled radioactivity almost to zero when positioned close to the emitting particle source. We observed air-turbulences caused by the air intake of the air purifier resulting in regional particle concentration peaks. Measurements and calculations demonstrate that indoor air purification systems can be effective measures to eliminate airborne particles.

As a purely physical application, its optical properties may be exploited to monitor in real time mechanical solicitations the fiber undergoes. In this paper we present a novel approach to using optical fibers as road sensors. As quite popular in literature, fiber is used to sense the vibrations caused by vehicles on the road: in our case, signals are processed by functional classification techniques to obtain a higher quality and a larger flexibility for the reuse of results. Classification aims at enabling profiling of road traffic.

Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods evaluation was completed in a psychology service based in the North of England which specialises in supporting adults with intellectual disabilities. Descriptive statistics and effect size calculations were used to examine therapeutic outcomes pre-therapy, post-therapy, and at follow-up. These findings informed a framework analysis of eight semi-structured interviews. Findings: Overall, outcome results improved post-therapy and regressed at follow-up. The framework analysis revealed facilitators to maintenance include a recollection of specific aspects of therapy and the regular utilisation of strategies and resources. Conversely, barriers to maintenance include a recollection focussed on personal outcome, a reliance on social support and an inability to remember therapy.

MDADI scores were categorized as follows:  80 optimal, 80C60 adequate, < 60 poor deglutition-related quality of life (QoL) group, and dichotomized as optimal vs adequate/poor for the analysis. A mean MDADI composite (MDADI-C) change of 10 points was considered as minimal clinically important difference (MCID). RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were enrolled of which 47 were considered for the analysis. At baseline, 26 (55%) were optimal and 21 (45%) were adequate/poor.

Yet, unfortunately, model accuracy can degrade due to concept drift, whereby the relationship between the features and the target prediction changes due to reasons ranging from software upgrades to seasonality to changes in user behavior. Mitigating concept drift is thus an essential part of operationalizing machine learning models, and yet despite its importance, concept drift has not been extensively explored in the context of networking -- or regression models in general. Thus, it is not well-understood how to detect or mitigate it for many common network management tasks that currently rely on machine learning models. As we show, concept drift cannot always be mitigated by periodic retraining models using newly available data, and doing so can even degrade model accuracy. In this paper, we characterize concept drift in a large cellular network for a metropolitan area in the United States. We find that concept drift occurs across key performance indicators (KPIs), regardless of model, training set size, and time interval -- thus necessitating practical approaches to detect, explain, and mitigate it. To do so, we develop Local Error Approximation of Features (LEAF). LEAF detects drift; explains features and time intervals that most contribute to drift; and mitigates drift using resampling, augmentation, or ensembling. We evaluate LEAF against industry-standard mitigations (i.e., periodic retraining) with more than three years of cellular data from Verizon.

The DDX DEAD box RNA helicase is a multifunctional protein involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism. Therefore, host RNA helicases may regulate and maintain such a large viral RNA genome. In this study, I investigated the potential role of several host cellular RNA helicases in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, DDX21 knockdown markedly accumulated intracellular viral RNA and viral production, as well as viral infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, indicating that DDX21 strongly restricts the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, MOV10 RNA helicase also suppressed the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, DDX1, DDX5, and DDX6 RNA helicases were required for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection dispersed the P-body formation of DDX6 and MOV10 RNA helicases as well as XRN1 exonuclease, while the viral infection did not induce stress granule formation. Accordingly, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein interacted with DDX1, DDX3, DDX5, DDX6, DDX21, and MOV10 and disrupted the P-body formation, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 N hijacks DDX6 to carry out viral replication. Conversely, DDX21 and MOV10 restricted SARS-CoV-2 infection through an interaction of SARS-CoV-2 N with host cellular RNA helicases.

However, it is not known how patients and physicians responded to an accelerated implementation of this model of medical care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to report the system-wide accelerated implementation of telemedicine, compare patient satisfaction between telemedicine and in-person visits, and report provider perceptions. METHODS: This study was conducted at the UC Christus Health Network, a large private academic health network in Santiago, Chile. The satisfaction of patients receiving telemedicine care in March and April 2020 was compared to those receiving in-person care during the same period (concurrent control group) as well as in March and April 2019 (retrospective control group). Patient satisfaction with in-person care was measured using the Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey. Patient satisfaction with telemedicine was assessed with an online survey assessing similar domains. Providers rated their satisfaction and responded to open-ended questions assessing challenges, strategies used to address challenges, the diagnostic process, treatment, and the patient-provider relationship. RESULTS: A total of 3962 patients receiving telemedicine, 1187 patients from the concurrent control group, and 1848 patients from the retrospective control group completed the surveys. Satisfaction was very high with both telemedicine and in-person services. Overall, 263 physicians from over 41 specialties responded to the survey. During telemedicine visits, most providers felt their clinical skills were challenged (61.8%). Female providers felt more challenged than male providers (70.7% versus 50.9%, P=.002).

Accordingly, many precautionary measures have been taken in many countries, including Saudi Arabia, such as border closures, lack of movement, and quarantine procedures, leading to an unprecedented impact on the daily lifestyle, and contributing significantly to increasing pressures on women because of her multiroles in family and work. This study aims at identifying the role of women in managing family crises during COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study. An online survey was conducted using self-designed electronic questionnaire consisting knowledge about the role of Saudi women in managing family during COVID-19 crises. The questionnaire was applied to 324 Saudi working women in Riyadh and Najran, with an average age of 33 years. RESULTS: The results indicate that the role of Saudi women during the COVID-19 crisis was approximately 82%. Moreover, results showed that the prevalence of the social, psychological, and professional role of Saudi women during crisis was 82.24%, 83.40%, and 78.80%, respectively, which indicates the importance of the role of Saudi women in managing family crises during COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, the study emphasizes the importance of urging responsible persons to provide a package of rescue and stimulus, including social protection measures. Furthermore, it empowers Saudi women in all sectors of society and provides them with all means of support to help them achieve their mandated role in society generally and in their families particularly.","output":"The role of Saudi women in crisis management within the family: The COVID-19 pandemic as a model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The past year has shown that obesity is a risk factor for severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Excess fat mass during obesity is known to be a risk factor for chronic diseases but also for severe infections and infectious complications. We have focused here on the elements responsible for this particular susceptibility to infections and more specifically to COVID-19. Excess fat is, in itself, responsible for alterations of the immune system by disrupting the production and function of immune cells. Indeed, hypertrophic adipocytes produce more pro-inflammatory adipokines (including cytokines). The increase in their apoptosis induces a release of pro-inflammatory compounds into the circulation and a recruitment of pro-inflammatory macrophages into the adipose tissue. A chronic systemic inflammatory state is then observed. In addition, diet, apart from its role in the development of adipose tissue, can also affect the immune system, with excess simple sugars and saturated fats exerting pro-inflammatory effects. This inflammation, the adipokines released by the adipocytes, and the infiltration of lipids into the lymphoid organs affects the production of immune cells and, directly, the functions of these cells. The alteration of the immune system increases the risk of infection as well as complications, including secondary bacterial infections and septic states, and increases infection-related mortality. During COVID-19, the chronic inflammatory state promotes the cytokine shock, characteristic of severe forms, caused in particular by excessive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, in obese subjects, the already present endothelial dysfunction will render endothelial inflammation (endotheliitis) due to viral infiltration all the more severe. Added to this is a state of hypercoagulability and a decrease in respiratory capacity, leading to a risk of severe COVID-19 with cardiovascular complications, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which can lead to multiple organ failure and even death.","output":"Obesity, Nutrients and the Immune System in the Era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To compare different Machine Learning (ML) Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to classify radiology reports in orthopaedic trauma for the presence of injuries. Assessing NLP performance is a prerequisite for downstream tasks and therefore of importance from a clinical perspective (avoiding missed injuries, quality check, insight in diagnostic yield) as well as from a research perspective (identification of patient cohorts, annotation of radiographs). METHODS Datasets of Dutch radiology reports of injured extremities (n = 2469, 33% fractures) and chest radiographs (n = 799, 20% pneumothorax) were collected in two different hospitals and labeled by radiologists and trauma surgeons for the presence or absence of injuries. NLP classification was applied and optimized by testing different preprocessing steps and different classifiers (Rule-based, ML, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)). Performance was assessed by F1-score, AUC, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. RESULTS The deep learning based BERT model outperforms all other classification methods which were assessed. The model achieved an F1-score of (95  2)% and accuracy of (96  1)% on a dataset of simple reports (n= 2469), and an F1 of (83  7)% with accuracy (93  2)% on a dataset of complex reports (n= 799).

Both the closed down and open up states, which determine the accessibility to the receptor binding domain, were considered. Results suggest that the spike undergoes drastic changes in the topology of the hydrogen bond network while salt bridges are mainly preserved. Reorganization in the hydrogen bonds structure produces conformational variations in the receptor binding subunit and explain the thermal inactivation of the virus. Conversely, the macrostructure of the spike is preserved at high temperature because of the retained salt bridges. The proposed mechanism has important implications for engineering new approaches to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","output":"Molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by temperature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To review available adaptive residency training approaches and management of the resident workforce in different residency programs amid COVID-19 pandemic.

PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar were also searched using keywords. Two independent reviewers extracted data using a customized tool that was developed to record the key information relevant to the review question.

Three were articles, 5 short or special communications, and the rest editorials and perspectives. We divided the data obtained into six thematic areas: resident staffing, clinical education, surgical education, didactic teaching, research activity, and accreditation process. CONCLUSION: Residency programs must reorganize the residents staffing and provide appropriate training to ensure the safety of residents during the pandemic. There are feasible adaptive approaches to maintaining residency training in the domains of didactic teaching, clinical education, and some research activities. Although some innovative virtual surgical skills training methods are implemented in limited surgical residency disciplines, their effectiveness is not well examined.

METHODS: We evaluated whether some specific post-mortem features are observed in these patients and if these changes are related to the presence of the virus in different organs. Complete macroscopic and microscopic autopsies were performed on different organs in 17 COVID-19 non-survivors. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated with immunohistochemistry (IHC) in lung samples and with real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in the lung and other organs. RESULTS: Pulmonary findings revealed early-stage diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in 15 out of 17 patients and microthrombi in small lung arteries in 11 patients. Late-stage DAD, atypical pneumocytes, and/or acute pneumonia were also observed. Four lung infarcts, two acute myocardial infarctions, and one ischemic enteritis were observed. There was no evidence of myocarditis, hepatitis, or encephalitis. Kidney evaluation revealed the presence of hemosiderin in tubules or pigmented casts in most patients. Spongiosis and vascular congestion were the most frequently encountered brain lesions. No specific SARS-CoV-2 lesions were observed in any organ. IHC revealed positive cells with a heterogeneous distribution in the lungs of 11 of the 17 (65%) patients; RT-PCR yielded a wide distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in different tissues, with 8 patients showing viral presence in all tested organs (i.e., lung, heart, spleen, liver, colon, kidney, and brain).

In this study, we aimed to explore the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the regulation of RLR-triggered effector functions of human monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). Our results show that RLR stimulation increased the phosphorylation of the mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and mTORC2 downstream targets p70S6 kinase and Akt, respectively, and this process was prevented by the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin as well as the dual mTORC1/C2 kinase inhibitor AZD8055 in both DC subtypes. Furthermore, inhibition of mTOR in moDCs impaired the RLR stimulation-triggered glycolytic switch, which was reflected by the inhibition of lactate production and downregulation of key glycolytic genes. Blockade of mTOR diminished the ability of RLR-stimulated moDCs and pDCs to secret type I interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, while it did not affect the phenotype of DCs. We also found that mTOR blockade decreased the phosphorylation of Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which mediates RLR-driven cytokine production. In addition, rapamycin abrogated the ability of both DC subtypes to promote the proliferation and differentiation of IFN-y and Granzyme B producing CD8 + T cells. Interestingly, AZD8055 was much weaker in its ability to decrease the T cell proliferation capacity of DCs and was unable to inhibit the DC-triggered production of IFN-y and Granyzme B by CD8 + T cells. Here we demonstrated for the first time that mTOR positively regulates the RLR-mediated antiviral activity of human DCs. Further, we show that only selective inhibition of mTORC1 but not dual mTORC1/C2 blockade suppresses effectively the T cell stimulatory capacity of DCs that should be considered in the development of new generation mTOR inhibitors and in the improvement of DC-based vaccines.","output":"Regulation of RLR-Mediated Antiviral Responses of Human Dendritic Cells by mTOR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Treatments that elevate NAD+ levels have been found to improve oocyte quality in mice, cattle, and pigs, suggesting that NAD+ is vital during oocyte maturation. This study aimed to examine the influence of different NAD+ biosynthetic pathways on oocyte quality by inhibiting key enzymes. Porcine oocytes from small antral follicles were matured for 44 h in a defined maturation system supplemented with 2-hydroxynicotinic acid (2-HNA, nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase; NAPRT inhibitor), FK866 (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; NAMPT inhibitor), or gallotannin (nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase; NMNAT inhibitor) and their respective NAD+ pathway modulators (nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and nicotinamide mononucleotide, respectively). Cumulus expansion was assessed after 22 hr of maturation. At 44 h, maturation rates were determined and mature oocytes were fixed and stained to assess spindle formation. Each enzyme inhibitor reduced oocyte maturation rate and adversely affected spindle formation, indicating that NAD+ is required for meiotic spindle assembly. Furthermore, NAMPT and NMNAT inhibition reduced cumulus expansion, whereas NAPRT inhibition affected chromosomal segregation. Treating oocytes with NAD+ pathway inhibitors in combination with nicotinamide mononucleotide or nicotinic acid improved spindle parameters compared with the inhibitors alone. These results indicate that the salvage pathway plays a vital role in promoting oocyte meiotic progression, while the Preiss-Handler pathway is essential for spindle assembly.","output":"Insights into the NAD+ biosynthesis pathways involved during meiotic maturation and spindle formation in porcine oocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cycle threshold (Ct) has been suggested as an approximate measure of initial viral burden. The relationship of initial Ct at hospitalization and patient mortality has not been thoroughly investigated. Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective study of all SARS-CoV-2 positive, hospitalized patients from 3/26/2020 to 8/5/2020 who had SARS CoV-2 Ct data within 48 hours of admission (n=1044). Only patients with complete survival data discharged (n=774) or died in hospital (n=270), were included in our analysis. Laboratory, demographic, and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to examine the relationship of patient mortality with Ct values while adjusting for established risk factors. Ct values were analyzed both as continuous variables and subdivided into quartiles to better illustrate their relationship with outcomes, and other covariates. Cumulative incidence curves were created to assess whether there was a survival difference in the setting of the competing risks of death versus patient discharge. In this cohort the mean Ct at admission was higher for survivors (28.6, SD=5.8) compared to non-survivors (24.8, SD=6.0, P<0.001). Patients with a lower Ct value on admission were found to have a higher odds ratio (0.91, CI 0.89-0.94, p<0.001) of in hospital mortality after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and history of hypertension and diabetes. Patients with Ct values in 3rd Quartile (Ct 27.4-32.8) and 4th Quartile (Ct >32.9) have a lower odds of in-hospital death (P<0.001) in comparison to the 1st Quartile. On comparing between Ct quartiles, the mortality, BMI and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were significantly different (p<0.05) between the groups. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and discharge was found to differ between Ct quartiles (Grays Test P<0.001 for both.)

In the EU, the 1986 adoption of a legal requirement to use scientific methods not entailing the use of live animals, rising public opinion against the use of animals and the almost exponential rise in development and application of non-animal new approach methodologies (NAMs) signals a readiness to end animal testing. Indeed, the European Parliament recently carried an almost unanimous vote to adopt an action plan to phase out the use of animals in research and testing. This article explores what is needed to make this action plan a success, considering all stakeholders and their needs. ABSTRACT: In September 2021, the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of a resolution to phase out animal use for research, testing, and education, through the adoption of an action plan. Here we explore the opportunity that the action plan could offer in developing a more holistic outlook for fundamental and biomedical research, which accounts for around 70% of all animal use for scientific purposes in the EU. We specifically focus on biomedical research to consider how mapping scientific advances to patient needs, taking into account the ambitious health policies of the EU, would facilitate the development of non-animal strategies to deliver safe and effective medicines, for example. We consider what is needed to help accelerate the move away from animal use, taking account of all stakeholders and setting ambitious but realistic targets for the total replacement of animals. Importantly, we envisage this as a phase-in approach, encouraging the use of human-relevant NAMs, enabling their development and application across research (with applications for toxicology testing).

Research into the mechanisms of these conditions has proposed that some of their causes (eg, macular degeneration/glaucoma and Alzheimer's disease) could be symptoms of an underlying common cause. Research into sensory-cognitive aging has provided data that sensory decline may be linked to the progression of dementia through reduced sensory stimulation. While hearing loss rehabilitation may have a beneficial effect on cognitive functioning, there are no data available on whether low vision rehabilitation, specifically for reading, could have a beneficial effect on cognitive health. OBJECTIVE: The research questions are: (1) Does low vision rehabilitation reduce reading effort? (2) If so, does reduced reading effort increase reading activity, and (3) If so, does increased reading activity improve cognitive functioning? The primary objective is to evaluate cognition before, as well as at 6 months and 12 months after, 3 weeks of low vision reading rehabilitation using magnification in individuals with age-related macular degeneration, with or without coexisting hearing impairments. We hypothesize that improvements postrehab will be observed at 6 months and maintained at 12 months for participants with vision loss and less so for those with dual sensory loss. The secondary objective is to correlate participant characteristics with all cognitive outcomes to identify which may play an important role in reading rehabilitation. METHODS: We employ a quasiexperimental approach (nonrandomized, pre-post intervention study). A 3x3 design (3 groups x 3 time points) allows us to examine whether cognitive performance will change before and after 6 months and 12 months of a low vision reading intervention, when comparing 75 low vision and 75 dual sensory impaired (vision & hearing) participants to 75 age-matched healthy controls. The study includes outcome measures of vision (eg, reading acuity and speed), cognition (eg, short-term and long-term memory, processing speed), participant descriptors, demographics, and clinical data (eg, speech perception in noise, mental health). RESULTS: The study has received approval, and recruitment began on April 24, 2019. As of March 4, 2021, 38 low vision and 7 control participants have been enrolled. Lockdown forced a pause in recruitment, which will recommence once the COVID-19 crisis has reached a point where face-to-face data collection with older adults becomes feasible again. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of protective effects caused by reading rehabilitation will have a considerable impact on the vision rehabilitation community and their clients as well as all professionals involved in the care of older adults with or without dementia. If we demonstrate that reading rehabilitation has a beneficial effect on cognition, the demand for rehabilitation services will increase, potentially preventing cognitive decline across groups of older adults at risk of developing macular degeneration.

METHODS: The monthly mortality rates from accidents (V01-X59), traffic accidents (V01-V99) and suicides (X60-X84) among elderly from 2015 to November 2020 were analyzed. Ordinary monthly expected values and reference ranges (RR: 95% range) were calculated by cause and sex and compared with the observed values.

We hypothesised that interventional treatment with depot steroids will not cause a significant increase in clinical infection in the first 4 weeks. METHODS Telephone follow-up was performed as a part of prospective longitudinal audit in a cohort of patients who received interventional treatment for chronic pain at a multidisciplinary pain medicine centre based at a university teaching hospital.

Our understanding of the indications of virus PCRs and our ability to interpret the results from a clinical point of view have improved.

We use the framework of adaptive networks, moment-closure, and ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to introduce several novel models based upon susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) dynamics. First, we compare computationally expensive, adaptive network simulations with their corresponding computationally highly efficient ODE equivalents and find excellent agreement. Second, we discover that there exists a relatively simple critical curve in parameter space for the epidemic threshold, which strongly suggests that there is a mutual compensation effect between the two mitigation strategies: as long as social distancing and quarantine measures are both sufficiently strong, large outbreaks are prevented. Third, we study the total number of infected and the maximum peak during large outbreaks using a combination of analytical estimates and numerical simulations. Also for large outbreaks we find a similar compensation effect as for the epidemic threshold. This suggests that if there is little incentive for social distancing within a population, drastic quarantining is required, and vice versa. Both pure scenarios are unrealistic in practice. Our models show that only a combination of measures is likely to succeed to control epidemic spreading. Fourth, we analytically compute an upper bound for the total number of infected on adaptive networks, using integral estimates in combination with the moment-closure approximation on the level of an observable. This is a methodological innovation. Our method allows us to elegantly and quickly check and cross-validate various conjectures about the relevance of different network control measures.","output":"Balancing quarantine and self-distancing measures in adaptive epidemic networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics and related problems have been an important public health issue throughout history and will continue to be so in the future Soon after its outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic which caught many countries unprepared with exceptions Turkey was one of them Having worked on plans and preparations for a possible pandemic since 2004 the Turkish Ministry of Health performed well in curbing the initial spread of the virus after its entrance into the country and has played an important role in Turkeys successful fight against COVID-19 since then Turkeys successful management of the crisis has been marked by its idiosyncratic approach to the crisis and the robustness of its healthcare sytstem which have helped taking COVID-19 pandemic under control and preventing its devastating consequences","output":"Turkey's Management of COVID-19: Measures and Strategies of Health Policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal central nervous system cancer and is associated with a poor prognosis.

METHODS: Numbers of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) activations, ST elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMIs) in a large tertiary Greater London centre and a large district general hospital, both of which have on-site heart attack centres, were collected. We compared the number of PPCI activations, STEMI, NSTEMIs and all MIs prior to the COVID-19 era (January to third week of February 2020), after the start of some COVID-19 restrictions taking place (fourth week of February 2020) and after formal instruction by the United Kingdom Government that all citizens were to observe strict social distancing measures (20 March 2020). We further obtained data for the corresponding weekly figures from 2019. RESULTS: The average weekly figure of all myocardial infarction in 2020, prior to the COVID-19 social distancing restrictions/awareness in the UK (beginning of January to third week of February), did not differ when compared with corresponding weeks in 2019 (23.3  5.4 in 2019 versus 21.13  3.5, p = 0.411).

The pEGFP-tagged ORF5 gene was ectopic expressed in PK-15 cells and an ORF5-deficient PCV2 mutant strain (PCV2(ORF5)) were used to infected PK-15 cells. This study demonstrated that the ORF5 is essential for the of PCV2-induced autophagy. The ORF5 protein triggers the phosphorylation of PERK, eIF2 and the expression of downstream transcription factor ATF4. In addition, ORF5 protein activated the AMPK-ERK1/2-mTOR signaling pathways. These findings suggest that ORF5 play essential roles in the induction of autophagy by PCV2.

The use of antiviral agents not only reduces the spread of viral pathogens but also diminishes the likelihood of them causing infection. The antiviral properties of novel copper-silver and copper-zinc intermetallic nanoparticles against Escherichia coli bacteriophage MS2 (RNA virus) and Escherichia coli bacteriophage T4 (DNA virus) are presented. The intermetallic nanoparticles were spherical in shape and were between 90 and 120 nm. Antiviral activity was assessed at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 2.0 wt/v% for 3 and 24 h using DNA and RNA virus model organisms. Both types of nanoparticles demonstrated strong potency towards RNA viruses (> 89% viral reduction), whilst copper-silver nanoparticles were slightly more toxic towards DNA viruses when compared to copper-zinc nanoparticles. Both nanoparticles were then incorporated into polymeric fibres (carrier) to investigate their antiviral effectiveness when composited into polymeric matrices. Fibres containing copper-silver nanoparticles exhibited favourable antiviral properties, with a viral reduction of 75% after 3 h of exposure. The excellent antiviral properties of the intermetallic nanoparticles reported in this study against both types of viruses together with their unique material properties can make them significant alternatives to conventional antiviral therapies and decontamination agents.","output":"Exploiting the antiviral potential of intermetallic nanoparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection age is often an important factor in epidemic dynamics.

The model allows the infection and recovery rates to vary and depend on the age of infection, the time since an individual becomes infected. We address uniform persistence and find that the model has the sharp threshold property, that is, for the basic reproduction number less than one, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, while for the basic reproduction number is above one, a Lyapunov functional is used to show that the endemic equilibrium is globally stable. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate and complement the main results.

Additionally, we propose brain health diplomacy (ie, global actions aimed to overcome the systemic challenges to brain health by bridging disciplines and sectors) and convergence science as frameworks for long-term coordinated responses, integrating tools, knowledge, and strategies to expand access to digital technology and develop collaborative models of care.

To test these hypotheses, 21 right-handed adults with developmental dyslexia and 21 right-handed adults with developmental prosopagnosia performed a divided visual field paradigm with delayed matching of faces, words and cars. Contrary to the predictions, we find that lateralization effects in face processing are within the normal range for both developmental dyslexics and prosopagnosics.

Planned relocation is considered a last resort as a form of adaptation to the impacts of climatic and environmental change. The health impacts of planned relocation are poorly understood. This paper draws on data from multi-year research with residents of the iTaukei (Indigenous) Fijian village of Vunidogoloa. We used qualitative research methods to examine experiences of planned relocation, including residents accounts of their health and quality of life. In-depth interviews and group discussions were conducted with villagers living in a site of relocation, at four points in time (2015, 2016, 2019, and 2020). Twenty-seven people in Vunidogoloa, Fiji, participated in in-depth interviews, several on more than one occasion. Six group discussions with between eight to twelve participants were also conducted. Qualitative analytic software (NVivo) was used to analyse interview transcripts and identify themes. Villagers report both health benefits and challenges following planned relocation. Key facilitators for good health include movement away from some environmental risks to health, adequate drinking water and sanitation, food security including through farms and kitchen gardens, livelihood opportunities, improved access to schools and health services, and appropriate housing design. However, residents also refer to unanticipated risks to health including increased consumption of packaged goods and alcohol, disruptions to social structures and traditional values, and disrupted place attachment following movement away from a coastal site of belonging with consequences for mental wellbeing. Therefore, planned relocation has altered the social determinants of health in complex ways, bringing both health opportunities and risks. These results highlight the need for context-specific planning and adaptation programs that include meaningful involvement of community members in ongoing decision making, and call for an understanding of diverse social determinants of health that emerge and evolve in contexts of planned relocation.","output":"Planned Relocation and Health: A Case Study from Fiji"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we present an improved whole\\\\cell biocatalysis system for the synthesis of heteroaromatic N\\\\oxides based on the production of a soluble di\\\\iron monooxygenase PmlABCDEF in Pseudomonas sp.

The study presents the experience of the College of Medicine of King Saud University in delivering a comprehensive internal medicine course for final-year medical students, which includes the implementation of novel methods of assessment. Methods: A 2-week revision of the internal medicine course was conducted for 70 pregraduation medical students. Lectures and focused case-based tutorials were conducted online. Novel assessment methods included brief written essays summarizing the tutorials, open-book short-answer question (SAQ) examination, and a virtual standardized oral examination (vSOE). A questionnaire was sent to the students (n = 70) on the contents of the course, clarity of objectives, duration, and online platform. Results: The response rate was 99.3%. Students scored higher in the SAQs compared with traditional multiple-choice tests (mean score: 92.3% vs. 69.8%). The vSOE was efficient, and grades were comparable to traditional objective structured clinical examination. The majority of students (93%) reported the scientific content as good or excellent, whereas approximately 30% found the course goals lacked a clear description. The majority (76%) found the course length appropriate, and 94% reported the online platform installation and operation easy or very easy.

We examined the impact of demography, subspecialty characteristics, and broadband availability on the utilization of telehealth in pediatric populations before and after the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Outpatients scheduled for subspecialty visits at sites affiliated with a single quaternary academic medical center between March C June 2019 and March C June 2020 were included. The contribution of demographic, socioeconomic, and broadband availability to visit completion and telehealth utilization were examined in multivariable regression analyses. RESULTS: Among visits scheduled in 2020 compared to 2019, in-person visits fell from 23,318 to 11,209, while telehealth visits increased from 150 to 7,675. Visits among established patients fell by 15% and new patients by 36% (p<.0001). Multivariable analysis revealed that completed visits were reduced for Hispanic patients and those with reduced broadband; high income, private non-HMO insurance, and those requesting an interpreter were more likely to complete visits. Of those with visits scheduled in 2020, established patients, those with reduced broadband, and patients older than 1 year were more likely to complete TH appointments. Cardiology, oncology, and pulmonology patients were less likely to complete scheduled TH appointments. CONCLUSIONS: Following COVID-19 onset, outpatient pediatric subspecialty visits shifted rapidly to telehealth. However, the impact of this shift on social disparities in outpatient utilization was mixed with variation among subspecialties.

Some COVID-19 patients encounter a severe symptom of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high mortality. This high severity is dependent on a cytokine storm, most likely induced by the interleukin-6 (IL-6) amplifier, which is hyper-activation machinery that regulates the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) pathway and stimulated by the simultaneous activation of IL-6-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and NF-B signaling in non-immune cells including alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells. We hypothesize that IL-6-STAT3 signaling is a promising therapeutic target for the cytokine storm in COVID-19, because IL-6 is a major STAT3 stimulator, particularly during inflammation.

In the absence of IFN-, lung ILC2s from mice challenged with the A/California/04/2009 (CA04) H1N1 virus, containing nonfunctional viral PB1-F2, initiated a robust IL-5 response, which also led to improved tissue integrity and increased survival.

IFN-èCdeficient mice had increased survival and improved tissue integrity following challenge with lethal doses of CA04, but not PR8 virus, and increased resistance was dependent on the presence of IFN-R(+) ILC2s. Reverse-engineered influenza viruses differing in functional PB1-F2 activity induced ILC2 and T cell phenotypes similar to the PB1-F2 donor strains, demonstrating the potent role of viral PB1-F2 in host resistance.

Saudi Arabia, like many other countries worldwide, implemented lockdown of most public and private services in response to the pandemic and established population movement restrictions nationwide. With the implementation of these strict mitigation regulations, technology and digital solutions have enabled the provision of essential services. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to highlight how Saudi Arabia has used digital technology during the COVID-19 pandemic in the domains of public health, health care services, education, telecommunication, commerce, and risk communication. METHODS: We documented the use of digital technology in Saudi Arabia during the pandemic using publicly available official announcements, press briefings and releases, news clips, published data, peer-reviewed literature, and professional discussions. RESULTS: Saudi Arabias government and private sectors combined developed and launched approximately 19 apps and platforms that serve public health functions and provide health care services. A detailed account of each is provided. Education processes continued using an established electronic learning infrastructure with a promising direction toward wider adoption in the future. Telecommunication companies exhibited smooth collaboration as well as innovative initiatives to support ongoing efforts.

Therefore, the reduction, storage, and reuse of CO2 is an important concern in modern society. Calcium oxide (CaO) is known to be an excellent adsorbent of CO2 in a high-temperature environment. However, since deterioration of the adsorbent is likely to occur after repeated cycles of adsorption under high temperature conditions, it would be desirable to mitigate this phenomenon, in order to maintain the stability of CaO. In the present study, common eggshell waste was used as the starting material. The main component of eggshell waste is calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which was purified to produce CaO. Different surfactants and amino-containing polymers were added to synthesize CaO-based adsorbents with different configurations and pore sizes. The amount of CO2 adsorbed was determined using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The results showed that the CO2 adsorption capacity of the synthetic CaO recovered from purified eggshell waste could reach 0.6 g-CO2/g-sorbent, indicating a good adsorption capacity. CaO modified with a dopamine-containing polymer was shown to have an adsorption capacity of 0.62 g-CO2/g-sorbent. Moreover, it showed an excellent adsorption capacity of 0.40 g-CO2/g-sorbent, even after 10 cycles of CO2 adsorption. The present study suggests that using eggshell waste to synthesize CaO-based adsorbents for effective CO2 adsorption can not only reduce environmental waste, but also have the potential to capture greenhouse gas CO2 emissions, which conforms to the principles of green chemistry.","output":"CaO recovered from eggshell waste as a potential adsorbent for greenhouse gas CO2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The practice of conventional medicine is rooted in the ability of a patient to effectively communicate with their physician, and for the physician to comprehend the patients story and perceive it through the lens of evidence-based practice.

Material and methods: Sixty-six patients and 21 healthy donors were investigated and observed until either their recovery or death. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated for each person and peripheral blood used for PAI-1 and TAFI measurements. PAI-1 antigen and TAFI activated/inactivated (TAFIa/i) were measured using ELISA kits. Results: PAI-1 antigen and TAFIa/i plasma levels are higher in patients than in control group (P&lt;00001 for both).Patients needing ICU had higher TAFIa/i values than non-ICU patients. The 15 patients who died had higher TAFIa/i levels than those staying alive.Obese patients (BMI . 30) had higher PAI-1 levels than non-obese patients. TAFIa/i is associated with D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, creatinine and neutrophile count, whereas PAI-1 is associated only with the serum creatinine level.

Medical students were invited through teaching platforms and social media to complete an online survey. SPSS software was used to analyze data. A total of 385 medical students participated in this research. Hence, 49.9% of the study population reported severe dysmenorrhea during COVID-19 compared to 36.9% before COVID-19 (p = 0.000). Dysmenorrhea was significantly associated with disruptions of sport and daily activities during COVID-19 (p = 0.015 and p = 0.002, respectively). The prevalence of PMS components, e.g., mastalgia, fatigue, headache, palpitation, and emotional and sleep disturbances, was raised during COVID-19 compared with before (p < 0.05). Symptoms of genitourinary tract infections, such as lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, genitalia rash/ulcers and itching, and urgency, were significantly increased after COVID-19 (p < 0.05). Positive Pearson correlations between COVID-19-associated mental health disorders and dysmenorrhea severity, PMS, and genital tract health abnormalities were observed (p < 0.05). The multiple linear regression model revealed that dysmenorrhea severity, PMS symptoms like palpitation, and genitourinary symptoms like lower abdominal pain and urgency were associated with worsening of depression, while dysuria was associated with a protective effect against depression. Moreover, it was observed that dysmenorrhea severity, PMS symptoms, such as headache and palpitation, and urinary urgency were associated with aggravation of anxiety. However, food craving and dysuria were protective against anxiety. Finally, dysmenorrhea severity, PMS symptoms of headache and palpitation, lower abdominal pain, and urgency were related to worsening of stress, whereas the premenstrual symptom of breast pain was a protective factor against stress.

Control measures were categorized into administrative, public health, and health system measures. To evaluate the stringency and timeliness of responses, we developed two indices: the Initial Response Index (IRI) and the Modified Stringency Index (MSI), which builds on the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT).Findings: Comprehensive administrative, public health, and health system control measures were implemented at the onset of the outbreak. Despite variations in package components, the stringency of control measures across the study sites increased with the acceleration of the outbreak, with public health control measures implemented the most stringently. Variations in daily average MSI scores are observed, with Mainland China scoring the highest (742), followed by Singapore (674), Vietnam (668), Hong Kong (662), South Korea (623), Taiwan (521), and Japan (503). Variations in IRI scores depicting timeliness were higher: Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Singapore acted faster (IRI>500), while Japan (424) and Mainland China (42) followed.Interpretation: Timely setting of stringency of the control measures, especially public health measures, at dynamically high levels is key to optimally controlling outbreaks.Funding: Saudi Ministry of Finance;Duke Global Health Institute.Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no conflict of interests.","output":"Effective COVID-19 Control: A Systematic and Comparative Analysis of the Stringency and Timeliness of Government Responses of Selected Countries and Subregions in Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: At the start of the UKCOVID-19 pandemic, people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) were designated extremely clinically vulnerable, underwent shielding, with face-to-face clinical contact postponed. Prior to lockdown we had cancelled routine CF clinics and used this unique opportunity to rapidly redesign outpatient services providing remote video-assisted consultations (VAC) with digital technology. VAC also enabled vulnerable shielding MDT members or those self-isolating through COVID contact to provide care. We describe our experience in rolling out VAC. Methods and results: We initially used AccurX?, a healthcare provider (HCP) text message-initiated video call service. From March 20thCApril 17th 2020, 192 physician-led VACs were completed to support pwCF with the lowest FEV1% in our clinic. From April 18th we moved to the NHS England and NHS Improvement supported secure Attend Anywhere? service with pre-arranged appointment times, constructing 10 bespoke MDT waiting area clinics with 44 active MDT users, including an all-discipline MDT clinic. Over 8 months, 1,348 consultations (602 hours) took place with most activity (1,163 consultations;86%;557 hours) in the MDT clinic. Other areas used were CF Nurse Specialist (n = 86), CFRD (n = 21), Dietetics (n = 12), Physiotherapy (n = 31) and Psychology (n = 19). Since August 2020, we have reinstated routine face-to-face clinics for emergencies and Annual Review, but >90% of our pwCF are now managed virtually via VAC with remote spirometric monitoring (Nuvoair?). Conclusions: MDT members and pwCF report a high satisfaction with VAC with an increased number of pwCF using it. VAC has improved pwCF's access to MDT services, abolishing the need to travel for and the risk of cross-infection associated with physical routine review, whilst improving appointment convenience.

We, therefore, aimed to demonstrate the diagnostic accuracy of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for the identification of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) in clinically suspected patients. Methods: Until November 23, 2020, databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science were scanned for eligible studies. A bivariate random-effects model was used for meta-analysis of the 33 included studies obtained from 1606 citations, and pooled summary estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were generated. Results: Twenty-three studies (n = 8,547) assessed NAAT accuracy for MSSA detection, while three studies (n = 479) evaluated MRSA detection in adults. The pooled NAAT sensitivity and specificity for MRSA in adults was higher [sensitivity: 0.83 (95% CI 0.59C0.96), specificity: 0.99 (95% CI 0.98C1.0)] as compared to MSSA [sensitivity: 0.76 (95% CI 0.69C0.82), specificity: 0.98 (95% CI 0.98C0.99)].

Influenza viral RNA was initially amplified by RT-PCR with a tailed reverse primer containing an additional sequence for SDA. The RT-PCR amplicon was then subjected to SDA, yielding multiple copies of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that can be used as a primer for subsequent RCA. Thereafter, a long ssDNA segment harboring tandem repeated G-quadruplexes that were generated through RCA was intercalated by Thioflavin T, yielding a strong fluorescence signal indicating the presence of the target viral RNA. Fluorometric analysis detected influenza viral RNA ranging from 50 pg to 500 pg with a limit of detection of 6.2 pg with a signal-to-background ratio of 10 and identified each influenza virus strain (H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B). Thus, the present method for the label-free fluorometric detection of viral RNA via tandem gene amplifications combining RT-PCR-coupled SDA and G-quadruplex-generating RCA would facilitate the efficient diagnosis of influenza infection.","output":"Label-free fluorometric detection of influenza viral RNA by strand displacement coupled with rolling circle amplification."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Renal denervation (RDN) is believed to reduce sympathetic nerve activity and is a potential treatment for resistant hypertension.

Particularly, the effects of the pandemic and its resulting social isolation on elderly individuals and their association with Alzheimers disease biomarkers remains a broad and open question. Here, we sought to investigate whether knowledge of COVID\\\\19, pandemic\\\\related distress, and changes in sleep quality were associated with in vivo tau deposition in an AD\\\\enriched cohort. METHODS: COVID\\\\19 telephone assessments were conducted in N=292 individuals (29 young/174 CN/52 MCI/19 AD/18 other) of the TRIAD cohort in April\\\\July 2020. Assessment consisted of clinical and neuropsychiatric, instruments, including scales assessing the individuals experience of the pandemic. Structural MRI and [(18)F]MK6240 tau\\\\PET were acquired before the pandemic. [(18)F]MK6240 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) were calculated 90\\\\110 minutes post\\\\injection using cerebellar grey matter as the reference region. Voxel\\\\based regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations between baseline [(18)F]MK6240 SUVR and knowledge of COVID\\\\19, distress related to COVID\\\\19, and change in sleep quality since the pandemic. RESULTS: Higher tau\\\\PET SUVR was associated with less knowledge of COVID\\\\19 in N=210 individuals in the cuneus, cingulate and superior temporal regions. Tau\\\\PET was similarly associated with lower levels of COVID\\\\19\\\\related distress in the isthmus and rostral anterior cingulate (N=201 individuals). Furthermore, tau\\\\PET tracer uptake was significantly associated with increases in sleep quality as assessed by rate of change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index before and during the pandemic (N=176 individuals). All results survived correction for multiple comparisons using random field theory with a cluster threshold of p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that those with increased tau deposition may have a weaker understanding of symptoms and prevention of COVID\\\\19 and lower levels of distress related to the pandemic than individuals with less brain tau. Individuals with higher tau may also experience improved sleep quality during the pandemic. While these observations appear to be favourable effects of tau, the first may suggest that public health information about COVID\\\\19 is less accessible to the aging population.

DESIGN We coupled cell culture experiments with characterisation of Fn/Fusobacteriales prevalence and host biology/microenviroment in tumours from two independent colorectal cancer patient cohorts (Taxonomy: n=140, colon and rectal cases of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-COAD-READ) cohort: n=605). RESULTS In vitro, Fn infection induced inflammation via nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells/tumour necrosis factor alpha in HCT116 and HT29 cancer cell lines. In patients, high Fn/Fusobacteriales were found in CMS1, microsatellite unstable () tumours, with infiltration of M1 macrophages, reduced M2 macrophages, and high interleukin (IL)-6/IL-8/IL-1 signalling. Analysis of the Taxonomy cohort suggested that Fn was prognostic for CMS4/CRIS-B patients, despite having lower Fn load than CMS1 patients. In the TCGA-COAD-READ cohort, we likewise identified a differential association between Fusobacteriales relative abundance and outcome when stratifying patients in mesenchymal (either CMS4 and/or CRIS-B) versus non-mesenchymal (neither CMS4 nor CRIS-B). Patients with mesenchymal tumours and high Fusobacteriales had approximately twofold higher risk of worse outcome. These associations were null in non-mesenchymal patients. Modelling the three-way association between Fusobacteriales prevalence, molecular subtyping and host contexture with logistic models with an interaction term disentangled the pathogen-host signalling relationship and identified aberrations (including NOTCH, CSF1-3 and IL-6/IL-8) as candidate targets.

This study further clarifies the psychological status of Chinese medical staff during the stable phase of the pandemic through a cross-sectional investigation in a large population sample in northern China. Methods: Subjects: Clinical frontline medical staff from seven hospitals in Liaoning Province were recruited from November 2020 to February 2021. Research Tools: The research tools used were the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and General Status Questionnaire. Statistical Analysis: SPSS 22.0, ANOVA variance analysis, and multiple logistics regression were used for statistical analysis. P-values of <0.05 indicated significant statistical differences. Results: A total of 3,144 medical staff completed the survey (599 men [19.1%] and 2,545 women [80.9%]; 1,020 doctors [32.4%] and 2,124 nurses [67.6%]). Among all subjects, the rates of anxiety and depression were 21.1% (663/3, 144) and 43.9% (1,381/3,144), respectively.

To better understand the evolution of spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed PANC (Parallel Network Analysis and Communities Detection), a new parallel preprocessing methodology for network-based analysis and communities detection on Italian COVID-19 data. The goal of the methodology is to analyze set of homogeneous datasets (i.e. COVID-19 data in several regions) using a statistical test to find similar/dissimilar behaviours, mapping such similarity information on a graph and then using community detection algorithm to visualize and analyze the initial dataset. The methodology includes the following steps: (i) a parallel methodology to build similarity matrices that represent similar or dissimilar regions with respect to data;(ii) an effective workload balancing function to improve performance;(iii) the mapping of similarity matrices into networks where nodes represent Italian regions, and edges represent similarity relationships;(iv) the discovering and visualization of communities of regions that show similar behaviour. The methodology is general and can be applied to world-wide data about COVID-19, as well as to all types of data sets in tabular and matrix format. To estimate the scalability with increasing workloads, we analyzed three synthetic COVID-19 datasets with the size of 90.0MB, 180.0MB, and 360.0MB.

SAE includes delirium, premature death, post-traumatic stress disorder, and major long-term cognitive impairment. The underlying pathophysiology of SAE is largely unresolved and specific treatment options are missing. We induced the peritoneal contamination and infection (PCI) sepsis model in 769 mice and compared these with 259 control mice. We found that experimental sepsis causes synaptic pathology in the brain characterized by severely disordered synaptic plasticity with reduced long-term potentiation, changes in CA1 pyramidal neuron dendritic spines, and behavioral abnormalities indicating cognitive dysfunction. Using electrophysiology, we found reduced frequency of quantal and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents whereas amplitudes of miniature, spontaneous, and evoked excitatory currents were increased, pointing towards a homeostatic synaptic scaling mechanism. Corresponding to dysfunctional excitatory synaptic function we discovered downregulation of genes related to neuronal and synaptic signaling in the brain, including the gene for activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc/Arg3.1), members of the transcription-regulatory EGR gene family, and the gene for dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (Dusp6). At the protein level, ARC expression and MAP kinase signaling in the brain were affected. For targeted rescue of dysfunctional synaptic signaling and plasticity, we overexpressed ARC in the hippocampus by microinjection of an adeno-associated virus containing a neuron-specific plasmid of the ARC transgene. Hereby we achieved recovery of defective synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway and improvement of memory dysfunction. Using a different rescue paradigm, PCI mice were subjected to enriched environment providing multiple activating stimuli. Enriched environment led to restoration of disordered long-term potentiation and memory, thus demonstrating the potential for activity-induced improvement.

Only 82(8.6%) had been COVID-19 tested, and 1(1.2%) tested positive. In public, 905(95.2%) socially distanced, however 99(10.4%) participants had recently attended meetings with over ten people. Regular hand washing was practiced by 907(95.4%) participants, 774(81.4%) wore face masks and 854(89.8%) stayed home when they experienced flu-like symptoms. The odds of adhering to the guidelines were lower among men versus women (AOR 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.528, 0.971) and those who had flu-like symptoms (AOR 0.42, 95% CI = 0.277, 0.628). In contrast, increased odds were reported for those who reported increased vitamin intake (AOR 1.37, 95% CI = 1.044,1.798), and were either cohabiting or married (AOR 1.39, 95% CI = 1.042,1.847). CONCLUSION: Despite high reported adherence, face mask use and symptomatic individuals not self-isolating, were areas for improvement. However, these factors cannot solely account for SA's increasing COVID-19 cases. Larger general population studies are needed to identify other adherence predictors for a strengthened SA COVID-19 response. While the government must continue to educate the entire population on preventative measures, provide personal protective equipment and stress the importance of adherence, there also needs to be implementation of prioritised prevention strategies for men and single individuals to address their demonstrated lower adherence.","output":"International citizen project to assess early stage adherence to public health measures for COVID-19 in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Mechanical ventilation is one of the most important life support tools in the ICU, but it may also be harmful by causing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and other deleterious effects. Advances in ventilator technology have allowed the introduction of numerous ventilator modes in an effort to improve gas exchange, reduce the risk of VILI, and finally improve outcome. In this review, we will summarize the studies evaluating some of the nonconventional ventilation techniques and discuss their possible use in clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS Proportional assist ventilation and neurally adjusted ventilator assist are able to improve patient-ventilator synchrony, possibly sleep, and may be better tolerated than pressure support ventilation; both integrate the physiological concept of respiratory variability like noisy ventilation. Experimental or short-term clinical studies have shown physiological benefits with the application of biphasic pressure modes. Some of the automated weaning algorithms may reduce time spent on ventilator and decrease ICU stay, especially in a busy environment. SUMMARY Apart from the physiological and clinical attractiveness demonstrated in animals and small human studies, most of the nonconventional ventilator modes must prove their clinical benefits in large prospective trials before being applied in daily clinical practice.","output":"Nonconventional ventilation techniques."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND One-third of all deaths in hospitals are caused by sepsis. Despite its demonstrated prevalence and high case fatality rate, antibiotics remain the only target-oriented treatment option currently available. Starting from results showing that low-dose anthracyclines protect against sepsis in mice, we sought to find new causative treatment options to improve sepsis outcomes. METHODS Sepsis was induced in mice, and different treatment options were evaluated regarding cytokine and biomarker expression, lung epithelial cell permeability, autophagy induction, and survival benefit. Results were validated in cell culture experiments and correlated with patient samples. FINDINGS Effective low-dose epirubicin treatment resulted in substantial downregulation of the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) degrading enzyme S1P lyase (SPL). Consequent accumulation and secretion of S1P in lung parenchyma cells stimulated the S1P-receptor type 3 (S1PR3) and mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and ERK, reducing tissue damage via increased disease tolerance. The protective effects of SPL inhibition were absent in S1PR3 deficient mice. Sepsis patients showed increased expression of SPL, stable expression of S1PR3, and increased levels of mucin-1 and surfactant protein D as indicators of lung damage. INTERPRETATION Our work highlights a tissue-protective effect of SPL inhibition in sepsis due to activation of the S1P/S1PR3 axis and implies that SPL inhibitors and S1PR3 agonists might be potential therapeutics to protect against sepsis by increasing disease tolerance against infections.

Correspondingly, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection increased CTSL expression in human cells in vitro and human ACE2 transgenic mice in vivo, while CTSL overexpression, in turn, enhanced pseudovirus infection in human cells. CTSL functionally cleaved the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and enhanced virus entry, as evidenced by CTSL overexpression and knockdown in vitro and application of CTSL inhibitor drugs in vivo. Furthermore, amantadine, a licensed anti-influenza drug, significantly inhibited CTSL activity after SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection and prevented infection both in vitro and in vivo.

Emergency Remote Teaching was designated to distinguish the new educational scheme. This concept involves production of online activities that may return to face-to-face format as soon as the isolation period ends. OBJECTIVE: From March through September of 2020, this systematic review attempted to elucidate experiences, benefits, and challenges enforced in dental education due to the pandemic, the learning technologies, and methods used to maintain education. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Cochrane, Embase, Lilacs, Livivo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Gray literature was also contemplated. Studies in which online teaching methods were described and dental learners were the subjects during pandemic were included. RESULTS: Learning technology, pedagogical model, knowledge gain, and dental learners' satisfaction and attitudes toward remote learning were assessed. The Joanna Briggs Institute JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Reports was applied as the methodological quality assessment to the 16 included studies. Assessments were related to demographic and historical characteristics of the participants, the intervention procedure, pre- and post-intervention descriptions, and identification of unanticipated events. All studies described the use of learning technology to ensure education continuity, and 15 studies highlighted the pedagogical model applied. Eight studies investigated knowledge gain while 12 searched the learners' satisfaction with online technologies. CONCLUSION: The evidence suggests that learning technologies can support continuity in dental education. Reported problems include poor knowledge of faculty members on how to deal with technology, Internet connection, and content transition to online education.","output":"The scope of dental education during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can spread rapidly in nursing homes once it is introduced (1,2). To prevent outbreaks, more data are needed to identify sources of introduction and means of transmission within nursing homes. Nursing home residents who receive hemodialysis (dialysis) might be at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infections because of their frequent exposures outside the nursing home to both community dialysis patients and staff members at dialysis centers (3). Investigation of a COVID-19 outbreak in a Maryland nursing home (facility A) identified a higher prevalence of infection among residents undergoing dialysis (47%; 15 of 32) than among those not receiving dialysis (16%; 22 of 138) (p<0.001). Among residents with COVID-19, the 30-day hospitalization rate among those receiving dialysis (53%) was higher than that among residents not receiving dialysis (18%) (p = 0.03); the proportion of dialysis patients who died was 40% compared with those who did not receive dialysis (27%) (p = 0.42).Careful consideration of infection control practices throughout the dialysis process (e.g., transportation, time spent in waiting areas, spacing of machines, and cohorting), clear communication between nursing homes and dialysis centers, and coordination of testing practices between these sites are critical to preventing COVID-19 outbreaks in this medically vulnerable population.","output":"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Involving Residents Receiving Dialysis in a Nursing Home  Maryland, April 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Recent evidence has revealed an association between neurodegenerative disorders and olfactory dysfunction. However, whether olfactory training can improve cognitive impairment in patients with dementia requires further study. The present study aimed to resolve this by developing an intensive olfactory training (IOT) protocol and assessing its impact on each of the cognitive domains in patients with dementia. METHODS Patients were prospectively recruited between June 2020 and September 2020. Baseline evaluations included demographic data, olfactory function test, depression scale and detailed cognitive function tests. Thirty-four patients in the experimental group underwent IOT twice a day with a 40-odor set for 15 days, while 31 individuals in the control group received conservative management. Follow-up evaluations using the depression scale and detailed cognitive function tests were performed after IOT. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were not different between the two groups. The IOT group showed significant improvements in depression, attention, memory and language functions, but not global cognition, frontal executive, or visuospatial functions compared with the control group. CONCLUSION This study shows the ability of IOT to alleviate depression and improve some cognitive functions in patients with dementia.

Overall, 803 of 1571 HCP (51.1%) stated their intention to get vaccinated while 768 (48.9%) stated their intention to decline vaccination. Most HCP (71.3%) who reported intent to get vaccinated noted contributing to the control of the pandemic and protecting their families and themselves as their reasons, while the most common reason for reporting intent to decline vaccination was inadequate information about the vaccines (74.9%), followed by concerns about vaccine safety (36.2%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the probability of intending to get vaccinated increased with male gender, being a physician, history of complete vaccination against hepatitis B, history of vaccination against pandemic A (H1N1) in 2009-2010, belief that COVID-19 vaccination should be mandatory for HCP, and increased confidence in vaccines in general during the COVID-19 pandemic. The following factors were associated with a lower intention to get vaccinated: no vaccination against influenza the past season, no intention to get vaccinated against influenza in 2020-2021, and no intention to recommend COVID-19 vaccination to high-risk patients.

Despite the association among food insecurity, chronic disease and psychological distress, narratives depicting the experiences of already food insecure populations are notably underrepresented in the literature. The current study assessed the impact of COVID-19 on clients of a food pantry who were also enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). DESIGN: A qualitative study probing the effects of the pandemic on daily living, food needs, food buying and food insecurity. Interview transcripts were analysed using a combined deductive and inductive approach. SETTING: Interviews were conducted via telephone between May and June of 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Equal numbers of English- and Spanish-speaking clients (n 40 total). RESULTS: Three main findings emerged: (1) the pandemic increased economic distress, such as from job loss or increased utility bills due to sustained home occupancy and (2) the pandemic increased food needs, food prices and food shortages. In combination with economic stressors, this led to greater food insecurity; (3) increased economic stress and food insecurity contributed to increased psychological stress, such as from fear of infection, isolation and children being confined at home. CONCLUSIONS: Despite federal legislation and state and local programmes to alleviate food insecurity, COVID-19 exacerbated economic hardship, food insecurity and psychological distress among urban SNAP and food pantry clients.

Procurement and sustainability of medical supplies to hospitals and clinics during the then upcoming COVID-19 pandemic was one of the top priorities. Continuing access to new personal protective equipment (PPE) was not guaranteed; thus, disinfecting and reusing PPE was considered as a potential alternative. Here, we describe part of a local program intended to test and implement a system to disinfect PPE for potential reuse in New Zealand. We used filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) coupons inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 or clinically relevant multidrug-resistant pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii Ab5075, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus USA300 LAC and cystic-fibrosis isolate Pseudomonas aeruginosa LESB58), to evaluate the potential use of ultraviolet-C germicidal irradiation (UV-C) or dry heat treatment to disinfect PPE. An applied UV-C dose of 1000 mJ/cm(2) was sufficient to completely inactivate high doses of SARS-CoV-2; however, irregularities in the FFR coupons hindered the efficacy of UV-C to fully inactivate the virus, even at higher UV-C doses (2000 mJ/cm(2)). Conversely, incubating contaminated FFR coupons at 65 C for 30 min or 70 C for 15 min, was sufficient to block SARS-CoV-2 replication, even in the presence of mucin or a soil load (mimicking salivary or respiratory secretions, respectively). Dry heat (90 min at 75 C to 80 C) effectively killed 10(6) planktonic bacteria; however, even extending the incubation time up to two hours at 80 C did not completely kill bacteria when grown in colony biofilms.

In addition to evaluation for treatment failure (primary endpoint, day 6), relapse, and study drug adherence, children were assessed for adverse events, including SAEs, which were managed per local standard clinical practice until resolution or stabilization. Between March 2016 and April 2019, 3000 children were enrolled, with male and younger children (aged less than 24 months) demonstrating more SAEs (10.3% for males vs 8.1% for females, p = 0.04; 10.0% for 2-6 months, 10.8% for 7-11 months, 9.7% for 12-23 months and 5.6% for 24-59 months, p = 0.01). The most common SAEs were progression of or recurrent pneumonia (220 SAEs in 217 children), acute gastroenteritis (14 SAEs in 14 children), and fever (8 SAEs in 8 children); however, there were no significant or substantive differences in the percentage of children with pneumonia-related, acute gastroenteritis, or fever SAEs noted between the 3- versus 5-day amoxicillin treatment groups. In our pediatric community-acquired pneumonia trial evaluating amoxicillin treatment, there were relatively few SAEs overall and very few attributed to amoxicillin. Duration of amoxicillin treatment did not impact the frequency of SAEs. We found male and younger children appear to be more vulnerable to SAEs in our trial; however, our data support previous data demonstrating the safety of amoxicillin use in children with pneumonia.Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02678195).","output":"Analysis of serious adverse events in a pediatric community-acquired pneumonia randomized clinical trial in Malawi"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is limited information regarding the role of biomarker levels at predicting mortality in patients with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The purpose of this study is to determine the differences in serum biomarker levels in adults with COVID-19 who survived hospitalization from those who did not. METHODS: A comprehensive search was completed on PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane libraries to identify studies of interest. Endpoints of interest were blood counts, hepatic function test, acute phase reactants, cytokines and cardiac biomarkers. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies with 1584 patients were included in the pooled analyses. Biomarkers that were noted to be significantly higher in those who died from coronavirus disease included: white blood cell count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, prothrombin time, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin and creatinine.

Lateral flow immunoassay that detects schistosome circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) in urine to establish prevalence thresholds for intervention in endemic areas is recommended. Stored urine may be useful if surveying at-risk populations is delayed or interrupted by unforeseen circumstances, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study evaluated the manufacturer's claim that Schistosoma mansoni infection can be reliably diagnosed in urine samples stored at -20C for one year. METHODS: Two-hundred-forty-two subjects from an endemic site in Brazil provided one urine sample each for testing with URINE CCA (SCHISTO) ECO TESTE? (POC-ECO) and one stool sample each for testing with Kato-Katz (KK) and Helmintex? (HTX) as a robust reference standard for infection status. At least 2 ml of urine from each participant was stored at -20C; after one year, 76 samples were randomly selected for POC-ECO retesting. RESULTS: The POC-ECO agreement between freshly collected and stored urine was inadequate considering trace results as positive (Cohen's kappa coefficient  = 0.08) and negative ( = 0.36). POC-ECO accuracy was not significantly greater than that of routine KK (54%; 95% confidence interval: 42.1%-65.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The precision and accuracy of POC-ECO have to be optimized in both freshly collected and stored urine before it can be recommended for use in control programs in Brazil.","output":"Reliability of point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen assay for diagnosing schistosomiasis mansoni in urine samples from an endemic area of Brazil after one year of storage at -20 degrees Celsius"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The COVID-19 epidemic originated in Wuhan City of Hubei Province in December 2019 and has spread throughout China. Understanding the fast evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. Methods We collected individual information on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases from official publically sources reported outside Hubei in mainland China, as of February 17, 2020. We estimated the temporal variation of the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. Results The median age of the cases was 44 years, with an increasing of cases in younger age groups and the elderly as the epidemic progressed. The delay from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4.4 days (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) until January 27 to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) from January 28 to February 17. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days (1.8-12.4) and the mean serial interval at 5.1 days (1.3-11.6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei was highly variable, but consistently included a mix of case importations and local transmission. We estimate that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than three weeks with Rt reaching peaks between 1.40 (1.04-1.85) in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province and 2.17 (1.69-2.76) in Shandong Province. In all the analyzed locations (n=10) Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold since the end of January. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the strict containment measures and movement restrictions in place may contribute to the interruption of local COVID-19 transmission outside Hubei Province. The shorter serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility is not as high as initial estimates suggested.","output":"Evolving epidemiology of novel coronavirus diseases 2019 and possible interruption of local transmission outside Hubei Province in China: a descriptive and modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Synonyms: Nasopharyngitis, coryza.

While biological, socioeconomic and clinical risk factors have been identified among the general population, a comprehensive assessment of risk factors for COVID-19 infection among PwMS is lacking. Methods A survey assessing personal experiences with COVID-19 in the USA was distributed online via the iConquerMS platform from December 18, 2020 to February 10, 2021. We conducted a retrospective nested caseCcontrol study of PwMS who self-reported testing positive for COVID-19 versus not. Risk factors evaluated include age, occupational setting, social determinants of health index, physical disability via Patient-Determined Disease Steps, disease-modifying therapy (DMT) and progressive disease. Results Of 611 PwMS, 47 (7.7%) self-reported a positive COVID-19 test. DMT use (odds ratio [95% CI]: 2.10 [0.75C5.39]) and employment outside the home (2.79 [1.42C5.41]) increased risk of COVID-19 infection, while older age (0.97 [0.95C0.99]), increased disability (0.81 [0.69C0.94]) and progressive disease (0.42 [0.19C0.86]) decreased risk in univariate analyses.

The Japanese Prime Minister and governors requested people to adopt self-restraint behaviors, including working from home and refraining from visiting nightlife spots. However, the effectiveness of the mobility change due to such requests in reducing the spread of COVID-19 has been little investigated. The present study examined the association of the mobility change in working, nightlife, and residential places and the COVID-19 outbreaks in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya metropolitan areas in Japan. METHODS: First, we calculated the daily mobility change in working, nightlife, and residential places compared to the mobility before the outbreak using mobile device data. Second, we estimated the sensitivity of mobility changes to the reproduction number by generalized least squares. RESULTS: Mobility change had already started in March, 2020. However, mobility reduction in nightlife places was particularly significant due to the state of emergency declaration. Although the mobility in each place type was associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, the mobility changes in nightlife places were more significantly associated with the outbreak than those in the other place types. There were regional differences in intensity of sensitivity among each metropolitan area.

In South Africa, the pandemic and the resultant national lockdown has highlighted the shortcomings in the protection and care of children. Children in alternative care are particularly at risk as a result of disrupted and uncoordinated service delivery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences and impact of the pandemic and the resulting social isolation on the wellbeing and protection of children living in a residential care facility. Methods and participants: We used qualitative, participatory approaches C specifically draw-and-write methods C to engage with 32 children (average age = 13.5 years) living in a residential care facility in Gauteng. FINDINGS: Children in care demonstrated an awareness of the socio-economic difficulties facing communities in South Africa, and shared deep concerns about the safety, well-being and welfare of parents and siblings. Although they expressed frustration at the lack of contact with family members, they acknowledged the resources they had access to in a residential care facility, which enabled them to cope and which ensured their safety. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We focus our discussion on the necessity of a systemic response to child welfare, including a coordinated approach by policy makers, government departments and child welfare systems to address the structural factors at the root of inequality and inadequate, unacceptable care. This is essential not only during COVID-19 but also in pre- and post-pandemic context.","output":"When will I be free: Lessons of COVID-19 for Child Protection in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lockdown period (MarchCMay 2020) during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in Europe led to a reduction in the anthropogenic emissions of primary pollutants. For three\\\\quarters of over 1,100 available monitoring stations, the average nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) concentrations decreased by at least 2.7 gm(?3) (or 25%) compared with the average concentrations recorded during the same period of the previous seven years. This reduction was not specific to urban or rural areas because the relative reduction was of similar magnitude in both areas. The ozone (O(3)) response differed spatially, with positive anomalies in Northern Europe and negative anomalies in Southwestern Europe. Reduced cloudiness and related enhanced radiation in Northern Europe played a significant role in the increase of surface O(3) concentrations by shifting the photochemical partitioning between NO(2) and O(3) toward more O(3). The level of total oxidant (O(x) = O(3) + NO(2)) remained unchanged, except in Southwestern Europe where it decreased. Several episodes lasting a few days of a high level of total oxidants were observed in Northern Europe.

We compared three methods to determine the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity of human convalescent plasma: life virus neutralization by plaque reduction assay, a lentiviral vector based pseudotype neutralization assay and a competition ELISA-based surrogate virus neutralization assay (sVNT). Neutralization activity correlated among the different assays; however the sVNT assay was overvaluing the low neutralizing plasma. On the other hand, the sVNT assay required the lowest biosafety level, is fast and is sufficient to identify highly neutralizing plasma samples. Though weakly neutralizing samples were more reliable detected by the more challenging lentiviral vector based assays or virus neutralization assays. Spike receptor binding competition assays are suitable to identify highly neutralizing plasma samples under low biosafety requirements.

Mortality rate is higher in elderly patients (pts) and in pts with comorbidities, including malignancies. However, there is a growing interest on COVID-19 outcomes in pts with hematologic diseases. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic registration and analysis of the outcomes of pts with hematologic disease and COVID-19 in our center. The study is a single-center, retrospective study, conducted at a Hematology Department and HCT unit of a tertiary Hospital after approval from local Ethics Committee. We included pts with a hematologic disease and RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection between October 2020 and July 2021. We reviewed hematological medical records to extract demographic and clinical data of COVID-19 infections. Most of the data have already been intergraded in ASH Research Collaborative Data Hub. Hematologic diseases were categorized to: Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia (AML), Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL), Multiple Myeloma (MM), Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN, including all Philadelphia-negative MPN) and other hematologic conditions. We evaluated a total of 89 pts, 54% were male and 46% female, with a median age of 64.5 (20-86) and 59.5 (21-85) years respectively. 83% of pts were 40 years and 27% 70 years old. Most of them (92%) acquired infection outside a hospital setting. 13% of pts were asymptomatic and diagnosis was confirmed only with positive RT-PCR test. The most common represented malignancies were NHL 26%, CLL 20% and acute leukemias 13.5%, while 15% of pts underwent transplantation (HCT). Pts presented with moderate/severe COVID-19 were 55%, while 43% of hospitalized pts required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Overall, the death rate was 24%, while remarkably almost all pts required ICU support did not survive (mortality 94%). Higher mortality observed in patients with MDS (50%), MM (43%), CLL (39%), ALL (33%) and NHL (30%). Further analysis showed a positive correlation between mortality and male gender with 16 deaths out of 21 (p = .0245), as well as mortality and ICU admission (p < .001). A chi-square test of independence was performed to examine the relation between age and COVID-19 severity, without any statistically significant result [x 2 (2, N = 87) = 3.475, p = .176]. Whereas the only significant correlation between age and mortality was among age groups 18-39 and >70 years (p = .0146). Regarding treatment, pts were divided into two subgroups, 78% of them received anticancer therapy at least once in their lives, while 22% of them have never been on treatment, mainly pts with CLL and indolent NHL. 62% of the first subgroup manifested moderate/severe COVID-19 infection requiring hospitalization with 28% death rate, while the same rates in the 2 nd subgroup were 30% and 10% respectively. Although there was a significant correlation between the treatment status and the severity of COVID-19 infection (p = .020), the above was not translated in statistically higher death rate in the first subgroup (p = .14). There was also a correlation between HCT and COVID-19 severity in general (p = .005), with autologous HCT having statistically higher mortality than the allogeneic subgroup (p = .032).  similar analysis in CLL and NHL groups showed no relation among treatment status, COVID-19 severity, and mortality (p values .638 and .115/ .34 and .62 respectively). As anticipated in hematological pts, the immunocompromised nature of the underlying disease makes them extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 infection regardless of their treatment status, a fact that is also reflected in mortality despite ICU admission and support. In general, the severity of infection is correlated to anticancer therapy, while mortality to male sex, ICU admission and autologous HCT. Larger n mber of pts are necessary for further studies to better understand the parameters that impact the outcome of COVID-19 in hematological pts.

When a viral solution with 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was mixed with test solutions at a ratio of 1:19 and incubated for 20 s, OG with ozone concentrations of over 1000 ppm inactivated  94.38% of the virus. Extension of the reaction time to 1 h led to the inactivation of  99.82% of the virus (the viral titer was below the detection limit). Extension to 24 h resulted in concentrations over 200 ppm OG inactivating  99.87% of the virus (the viral titers were below the detection limit). Next, viral solutions with 1, 20, and 40% FBS were mixed with test solutions at a ratio of 1:19 and incubated for 5 min. Whereas the virucidal activity of 500 ppm OG was very limited in the presence of 1% FBS (79.47% inactivation), it increased in the presence of 20 and 40% FBS (95.13 and 97.95% inactivation, respectively; the viral titers were not below the detection limit). Meanwhile, over 1000 ppm OG inactivated  99.44% of the virus regardless of the FBS concentration (the viral titers were below the detection limit). Extension of the reaction time to 1 h led to 500 ppm OG inactivating  99.91 and  99.95% of the virus with 20 and 40% FBS, respectively (the viral titers were below the detection limit).

In order to be certified as asthma friendly, each school will have: . An asthma policy . A register of pupils with asthma- all with medically issued asthma plans . Emergency inhaler/spacer kits . A minimum of 85% of staff trained in asthma management All schools taking part will be audited annually by the School Health Service. Improving asthma management within schools in this way has many benefits, including: . Improved attendance . Improved academic achievement . Improved participation in physical activity . Reduced medical complications related to asthma Objectives Using a train-the-trainer approach, we aim to identify and train asthma champions within each school in the borough. The aim is for these champions to share this training with the staff and student body, thereby raising awareness of asthma and how to treat it. Methods In 2018, a new train-the-trainer approach to teaching Asthma Friendly Schools was launched across the borough, taught face-to-face. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 the course was redesigned into an online format. Pre and post course questionnaires were collected. Candidates rated their confidence across 14 domains, on a 5-point likert scale. Feedback was compared between the 2019 faceto-face course, and the 2020 online course. Results In the face-to-face course, the scores improved from pre to post course across 13 domains (mean percentage improvement across all domains 20%). In the online course, scores improved across all 14 domains (mean percentage improvement across all domains 22%). There was a greater improvement between pre and post scores in the online course than the face-to-face course in 10 of the 12 domains. The post-course questionnaire also asked participants to rate 5 additional outcomes, self-rating their understanding of asthma and confidence teaching how to manage it, on a 5 point likert scale. Mean rating across all 5 domains was 4.51 in the face-to-face course and 4.34 in the online course. Participants on the face-to-face course scored higher confidence ratings on 4 out of 5 domains. After the online course, participants were asked if they liked the online format. Participants mean score for 'This session worked well online' was 4.42 (on a scale of 1-5). 83.80% answered yes to 'If you attend another similar event to this, would you prefer to attend it online via Zoom, rather than face-to-face.' 73.70% answered yes to 'If you have previously attended an AFS train-the-trainer face-to-face session, did you prefer to be taught online via Zoom rather the faceto-face.' Conclusions Participants in both the online and face-to-face courses rated their knowledge of asthma across a range of domains as improved after attending the Asthma Friendly Schools workshop. The participants' self-ratings in their confidence improved more during the online than face-to-face course;however their self-evaluation of their post-course understanding of asthma was higher in the face-to-face course.

The co-occurrence of the Dengue virus (DENV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has been into existence, but recently the co-infection of DENV and SARS-CoV-2 has been reported. Thus, the possibility of DENV, CHIKV, and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection could be predicted in the future with enhanced vulnerability. It is essential to elucidate the host interactors and the connected pathways to understand the biological insights. The in silico approach using Cytoscape was exploited to elucidate the common human proteins interacting with DENV, CHIKV, and SARS-CoV-2 during their probable co-infection. In total, 17 interacting host proteins were identified showing association with envelope, structural, non-structural, and accessory proteins. Investigating the functional and biological behaviour using PANTHER, UniProtKB, and KEGG databases uncovered their association with several cellular pathways including, signaling pathways, RNA processing and transport, cell cycle, ubiquitination, and protein trafficking. Withal, exploring the DrugBank and Therapeutic Target Database, total seven druggable host proteins were predicted. Among all integrin beta-1, histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) and microtubule affinity-regulating kinase-3 were targeted by FDA approved molecules/ drugs. Furthermore, HDAC2 was predicted to be the most significant target, and some approved drugs are available against it. The predicted druggable targets and approved drugs could be investigated to obliterate the identified interactions that could assist in inhibiting viral infection.","output":"Computational approach to decipher cellular interactors and drug targets during co-infection of SARS-CoV-2, Dengue, and Chikungunya virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This qualitative study analyzes the lack of political action to address climate change using a psychiatric lens, and frames that ambivalence lies at the core of inaction. While most politicians understand that climate action is absolutely necessary, any significant action is stalled by a number of important barriers they have to overcome. Using clinical analogies from eating disorders and the scientific literature on motivational change, this paper analyses three current strategies that push for political action. First, using force and emotions (like confronting activists) is equivalent to playing a power struggle, which risks increasing politicians' resistance to change. Second, collaborative discussions in multilateral conferences and debates risk feeding verbal manifestos without enacting behavioural change. Withdrawal from the manifestos of politicians is a third strategy to push for change discussed in this paper. However, even after bypassing manifestos, this strategy is unlikely to succeed because the benefits of greenhouse gas emissions, linked to our current social norms, seriously outweigh the benefits of climate action. Overall, all three methods present severe flaws and are not viable solutions to help politicians implement climate action. Other enhanced options are likely to be necessary.","output":"Confronting, collaborating, withdrawing?

Main Outcome Measures: Hypotheses were tested in a sample of 561 participants (Mage = 42.79, SDage = 6.12). Every evening, participants indicated their exposure to COVID-19-related media (e.g., TV, print, online) and their COVID-19-related worries. Results: Same-day analyses showed that participants reported more COVID-19-related worries on days with higher exposure to COVID-19-related media. Dynamical structural equation models provided evidence for a reciprocal cycle across days: Higher media exposure at one day predicted higher worries the next day, and higher worries at one day also predicted higher media exposure the next day. Individuals with high trait anxiety reported an enhanced general level of media exposure during the 21 days of assessment, and individuals high in neuroticism and anxiety reported an enhanced level of worries.

Currently, pigeon racing is becoming increasingly popular and considered to be a national sport in China, and even, the greatest competitions of racing pigeons are taking place in China. However, there are still no epidemiologic data regarding PiCV infections among racing pigeons in China. The purpose of our study was to provide information of prevalence, genetic variation and evolution of PiCV from racing pigeons in China. RESULTS: To trace the prevalence, genetic variation and evolution of PiCV in sick and healthy racing pigeons, 622 samples were collected from 11 provinces or municipalities in China from 2016 to 2019. The results showed that the positive rate of PiCV was 19.3% (120/622) at the sample level and 59.0% (23/39) at the club level, thus suggesting that the virus was prevalent in Chinese racing pigeons. A sequence analysis revealed that the cap genes of the PiCV strains identified in our study displayed a high genetic diversity and shared nucleotide homologies of 71.9%C100% and amino acid homologies of 71.7%C100%. 28 and 36 unique amino acid substitutions were observed in the Cap and Rep proteins derived from our PiCV strains, respectively. A cladogram representation of PiCV strains phylogeny based on 90 cap gene sequences showed that the strains in this study could be further divided into seven clades (A, B, C, E, G, H, and I) and some of them were closely related to worldwide strains from different types of pigeons. A large number of recombination events (31 events) were also detected in the PiCV genomes from Chinese racing pigeons. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that PiCV strains circulating in China exhibit a high genetic diversity and also contribute to information of prevalence, genetic variation and evolution of PiCV from racing pigeons in China.

As in other respiratory infections, leukocyte recruitment to the respiratory system in people with COVID-19 is orchestrated by specific leukocyte trafficking molecules, and when uncontrolled and excessive it results in various pathological complications, both in the lungs and in other organs. In the absence of experimental data from physiologically relevant animal models, our knowledge of the trafficking signals displayed by distinct vascular beds and epithelial cell layers in response to infection by SARS-CoV-2 is still incomplete. However, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus elicit partially conserved inflammatory responses in the different respiratory epithelial cells encountered early in infection and may trigger partially overlapping combinations of trafficking signals in nearby blood vessels.

We also discuss how an imbalance in vascular activation by leukocytes outside the airways and lungs may contribute to extrapulmonary inflammatory complications in subsets of patients with COVID-19.

Here we investigated whether Omicron escapes antibody neutralization in South Africans, either previously SARS-CoV-2 infected or uninfected, who were vaccinated with Pfizer BNT162b2. We also investigated if Omicron requires the ACE2 receptor to infect cells. We isolated and sequence confirmed live Omicron virus from an infected person in South Africa and compared plasma neutralization of this virus relative to an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain with the D614G mutation, observing that Omicron still required ACE2 to infect. For neutralization, blood samples were taken soon after vaccination, so that vaccine elicited neutralization was close to peak. Neutralization capacity of the D614G virus was much higher in infected and vaccinated versus vaccinated only participants but both groups had 22-fold Omicron escape from vaccine elicited neutralization. Previously infected and vaccinated individuals had residual neutralization predicted to confer 73% protection from symptomatic Omicron infection, while those without previous infection were predicted to retain only about 35%. Both groups were predicted to have substantial protection from severe disease. These data support the notion that high neutralization capacity elicited by a combination of infection and vaccination, and possibly boosting, could maintain reasonable effectiveness against Omicron. A waning neutralization response is likely to decrease vaccine effectiveness below these estimates. However, since protection from severe disease requires lower neutralization levels and involves T cell immunity, such protection may be maintained.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Omicron has extensive but incomplete escape of Pfizer BNT162b2 elicited neutralization and requires ACE2 for infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Detecting hepatitis E virus (HEV) RNA in faeces is useful for diagnosing and monitoring HEV infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients requiring ribavirin therapy. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the performance of the Altona RealStar HEV RNA kit for detecting and quantifying HEV in faeces. STUDY DESIGN: RNA was extracted from 94 stool samples by two methods: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit and MagNA Pure 96 automate. The Altona results were compared to a reference laboratory-developed accredited ISO15189 RT-PCR assay. RESULTS: The Altona and reference assays detect HEV RNA in 77/93 (82.8%) and 83/93 (89.2%) of the QIAamp extracted samples, respectively, after exclusion of invalid result; they detected HEV RNA in 67/92 (72.8%) and 66/92 (71.7%) of the MagNA Pure extracted samples, respectively, which emphasizes the importance of the RNA extraction method. The HEV RNA concentrations obtained with Altona RT-PCR and the reference RT-PCR were well correlated whatever the extraction method, and Bland Altman analyses indicated that the Altona values were higher than the reference assay values. The Altona values for QIAamp-extracted and MagNA Pure-extracted HEV RNA were very similar. CONCLUSIONS: The Altona RealStar assay is suitable for quantifying HEV RNA in the faeces and monitoring HEV RNA shedding during ribavirin therapy.

Many nursing students had mandatory practical training in hospitals to help the national system respond to the crisis. The investigation of nursing students perceptions of patient safety culture (PSC) might be beneficial in identifying safety areas that need improvement.Aim: The pilot study aimed to investigate nursing students perception of PSC during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: The data were collected using the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture - Nursing Students (HSOPS-NS). The HSOPS-NS tool was distributed online via the Google Forms platform between February and April 2021. The respondents studied in the 3rd year of the bachelors degree in nursing (n = 66). Three nursing faculties from 3 regions in Slovakia were addressed. Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, frequency) was used for the sample characteristics and the HSOPS-NS tool. The Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal Wallis test analysed associations between sociodemographic data. The predictors of outcome dimensions of the HSOPS-NS were analysed by a multiple regression analysis.Results: The nursing students evaluated the overall patient safety grade as very acceptable. Concerning PSC dimensions, the best-rated dimensions were Feedback & communication about the error (55.04%) and Communication openness (53.53%). The worst-rated dimensions were Frequency of events reported (33.32%) and Staffing (35.22%). A significant relationship was found between the perception of PSC and age, current area/unit, awareness of reporting systems, and supervision. The overall patient safety grade, the number of reported events, the number of reported events by nursing students were significantly predicted by several PSC dimensions (p  0.05).Conclusions: The nursing students perspective on PSC revealed a weak perception of reporting adverse events. The awareness of reporting adverse events requires an increase in theoretical knowledge and the support of nursing students during their clinical training. A regular and comprehensive evaluation of PSC may strengthen patient safety and the overall awareness of patient safety among nursing students.","output":"Nursing Students Perception of Patient Safety Culture During the Covid-19 Pandemic C Results of a Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, the use of social media to analyze disaster responses has become important.

A recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified that US counties with high social vulnerability according to metrics such as poverty, unemployment, low income, and no high school diploma, have significantly lower rates of vaccination compared to the national average1. Here, we build upon this analysis to consider associations between county-level vaccination rates and 68 different demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors for 1,510 American counties with over 228 million individuals for which vaccination data was also available. Our analysis reveals that counties with high levels of uninsured individuals have significantly lower COVID-19 vaccination rates (Spearman correlation: -0.264), despite the fact that the CDC has mandated that all COVID-19 vaccines are free and cannot be denied to anyone based upon health insurance coverage or immigration status. Furthermore, we find that the counties with high levels of uninsured individuals tend to have the highest COVID-19 incidence rates in March 2021 relative to December 2020 (Spearman correlation: 0.388). Among the 68 factors analyzed, insurance coverage is the only factor which is highly correlated with both vaccination rate and change in COVID-19 incidence during the vaccination period (|Spearman correlation| > 0.25). We also find that counties with higher percentages of Black and Hispanic individuals have significantly lower vaccination rates (Spearman correlations: -0.128, -0.136) and lesser declines of COVID-incidence rates (Spearman correlations: 0.334, 0.330) during the vaccination period. Surprisingly however, after controlling for race, we find that the association between lack of insurance coverage and vaccination rate as well as COVID-19 incidence rates is largely driven by counties with a majority white population. Among the counties with high proportions of white residents (top 10% decile), the association between insurance coverage and vaccination rate is significant (Spearman correlation: -0.210, p-value: 0.002), but among counties with low proportions of white residents (bottom 10% decile) this association is not significant (Spearman correlation: 0.072, p-value: 0.088). Taken together, this study highlights the fact that intricate socioeconomic factors are correlated not just to COVID-19 vaccination rates, but also to COVID-19 incidence fluctuations, underscoring the need to improve COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in marginalized communities. The strong positive correlation between low levels of health insurance coverage and low vaccination rates is particularly concerning, and calls for improved public health messaging to emphasize the fact that health insurance is not required to be eligible for any of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines in the United States.","output":"Counties with lower insurance coverage are associated with both slower vaccine rollout and higher COVID-19 incidence across the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to test the hypothesis that RNA structural elements promote the distribution of certain types of recombination junctions in each one of the 2C and 3D poliovirus genomic regions (Sabin 3/Sabin 2 or Sabin 1 in 2C and Sabin 2/Sabin 1 or Sabin 3 in 3D), we searched in 2C and 3D regions of reference Sabin strains for high probability RNA structural elements that could promote recombination. Recombination junctions that were identified in clinical strains of this study, as well as in clinical strains of previous studies, were superimposed on RNA secondary structure models of 2C and 3D genomic regions. Furthermore, we created an in vitro model, based on double infection of cell-culture with two poliovirus strains, for the production and identification of recombinant Sabin strains in 2C and 3D regions. Our intention was to compare the results that refer to the correlation of recombination junctions and RNA secondary structures in 2C and 3D regions of clinical strains, with the respective results of the in vitro model. Most of the recombination junctions of the clinical strains were correlated with RNA secondary structure elements, which were identical between recombining Sabin strains, and also presented high predictive value.

Evidence has shown an increase in 30-day mortality for hip fracture patients co-infected with COVID-19. However, there are no studies analysing mortality trends between the first two waves of the UK pandemic. Additionally, hospital versus community acquired COVID-19 infection between the two waves has not been analysed. Furthermore, predictive factors of 30-day mortality have not been fully evaluated. METHODS: Data from two audits conducted by the CHIP collaborative group were used: a published regional audit in England of nine hospitals providing the COVID-19 negative cases and an unpublished UK national audit of 43 hospitals, which provided the COVID-19 positive cases. Data collection for the COVID-19 positive cases was from 23 March to 31 December 2020. September 1, 2020 was used to define the transition between the two waves. RESULTS: There were 517 COVID-19 positive hip fracture patients and 1445 COVID-19 negative hip fracture patients. Overall, 30-day mortality rates were 5.7% in the COVID-19 negative group and 22.4% in the COVID-19 positive patients (p < 0.001). A difference in survival function between the first and second waves was found (p = 0.038). To allow for significant demographic differences, a matched analysis of 185 patients found a 26.5% 30-day mortality in the first wave compared to 21.1% in the second wave (p = 0.222). Within the COVID-19 positive groups, the virus was hospital acquired in 66.7% of cases in the first wave and 72.8% of cases in the second wave (p = 0.130). Independent predictors of mortality were found to include COVID-19 positive status, AMTS  6, male gender and age.

We demonstrate how wake flows may alter the droplet and aerosol dispersion, exceeding previously reported settling distances. A dipolar vortex is used to model the wake flow, self propelling through a cloud of micron sized evaporating saliva droplets, which are tracked using a Lagrangian method. The droplet spatial location, velocity, diameter, and temperature are traced, while coupled to their local flow field thereof. Contrary to previous studies of droplet dispersion by vortical flows, a vortex viscous decay model is included. This proves to be essential for accurately predicting the dispersion and settling distances of droplets and aerosols. The non volatile saliva components are also considered, allowing for properly capturing the droplet aerosol transition while predicting the equilibrium diameter of post evaporation residual aerosols. Moreover, the model is verified with previously published results, yielding an accurate prediction of the droplet evaporation falling curves. Using this model, our theoretical analysis reveals non intuitive interactions between wake flows, droplet relaxation time, gravity, and mass transfer rates. The underlying physical mechanism responsible for the increased dispersion is studied, where aerosols originating from saliva droplets entrap within the vortical structure and subsequently translate to distances two orders of magnitude larger than the size of the vortex. Thus, a new mechanism enhancing the transmission of airborne pathogens is suggested, offering a new outlook on the spreading of airborne-carried pathogens.","output":"Dispersion of Airborne Respiratory Saliva Droplets by Indoor Wake Flows"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The East Winner Bank Shipwreck takes its name from the southern sandbank on Hayling Island near Portsmouth, UK.

The in silico methods hold the promise to streamline the discovery of novel TCR therapies by reducing costs and time of laboratory research. In particular, the prediction of TCR binding to a target antigen, as well as the prediction of TCR off-target toxicity2 can provide useful insights supporting the development of safe therapies. We aimed at the development of an experimentally validated AI model of pHLA:TCR binding that will help to prioritize and reduce the number of in vitro assays necessary to discover novel TCRs for cancer therapies.MethodsThe limiting factor of successful pHLA:TCR binding modeling is data availability and completeness of TCR characterization. To address this issue, we are building an oncological pHLA:TCR database with paired alpha and beta chain TCR sequences. We are collecting and sequencing tumor and normal samples from 100 cancer patients, as part of an observational clinical trial. Those data are then screened with the Ardigen's ArdImmune Vax platform3 4 to select immunogenic epitopes. T cells that bind those epitopes are subsequently sorted and used to generate TCR sequencing data at single-cell resolution. We use data-driven and simulation-based models to extract insights about the dynamics of a pHLA:TCR system to predict the binding probability and explain the inference made by the model.ResultsWe optimized our data collection pipeline for the cost-efficient acquisition of a large oncological pHLA:TCR dataset. These data will enable us to build efficient models to streamline the development of TCR therapies against cancer.We benchmarked our modeling approach for pHLA:TCR binding against existing solutions5C7 on publicly available data. We also show how focus on model explainability facilitates the detection of model inconsistency of uncertain predictions by expert inspection. Our toxicity assessment solution2 extends the applicability of our system to the prediction of TCR safety profile.ConclusionsThe presented work shows perspectives and limitations of AI-aided TCR therapy development. We present results for our pHLA:TCR binding model, a TCR-toxicity-screening solution, and the study design of our observational clinical trial. Our growing database of pHLA:TCR interactions will enable us to develop highly predictive pHLA:TCR binding models, in particular for oncological targets.AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge funding through the project Creating an innovative AI-based (Artificial Intelligence) IN SILICO TECHNOLOGY TCRact to launch a NEW SERVICE for designing and optimizing T-cell receptors (TCR) for use in cancer immunotherapies cofunded by European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) as part of Smart Growth Operational Programme 2014C2020.ReferencesFarkona S, Diamandis EP, Blasutig IM.

In addition, 15 healthy individuals (nine men and six women; mean age, 38.2  4.6 years) were recruited as the control group. Lower-limb muscle regional saturation of oxygen (rSO2) was monitored on the lateral side of the gastrocnemius muscle before HD using an INVOS 5100C (Covidien Japan, Tokyo, Japan), which utilizes near-infrared spectroscopy. Here, we evaluated the association between lower-limb muscle rSO2 and clinical parameters. RESULTS The rSO2 values were significantly lower in patients undergoing HD than in healthy individuals (50.0%  1.7% vs 76.8%  2.5%, P < 0.001). Lower-limb muscle rSO2 showed significant positive correlations with diastolic blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen concentration, serum creatinine concentration, serum potassium concentration, serum inorganic phosphate concentration, and serum albumin concentration as well as negative correlation with HD duration. We conducted a multiple linear regression analysis using parameters that were significantly correlated with the lower-limb muscle rSO2 in a simple linear regression analysis. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that lower-limb muscle rSO2 was independently associated with serum inorganic phosphate (standardized coefficient: 0.27) and serum albumin concentrations (standardized coefficient: 0.24). In addition, there were no differences in lower-limb muscle rSO2 between diabetic and non-diabetic HD patients. This study has several limitations. Firstly, its sample size was relatively small. Secondly, we could not evaluate the association between lower-limb muscle rSO2 and calculated nutritional markers, including normalized protein catabolic rate and body mass index, anthropometric measurements representing nutritional status, and the severity of protein-energy wasting. Finally, we did not routinely examine the arterial vascular status of HD patients without symptoms of peripheral artery disease.

Human bocavirus (HBoV) is confirmed to have an association with pediatric lower respiratory tract infection. Seasonal and meteorological factors may play a key role in the epidemiology of HBoV. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the frequency, season, and clinical characteristics of hospitalized children with HBoV infection. In addition, an evaluation of the effects of meteorological factors on the incidence of HBoV in a subtropical area in China will be conducted. Children were <14 years in age and hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infection between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2012 in the Respiratory Disease Department at the Children's Hospital affiliated to Soochow University. Multi\\\\pathogens were detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. The association between HBoV activity and regional meteorological conditions was analyzed. The average incidence of HBoV infection was 6.6% (502/7,626). Of the 502 HBoV positive children, the median age was 13 months (range 1C156 months). The HBoV infection rate was highest among the 7C12 months groups (12.9%, 163/1,267). Seasonal distribution of HBoV was noted during June to November, especially during the summer season (June to August). HBoV activity was associated with temperature and humidity although the lag effect between temperature and HBoV activity observed. HBoV is one of the most common viral pathogens in children with lower respiratory tract infection. HBoV infection occurs throughout the year with a peak during the summer.

METHODS We used data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health 2014-2017 which included 2,888 pregnant women 18 years or older. The WHODAS instrument was utilized to measure disability as the degree of functional impairment due to emotional/behavioral problems experienced by the respondent. Multinomial logistic regression models were built to assess the magnitude and direction of the association between severity of mental health-related disability with opioid use and abuse/dependency in the past year. RESULTS Approximately 30% of pregnant women suffered from moderate/severe mental health-related disability, and 2% reported opioid abuse/dependency. Compared to those with no opioid use, the odds of opioid use in the past year for individuals with moderate/severe mental health-related disability were 1.73 (95% CI 1.36, 2.21) times higher than those with no/mild disability. Similarly, the odds of opioid abuse/dependency were at least three times higher (OR 3.51; 95% CI 1.80, 6.84) among those with moderate/severe mental health-related disability relative to pregnant women with no/mild disability.

Transient non-severe increased insulin requirement in patients hospitalized for medical conditions such as sepsis or myocardial infarction is a well-known phenomenon. However, extremely high-dose insulin requirement remains a very rarely reported entity. Here, we report the case of an extreme and transitory insulin requirement episode in a type 2 diabetic patient presenting an acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old man resident in Geneva, Switzerland, previously known for type 2 diabetes for 3 years was admitted for an aggravation of his dyspnea. His type 2 diabetes was treated only with metformin and his latest Hb1Ac was 6.1%. Chest CT SCAN showed a bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification. Twenty-four hours after his admission he presented a worsening of dyspnea and severe hypoxemia requiring a transfer to the intensive care unit rapidly followed by oro-tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation support. A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and test of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR assay was positive. At day 3, he presented a rapidly progressive insulin requirement at a rate of up to 50 units/hour intravenous insulin aspart. Despite the high insulin doses, he maintained an elevated plasma glucose level at 270 mg/dL on average. His extremely high-dose insulin requirement \\"resolved\\" at day 9, and the insulin infusion rate was rapidly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: This case may reflect a specific and profound impact of SARS-CoV-2 on metabolic homeostasis, in particular in diabetic patients that appear more prone to complications of COVID-19 infection. Yet, the mechanisms behind this remain to be elucidated. The optimal management of hyperglycemia of diabetic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has yet not be defined, however insulin remain the mainstay of treatment approach. Report of extreme dysregulation of chronic conditions such as diabetes in patients with COVID-19 may help clinicians to better take care of patients during the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.

Too low public vaccine confidence, which results in insufficient vaccine uptake, remains an area of concern for EU policy-makers. Within the European Joint action on vaccination, a work-package dedicated to research aims to define tools and methods for priority-setting in the field of vaccination research. We therefore propose a prioritization framework to identify research priorities towards generating and synthesizing evidence to support policies and strategies aiming at increasing vaccine coverage. MATERIALS/METHODS We used a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method inspired by the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative developed by Rudan et al. This quantitative methodology follows a series of steps involving different groups of experts and relevant stakeholders. The first step consists in identifying key research questions through a broad consultation. In parallel, a first group of experts is tasked to select criteria for prioritization of research questions, taking into consideration the ultimate goal of the exercise. Another group of experts is then requested to assess a weight to each of the criteria, using pair-wise comparisons. The final step consists in gathering experts who will assess each research question against the weighted criteria. This evaluation leads to assigning a score to each individual research question, which can then be ranked in order of priority. RESULTS We focused our work on four pre-selected pilot vaccines (pertussis, measles containing combination vaccines, influenza and HPV). The consultation generated 124 questions, which were secondarily sorted and re-worded to obtain 27 questions to be ranked. Criteria for setting priorities were the following: accessibility, answerability, deliverability, disease prevalence/incidence, effectiveness, equity, generalization, and territory. During a final face-to-face meeting international experts ranked the 27 questions and agreed on a consensual list of six top-priorities. CONCLUSIONS We have developed a transparent, evidence-based rigorous framework to defined key research questions to generate evidence towards the design of policies and strategies to increase vaccine coverage. Results were disseminated broadly and submitted to the EC for potential funding in the context of The Horizon Europe Program. The same process will be conducted in 2021 to identify vaccination research priorities regarding all vaccines used in the EU as well as COVID-19 vaccines.","output":"Research priorities to increase vaccination coverage in Europe (EU joint action on vaccination)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors have withdrawn this preprint due to erroneous posting.","output":"Alteration of lipid profile and prognostic value of lipids on the length of hospital stay in COVID-19 pneumonia patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antisera prepared against each of three single and one pair of major structural proteins of the bovine coronavirus (Mebus strain) were used in immunoblotting studies to measure cross-reactivity with the structural proteins of the human coronavirus OC43 and the mouse hepatitis coronavirus A59.

In the current paper, we determined the in vitro and in vivo safety and efficacy of CAP generated by this sDBD device. METHODS: The effect of CAP on DNA mutations of V79 fibroblasts was measured using a hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) assay. Furthermore, effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis and DNA damage in ex vivo burn wound models (BWMs) were assessed using immunohistochemistry. Next, 105 colony forming units (CFU) P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 were exposed to CAP in a 3D collagen-elastin matrix environment to determine the number of surviving bacteria in vitro. Finally, rat excision wounds were inoculated with 107 CFU PAO1 for 24 h. The wounds received a single CAP treatment, repeated treatments on 4 consecutive days with CAP, 100 L of 1% (wt/wt) silver sulfadiazine or no treatment. Wound swabs and punch biopsies were taken to determine the number of surviving bacteria. RESULTS: Exposure of V79 fibroblasts to CAP did not increase the numbers of mutated colonies. Additionally, the number of proliferative, apoptotic and DNA damaged cells in the BWMs was comparable to that of the unexposed control. Exposure of PAO1 to CAP for 2 min resulted in the complete elimination of bacteria in vitro. Contrarily, CAP treatment for 6 min of rat wounds colonized with PAO1 did not effectively reduce the in vivo bacterial count. CONCLUSIONS: CAP treatment was safe but showed limited efficacy against PAO1 in our rat wound infection model.","output":"Safety and bactericidal efficacy of cold atmospheric plasma generated by a flexible surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge device against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro and in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Selenium deficiency is widespread in the Malawi population. The selenium concentration in maize, the staple food crop of Malawi, can be increased by applying selenium-enriched fertilizers. It is unknown whether this strategy, called agronomic biofortification, is effective at alleviating selenium deficiency. Objectives: The aim of the Addressing Hidden Hunger with Agronomy (AHHA) trial was to determine whether consumption of maize flour, agronomically-biofortified with selenium, affected the serum selenium concentrations of women, and children in a rural community setting. Design: An individually-randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted in rural Malawi. Participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either intervention maize flour biofortified with selenium through application of selenium fertilizer, or control maize flour not biofortified with selenium. Participant households received enough flour to meet the typical consumption of all household members (330 g capita(?1) day(?1)) for a period of 8 weeks. Baseline and endline serum selenium concentration (the primary outcome) was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results: One woman of reproductive age (WRA) and one school-aged child (SAC) from each of 180 households were recruited and households were randomized to each group. The baseline demographic and socioeconomic status of participants were well-balanced between arms. No serious adverse events were reported. In the intervention arm, mean (standard deviation) serum selenium concentration increased over the intervention period from 57.6 (17.0) g L(?1) (n = 88) to 107.9 (16.4) g L(?1) (n = 88) among WRA and from 46.4 (14.8) g L(?1) (n = 86) to 97.1 (16.0) g L(?1) (n = 88) among SAC. There was no evidence of change in serum selenium concentration in the control groups. Conclusion: Consumption of maize flour biofortified through application of selenium-enriched fertilizer increased selenium status in this community providing strong proof of principle that agronomic biofortification could be an effective approach to address selenium deficiency in Malawi and similar settings.

We have found a novel anti-inflammatory pathway that is initiated by the acute phase protein, C-reactive protein (CRP), interacting with Fc receptor (FcR) on monocytes. This pathway is protective in animal models of endotoxin shock. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in the FcR might contribute to monocyte responses and susceptibility to infectious complications after severe trauma. METHODS We conducted an observational study on a prospectively identified cohort of adult patients with convenience enrollment admitted after severe trauma. We enrolled 66 patients and collected blood samples at enrollment and again at 48 hours and 72 hours. Patients were followed through their hospital stay, and any septic events before 14 days were recorded. Cytokine and CRP levels were determined in the plasma from all three blood draws. In addition, DNA was extracted from blood and analyzed for the 131 H/R FcRIIa polymorphism that strongly affects the binding of IgG and CRP to this receptor. RESULTS Elevated levels of interleukin 8 (IL-8), IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and CRP were associated with reduced time to posttraumatic sepsis in Cox regression analysis. Expression of monocyte human leukocyte antigen DR less than 45% on patient monocytes was also associated with sepsis (hazard ratio, 3.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.45-6.93). Genetic analysis found that individuals with the polymorphism of the FcRIIa receptor that binds CRP poorly were also more likely to have decreased monocyte human leukocyte antigen DR and posttraumatic sepsis. In vitro studies showed that CRP could attenuate monocyte deactivation in volunteers with the polymorphism of the FcRIIa receptor that binds CRP. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that a common genetic variation in the FcRIIa receptor may contribute to infectious susceptibility in trauma patients. In vitro experiments suggest that this association is related to the inability of CRP to bind to this FcRIIa receptor variant.

In total 25 O-glycosites were identified, with similar patterns in the two ectodomains of different cell origin, and a distinct pattern of the monomeric RBD. Strikingly, 16 out of 25 O-glycosites were located within three amino acids from known N-glycosites. However, O-glycosylation was primarily found on peptides that were unoccupied by N-glycans, and otherwise had low overall occupancy.

As demonstrated by an incredible number of COVID-19-related publications, the research science community responded rapidly. Therefore, this study was intended to assess the growing contribution of the Arab world to global research on COVID-19. METHODS: For the period between December 2019 and March 2021, the search for publications was conducted via the Scopus database using terms linked to COVID-19. VOSviewer 1.6.16 software was applied to generate a network map to assess hot topics in this area and determine the collaboration patterns between different countries. Furthermore, the research output of Arab countries was adjusted in relation to population size and gross domestic product (GDP). RESULTS: A total of 143,975 publications reflecting the global overall COVID-19 research output were retrieved. By restricting analysis to the publications published by the Arab countries, the research production was 6131 documents, representing 4.26% of the global research output regarding COVID-19. Of all these publications, 3990 (65.08%) were original journal articles, 980 (15.98%) were review articles, 514 (8.38%) were letters and 647 (10.55%) were others, such as editorials or notes. The highest number of COVID-19 publications was published by Saudi Arabia (n = 2186, 35.65%), followed by Egypt (n = 1281, 20.78%) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), (n = 719, 11.73%). After standardization by population size and GDP, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Lebanon had the highest publication productivity. The collaborations were mostly with researchers from the United States (n = 968), followed by the United Kingdom (n = 661). The main research lines identified in COVID-19 from the Arab world are related to: public health and epidemiology; immunological and pharmaceutical research; signs, symptoms and clinical diagnosis; and virus detection. CONCLUSIONS: A novel analysis of the latest Arab COVID-19-related studies is discussed in the current study and how these findings are connected to global production.

Biomedical informatics relies for the most part on structured data, which require a preexisting data or knowledge model; however, novel diseases do not have preexisting knowledge models. In an emergent epidemic, language processing can enable rapid conversion of unstructured text to a novel knowledge model. However, although this idea has often been suggested, no opportunity has arisen to actually test it in real time. The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents such an opportunity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the added value of information from clinical text in response to emergent diseases using natural language processing (NLP). METHODS: We explored the effects of long-term treatment by calcium channel blockers on the outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients with high blood pressure during in-patient hospital stays using two sources of information: data available strictly from structured electronic health records (EHRs) and data available through structured EHRs and text mining. RESULTS: In this multicenter study involving 39 hospitals, text mining increased the statistical power sufficiently to change a negative result for an adjusted hazard ratio to a positive one. Compared to the baseline structured data, the number of patients available for inclusion in the study increased by 2.95 times, the amount of available information on medications increased by 7.2 times, and the amount of additional phenotypic information increased by 11.9 times. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, use of calcium channel blockers was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. This finding was obtained by quickly adapting an NLP pipeline to the domain of the novel disease; the adapted pipeline still performed sufficiently to extract useful information. When that information was used to supplement existing structured data, the sample size could be increased sufficiently to see treatment effects that were not previously statistically detectable.","output":"Natural Language Processing for Rapid Response to Emergent Diseases: Case Study of Calcium Channel Blockers and Hypertension in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Due to its high spatial resolution, intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been used as a valid method for in vivo evaluation of several types of coronary stents at straight lumen and bifurcation sites. We sought to evaluate its effectiveness for flow diverting stents deployed in arterial bifurcation sites involving jailing of a side branch. METHODS Four large white swine were stented with flow diverting stents covering the right common carotid artery-ascending pharyngeal artery bifurcation. After 12 weeks of follow-up the animals were evaluated by digital subtraction angiography and intravascular OCT and subsequently sacrificed. Neointimal thickness on the parent arteries and the free segments of the stent were measured. The stented arteries were harvested and underwent scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. Ostia surface values were measured with OCT three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions and SEM images. RESULTS All endovascular procedures and OCT pullback runs were feasible. Stent apposition was satisfactory on the immediate post-stent OCT reconstructions. At 12-week controls, all stents and jailed branches were patent. Mean neointimal thickness was 0.110.04 mm on the free segments of the stent. The mean ostia surface at 12 weeks was 319 750345 533 m2 with 3D-OCT reconstructions and 351 198396 355 m2 with SEM image-derived calculations.

By introducing a random duration of immunity a memory effect is introduced into the process which crucially determines the epidemic dynamics. In the second part, we investigate the influence of the memory effect on the space-time dynamics of the epidemic spreading by implementing this approach into computer simulations and employ a multiple random walker's model. If a susceptible walker meets an infectious one on the same site, then the susceptible one gets infected with a certain probability. The computer experiments allow us to identify relevant parameters for spread or extinction of an epidemic. In both parts, the finite duration of immunity causes persistent oscillations in the number of infected individuals with ongoing epidemic activity preventing the system from relaxation to a steady state solution. Such oscillatory behavior is supported by real-life observations and cannot be captured by standard SIR models.","output":"A simple model of epidemic dynamics with memory effects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The quality of teaching in mechanical engineering greatly depends on the practical application of the fundamental theory taught.

OBJECTIVE To screen constituents derived from Chinese herb medicines for their antiviral activity against infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty constituents derived from Chinese herb medicines and B87 strain of IBDV were used. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC) and 50% effective concentration (EC) were determined by visualization of cytopathologic effect (CPE) and 3-(4,5-dimethyithiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) test on chicken embryo fibroblast. Selectivity index (SI) and inhibition ratio (%I) were calculated from the data obtained from the MTT test. RESULTS Antiviral assays showed dipotassium glycyrrhizinate and ligustrazine hydrochloride among the 20 constituents tested exhibited significant inhibitory activity against IBDV in a dose-dependent manner. EC of dipotassium glycyrrhizinate and ligustrazine hydrochloride were 663.2  268.4 and 92.52  21.13 g/mL, and SI were >4.52 and >21.62, respectively. The time-of-addition and virucidal assay indicated that anti-IBDV activity of the two constituents could be due to their inhibiting virus replication and/or inactivating virus directly. The inhibition of virus attachment was not observed in the adsorption inhibition assay. Dipotassium glycyrrhizinate and ligustrazine hydrochloride exhibited more than 70% and 80% inhibition of IBDV, respectively, at the maximum safe concentration.

Recent trends have shifted from acute effects towards the long-term morbidity of COVID-19. In this review, we hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 contributes to age-related perturbations in endothelial and adipose tissue, which are known to characterize the early aging process. This would explain the long-lasting symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 as the result of an accelerated aging process. Connective tissues such as adipose tissue and musculoskeletal tissue are the primary sites of aging. Therefore, current literature was analyzed focusing on the musculoskeletal symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Hypovitaminosis D, increased fragility, and calcium deficiency point towards bone aging, while joint and muscle pain are typical for joint and muscle aging, respectively. These characteristics could be classified as early osteoarthritis-like phenotype. Exploration of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and osteoarthritis on endothelial and adipose tissue, as well as neuronal function, showed similar perturbations. At a molecular level, this could be attributed to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression, renin-angiotensin system dysfunction, and inflammation.

High-risk patients typically have more difficult plaque morphology; flow reversal decreases the rate of distal emboli but does not offer the intraprocedural visualization seen with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). In this paper, we illustrate potential periprocedural outcomes associated with stenting of the stenotic carotid bifurcation under flow reversal and how IVUS influenced endovascular management. Three high-risk patients who underwent CAS with direct common carotid artery cutdown approaches due to common carotid ostia disease with flow-reversal proximal embolic protection also had intraprocedural IVUS performed to evaluate plaque morphology and stability before the protection system was removed. Case 1 illustrates no intraluminal thrombus on IVUS, requiring no further intervention after stent placement. Case 2 demonstrates intraluminal thrombus on IVUS requiring a second stent to stabilize plaque. Case 3 shows the inadequate resolution of thrombus after a second stent, which was addressed with balloon angioplasty. In our experience, using IVUS as an adjunct to CAS under proximal embolic protection helped demonstrate plaque morphology and plaque fragmentation after stent placement. These cases illustrate the potential benefit of allowing stabilization of the plaque before flow reversal is stopped.","output":"Utility of Intravascular Ultrasound During Carotid Angioplasty and Stenting with Proximal Protection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Symmetrical peripheral gangrene is a rare condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

These requirements address ethical challenges intrinsic to this research context. Multiple approaches have evolved to accomplish these activities that may reflect and advance different aims. This scoping review was designed to identify areas of consensus and lingering uncertainty in the literature. METHODS Scoping review methodology was used. Conceptual and empirical literature related to community consultation and public disclosure for EFIC research was included and identified through a structured search using EMBASE, HEIN Online, PubMed, and Web of Science. Data were extracted using a standardized tool with domains for major literature categories. RESULTS Among 84 manuscripts, major domains included: conceptual or policy issues; reports of community consultation processes and results; and reports of public disclosure processes and results. Areas of consensus related to community consultation included the need for a two-way exchange of information and use of multiple methods. Public acceptance of personal EFIC enrollment is commonly 64-85%. There is less consensus regarding how to assess attitudes, what \\"communities\\" to prioritize, and how to determine adequacy for individual projects. Core goals of public disclosure are less well-developed, no metrics exist for assessing adequacy. CONCLUSIONS Multiple methods are used to meet community consultation and public disclosure requirements. There remain no settled norms for assessing adequacy of public disclosure, and there is lingering debate about needed breadth and depth of community consultation.","output":"Meeting Unique Requirements: Community Consultation and Public Disclosure for Research in Emergency Setting Using Exception from Informed Consent."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past two decades there has been a significant expansion in the number of new therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are approved by regulators.

METHODS: Complete postmortem examinations were performed according to standard procedures in a negative-pressure autopsy suite/isolation room using personal protective equipment, including N95 masks, eye protection, and gowns. The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing on postmortem swabs. RESULTS: A 77-year-old obese man with a history of hypertension, splenectomy, and 6 days of fever and chills died while being transported for medical care. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on postmortem nasopharyngeal and lung parenchymal swabs. Autopsy revealed diffuse alveolar damage and chronic inflammation and edema in the bronchial mucosa. A 42-year-old obese man with a history of myotonic dystrophy developed abdominal pain followed by fever, shortness of breath, and cough. Postmortem nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2; lung parenchymal swabs were negative. Autopsy showed acute bronchopneumonia with evidence of aspiration.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer is technically feasible, but there are no data to evaluate the long-term outcome between laparoscopic and open approach. Moreover, the long-term impact of conversion is not known. METHODS Between 1994 and 2006, patients treated by open (1994-1999) and laparoscopic (2000-2006) curative resection for rectal cancer were included in a retrospective comparative study. Patients with fixed tumors or metastatic disease were excluded. Those with T3-T4 or N+ disease received long course preoperative radiotherapy. Surgical technique and follow-up were standardized. Survival were analyzed by Kaplan Meier method and compared with the Log Rank test. RESULTS Some 471 patients had rectal excision for invasive rectal carcinoma: 238 were treated by laparoscopy and 233 by open procedure. Postoperative mortality (0.8% vs. 2.6%; P = 0.17), morbidity (22.7% vs. 20.2%; P = 0.51), and quality of surgery (92.0% vs. 94.8% R0 resection; P = 0.22) were similar in the 2 groups. At 5 years, there was no difference of local recurrence (3.9% vs. 5.5%; P = 0.371) and cancer-free survival (82% vs. 79%; P = 0.52) between laparoscopic and open surgery. Multivariate analysis confirmed that type of surgery did not influence cancer outcome. Conversion (36/238, 15%) had no negative impact on postoperative mortality, local recurrence, and survival. CONCLUSIONS The efficacy of laparoscopic surgery in a team specialized in rectal excision for cancer (open and laparoscopic surgery) is suggested with similar long-term local control and cancer-free survival than open surgery. Moreover, conversion had no negative impact on survival.","output":"Laparoscopic versus open surgery for rectal cancer: long-term oncologic results."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a report of established invasive Aspergillus rhinosinusitis in a patient diagnosed with COVID\\\\19 and afflicted by AML, which was initially considered to be rhinocerebral mucormycosis.","output":"First report of invasive Aspergillus rhinosinusitis in a critically ill COVID\\\\19 patient affected by acute myeloid leukemia, northeastern Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the worldwide burden of noncommunicable disease, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) launched a global health awareness initiative in 2007 called Exercise is Medicine?

While cerebellar dysfunction can be caused by vascular, traumatic, metabolic, genetic, inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic events, the cerebellum is also a frequent target of autoimmune attacks. The underlying cause for this vulnerability is unclear, but it may be a result of region-specific differences in bloodCbrain barrier permeability, the high concentration of neurons in the cerebellum and the presence of autoantigens on Purkinje cells. An autoimmune response targeting the cerebellumor any structure in the CNSis typically accompanied by an influx of peripheral immune cells to the brain. Under healthy conditions, the brain is protected from the periphery by the bloodCbrain barrier, bloodCCSF barrier, and bloodCleptomeningeal barrier. Entry of immune cells to the brain for immune surveillance occurs only at the blood-CSF barrier and is strictly controlled. A breakdown in the barrier permeability allows peripheral immune cells uncontrolled access to the CNS.

The spreading of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is a significant problem in surgery, and the most relevant MDR pathogens are summarized as Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococci (ESKAPE) bacteria. Data regarding the species and distribution of bacteria in AA are available, but information about the resistances and their relevance is deficient. METHODS In this retrospective study, we analyzed microbiological swabs of patients with AA. The outcome parameters of patients after laparoscopic appendectomy were analyzed against microbiological results, including antibiotic resistance testing. Positive swabs were compared with bacteria cultivated after alternative abdominal emergency surgery (AES). RESULTS In total, 584 patients with AA were included and had a mean age of 35.5 years. In 216 patients (36.9%), a swab was taken, and in 128 (59.3%) swabs, bacteria could be cultivated. The most frequent organisms were Escherichia coli, Bacteroides species, and Pseudomonas. In 9.4% of the positive AA swabs, MDR germs were cultivated, and all of them were ESKAPE pathogens. Patients with MDR bacteria in AA suffered more infectious complications (p = 0.006) and needed longer hospitalizations (p < 0.009). In AES, aside from appendicitis, a different spectrum containing more MDR bacteria was cultivated (5.9 vs. 20.9%; p < 0.0001).

The attitudes of hospitals toward welcoming families in this respect have improved. In Arab culture, the main core of society is considered to be the family, not the individual. The objective behind involving family in patient care is to meet patients support needs. Consequently, this involvement affects nurses and their attitudes toward the importance of family involvement in patient care. Objectives: To describe nurses and nursing students perceptions of family involvement in the care of hospitalized adult patients in Saudi Arabia. Design: This study used a quantitative descriptive cross-sectional design. The data were collected using a convenience sampling survey via social media. Results: A total of 270 participants (staff and students) took part in this study, including 232 (85.9%) females and 38 (14.1%) males. Moreover, a high percentage of participants (78.8%) acknowledged that family presence strongly affected the improvement of the patients condition. However, 69.3% of participants thought that involving family members during special care processes or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) would be traumatizing for these individuals. Moreover, there was a significant diffidence between the attitudes of the nurses and nursing students toward family involvement and the number of years of employment (F = 3.60, p &lt; 0.05). On the contrary, there were insignificant differences between the attitudes of the nurses and nursing students toward family involvement and their gender, nationality, age, education level, and years of work experience in Saudi Arabia (p &gt; 0.05). Furthermore, the regression analysis showed a significant negative correlation between nurses years of employment and their support of family involvement in patient care (? = ?0.20, SE = 0.08, t = ?2.70, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Nurses with more experience showed no support for family involvement in patient care. We have to consider the clinical barriers that affect nurses support for family involvement in patient-centered care, such as hospital polices, guidelines, and the model used for family-centered care integration in the hospital system to facilitate the interaction between healthcare providers and family members.","output":"The Perceptions of Nurses and Nursing Students Regarding Family Involvement in the Care of Hospitalized Adult Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been associated with myocardial damage N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels have been reported to be elevated and to portend worse outcomes among patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) The value of NT-proBNP in COVID-19 patients without heart failure (HF) is unclear, and data from the United States are limited We reviewed the medical records of 304 adults without history of HF admitted to Stony Brook University Hospital, Long Island, NY, from March 1 to April 15, 2020 with documented severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring high-flow oxygen therapy (non-rebreather mask, Venturi mask with FiO2 &gt;50%, or high-flow nasal cannula) We excluded patients transferred already intubated from outside hospitals and those who were intubated or died within 24h of admission NT-proBNP was measured with a standard Roche Diagnostics assay with a 5-ng/L limit of detection Follow-up data were collected until death or hospital discharge or 30 days if still in the hospital by database lock (May 15, 2020) The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality and the secondary endpoint was death or need for intubation The association of NT-proBNP with the endpoints was evaluated with multivariable Cox regression models Mean age was 6017 years;95 (31 2%) of patients were female;156 (51 3%) were White, 103 (33 9%) Hispanic, 22 (7 2%) Black, and 21 (6 9%) Asian;91 (29 9%) had diabetes, 39 (12 8%) coronary artery disease (CAD), and 27 (8 9%) atrial fibrillation (AF);mean body mass index (BMI) was 30 36 5 kg/m2 On admission, mean O2 saturation (O2SAT) was 898% and median NT-proBNP was 156 ng/L (44-729) After a median of 12 days (8-20), 74 patients (24 3%) died and 59 more (19 4%) were intubated and survived to hospital discharge Baseline NT-proBNP was strongly associated with mortality In models adjusting for age, sex, race, diabetes, CAD, AF, BMI, and baseline O2SAT, every log-2 (doubling) of NT-proBNP was associated with 29% higher risk (HR 1 29;95%CI: 1 17-1 43;P&lt;0 001) The association of baseline NT-proBNP with the composite of death or intubation was weaker (HR 1 09;95%CI: 1 01-1 18;P = 025) Among patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, admission NT-proBNP is a strong predictor of mortality Elevated NT-proBNP levels may identify a subgroup of patients in need of cardioprotective therapy","output":"N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide and Mortality in Patients without Heart Failure Hospitalized with Severe Covid-19 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: For the emerging pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), no clear description on its deaths clinical characteristics and causes of death is available.

Method: A retrospective analysis of 77 COVID-19 deaths in East Branch, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from February 1 to March 7, 2020 was performed in clinical characteristics, laboratory results, causes of death, and subgroup comparison. Results: : Totally 72.7% of the deaths (male-female ratio: 51:26, average age at death: 71, mean survival time: 17.4 days) had hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and other comorbidities. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis were the main causes of death. Increases in C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer and lactic acid (LAC), and decreases in lymphocyte, cluster of differentiation (CD) 4+ and CD8+ cells were common in laboratory results. Subgroup analysis showed: 1) Most female deaths had cough and diabetes. 2) The male proportion in young and middle-aged deaths was higher;while elderly deaths were more prone to myocardial injury and elevated CRP. 3) There was no statistical difference between short-term and non-short-term survival subgroups. 4) CRP and LDH increased and CD4+ and CD8+ cells decreased significantly in patients with hypertension.

Few studies have shown the role of host genetics in disease prognosis and drug response highlighting the importance of diverse participation in COVID-19 clinical trials. The goal of this study is to assess public attitudes in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan toward participating in COVID-19 clinical trials and to identify the factors that may influence their attitude. An online questionnaire was developed and distributed among the target group through social media platforms. The number of responses was 1,576. Three quarters (74.9%) of participants heard about clinical trials before, 57.6% of them had a positive attitude toward participation in COVID-19 clinical trials.

Other positive factors also included protection of family from COVID-19 and contributing to the return to normal community life as well as receiving additional healthcare benefit was the fourth significant predictor. On the other hand, the thought that clinical trials can have a negative impact on the health of participants strongly predicted the unwillingness of individuals to participate in such trials. This was followed by having limited information about the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 and the lack of trust in physicians and hospitals.

In the first few weeks, medical personnel, elderly citizens, and patients with chronic diseases were prioritized. As such, patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies were encouraged to receive the vaccine. Although the efficacy of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines has been demonstrated in the general population, little is known about their efficacy and safety in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI). OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the humoral and cellular immune response to COVID-19 vaccine in a cohort of patients with IEI. METHODS: A total of 26 adult patients were enrolled, and plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from them 2 weeks following the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Humoral response was evaluated by testing anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor-binding domain and antinucleocapsid antibody titers and evaluating neutralizing ability by inhibition of receptor-binding domain-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding. Cellular immune response was evaluated by using ELISpot, estimating IL-2 and IFN-?3 secretion in response to pooled SARS-CoV-2 S- or M-peptides. RESULTS: Our cohort included 18 patients with a predominantly antibody deficiency, 2 with combined immunodeficiency, 3 with immune dysregulation, and 3 with other genetically defined diagnoses. Twenty-two of them were receiving immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Of the 26 patients, 18 developed specific antibody response, and 19 showed S-peptide-specific T-cell response.

These restrictions negatively impact peoples' cardiometabolic and mental health and disproportionately affect certain sectors of the population, including racial/ethnic minorities. In part, the higher risk for complications of COVID-19 could be the result of increased prevalence of comorbid diseases.

A practical strategy to promote health and well-being during COVID-19 is reducing sedentary behavior. Reducing sedentary behaviors (e.g., breaking up periods of prolonged sitting with light-intensity physical activity) may be more easily achieved than physical activity for all individuals, including individuals of racial/ethnic decent, as it does not require purchasing equipment nor require compromising the physical restrictions necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19.

At the same time, many have noted a potential opportunity for rapid change in health, housing, and drug policy despite previous stagnationreferred to as a punctuated equilibrium by Baumgartner and Jonesin response to the pandemic. The pandemic forced some important policy interventions in the United States at both national and local levels, including eviction moratoriums and loosening of drug policy related to substance use treatment. However, to what extent some of these changes will be sustained past the current COVID-19 crisis is still unclear, as is how drug and housing related policy shifts have impacted the work of frontline overdose prevention, substance use treatment, and homelessness advocacy workers. In this qualitative study, we used semi-structured interviews to assess how Philadelphias harm reduction advocates, community organizers, and SUD treatment clinicians have responded to the overdose and homelessness crises during COVID-19, and how they predict the pandemic and ensuing policy changes will impact the future of overdose prevention, harm reduction efforts, and homelessness advocacy. We interviewed 30 eligible participants during July and August 2020. The analysis of these data yielded three themes: 1/None of it should be new to anybody: COVID-era issues impacting PWUD and people experiencing homelessness are extensions of existing problems; 2/An opportunity to actually benefit in some way from this crisis: Possibility for innovation and improved care for PWUD and people experiencing homelessness; and 3/Nothing weve tried has worked, so we have to be uncomfortable and creative: The uncertain path forward. Despite the many barriers that participants faced to promoting the health and well-being of marginalized communities during the pandemic, they also believed that the pandemic presented an important opportunity for positive policy change that has the potential to promote drug user health into the future, including a continuation of loosened federal restrictions on substance use disorder treatment, legalization of safe consumption spaces, safe supply of substances, and progressive, creative housing solutions.","output":"We have to be uncomfortable and creative: Reflections on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on overdose prevention, harm reduction & homelessness advocacy in Philadelphia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibody (MCA) therapies have been utilized under emergency use authorization (EUA) for high-risk pediatric patients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the outpatient setting since late 2019. The purpose of this study was to describe the use of MCA therapy in pediatric patients in the pediatric emergency department (ED) at a large community hospital. METHODS: This was a retrospective case series of high-risk pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age who received MCA therapy in the pediatric ED between December 8, 2020 and June 3, 2021. The primary outcome was to describe the patient characteristics, clinical presentation, and safety profile of the pediatric population that received MCA therapy. The secondary outcome was to describe the incidence of hospitalizations or ED visits up to 28 days following therapy. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients were included in the analysis. The median number of days of symptoms was 4 with 41% of patients having symptoms between 0 and 3 days at time of MCA administration. Only one patient experienced a mild adverse event that did not require epinephrine administration. Two patients returned to the ED for reevaluation during the study follow-up period. No patients required admission within 28 days post-therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of MCA therapy in high-risk pediatric patients in the pediatric ED was well-tolerated with subjective improvement noted in COVID-19 symptoms post-therapy. Further studies are necessary to determine the role MCA therapy may play in reducing morbidity from COVID-19 infection in high-risk pediatric patients.","output":"The use of monoclonal antibody therapy in pediatric patients with COVID-19: a retrospective case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"West Nile virus is an emerging infection in North America but has not traditionally been associated with acute vascular events.

OBJECTIVE: The anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of Sal-B and ZDDY was assessed using the authentic and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection assay. The antiviral targets of Sal-B were identified by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to examine the structural characteristics of HR1 and HR2 regions of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and the S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay was used to evaluate the effect of Sal-B on virus-cell membrane fusion. Flow cytometry was carried out to analyze the effect of Sal-B on the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to hACE2 receptor. OBJECTIVE: The median effective concentrations (EC50) of Sal-B and ZDDY against SARSCoV-2 infection in Vero-E6 cells were 55.47 mol/L and 36.07 g/mL, respectively. Both Sal-B and ZDDY successfully inhibited the entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus into the cells that stably expressed human ACE2 (ACE2/293T), with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 1.69 mol/L and 24.81 g/mL, respectively. Sal-B showed a binding affinity of -8.2 kcal/mol to the 6-helix bundle (6-HB) of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Molecular dynamics simulation showed stable binding between Sal-B and the 6-HB of SARS-CoV-2 S protein at the predicted binding site. Sal-B disturbed the formation of the secondary structure of 6-HB in HR1P/HR2P mixture, resulting in a significantly lowered &#945;-helicity (P < 0.05). Sal-B dose-dependently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion, with an IC50 of 3.33 mol/L. Sal-B showed no effect on RBD-Fc protein binding to the ACE2 receptor. OBJECTIVE: Sal-B and its magnesium salt ZDDY can inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells in vitro by blocking SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated virus-cell membrane fusion.","output":"[Salvianolic acid B and its magnesium salt inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero-E6 cells by blocking spike protein-mediated membrane fusion]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In the United Kingdom (UK), 63% of adults are overweight,(1) costing the NHS 6.1 billion/year. With the public using digital technology over healthcare professionals (HCPs) for health advice, this warrants an investigation of technology use in community pharmacy, given its previous successful use.(2) AIM: To determine the feasibility and perceptions of a community pharmacist (CP)-led weight management programme (WMP), enhanced by a Facebook support group (FSG). METHODS: A proof of concept study was conducted between January-March 2020. Recruitment was via a pharmacy, the university and a community Facebook group. Inclusion criteria: over 18 years; overweight; no medical conditions. Participants attended face-to-face meetings (ftf) with a CP and final year pharmacy student (PS) on two occasions (0 (baseline) and 4 weeks). At baseline, participants were given the NHS weight loss programme and set weight loss goals. During ftf, participants had height, weight, and waist circumference (WC) measurements by a CP/PS and discussed eating habits, exercise and alcohol. In between ftf, participants accessed the FSG (created (December 2019) and moderated by a CP). Here, they received posts about diet, exercise and motivation. Participants were to have their measurements taken ftf at 8-weeks, however, COVID-19 meant participants had to self-declare these via video call. Following the 8-week programme, participants completed a 4-section survey about their experience (signing up to the service; comparison to previous weight loss attempts; the FSG and overall perceptions). Question types included multiple choice, Likert scale and free text comments. Data were analysed in Excel (Microsoft Corporation 2016) with changes in height, weight, waist circumference, alcohol and exercise being calculated. RESULTS: Fifty-five participants were recruited. 18 were lost to follow-up, most (n=12/18) citing COVID-19. Of the 37 participants remaining (70.3% female, mean age=37 years), 22 were obese, the rest overweight. Mean weight loss, mean percentage weight loss and mean WC reduction at 4-weeks was 1.6 kg (SD+/- 1.7 kg), 1.8% (SD+/- 1.9%) and 2 cm (SD+/- 1.96 cm) respectively. At week 8 measurements were self-declared. Mean weight loss at 8-weeks from baseline was 2.7 kg (SD +/- 2.6 kg) and mean percentage weight loss was 3% (SD+/- 3%). Only five participants self-declared WC measurements at 8-weeks with mean reduction being 3.6 cm. Five participants moved to healthier BMI classifications by week 8. All participants accessed the FSG at least weekly with 13 accessing it daily. Diet posts were the most popular (n=20/37). Participants learned about portion control and increasing fruits/vegetables intake. All participants would recommend the programme to their friends/family. CONCLUSION: An 8-week CPWMP, enhanced with FSG, supported participants to lose a mean of 3% body weight. Participants accessed the page regularly and were positive about its usefulness. One limitation was that the COVID-19 lockdown prevented the 8-week ftf, therefore, self-declared measurements were used. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of pharmacy embracing technology for service delivery, particularly when in-person contact is limited. The implication of this study is that it provides proof that the concept of digital service delivery could work in practice. REFERENCES: 1. GOV.UK.

OBJECTIVE To prospectively analyze the impact of HRQoL between obese patients who underwent surgery and those who were wait-listed. METHODS Between April 2017 and March 2018, 70 surgical and 69 wait-listed patients were interviewed twice, at baseline and at the 12-month follow-up. Quality of life was measured by the SF-12v2 and the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQoL-Lite) questionnaires. Sociodemographic-, clinical-, and surgical-related variables were collected. RESULTS One hundred thirty-nine patients were analyzed, showing similar baseline characteristics but differences in HRQoL. Performing more qualified work improved scores on some aspects of the SF-12 survey. In contrast, women scored worse on the self-esteem domain, and men scored worse on the mental health domain. By group, at the 12-month follow-up, statistically significant differences were found among all aspects of the questionnaires between both groups (P < 0.001) and between baseline and postoperative 12-month follow-up in the surgical group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, scores were lower in all domains in the evolution of wait-listed patients, with statistically significant differences among the Bodily Pain, Emotional Role, Mental Health, and Mental Component Summary Domains (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION HRQoL is a multimodal concept that allows the identification of factors impacting obese patients' quality of life. It promotes the benefit of surgery against waiting list delays, which can take up to 4 years in our hospital. Therefore, HRQoL is an important pillar to justify more resources for reducing unacceptable surgical delays.","output":"Prospective Analysis Regarding Health-Related Quality of Life (HR-QOL) between Morbid Obese Patients Following Bariatric Surgery Versus on a Waiting List."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of every economy.

Several and often interconnected factors, both abiotic and biotic, determine the persistence of these viruses released in the environment, which can last from a few seconds to several years. Moreover, viruses in the environment are able to travel short to very long distances, especially in the air or in water. SUMMARY Although well described now, the role of these environments as intermediaries or as reservoirs in virus transmission has been extensively studied and debated in the last century. The majority of these discoveries, such as the pioneer work on bacteria transmission, the progressive discoveries of viruses, as well as the persistence of the influenza virus in the air varying along with droplet sizes, or the role of water in the transmission of poliovirus, have contributed to the improvement of public health. Recent outbreaks of human coronavirus, influenza virus, and Ebola virus have also demonstrated the contemporaneity of these research studies and the need to study virus persistence in the environment.

However, some features such as thyrotoxicosis are inconsistent in these studies. In addition, some drugs such as heparin interfere with the free T4 assay. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to examine TFT abnormalities in COVID-19, utilizing direct and indirect methods of free T4 assay. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 131 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Serum levels of total T3, TSH, T3RU, and total T4 were measured. The free T4 assay was performed using direct (free T4) and indirect (free thyroxin index or FT4I) methods. The patients were categorized into different TFT groups. The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and outcomes were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The frequencies of nonthyroidal illness (NTI), subclinical/overt hypothyroidism and subclinical/overt thyrotoxicosis were 51.7, 6.9, and 6.9%, respectively. Besides, 6 and 8.1% of the patients had isolated high free T4 and isolated high FT4I without any other TFT abnormality, respectively. The lymphocyte percent was lower in the subclinical/overt group than in other TFT groups (P = 0.002).

The spread of the pandemic led first to the activation of a conflict between a sovereigntist reflex privileging the expression of national capacities and national self-reliance and a more perforated understanding of sovereignty stressing the interdependence of peoples and states, both geographically and institutionally. As the response to COVID itself became more politicized we see the emergence of a second tension, between a libertarian reflex supporting a residual state protecting liberties and facilitating individual choice and a sovereign-statist instinct, calling for an empowered guardian of the public good capable of ensuring collective security. A third tension relates to the seemingly growing opposition between a conception of sovereignty founded (and contingent) upon the will of the people and one in which the sovereign is, simultaneously, the discerner, defender and ultimate guarantor of the public good. After having mapped out these interwoven tensions and their main fault lines in general terms, the paper proceeds comparatively, tracking and tracing their (differential and specific) presence in governmental responses in two advanced capitalist democracies, France and Britain.","output":"The antinomies of sovereigntism, statism and liberalism in European democratic responses to the COVID-19 crisis: a comparison of Britain and France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Even though gossip is a ubiquitous organizational behavior that fulfils important social functions (e.g., social bonding or emotion venting), little is known about how workplace gossip and its functions unfold in situ.

It evaluates the contribution of various risk factors (e.g., race/ethnicity, wearing a face mask) and the relationship with mental distress among U.S. adults in March and April 2020, when the pandemic escalated across the country. Methods Participants consisted of a probability-based, nationally representative sample of U.S. residents aged 18 years who completed COVID-19-related surveys online in March and April (n=3,665). Multivariable logistic regression was used to predict the probability of a person perceiving COVID-19 associated discrimination. Linear regression was used to analyze the association between discrimination and mental distress. Analyses were conducted in May 2020. Results Perception of COVID-19 associated discrimination increased from March (4%) to April (10%). Non-Hispanic blacks (absolute risk from 0.09 to 0.15 across months) and Asians (absolute risk from 0.11 to 0.17) were more likely to perceive discrimination than other racial/ethnic groups (absolute risk from 0.03 to 0.11). Individuals who wore face masks (absolute risk from 0.11 to 0.14) also perceived more discrimination compared with those who did not (absolute risk from 0.04 to 0.11). Perceiving discrimination was subsequently associated with increased mental distress (from 0.77 to 1.01 points on the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire score). Conclusions Perception of COVID-19 associated discrimination was relatively low but increased with time. Perceived discrimination was associated with race/ethnicity and wearing face masks, and may contribute to greater mental distress during early stages of the pandemic. The long-term implications of this novel form of discrimination should be monitored.","output":"Perceived Discrimination and Mental Distress Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence From the Understanding America Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination is a critical tool in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Vaccine acceptance was also higher in persons with high risk perception (aOR = 1.61, 95%CI:1.13-2.81, high vs. low), those who were unconcerned about vaccine safety (aOR = 1.71, 95%CI:1.13-3.55), and those who were not worried about efficacy (aOR = 2.02, 95%CI:1.14-4.11) and infertility-related rumors (aOR = 1.98, 95%CI:1.24-3.18). Themes revealed doubts about the existence of COVID-19, mistrust for authorities, and popular credence to rumors and conspiracy theories. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was sub-optimal and influenced by respondent's age, income, co-morbidities, risk perception, and concerns about vaccine safety, efficacy, and rumors. Context-specific, evidence-based risk communication strategies and trust-building measures could boost vaccine confidence in similar settings.","output":"\\"They have produced a vaccine, but we doubt if COVID-19 exists\\": correlates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptability among adults in Kano, Nigeria."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Delirium, a form of acute brain dysfunction, is very common in the critically ill adult patient population. Although its pathophysiology is poorly understood, multiple factors associated with delirium have been identified, many of which are coincident with critical illness. To date, no drug or non-drug treatments have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with delirium. Clinical trials have provided a limited understanding of the contributions of multiple triggers and processes of intensive care unit (ICU) acquired delirium, making identification of therapies difficult. Delirium is independently associated with poor long term outcomes, including persistent cognitive impairment. A longer duration of delirium is associated with worse long term cognition after adjustment for age, education, pre-existing cognitive function, severity of illness, and exposure to sedatives. Interestingly, differences in prevalence are seen between ICU survivor populations, with survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome experiencing higher rates of cognitive impairment at early follow-up compared with mixed ICU survivor populations. Although cognitive performance improves over time for some ICU survivors, impairment is persistent in others. Studies have so far been unable to identify patients at higher risk of long term cognitive impairment; this is an active area of scientific investigation.","output":"Delirium and long term cognition in critically ill patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetes is a most significant and sensitive metabolic disorder.

Despite this, there has been little research to date on the relationship between loneliness and COVID-19 preventive behaviours. We studied these associations in a sample of the Japanese population. METHODS: Data were analysed from an online survey of 2000 adults undertaken in April and May 2020. Loneliness was assessed with the Three-Item Loneliness Scale. Information was also collected on 13 COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Regression analyses were used to examine associations. RESULTS: In linear regression models adjusted for demographic and mental health variables, both dichotomous and continuous loneliness measures were negatively associated with engaging in COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Logistic regression analyses further showed that loneliness was also associated with reduced odds for a variety of individual preventive behaviours including wearing a mask (odds ratio [OR]: 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62-0.95), disinfecting hands (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67-0.94) and social distancing when outdoors (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61-0.92).

As patients entering a doctor's practice can potentially infect medical staff and other patients, using digital alternatives wherever possible is a potential solution to avoiding face-to-face encounters. In these conditions, telemedicine is becoming increasingly relevant. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine telemedicine use and gathered experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In June 2020, a representative group of Austrian respondents (n = 1000) was asked via online survey whether they had contacted a doctor during spring of 2020, and, if so, whether they had used a telemedical method to do so. The survey also reflected gathered experiences and degrees of satisfaction with the use of telemedicine. RESULTS: A third (33%) of those who contacted a doctor during the target period did so using telemedical tools. The majority of those with previous telehealth experience were satisfied with the help they received. Patients commonly used a telephone to contact their doctors. The overall assessment of telemedical aids tended to be positive, with more than half (53%) of those surveyed seeing significant advantages, and a 90% satisfaction rate among the respondents who used telehealth services. CONCLUSION: The outcomes from this work hint at fairly high acceptance of telemedical communication tools in the studied group of the Austrian population. Based on the high rate of satisfaction among patients who used telehealth, it is expected that the use of telehealth services will increase further in the near future.","output":"Telehealth in Times of COVID-19: Spotlight on Austria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this chapter, a fractional SEIR model and its robust first-order unconditionally convergent numerical method is proposed Initial conditions based on Namibian data as of 4 July 2020 were used to simulate two scenarios In the first scenario, it is assumed that the proper control mechanisms for kerbing the spread of COVID-19 are in place In the second scenario, a worst-case scenario is presented The worst case is characterised by ineffective COVID-19 control mechanisms Results indicate that if proper control mechanisms are followed, Namibia can contain the spread of COVID-19 in the country to a lowest level of 1, 800 positive cases by October 2020 However, if no proper control mechanisms are followed, Namibia can hit a potentially unmanageable level of over 14, 000 positive cases by October 2020 From a mathematical point of view, results indicate that the fractional SEIR model and the proposed method are appropriate for modelling the chaotic nature observed in the spread of COVID-19 Results herein are fundamentally important to policy and decision-makers in devising appropriate control and management strategies for curbing further spread of COVID-19 in Namibia ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd","output":"Fractional SEIR Model for Modelling the Spread of COVID-19 in Namibia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is spreading throughout the world affecting both healthy individuals and people with underlying immune-deficiencies.

Abdominal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass of about 2cm in diameter in contact with the right adrenal gland. Total situs inversus was simultaneously confirmed. The plasma aldosterone concentration was elevated to 442pg/mL, and renin activity was suppressed, at 0.3ng/mL/hr. DISCUSSION These findings indicated a diagnosis of primary aldosteronism due to an adrenal tumor, and the right adrenal tumor was resected laparoscopically. The right adrenal gland was approached and resected from the lateral side of the spleen, which was located on the right side because of situs inversus.

They provide antiviral properties to cells by inducing the expression of hundreds of genes known as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The two most important IFNs that can be produced by virtually all cells in the body during intrinsic innate immune response belong to two distinct families: the type I and type III IFNs. The type I IFN receptor is ubiquitously expressed whereas the type III IFN receptors expression is limited to epithelial cells and a subset of immune cells. While originally considered to be redundant, type III IFNs have now been shown to play a unique role in protecting mucosal surfaces against pathogen challenges. The mucosal specific functions of type III IFN do not solely rely on the restricted epithelial expression of its receptor but also on the distinct means by which type III IFN mediates its anti-pathogen functions compared to the type I IFN. In this review we first provide a general overview on IFNs and present the similarities and differences in the signal transduction pathways leading to the expression of either type I or type III IFNs. By highlighting the current state-of-knowledge of the two archetypical mucosal surfaces (e.g. the respiratory and intestinal epitheliums), we present the differences in the signaling cascades used by type I and type III IFNs to uniquely induce the expression of ISGs. We then discuss in detail the role of each IFN in controlling pathogen infections in intestinal and respiratory epithelial cells. Finally, we provide our perspective on novel concepts in the field of IFN (stochasticity, response heterogeneity, cellular polarization/differentiation and tissue microenvironment) that we believe have implications in driving the differences between type I and III IFNs and could explain the preferences for type III IFNs at mucosal surfaces.","output":"Importance of Type I and III Interferons at Respiratory and Intestinal Barrier Surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the scale and rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, or 2019-nCoV), there is an urgent need to identify therapeutics that are effective against COVID-19 before vaccines are available. Since the current rate of SARS-CoV-2 knowledge acquisition via traditional research methods is not sufficient to match the rapid spread of the virus, novel strategies of drug discovery for SARS-CoV-2 infection are required. Structure-based virtual screening for example relies primarily on docking scores and does not take the importance of key residues into consideration, which may lead to a significantly higher incidence rate of false-positive results. Our novel in silico approach, which overcomes these limitations, can be utilized to quickly evaluate FDA-approved drugs for repurposing and combination, as well as designing new chemical agents with therapeutic potential for COVID-19. As a result, anti-HIV or antiviral drugs (lopinavir, tenofovir disoproxil, fosamprenavir and ganciclovir), antiflu drugs (peramivir and zanamivir) and an anti-HCV drug (sofosbuvir) are predicted to bind to 3CL(Pro) in SARS-CoV-2 with therapeutic potential for COVID-19 infection by our new protocol. In addition, we also propose three antidiabetic drugs (acarbose, glyburide and tolazamide) for the potential treatment of COVID-19.

Currently, contacts traced manually through the NHS Test and Trace scheme in the UK are asked to self-isolate for 14 days from the day they were exposed to the index case, which represents the upper bound for the incubation period. However, following previous work on screening strategies for air travellers it may be possible that this quarantine period could be reduced if combined with PCR testing. Adapting the simulation model for contact tracing, we find that quarantine periods of at least 10 days combined with a PCR test on day 9 may largely emulate the results from a 14-day quarantine period in terms of the averted transmission potential from secondary cases (72% (95%UI: 3%, 100%) vs 75% (4%, 100%), respectively). These results assume the delays from testing index cases' and tracing their contacts are minimised (no longer than 4.5 days on average). If secondary cases are traced and quarantined 1 day earlier on average, shorter quarantine periods of 8 days with a test on day 7 (76% (7%, 100%)) approach parity with the 14 day quarantine period with a 1 day longer delay to the index cases' test. However, the risk of false-negative PCR tests early in a traced case's infectious period likely prevents the use of testing to reduce quarantine periods further than this, and testing immediately upon tracing, with release if negative, will avert just 17% of transmission potential on average. In conclusion, the use of PCR testing is an effective strategy for reducing quarantine periods for secondary cases, while still reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially if delays in the test and trace system can be reduced, and may improve quarantine compliance rates.","output":"Quarantine and testing strategies in contact tracing for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper discusses social prescribing as part of the wider NHS England universal personalised care model, and it describes how community nurses can engage with social prescribing systems to support community resilience.

However, an unintended consequence of this structure is that the identity of which silver plans are free will often turn over between years, requiring that enrollees actively initiate premium payment (or lose coverage). The prevalence of this free-plan turnover is not known. OBJECTIVE: To measure the prevalence of free-plan turnover in ACA Marketplaces and to estimate how many enrollees below 150% of FPL are likely to be affected. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational cross-sectional study used data on plan offerings and premiums in 33 state ACA Marketplaces using HealthCare.gov in 2021 and 2022, along with estimates of county-level enrollee characteristics and plan selection patterns. The enrollment-weighted share of county markets affected by free-plan turnover was quantified, along with the association of turnover with enrollee and market characteristics. Estimates of the number of affected low-income enrollees were calculated using the data plus statistics reported in past research. Data were analyzed from November 21, 2021, to February 28, 2022. RESULTS: This study found that turnover of zero-premium plans was quite common, with 93% of HealthCare.gov counties (weighted by enrollment) experiencing at least 1 zero-premium plan in 2021 turning over to nonfree in 2022; 84% of counties experienced turnover of all $0 silver plans from 2021 to 2022.

Methods In this randomised, multi-arm, parallel group, open label, adaptive phase 2 proof-of-concept trial (CATALYST) we recruited hospitalised patients []16 years with COVID-19 pneumonia and C-reactive protein (CRP) []40mg/L in nine UK hospitals. Participants were randomly allocated with equal probability to usual care, or usual care plus a single 150mg intravenous dose of namilumab (150mg) or infliximab (5mg/kg). Randomisation was stratified for ward versus ICU. The primary endpoint was improvement in inflammation in intervention arms compared to control as measured by CRP over time, analysed using Bayesian multi-level models. ISRCTN registry number 40580903. Findings Between 15th June 2020 and 18th February 2021 we randomised 146 participants: 54 to usual care, 57 to namilumab and 35 to infliximab. The probabilities that namilumab and infliximab were superior to usual care in reducing CRP over time were 97% and 15% respectively. Consistent effects were seen in ward and ICU patients and aligned with clinical outcomes, such that the probability of discharge (WHO levels 1-3) at day 28 was 47% and 64% for ICU and ward patients on usual care, versus 66% and 77% for patients treated with namilumab. 134 adverse events occurred in 30/55 (54.5%) namilumab patients compared to 145 in 29/54 (53.7%) usual care patients. 102 events occurred in 20/29 (69.0%) infliximab patients versus 112 events in 17/34 (50.0%) usual care patients.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many trainings planned face-to-face were carried out remotely. In this study, our aim is to evaluate students' views on the efficiency of DAE, and to increase the efficiency of DAE in the future. METHODS: The questionnaire used in the study was applied to the first grade students in the Faculty of Medicine, at the Eskisehir Osmangazi University, in 2019-2020. 239 students completed the survey. The questionnaire consisted of the demographic information, that was obtained with voluntary consent, and sections containing suggestions on DAE, and its comparison with distance education of other basic medical science courses. The survey was prepared as a Likert scale (with 1 = totally disagree to 5 = totally agree), on Google forms and sent to the students online. RESULTS: 82.4% of the students marked \\"totally disagree\\" or \\"disagree\\" for the statement of \\"DAE is more efficient than TAE\\". The total percentage of students who marked \\"totally disagree\\" or \\"disagree\\" for the statement of \\"I was satisfied with the theoretical education in DAE\\" was 58.6%, but when it came to practical education the percentage raised to 79.9%. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results the efficiency of DAE, especially in terms of practice lessons, was found to be lower than TAE.

This study investigated the canonical relationship between factors of COVID-19 preparedness and anxiety and proposed a conceptual model framework on these factors in the contexts of Thailand. This mixed-methods study employed an explanatory sequential design to conduct a two-phase exploration. Quantitative data were collected in the first phase using online questionnaires. The sample included 2808 respondents selected through a convenience and a snowball sampling. Data collection was conducted from March 29 to May 16, 2020, and content analysis was employed to process these data. The quantitative analysis with canonical relationship between COVID-19 preparedness and anxiety was 0.403 at a moderate level (p-value < 0.01). Thai citizens with high preparedness on risk mitigation and long-term outbreak mitigation planning tended to congruently demonstrate high anxiety towards responses of the government and public sectors, corruption, and misconduct. The conceptual model framework of qualitative analysis on preparedness were classified into three levels, i.e., individuals, families and communities, and social networks.

(B) A 50-year-old woman with COVID-19, 4 days after admission, started complaining of tachycardia, pain, and mass in the lower abdomen. On abdomen physical examination, a huge lower abdominal tender mass was noticed. Both of the patients underwent an abdomen CT scan which confirmed a huge rectus sheath hematoma (RSH). Both of the patients underwent angioembolization of the inferior epigastric artery. The patient recovered completely and no evidence of further expansion was seen after 2 weeks of follow-up. DISCUSSION: Hemorrhagic issues in COVID-19 patients remain poorly understood. Physicians should discuss risks of RSH in patients where continuous anticoagulation therapy will be reinstated. With increased clinician awareness of the need for RSH screening in COVID-19 patients with acute abdominal pain, the interprofessional team of healthcare providers can maximize patient safety and reduce hospitalization time, especially in high-risk patients at risk for unnecessary surgery.

We aim to understand the extent of their psychological distress in this epidemic and whether they have received sufficient support. Thus targeted to provide support for them and indirectly reduce the concerns of the rescue workers. From February 27 to March 1, 2020, we used the scales of Perceived Stress Scale, 10-items Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-2, and primary care-posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to evaluate the mental health level of the family members of front-line rescue workers online. Six hundred and seventy one family members voluntarily filled out the questionnaire after reading the purpose of the study. A total of 671 family members of front-line rescue workers participated in the survey, including 194 husbands/wives, 52 parents, 49 children, 76 brothers and sisters, and 300 other relationships. Among them, 55% of the family members reported sleep problems, 49.0% of the family members had mild, and above anxiety symptoms, 12.2% of the family members reported clinically significant depression symptoms, and 10.4% of the family members may have PTSD, 8.3% of family members had thoughts of self-injury or suicide. The feeling of stress was positively correlated with anxiety and depression, but there was no significant correlation between psychological elasticity and various symptoms. Family members who are more worried about the safety, physical condition and living security of front-line rescue workers are more likely to report symptoms such as sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression. Family members' first-line rescue has a significant impact on their daily life, raising children and supporting the elderly, which is also related to the occurrence of mental and psychological symptoms. During the period of front-line support, they received support from the units or organizations of the first-line workers, mainly including telephone greetings and daily necessities. The top three concerns about the information of the epidemic were the time of the end of the epidemic, the time of the return of the family and the progress of COVID-19's treatment. After the end of the epidemic, what they most want to do is to pay more attention to and accompany their families, family gatherings, and do more exercise. The psychological impact of this epidemic on the families of front-line rescue workers is mainly sleep problems and anxiety.

The performance achievements of this paper are implemented within the bandwidth of 3 MHz of uplink and downlink, such as impedance bandwidth is 3 MHz with impedance of 50, axial ratio bandwidth is 2.5 MHz, operation frequency of uplink is 240-243 MHz, downlink is 320 MHz and 401 MHz, and the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) is less than 2 dB which is so called S parameter, the above parameters can meet the performance index design requirements.","output":"Mechanical stress induces a scalable circularly polarized LEO satellite antenna with Quadrifilar spiral"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It is now well recognised that the risk of severe COVID-19 increases with some long-term conditions (LTCs). However, prior research primarily focuses on individual LTCs and there is a lack of data on the influence of multimorbidity (&#8805;2 LTCs) on the risk of COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of multimorbidity, more detailed understanding of the associations with multimorbidity and COVID-19 would improve risk stratification and help protect those most vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Here we examine the relationships between multimorbidity, polypharmacy (a proxy of multimorbidity), and COVID-19; and how these differ by sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological prognostic factors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied data from UK Biobank (428,199 participants; aged 37-73; recruited 2006-2010) on self-reported LTCs, medications, sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological measures which were linked to COVID-19 test data. Poisson regression models examined risk of COVID-19 by multimorbidity/polypharmacy and effect modification by COVID-19 prognostic factors (age/sex/ethnicity/socioeconomic status/smoking/physical activity/BMI/systolic blood pressure/renal function). 4,498 (1.05%) participants were tested; 1,324 (0.31%) tested positive for COVID-19. Compared with no LTCs, relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 in those with 1 LTC was no higher (RR 1.12 (CI 0.96-1.30)), whereas those with &#8805;2 LTCs had 48% higher risk; RR 1.48 (1.28-1.71). Compared with no cardiometabolic LTCs, having 1 and &#8805;2 cardiometabolic LTCs had a higher risk of COVID-19; RR 1.28 (1.12-1.46) and 1.77 (1.46-2.15), respectively. Polypharmacy was associated with a dose response higher risk of COVID-19. All prognostic factors were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in multimorbidity; being non-white, most socioeconomically deprived, BMI &#8805;40 kg/m2, and reduced renal function were associated with the highest risk of COVID-19 infection: RR 2.81 (2.09-3.78); 2.79 (2.00-3.90); 2.66 (1.88-3.76); 2.13 (1.46-3.12), respectively. No multiplicative interaction between multimorbidity and prognostic factors was identified. Important limitations include the low proportion of UK Biobank participants with COVID-19 test data (1.05%) and UK Biobank participants being more affluent, healthier and less ethnically diverse than the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing multimorbidity, especially cardiometabolic multimorbidity, and polypharmacy are associated with a higher risk of developing COVID-19. Those with multimorbidity and additional factors, such as non-white ethnicity, are at heightened risk of COVID-19.","output":"Multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and COVID-19 infection within the UK Biobank cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]governments took new steps to include labor market outsiders in social programs.

In China, after strict city lockdown, the average NO2 concentration decreased 55.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 51.5-59.6%) and the total number of confirmed new cases decreased significantly. We also determined that the global airborne NO2 concentration steeply decreased over the vast majority of COVID-19-hit areas based on satellite measurements.

However, the pain symptoms, including neurological and musculoskeletal pain symptoms, are still poorly understood. DESIGN: In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the prevalence of musculoskeletal and neurological pain symptoms among hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Furthermore, the association of clinical and demographic factors with the prevalence of pain symptoms was also investigated. RESULT: We included 182 hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients with a mean age of 48.86  13.98 yrs. Pain symptoms were reported by 61.54% patients (n = 112). Most common symptoms reported were generalized myalgia (n = 60, 32.96%), headache (n = 50, 27.47%), and low back pain (n = 41, 22.53%). Interestingly, neuropathic pain was present in 14 participants (7.69%). Logistic regression analysis revealed an association of pain symptoms with coronavirus disease 2019 severity, male sex, higher body mass index, and a history of addiction. CONCLUSIONS: Pain symptoms are common manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019.

Our goal was to generate an N95-alternative 3D printed respirator that passed the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)-certified quantitative fit testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3D printed prototypes for N95 solutions were created based on the design of commercial N95 respirators. CT imaging was performed on an anthropomorphic head phantom wearing a commercially available N95 respirator and these facial contour data was used in mask prototyping. Prototypes were generated using rigid and flexible polymers. According to OSHA standards, prototypes underwent subsequent quantitative respirator fit testing on volunteers who passed fit tests on commercial N95 respirators. RESULTS: A total of 10 prototypes were 3D printed using both rigid (n=5 designs) and flexible materials (n=5 designs), Prototypes generated with rigid printing materials (n=5 designs) did not pass quantitative respirator fit testing. Three of the 5 prototypes with flexible materials failed quantitative fit testing. The final two prototypes designs passed OSHA-certified quantitative fit tests with an overall mean fit factor of 138 (passing is over 100). CONCLUSIONS: Through rapid prototyping, 3D printed N95 alternative masks were designed with topographical facial CT data to create mask facial contour and passed OSHA-certified quantitative respiratory testing when flexible polymer was used. This mask design may provide an alternative to disposable N95 respirators in case of pandemic-related shortages. Furthermore, this approach may allow customization for those that would otherwise fail fit testing on standard commercial respirators.","output":"Quantitative fit tested N95 respirator-alternatives generated with CT imaging and 3D printing: a response to potential shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report on the onset of minimal change disease (MCD) presenting with anasarca after a second dose of the messenger RNA (mRNA)-based Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

SARS-CoV-2 has a unique polybasic insertion at the S1/S2 CS, which we demonstrate can be cleaved by furin. Using lentiviral pseudotypes and a cell-culture adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus with a S1/S2 deletion, we show that the polybasic insertion is selected for in lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures but selected against in Vero E6, a cell line used for passaging SARS-CoV-2. We find this selective advantage depends on expression of the cell surface protease, TMPRSS2, that allows virus entry independent of endosomes thus avoiding antiviral IFITM proteins. SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking the S1/S2 furin CS was shed to lower titres from infected ferrets and was not transmitted to cohoused sentinel animals. Thus, the polybasic CS is a key determinant for efficient SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","output":"The furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a key determinant for transmission due to enhanced replication in airway cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A concert is a common event at which people gather to share a musical experience. While techniques are increasingly offering insights into naturalistic stimuli perception, this study extended methods to a more ecological context in order to explore real-world music listening within a concert setting. Cardiorespiratory, skin conductance, and facial muscle responses were measured from participants attending one of three concerts with live chamber music performances of works of varying Western Classical styles (Viennese Classical, Contemporary, and Romantic). Collective physiological synchronisation of audience members was operationalised via inter-subject correlation (ISC). By assessing which musical features (obtained via Music Information Retrieval and music-theoretical analyses) evoked moments of high synchrony, logistic regressions revealed that tempo consistently predicted physiological synchrony across all concerts in Classical and Romantic styles, but not the Contemporary style. Highly synchronised responses across all three concert audiences seemed to occur during structural transitional passages, boundaries, and at phrase repetitions. The results support the idea that group synchronisation is linked to musical arousal, structural coherence, and familiarity. By employing physiological ISC and an inter-disciplinary musical analysis, the current study demonstrates a novel approach to gain valuable insight into experiences of naturalistic stimuli in an ecological context.","output":"Synchrony in the periphery: inter-subject correlation of physiological responses during live music concerts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"T follicular helper (Tfh) cells provide critical help to B cells during the germinal center (GC) reaction to facilitate generation of protective humoral immunity.

Prolonged glucocorticoid overtreatment causes multiple morbidities. HYPOTHESIS: We tested the hypotheses that the DGRD, empirically determined by individual patient titration, is lower than that of the Endocrine Society guidelines and tolerated without evidence of glucocorticoid under-replacement. METHODS: We empirically determined the DGRD in 25 otherwise healthy adults with AI by titrating the DGRD to the lowest dose tolerated as judged by body mass index, blood pressure, serum sodium concentration and AI symptoms. Patients received either HC or prednisone (PRED). The HC equivalent of PRED was assumed to be 4:1. RESULTS: The mean empirically determined DGRD, expressed as HC equivalent, was significantly less than the midpoint of the Endocrine Societys recommended DGRD (7.6  3.5 mg/m(2) vs 11.8 mg/m(2); P < 0.001). The DGRD in the adrenalectomy group was not significantly different than the DGRD of those with other AI causes (7.9  4.0 mg/m(2) vs 7.3  3.1 mg/m(2); P = ns), demonstrating that the empirically determined DGRD was not biased by residual cortisol secretion.

Electronic databases were searched for eligible studies on 1 August 2021. All prospective and retrospective studies of COVID-19 in KTR were considered eligible without language restriction. Since data in case reports and series could potentially be subsets of larger studies, only studies with  50 patients were included. Random-effects model meta-analysis was used to calculate weighted mean difference (WMD) and pooled odds ratio (OR) of factors associated with mortality. From a total 1,137 articles retrieved, 13 were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis comprising 4,440 KTR. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were significantly older (WMD 10.5 years, 95% CI 9.3C11.8). KTR of deceased donor were at higher risk of death (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.10C2.74).

Even though the length of hospital stay could vary due to different factors, the factors that affect the stay are not well characterized yet, particularly in the resource-limited settings. Knowing the time spent by the coronavirus disease 2019 patients in the hospital and its associated factors are important to prioritize mobilizing resources, such as beds, pharmacological and non-pharmacological supplies, and health personnel. Therefore, this study was intended to determine the median and identify factors associated with the length of hospital stay among coronavirus disease 2019 cases. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study design was implemented on 394 randomly selected hospitalized patients. Epidata Version 3.1 software was used for data entry, and further analysis was done using Stata version 14.2 software. Frequencies, median with interquartile range, and chi-square test were performed. A logistic regression model was used to identify the association between outcome and explanatory variables. The statistical significance was declared at p-value of less than 0.05 at 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: The analysis was done for a total of 394 cases admitted for coronavirus disease 2019. The median age of the study participants was 40 years with interquartile range of 28C60 years. The median length of hospital stay was 12 days with the interquartile range of 8C17 days. The patients presented with shortness of breathing (AOR = 2.74, 95% confidence interval: 1.33C5.66), incident organ failure (AOR = 3.65, 95% confidence interval: 1.15C11.58), increased leukocyte count (AOR = 0.95; 95% confidence interval: 0.91C0.99), and blood urea nitrogen (AOR = 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.97C0.99) had a significant association with prolonged hospital stay. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the proportion of patients stayed above the median hospital stay of the total patients was 185 (46.9%) with the median length of 12 (interquartile range = 8C17) days. Patients presented with difficulty of breathing, had incident organ failure, had decreased leukocyte, and blood urea nitrogen level should be estimated to stay longer in the hospital. Hence, patients with prolonged hospital length of stay associating factors should be expected to consume more pharmacological and non-pharmacological resources during hospital care receiving.","output":"Factors associated with prolonged length of hospital stay among COVID-19 cases admitted to the largest treatment center in Eastern Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients despite advancements in the field.

We fitted a stochastic transmission model on reported cases, recoveries and deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection across 101 countries. The dynamics of disease transmission was represented in terms of the daily effective reproduction number ([Formula: see text]). The relationship between public health interventions and [Formula: see text] was explored, firstly using a hierarchical clustering algorithm on initial [Formula: see text] patterns, and secondly computing the time-lagged cross correlation among the daily number of policies implemented, [Formula: see text], and daily incidence counts in subsequent months. The impact of updating [Formula: see text] every time a prediction is made on the forecasting accuracy of the model was investigated. We identified 5 groups of countries with distinct transmission patterns during the first 6 months of the pandemic. Early adoption of social distancing measures and a shorter gap between interventions were associated with a reduction on the duration of outbreaks. The lagged correlation analysis revealed that increased policy volume was associated with lower future [Formula: see text] (75 days lag), while a lower [Formula: see text] was associated with lower future policy volume (102 days lag).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case-control study, 30 patients with breast cancer and 20 normal subjects were sampled after obtaining written consent. MPs were isolated from blood samples by centrifugation technique. CD42b and annexin V markers were used respectively for counting PMPs and procoagulant MPs with flow cytometry.

To provide an indication of the UHC-related priorities of Pacific health authorities and promote alignment of domestic and international investments in health sector development, we thematically analyzed the discussion, resolutions, and recommendations from 5 years (2015C2020) of senior-level Pacific health meetings. Five main themes emerged: (i) the Healthy Islands vision has (and continues to have) a unifying influence on action for UHC;(ii) adoption of appropriate service delivery models that support integrated primary health care at the community level are needed;(iii) human resources for health are critical if efforts to achieve UHC are to be successful;(iv) access to reliable health information is core to health sector improvement;and (v) while not a panacea for all challenges, digital health offers many opportunities.

Methods: : Data of inpatients before and after implementation of new requirements were retrospectively analyzed, including infection rate, use of alcohol-based hand cleaner, anatomical sites of infections, pathogen species, infection by multi-drug-resistant species, use of different antibiotics, and antibiotic use density. Results: : The HAI rate was significantly higher in 2020 than in 2018 and 2019 ( P< 0.05), and the CAI rate was significantly higher in 2019 and 2020 than in 2018 ( P <0.001). Lower respiratory tract infections were the most common HAI during all years, with no significant changes over time. Lower respiratory tract infections were also the most common CAI, but were significantly more common in 2018 and 2019 than 2020 ( P <0.001). There were no changes in upper respiratory tract infections among HAIs or CAIs.

Recently, ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs), made from ferroelectric hafnium oxide (HfO2), have demonstrated promising SHG capabilities due to their unique symmetric transfer curves. In this letter, we illustrate how this symmetry is highly sensitive to material properties by varying the thickness of the ferroelectric layer and the doping of the silicon substrate. We show that the SHG conversion gain and the spectral purity are greatly increased (up to 96%) by precisely tuning the ferroelectric polarization reversal and the quantum tunneling currents. Based on this, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the generation of the difference and of the sum of two input frequencies (frequency mixing) with a single FeFET, which we attribute to the inherently strong quadratic component of the symmetric transfer characteristics. Due to the reversible and continuous ferroelectric switching in HfO2, our approach allows for an electrical control of the energy distribution of spectral components, thus opening up new and very promising paths for frequency manipulations with simple ferroelectric devices.","output":"Frequency mixing with HfO2 based ferroelectric transistors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reducing the time to diagnose COVID-19 helps to manage insufficient isolation-bed resources and adequately accommodate critically ill patients.

So far, assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies rely on cell-culture based infection assays either using wild type SARS-CoV-2 or pseudotyped viruses. Such assays are labour-intensive, require appropriate biosafety facilities and are difficult to standardize. Recently, a new surrogate virus neutralisation test (sVNT) was described that uses the principle of an ELISA to measure the neutralisation capacity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies directed against the receptor binding domain. Here, we performed an independent evaluation of the robustness, specificity and sensitivity on an extensive panel of sera from 269 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 259 unmatched samples collected before 2020 and compared it to cell-based neutralisation assays. We found a high specificity of 99.2 (95%CI: 96.9-99.9) and overall sensitivity of 80.3 (95%CI: 74.9-84.8) for the sVNT.

METHODS Thirty-six patients undergoing open DP at our institution between May 2005 and December 2011 were included. They were divided in two groups depending on pancreatic remnant management: in 24 cases the stump was closed by hand-sewn suture (Group A), while in 12 earlier cases a pancreato-jejunostomy was performed (Group B). We analyzed postoperative data in terms of mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay between the two groups.

The Unyvero Hospitalized Pneumonia (HPN, Curetis) test is a multiplex PCR (M-PCR) system detecting 21 bacteria and 19 resistance genes on respiratory samples within 5 h. We assessed the performance and the potential impact of the M-PCR on the antibiotic therapy of ICU patients. METHODS: In this prospective study, we performed a M-PCR on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or plugged telescoping catheter (PTC) samples of patients with ventilated HAP or VAP with Gram-negative bacilli or clustered Gram-positive cocci. This study was conducted in 3 ICUs in a French academic hospital: the medical and infectious diseases ICU, the surgical ICU, and the cardio-surgical ICU. A multidisciplinary expert panel simulated the antibiotic changes they would have made if the M-PCR results had been available. RESULTS: We analyzed 95 clinical samples of ventilated HAP or VAP (72 BAL and 23 PTC) from 85 patients (62 males, median age 64 years). The median turnaround time of the M-PCR was 4.6 h (IQR 4.4C5). A total of 90/112 bacteria were detected by the M-PCR system with a global sensitivity of 80% (95% CI, 73C88%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI 99C100). The sensitivity was better for Gram-negative bacteria (90%) than for Gram-positive cocci (62%) (p = 0.005). Moreover, 5/8 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (CTX-M gene) and 4/4 carbapenemases genes (3 NDM, one oxa-48) were detected. The M-PCR could have led to the earlier initiation of an effective antibiotic in 20/95 patients (21%) and to early de-escalation in 37 patients (39%) but could also have led to one (1%) inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Among 17 empiric antibiotic treatments with carbapenems, 10 could have been de-escalated in the following hours according to the M-PCR results. The M-PCR also led to 2 unexpected diagnosis of severe legionellosis confirmed by culture methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the use of a M-PCR system for respiratory samples of patients with VAP and ventilated HAP could improve empirical antimicrobial therapy and reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.","output":"Performance and impact of a multiplex PCR in ICU patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia or ventilated hospital-acquired pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates the extent to which international academic conferences changes format to virtual when faced by sudden Covid-19 related immobility Data on 587 conferences in the fields of business, economics, information technology, management and other social sciences that were planned to be held between March and August 2020 are retrieved from authorised conference listings Approximately 28% of the conferences changed to virtual format during the period of time studied Probit estimations reveal that the probability of changing format to virtual increases with the country of location (United States), planning horizon and the available quality of broadband infrastructure in the scheduled conference country However, the role of planning horizon differs across fields and location of the conference The probability of virtual conferences is highest in the United States and for academic conferences in the field of information technology","output":"When international academic conferences go virtual"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: The article examines the dynamics of the socioeconomic development of the Russian regions and the state of their budgets in the acute phase of the coronavirus crisis in AprilCMay 2020 Differences in the rate of decline are revealed, due not only to the severity of quarantine measures, which affected the consumption indicators, but also the structure of the regional economy, which strongly influenced the industrial production dynamics and budget revenues The rapid increase in the level of registered unemployment in almost all regions is due to the impact of quarantine restrictions on the market services sector, which is the most developed in large cities, as well as institutional measures (increase in the size of benefits and streamlined registration) The regional dynamics of the main indicators during the three crises of the 2000s are compared and significant differences are revealed in the distribution of regions by the rate of decline The regional profile of each crisis was different due to its factors, risk zones, duration, and depth of the decline The coronavirus crisis is aggravated by the fact that in most regions, the decline of the previous crisis in 2015 has not yet been compensated, which may lead to a protracted recovery from the 2020 crisis ? 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd","output":"Russian Regions in the Acute Phase of the Coronavirus Crisis: Differences from Previous Economic Crises of the 2000s"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper is an analysis of complex crisis management and the importance of resilience on the example of co-occurring disasters.

Yet the up-front cost of genomic testing with next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies can be prohibitive. Our study is a structured review of economic evaluations of precision oncology informed by NGS. The aim is to characterize the availability and scope of economic evidence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched Medline (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), and Web of Science databases for English-language full-text peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2016. We focused our search on articles that estimated the benefit of precision oncology in relation to its costs. We excluded studies that did not undertake full economic evaluations or did not focus on NGS technologies. We reviewed all included studies and summarized key methodological and empirical study characteristics. RESULTS: Fifty-five economic evaluations met our inclusion criteria. The number of published studies increased steadily, from three studies between 2005 and 2007 to 26 between 2014 and 2016. Most studies evaluated multiplex panels (86%). We found testing was frequently used to predict prognosis (67%), to diagnose patients (24%), or to identify targeted therapeutic options (7%). Methods and cost effectiveness differed according to NGS technology, test strategy, and cancer type. Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were typically used to characterize parameter and decision uncertainty (91% and 75%). CONCLUSION: Although the availability of economic evidence examining precision oncology increased over time, methods used often did not align with current guidelines. Future evaluations should undertake extensive sensitivity analysis to address all sources of uncertainty associated with rapidly changing NGS technologies. Furthermore, additional research is needed evaluating the cost effectiveness of more comprehensive next-generation technologies before implementing these on a wider scale.","output":"Economic Evaluations of Next-Generation Precision Oncology: A Critical Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Algal species still show unrevealed and unexplored potentiality for the identification of new compounds.

Greatly, there are limited studies concerned with the effect of airborne pollutants on COVID-19 infection, while exposure to airborne pollutants may harm human health. This paper aimed to examine the associations of acute exposure to ambient atmospheric pollutants to daily newly COVID-19 confirmed cases in 41 Chinese cities. Using a generalized additive model with Poisson distribution controlling for temperature and relative humidity, we evaluated the association between pollutant concentrations and daily COVID-19 confirmation at single-city level and multicity levels. We observed a 10-g/m3 rise in levels of PM2.5 (lag 0-14), O3 (lag 0-1), SO2 (lag 0), and NO2 (lag 0-14) were positively associated with relative risks of 1.050 (95% CI: 1.028, 1.073), 1.011 (1.007, 1.015), 1.052 (1.022, 1.083), and 1.094 (1.028, 1.164) of daily newly confirmed cases, respectively. Further adjustment for other pollutants did not change the associations materially (excepting in the model for SO2). Our results indicated that COVID-19 incidence may be susceptible to airborne pollutants such as PM2.5, O3, SO2, and NO2, and mitigation strategies of environmental factors are required to prevent spreading.","output":"Associations of acute exposure to airborne pollutants with COVID-19 infection: evidence from China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has created an unprecedented healthcare, social, and economic disaster.

Additional strategies are required to lessen transmission. Nasal rinses and mouthwashes, which directly impact the major sites of reception and transmission of human coronaviruses (HCoV), may provide an additional level of protection against the virus. Common over-the-counter nasal rinses and mouthwashes/gargles were tested for their ability to inactivate high concentrations of HCoV using contact times of 30 s, 1 min, and 2 min. Reductions in titers were measured by using the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50 ) assay. A 1% baby shampoo nasal rinse solution inactivated HCoV greater than 99.9% with a 2-min contact time. Several over-the-counter mouthwash/gargle products including Listerine and Listerine-like products were highly effective at inactivating infectious virus with greater than 99.9% even with a 30-s contact time.

Artemisia afra is a plant traditionally used for its medicinal values, including treatment of malaria in many parts of the world. Currently, it is also attracting attention because of a claim that a related species, Artemisia annua, is a remedy for the COVD-19 pandemic. The aim of the present study was to investigate toxic effects of A. afra on brain, heart and suprarenal glands in mice aged 8C12 weeks and weighing 25C30g. METHODS: Leaves of A.afra were collected from Bale National Park, dried under shade, crushed into powder and soaked in distilled water to yield aqueous extract for oral administration. For acute toxicity study, seven treated and one control groups, with 3 female mice each, were used. They were given a single dose of 200mg/kg, 700mg/kg, 1200mg/kg, 2200mg/kg, 3200mg/kg, 4200mg/kg or 5000mg/kg b/wt of the extract. For the sub-acute toxicity study, two treated and one control groups, with 5 female and 5 male mice each, were used. They were daily treated with 600mg/kg or 1800mg/kg b/wt of extract. RESULTS: LD(50) was found to be greater than 5000mg/kg indicating that the plant is relatively safe. In the sub-acute study, no signs of toxicity were observed in all treatment groups.

Numerous biological properties of GA have been reported and have attracted researchers from all over the world in recent years due to the peculiar GA scaffold based semisynthetic cytotoxic effects. AREAS COVERED : This review represents the applications of semisynthetic derivatives of GA for the development of future cancer treatments. Included in the review are important structural features of the semisynthetic GAs crucial for cytotoxic effects. EXPERT OPINION : Numerous semisynthetic GA derivatives illustrated excellent cytotoxic effects towards various cancer cells. Notably the C-3(OH) at ring A along with C30-CO2H at ring E as vital structural features, make GA very appealing as a lead scaffold for medicinal chemistry, since these two groups permit the creation of further chemical diversity geared towards improved cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, numerous GA derivatives have been synthesized and indicate that compounds featuring cyanoenone moieties in ring A, or compounds having the amino group or nitrogen comprising heterocycles and hybrids thereof, illustrate more potent cytotoxicity. Furthermore, GA has a great capability to be conjugated with other anticancer molecules to synergistically enhance their combined cytotoxicity.","output":"Glycyrrhetinic acid: A Promising Scaffold for the Discovery of Anticancer Agents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Telephones, internet-connected devices (phablets, personal computers), chat platforms, and mobile apps (eg, Skype, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp) can be exploited for telemedicine applications. WhatsApp and similar apps are also widely used to facilitate clinical communication between physicians. Moreover, WhatsApp is used by emergency department (ED) physicians and consulting physicians to exchange medical information during ED consultations. This platform is regarded as a useful app in the consultation of dermatological and orthopedic cases. Preventing overcrowding in the ED is key to reducing the risk of disease transmission, and teleconsulting practice is thought to be effective in the diagnosis, treatment, and reduction of transmission risk of disease, most notably during the COVID-19 pandemic. Video consultation is highly recommended in some countries on the grounds that it is likely to reduce the risk of transmission. WhatsApp-like apps are among the video consultation platforms that are assumed to reduce the risk of contamination by minimizing patient-physician contact. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of WhatsApp video consultation on patient admission and discharge times in comparison to bedside consultation in the evaluation of potential patients with COVID-19 visiting a COVID-19 outpatient clinic during the pandemic. METHODS: Patients who presented to the ED COVID-19 outpatient clinic between March 11 and May 31, 2020, and for whom an infectious disease specialist was consulted (via WhatsApp or at bedside) were included in the study in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eventually, 54 patients whose consultations were performed via WhatsApp and 90 patients whose consultations were performed at bedside were included in our study. RESULTS: The median length of stay in the ED of discharged patients amounted to 103 minutes (IQR 85-147.75) in the WhatsApp group and 196 minutes (IQR 141-215) in the bedside group. In this regard, the length of stay in the ED was found to be significantly shorter in the WhatsApp group than in the bedside group (P<.001). Among the consulted and discharged patients, 1 patient in each group tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction test and thus was readmitted and hospitalized (P=.62). The median length of stay of the inpatients in the ED was found to be 116.5 minutes (IQR 85.5-145.5) in the WhatsApp group and 132 minutes (IQR 102-168) in the bedside group. The statistical analysis of this time difference revealed that the length of stay in the ED was significantly shorter for patients in the WhatsApp group than in the bedside group (P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Consultation via WhatsApp reduces both contact time with patients with COVID-19 and the number of medical staff contacting the patients, which contributes greatly to reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. WhatsApp consultation may prove useful in clinical decision making as well as in shortening process times. Moreover, it does not result in a decreased accuracy rate. The shortened discharge and hospitalization timespans also decreased the length of stay in the ED, which can have an impact on minimizing ED crowding.

Gene targeting to generate constitutive or conditional loss of function knockouts remains cost and labor intensive, as well as time consuming. Adding to these challenges, retina expressed genes may have essential roles outside the retina leading to unintended confounds when using a knockout approach. Furthermore, the ability to ectopically express a gene in a gain of function experiment can be extremely valuable when attempting to identify a role in cell fate specification and/or terminal differentiation. We present a method for the rapid and efficient incorporation of DNA plasmids into the neonatal mouse retina by electroporation. The application of short electrical impulses above a certain field strength results in a transient increase in plasma membrane permeability, facilitating the transfer of material across the membrane (1,2,3,4). Groundbreaking work demonstrated that electroporation could be utilized as a method of gene transfer into mammalian cells by inducing the formation of hydrophilic plasma membrane pores allowing the passage of highly charged DNA through the lipid bilayer (5). Continuous technical development has resulted in the viability of electroporation as a method for in vivo gene transfer in multiple mouse tissues including the retina, the method for which is described herein (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). DNA solution is injected into the subretinal space so that DNA is placed between the retinal pigmented epithelium and retina of the neonatal (P0) mouse and electrical pulses are applied using a tweezer electrode. The lateral placement of the eyes in the mouse allows for the easy orientation of the tweezer electrode to the necessary negative pole-DNA-retina-positive pole alignment. Extensive incorporation and expression of transferred genes can be identified by postnatal day 2 (P2). Due to the lack of significant lateral migration of cells in the retina, electroporated and non-electroporated regions are generated. Non-electroporated regions may serve as internal histological controls where appropriate. Retinal electroporation can be used to express a gene under a ubiquitous promoter, such as CAG, or to disrupt gene function using shRNA constructs or Cre-recombinase. More targeted expression can be achieved by designing constructs with cell specific gene promoters. Visualization of electroporated cells is achieved using bicistronic constructs expressing GFP or by co-electroporating a GFP expression construct. Furthermore, multiple constructs may be electroporated for the study of combinatorial gene effects or simultaneous gain and loss of function of different genes. Retinal electroporation may also be utilized for the analysis of genomic cis-regulatory elements by generating appropriate expression constructs and deletion mutants. Such experiments can be used to identify cis-regulatory regions sufficient or required for cell specific gene expression (11). Potential experiments are limited only by construct availability.","output":"In vivo electroporation of developing mouse retina."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to introduce a superior discrete statistical model for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality numbers in Saudi Arabia and Latvia.

The COVID-19 pandemic has major ramifications for global health and the economy, with growing concerns about economic recession and implications for mental health. Here we investigated the associations between COVID-19 pandemic-related income loss with financial strain and mental health trajectories over a 1-month course. METHODS. Two independent studies were conducted in the U.S and in Israel at the beginning of the outbreak (March-April 2020, T1; N = 4 171) and at a 1-month follow-up (T2; N = 1 559). Mixed-effects models were applied to assess associations among COVID-19-related income loss, financial strain, and pandemic-related worries about health, with anxiety and depression, controlling for multiple covariates including pre-COVID-19 income. FINDINGS. In both studies, income loss and financial strain were associated with greater depressive symptoms at T1, above and beyond T1 anxiety, worries about health, and pre-COVID-19 income. Worsening of income loss was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in both studies. Worsening of subjective financial strain was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in one study (US). INTERPRETATION. Income loss and financial strain were uniquely associated with depressive symptoms and the exacerbation of symptoms over time, above and beyond pandemic-related anxiety. Considering the painful dilemma of lockdown versus reopening, with the tradeoff between public health and economic wellbeing, our findings provide evidence that the economic impact of COVID-19 has negative implications for mental health.

Determine the targets and methods of psychological and pedagogical work that aimed increasing the specific normativity of students' behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, on compliance with the mask regime. Background. Due to the situation with COVID-19 pandemic many countries all over the world, including in Russia, introduced the number of tough measures which restricted the behavior and interaction of people. The study focuses on such acute issues as the attitudes of different social groups toward both the disease itself and the measures to combat it, clarification of the reasons and motivations for individuals' compliance/non-compliance with normative behavior during the pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic actualizes the problems of providing practical psychological assistance to people, including young people, who experience stress and who have difficulties with coping with this situation. Study design. The study was conducted during the increasing spread of the disease and the introduction of an isolation regime. The data obtained was analyzed with reference to the time of the research participants' questionnaire completion: the first group of students filled the Google forms from 9th to 23rd November 2020 (stage 1);the second group - from 24th November to 8th December 2020 (stage 2). The research analyzed students' social representations of the pandemic and measures to combat it;peculiarities of attitudes toward various aspects of COVID-19 and toward the normative behavior of young people during the pandemic;subjective experience of danger of the disease and the dominant coping strategies associated with them. Participants. 565 undergraduate students from various faculties of the Moscow State University of Psychology and Education (MGPPU): 504 females, 61males. Measurements. Anonymous survey included closed questions;method of prototypical analysis of social representations (P. Verges);Self-perceived flexible coping with stress (SFCS);The Fear of COVID- 19 Scale;SPSS Statistics 20 package (contingency tables with the calculation of the Pearson 2 test, Spearman's correlation coefficient, Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests). Results. Students showed a diverse and often controversial views on COVID-19 and ways prevent its spread. At the core of social representations of the pandemic and protective masks, the most popular are those that reflect the personal restrictions imposed by the pandemic, the inconvenience and displeasure resulted from the compliance with these restrictions. To a smaller extent, there is a fear of getting sick. There are practically no social representations associated with concern over other people, that express a pro-social position. In relation to the mechanisms of compliance with restrictive measures, the opinions of students are heterogeneous: some support the introduction of strict restrictions and consider it rational to have strict external control, while others believe that the fulfillment of sanitary and epidemiological requirements should be an independent decision of a person. The study found the predominant choice of situational and multiple coping strategies by students in response to the emergence of the pandemic situation and the relationship between these types of coping with low level of subjective fear. Nevertheless, with the deterioration of the pandemic situation, students' assessments of the means of informing about COVID-19 and strategies to combat it changed: at the first stage of the study students considered specialists (doctors, scientists) as a reference group, at the second stage - parents and close circle. Social media turned out to be the most insignificant source of information. Main conclusions. The data obtained make it possible to identify the main targets of psychological and pedagogical work with students and to determine the main methods of this work which should include the activity-based inclusion in the solution of group tasks aimed at optimizing the life of people in a pandemic. According to the results of the study a group of students stood out with a high level of fear experience (32%) and a tendency to non-constructive ways of coping.

Furthermore, there is presumably no pre-existing immunity in the population to the new coronavirus, and it is as-sumed that everyone in the population is susceptible. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the procedures described in the article is to minimize the risk of human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus 2) virus during procedures carried out in endoscopic laboratories. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF THE ART: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be asymptomatic, cause severe pneumonia, or lead to death. Symptoms of COVID-19 range from none (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia and it can be fatal. Case studies to-date indicate that this infection causes a mild illness (i.e. pneumonia or mild pneumonia) in approximately 80% of cases, and most cases recove; 14% have a more severe illness, 6% experience a critical illness. The vast majority of the most serious illnesses and deaths have occurred among the elderly and people with other chronic underlying diseases. Average progression times include: a? in mild cases: from the onset of symptoms to recovery in almost 2 weeks; a? in severe cases: from the onset of symptoms to recovery in 3-6 weeks, and from symptoms to death in 2-8 weeks.

While scientists have moved quickly to study the physical health implications of the disease, less attention has been paid to the negative mental health repercussions. The current study utilized a community sample of adolescents who had recently completed a 2-year, four wave study of adolescent mental health (Wave 1 n = 184, Mage = 13.9 years; 50.3% female). Participants were recontacted to assess their anxiety, depression, and emotion dysregulation symptoms during the pandemic. Latent growth modeling based on four pre-COVID time points indicated the extent to which the fifth (COVID) time point deviated from trend expectations. Results showed that (a) anxiety and depression scores were significantly higher than previous trajectories would have predicted, and (b) deviations from personal trajectories were associated with higher levels of perceived lifestyle impact due to the pandemic. Furthermore, gender-based analyses revealed that financial impacts, lifestyle impacts, and coronavirus fear were differentially associated with symptom increases for male and female participants. The current study is among the first to report that adolescent mental health trajectories have been altered in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. As physical distancing and other safety precautions may be required for several years, it is essential that we gain a deep understanding of how prevention efforts are associated with significant disruptions to youth mental health to bolster youth resilience during these unprecedented times.

Complex PTSD (cPTSD) also appears to be more common than PTSD. One treatment option is Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET), a brief trauma-focused psychotherapy which attempts to place trauma within a narrative of the persons life. Our primary aim was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of recruiting people to a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of NET alone compared to NET augmented by a genealogical assessment. We hypothesized that incorporating a genealogical assessment may be more effective than NET alone in a population with predominately complex PTSD. METHODS: This pilot RCT enrolled participants who were 18 years of age or older, currently homeless or vulnerably housed, and with active symptoms of PTSD. Participants were randomized to NET alone or NET plus a genealogical assessment. Rates of referral, consent, and retention were examined as part of feasibility. Demographic and clinical data were collected at baseline. Symptoms of PTSD, drug use, and housing status were re-assessed at follow-up visits. We conducted a thematic analysis of qualitative interviews of service providers involved in the study which explored barriers and facilitators of study participation. RESULTS: Twenty-two potential participants were referred to the study, with 15 consenting to participate. Of these, one was a screen failure and 14 were randomized equally to the treatment arms. One randomized participant was withdrawn for safety. Attrition occurred primarily prior to starting therapy. Once therapy began, retention was high with 80% of participants completing all six sessions. Seven participants completed all follow-up sessions. Service providers identified a clear need for the treatment and emphasized the importance of trauma-informed care, a desire to know more about NET, and more communication about the process of referral. CONCLUSION: Recruiting participants who were vulnerably housed to an RCT of a trauma-based therapy was possible. Once therapy had started, participants were likely to stay engaged.

The wavelength of light in this part of the spectrum usually lie in the range of mm to cms. Hence it can get bent across an obstacle while propagating forward. Apart from radiative, the convective and conductive processes also get affected due to appearance of non linearities in the modes of lattice vibrations and anomalies in material transport due to the appearance of vorticity and turbulence in the intervening media.

The mechanism(s) behind this effect, however, is (are) still unclear. In this respect, a lower incidence of intradialytic hypotension (IDH), and hence less tissue injury, may play a role. To address these items, the HOLLANT study was designed. METHODS: HOLLANT is a Dutch multicentre randomized controlled cross-over trial. In total, 40 prevalent dialysis patients will be included and, after a run-in phase, exposed to standard HD, HD with cooled dialysate, low-volume HDF and high-volume HDF (Dialog iQ? machine) in a randomized fashion. The primary endpoint is an intradialytic nadir in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of < 90 and < 100 mmHg for patients with predialysis SBP < 159 and  160 mmHg, respectively. The main secondary outcomes are 1) intradialytic left ventricle (LV) chamber quantification and deformation, 2) intradialytic hemodynamic profile of SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure (PP), 3) organ and tissue damage, such as the release of specific cellular components, and 4) patient reported symptoms and thermal perceptions during each modality. DISCUSSION: The current trial is primarily designed to test the hypothesis that a lower incidence of intradialytic hypotension contributes to the superior survival of (HV)-HDF. A secondary objective of this investigation is the question whether changes in the intradialytic blood pressure profile correlate with organ dysfunction and tissue damage, and/or patient discomfort.

This study aimed to discover the behaviour of a group of dependent drinkers of spirits during a 33-day period of complete closure of physical stores selling spirits during COVID-19 lockdown in Auckland, New Zealand, March 2020. METHODS: Electronic clinical records of drinkers waitlisted to complete an alcohol detox at the in-patient service were followed from day 1 of lockdown and outcomes at the end of the period analysed. RESULTS: Drinkers of spirits were statistically more successful in stopping drinking (P = 0.002) than those of wine or beer. Only 26% chose to switch to an alternate alcohol type initially. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: A sudden reduction in availability of spirits resulted in positive behaviour change in spirits drinkers compared to those of other alcohol types, aided by the support of detox services. Internet alcohol purchasing, while not used by this group, deserves close future scrutiny due to its potential to increase alcohol availability in dependent drinkers.","output":"The behaviour of alcohol-dependent drinkers of spirits during level 4 COVID-19 lockdown in Auckland, New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Epidemics are a major cause of health problems in developing countries, preventing the accumulation of human capital and economic growth.

PRSs are typically constructed using pruning and thresholding (P+T), but the best choice of parameters is uncertain; thus multiple settings are used and the best is chosen. Optimization can lead to inflated Type I error. Permutation procedures can correct this, but they can be computationally intensive. Alternatively, a single parameter setting can be chosen a priori for the PRS, but choosing suboptimal settings results in loss of power. We propose computing PRSs under a range of parameter settings, performing principal component analysis (PCA) on the resulting set of PRSs, and using the first PRS-PC in association tests. The first PC reweights the variants included in the PRS to achieve maximum variation over all PRS settings used. Using simulations and a real data application to study PRS association with bipolar disorder and psychosis in bipolar disorder, we compare the performance of the proposed PRS-PCA approach with a permutation test and an a priori selected p-value threshold.

This case study integrates atmospheric indicators (concentrations of criteria pollutants including particulate matter and gaseous pollutants), traffic indicators (permanent traffic monitoring station data), and social indicators (community responses in Twitter archives) representing the interplay of the three critical pillars of the United Nations' Triple Bottom Line: environment, economy, and society. During the watershed moment of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns in Florida, urban centers demonstrated the gaps and opportunities for understanding the relationships, through correlations rather than causations, between urban air quality, traffic emissions, and public perceptions. The relationship between the perception and the traffic variables were strongly correlated, however no correlation was observed between the perception and actual air quality indicators, except for NO2. These observations might consequently infer that traffic serves as people's proxy for air quality, regardless of actual air quality, suggesting that social media messaging around asthma may be a way to monitor traffic patterns in areas where no infrastructure currently exists or is prohibited to build. It also indicates that people are less likely to be reliable sensors to accurately measure air quality due to bias in their observations of traffic volume and/or confirmation biases in broader social discourse.

This paper quantitatively tests the inter-linkages between the above variables on a sample of senior managers in hotels in Spain. It finds that the levels of organisational resilience and the extent of CSR practices reinforce perceived job security of managers which, in turn, determines their organisational commitment.

Metformin has sex specific immunomodulatory effects which may elucidate treatment mechanisms in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify whether metformin reduced mortality from Covid19 and if sex specific interactions exist. DESIGN: Retrospective review of de-identified claims from UnitedHealth Groups Clinical Discovery Database. Unadjusted and multivariate models were conducted to assess risk of mortality based on metformin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) inhibitors as home medications in individuals with T2DM and obesity, controlling for comorbidities, medications, demographics, and state. Heterogeneity of effect was assessed by sex. SETTING: The database includes all 50 states in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Persons with at least 6 months of continuous coverage from UnitedHealth Group in 2019 who were hospitalized with Covid-19. Persons in the metformin group had > 90 days of metformin claims in the 12 months before hospitalization. RESULTS: 6,256 persons were included; 52.8% female; mean age 75 years. Metformin was associated with decreased mortality in women by logistic regression, OR 0.792 (0.640, 0.979); mixed effects OR 0.780 (0.631, 0.965); Cox proportional-hazards: HR 0.785 (0.650, 0.951); and propensity matching, OR of 0.759 (0.601, 0.960). There was no significant reduction in mortality among men. TNF inhibitors were associated with decreased mortality, by propensity matching in a limited model, OR 0.19 (0.0378, 0.983). CONCLUSIONS: Metformin was significantly associated with reduced mortality in women with obesity or T2DM in observational analyses of claims data from individuals hospitalized with Covid-19. This sex-specific finding is consistent with metformins reduction of TNF in females over males, and suggests that metformin conveys protection in Covid-19 through TNF effects.

Serial testing using rapid lateral flow antigen tests is a possible way to do this by screening populations in a targeted way, identifying infectious (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) people and removing them from circulation while infectious. To make rapid antigen testing effective, high levels of participation are important. This study was designed to evaluate the establishment of a testing programme in a university setting and assess some of the factors that impact participation in such a study among both staff and students. Study DesignObservational, survey MethodsA trial period of SARS-CoV-2 rapid testing using the Abbott Panbio rapid antigen test was set up and staff and students based in the University College Dublin Veterinary Hospital were asked to take part voluntarily for 6 weeks. Following the trial period, we used a questionnaire to evaluate satisfaction and to understand some reasons behind participation or lack thereof. ResultsOverall, almost all respondents to the survey stated that they were happy with having a testing programme present in the workplace and it helped to reduce anxiety associated with COVID-19. Findings indicated that staff and students did not participate equally in the voluntary testing programme. The findings also highlighted that intrinsic motivations and extrinsic motivations for participation differ. For example, participation among staff was much higher than among students, motivational messaging focused on protecting others did not resonate with students as much as staff, convenience was a key factor driving participation in both cohorts and the pressure of being forced to miss class (if positive) close to exam time provided motivation to students to avoid testing. ConclusionsIntroducing antigen testing into a workplace helped to reduce overall anxiety associated with the potential impact of COVID-19, but achieving good participation was challenging. Participation is key to a successful, campus wide antigen testing programme but reaching high levels of participation is not straightforward and can not be taken for granted. Different motivations drive participation in different cohorts and different messaging/incentivisation is needed to encourage participation in those different cohorts. The findings reported here should inform any SARS-CoV-2 testing programme that will run in these types of settings in the future.","output":"Rapid antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a university setting in Ireland: learning from a 6-week pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing is an important and necessary measure to help arrest the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In other words, marginalized or disadvantaged persons are at risk of both contracting SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of harms that may come about because of the social distancing measures themselves. Finally, a third layer of risk faced by marginalized persons would be the overuse of utility (i.e., maximize the benefit of resource x) as the primary ethics principle upon which to make allocation decisions, since oftentimes it is resource-intensive to help those in positions of social marginality.

Good knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of hepatitis B infection (HBI) prevention are essential for HBI control. However, there is limited evidence concerning the KAP of HBI prevention among nursing students, who are significantly exposed to HBI. We assessed the KAP of HBI prevention and the factors associated with the practice of HBI prevention among nursing students in the Upper West Region of Ghana. METHODS: We administered an online cross-sectional survey in November 2020 to a stratified random sample of 402 nursing students in two nursing training colleges in the Upper West Region. Using STATA version 13, we computed composite scores of KAP of HBI prevention with maximum scores of 18 for knowledge and 8 each for attitude and practice. A generalised ordered logistic regression model was run to assess the factors associated with the practice of HBI prevention. RESULTS: The students had moderate median scores for knowledge (12.00; IQR = 10C13) and attitude (6.00; IQR = 5.00C7.00) but a poor median score (5.00; IQR = 4.00C6.00) for the practice of HBI prevention. High knowledge (aOR = 2.05; p = 0.06), good attitude, being a male, second year student and having parents with tertiary education were significantly associated with higher likelihoods (aOR >1; p < 0.05) of demonstrating good practice of HBI prevention. Students who had never married were significantly (aOR = 0.34; p = 0.010) less likely to exhibit good practice of HBI prevention. CONCLUSION: The KAP scores of HBI prevention among the students were sub-optimal. We recommend institution-based policies and regular education on HBI prevention, free/subsidised HBI prevention services, and the enforcement of proper professional ethics on HBI prevention in nursing training colleges.

Its etiology is unknown; however, it may be associated with other systemic autoimmune diseases, malignancy, and rarely with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. RP has a variable pattern at presentation and may be associated with constitutional symptoms such as fever and arthralgia, in addition to various auricular, ocular, respiratory, and cardiovascular manifestations. Auricular and ocular signs are the most common presenting features; however, idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome is considered a rare manifestation of the disease. Systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment, but immunomodulatory therapy may be required for refractory cases. CASE REPORT: We present a challenging case of RP in a 58-year-old woman with HIV controlled by highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) and stable chronic reactive arthritis on sulfasalazine who developed unilateral auricular chondritis associated with contralateral idiopathic orbital inflammation and scleritis as well as worsening arthralgia. She was initially treated empirically with antibiotics, without clinical improvement. The infectious diseases work-up was unrevealing, and other diagnostic possibilities were meticulously excluded. Clinical suspicion for RP ultimately led to appropriate therapy with corticosteroids and subsequent immunosuppression with methotrexate, resulting in clinical improvement and allowing for gradual tapering of steroids.

This dramatic situation has forced the public health authorities and pharmaceutical companies to develop anti-COVID-19 vaccines in record time. Currently, almost 80% of the population are vaccinated with the required number of doses in Spain. Thus, in this paper, COVID-19 incidence and lethality rates are analyzed through a segmented spatio-temporal regression model that allows studying if there is an association between a certain vaccination level and a change (in mean) in either the incidence or the lethality rates. Spatial dependency is included by considering the Besag-York-Molli\\\\'e model, whereas natural cubic splines are used for capturing the temporal structure of the data. Lagged effects between the exposure and the outcome are also taken into account. The results suggest that COVID-19 vaccination has not allowed yet (as of September 2021) to observe a consistent reduction in incidence levels at a regional scale in Spain. In contrast, the lethality rates have displayed a declining tendency which has associated with vaccination levels above 50%.","output":"On the association between COVID-19 vaccination levels and incidence and lethality rates at a regional scale in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The segmentation and extraction of brain tissue in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a meaningful task because it provides a diagnosis and treatment basis for observing brain tissue development, delineating lesions, and planning surgery. However, MRI images are often damaged by factors such as noise, low contrast and intensity brightness, which seriously affect the accuracy of segmentation. A non-local fuzzy c-means clustering framework incorporating the Markov random field for brain tissue segmentation is proposed in this paper. Firstly, according to the statistical characteristics that MRF can effectively describe the local spatial correlation of an image, a new distance metric with neighborhood constraints is constructed by combining probabilistic statistical information. Secondly, a non-local regularization term is integrated into the objective function to utilize the global structure feature of the image, so that both the local and global information of the image can be taken into account. In addition, a linear model of inhomogeneous intensity is also built to estimate the bias field in brain MRI, which has achieved the goal of overcoming the intensity inhomogeneity. The proposed model fully considers the randomness and fuzziness in the image segmentation problem, and obtains the prior knowledge of the image reasonably, which reduces the influence of low contrast in the MRI images. Then the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can eliminate the noise and intensity inhomogeneity of the MRI image and effectively improve the image segmentation accuracy.","output":"Brain tissue segmentation via non-local fuzzy c-means clustering combined with Markov random field"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has given rise to the need to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible. As pregnant women are at increased risk of contracting severe COVID-19, with higher mortality, it is essential to assess the safety of the vaccines administered during pregnancy. Methods: The aim of this study was to determine the titer of specific maternal and cord antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 S protein after antenatal vaccination. The secondary objective was to evaluate the ratio of the umbilical cord to the maternal antibody titers. Patients included in the study were enrolled after undergoing voluntary vaccination against COVID-19 during pregnancy at different weeks of gestation. All patients analyzed in our initial study were vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Results: The results of the current study document high anti-S total IgG antibody titers in cord serum at birth in all motherCinfant pairs analyzed. The mean umbilical cord blood sample IgG antibody titer anti-S protein was 1026.51 U/mL (SD 769.25). The mean cord-to-maternal antiCS IgG antibody ratio was 1.28 (SD 0.798). A significant positive correlation was observed between the week of gestation at which the first dose was administered and the week of gestation at which the second dose was administered, and the respective cord-to-maternal ratio (r = 0.48; p = 0.0029) for the first dose and (r = 0.39; p = 0.0102) for the second dose. Conclusions: To date, despite the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination, there is a lack of conclusive evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of vaccination of pregnant women. Therefore, the results we present are complementary. Our study suggests that maternal immunization may provide neonatal protection through the transplacental transfer of antibodies. Of particular importance is the demonstration that antibody transfer is correlated with the time from vaccination to delivery, which may allow future determination of the optimal timing of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women.","output":"Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Antibody Titers in Cord Blood after COVID-19 Vaccination during Pregnancy in Polish Healthcare Workers: Preliminary Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: E-commerce and social media technologies can significantly benefit the food and beverage industry by reducing costs, streamlining supply activities, and, most importantly, engaging users in active interaction and enhancing social presence.

Increases in mortality are measured in terms of the number of years of life lost (LY) to the pandemic. Additional years spent in poverty (PY) are conservatively estimated using growth estimates for 2020 and two dierent scenarios for its distributional characteristics. Using years of life as a welfare metric yields a single parameter that captures the underlying trade-off between lives and livelihoods: how many PYs have the same welfare cost as one LY. Taking an agnostic view of this parameter, estimates of LYs and PYs are compared across countries for different scenarios. Three main ndings arise. First, as of early June 2020, the pandemic (and the observed private and policy responses) has generated at least 68 million additional poverty years and 4.3 million years of life lost across 150 countries. The ratio of PYs to LYs is very large in most countries, suggesting that the poverty consequences of the crisis are of paramount importance. Second, this ratio declines systematically with GDP per capita: poverty accounts for a much greater share of the welfare costs in poorer countries. Finally, the dominance of poverty over mortality is reversed in a counterfactual herd immunity scenario: without any policy intervention, LYs tend to be greater than PYs, and the overall welfare losses are greater.","output":"Lives and Livelihoods: Estimates of the Global Mortality and Poverty Effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Population surveillance provides data on the health status of the population through continuous scrutiny of different indicators Identifying risk factors is essential for the quickly detecting and controlling of epidemic outbreaks and reducing the incidence of cross-infections and non-communicable diseases The objective of the present study is to analyze research on population surveillance, identifying the main topics of interest for investigators in the area Methodology: We included documents indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection in the period from 2000 to 2019 and assigned with the generic Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) \\"population surveillance\\" or its related terms (\\"public health surveillance,\\" \\"sentinel surveillance\\" or \\"biosurveillance\\") A co-occurrence analysis was undertaken to identify the document clusters comprising the main research topics Scientific production, collaboration, and citation patterns in each of the clusters were characterized bibliometrically We also analyzed research on coronaviruses, relating the results obtained to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic Results: We included 39,184 documents, which reflected a steady growth in scientific output driven by papers on \\"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health\\" (21 62% of the documents) and \\"Infectious Diseases\\" (10 49%) Research activity was concentrated in North America (36 41%) and Europe (32 09%) The USA led research in the area (40 14% of documents) Ten topic clusters were identified, including \\"Disease Outbreaks,\\" which is closely related to two other clusters (\\"Genetics\\" and \\"Influenza\\") Other clusters of note were \\"Cross Infections\\" as well as one that brought together general public health concepts and topics related to non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular and coronary diseases, mental diseases, diabetes, wound and injuries, stroke, and asthma) The rest of the clusters addressed \\"Neoplasms,\\" \\"HIV,\\" \\"Pregnancy,\\" \\"Substance Abuse/Obesity,\\" and \\"Tuberculosis \\" Although research on coronavirus has focused on population surveillance only occasionally, some papers have analyzed and collated guidelines whose relevance to the dissemination and management of the COVID-19 pandemic has become obvious Topics include tracing the spread of the virus, limiting mass gatherings that would facilitate its propagation, and the imposition of quarantines There were important differences in the scientific production and citation of different clusters: the documents on mental illnesses, stroke, substance abuse/obesity, and cross-infections had much higher citations than the clusters on disease outbreaks, tuberculosis, and especially coronavirus, where these values are substantially lower Conclusions: The role of population surveillance should be strengthened, promoting research and the development of public health surveillance systems in countries whose contribution to the area is limited","output":"Systematic analysis of the scientific literature on population surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A study was completed to assess the academic and state-level professional optometry leadership views regarding optometry professionals as surge responders in the event of a catastrophic event.

METHODS: A matched cohort study was conducted using the Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD). Adults with an incident asthma code were identified and matched, with up to four randomly selected people without asthma, by age, gender, and practice. Osteoporosis and FF incidence rates were calculated, and Cox regression was performed comparing hazard rates to the general population. We report the impact of age, gender, glucocorticoids, and the risk of specific fractures. RESULTS: Patients with asthma had a higher risk of osteoporosis (aHR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.13-1.23) and were 12% (aHR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.07-1.16) more likely to sustain FF than the general population.

SETTING: Adult ICU. PATIENTS: Adult patients in the ICU with a planned withdrawal of life-supporting measures and an expectation of imminent death. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Vital sign waveforms and clinical data were prospectively collected from 429 patients enrolled from 20 ICUs across Canada, the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands. Vital sign variability metrics were calculated during the hour prior to withdrawal. Patients were randomly assigned to the derivation cohort (288 patients) or the validation cohort (141 patients), of which 103 and 54, respectively, were eligible for organ donation after circulatory death. Random survival forest models were developed to predict the probability of death within 30, 60, and 120 minutes following withdrawal using variability metrics, features from existing clinical models, and/or the physicians prediction of rapid death. A model employing variability metrics alone performed similarly to a model employing clinical features, whereas the combination of variability, clinical features, and physicians prediction achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of all models at 0.78 (0.7C0.86), 0.79 (0.71C0.87), and 0.8 (0.72C0.88) for 30-, 60- and 120-minute predictions, respectively.

We present a case of a patient with a TPE who was initially misdiagnosed to have azathioprine-induced lung injury. The diagnosis of TPE was arrived at with the help of clinical assessment, laboratory and radiological investigations. CASE PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old chronic smoker with sympathetic ophthalmia on long-term immunosuppression, latent tuberculosis infection and a significant family history of tuberculosis presented with a three-week history of productive cough, low-grade fever, night sweats and weight loss. Examination of the lungs showed reduced breath sounds at the right lower zone. Chest x-ray showed minimal right pleural effusion with a small area of right upper lobe consolidation. The pleural fluid was exudative with predominant mononuclear leukocytes. Direct smears of sputum and pleural fluid; polymerase chain reaction of pleural fluid; and sputum, pleural fluid and blood cultures were negative for M. tuberculosis (MTB) and other organisms. As he did not respond to a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, he was then treated as a case of azathioprine-induced lung injury. However, his condition did not improve despite the cessation of azathioprine. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the thorax showed right upper lobe consolidation with tree-in-bud changes, bilateral lung atelectasis, subpleural nodule, mild right pleural effusion and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for malignant cells and microorganisms including, MTB. However, no pleural biopsy was done. He was empirically treated with anti-tubercular therapy for 9 months duration and showed complete recovery.

METHODS We conducted comprehensive searches to March 2016 for published, English-language SRs and RCTs of acute management of moderate to severe TBI. Systematic reviews and RCTs were grouped under 12 broad intervention categories. For each review, we mapped the included and non-included RCTs, noting the reasons why RCTs were omitted. An SR was judged as 'current' when it included the most recently published RCT we found on their topic, and 'complete' when it included every RCT we found that met its inclusion criteria, taking account of when the review was conducted. Quality was assessed using the AMSTAR checklist (trichotomised into low, moderate and high quality). FINDINGS We included 85 SRs and 213 RCTs examining the effectiveness of treatments for acute management of moderate to severe TBI. The most frequently reviewed interventions were hypothermia (n = 17, 14.2%), hypertonic saline and/or mannitol (n = 9, 7.5%) and surgery (n = 8, 6.7%). Of the 80 single-intervention SRs, approximately half (n = 44, 55%) were judged as current and two-thirds (n = 52, 65.0%) as complete. When considering only the most recently published review on each intervention (n = 25), currency increased to 72.0% (n = 18). Less than half of the 85 SRs were judged as high quality (n = 38, 44.7%), and nearly 20% were low quality (n = 16, 18.8%). Only 16 (20.0%) of the single-intervention reviews (and none of the five multi-intervention reviews) were judged as current, complete and high-quality. These included reviews of red blood cell transfusion, hypothermia, management guided by intracranial pressure, pharmacological agents (various) and prehospital intubation. Over three-quarters (n = 167, 78.4%) of the 213 RCTs were included in one or more SR. Of the remainder, 17 (8.0%) RCTs post-dated or were out of scope of existing SRs, and 29 (13.6%) were on interventions that have not been assessed in SRs. CONCLUSION A substantial number of SRs in acute management of moderate to severe TBI lack currency, completeness and quality. We have identified both potential evidence gaps and also substantial research waste. Novel review methods, such as Living Systematic Reviews, may ameliorate these shortcomings and enhance utility and reliability of the evidence underpinning clinical care.","output":"The currency, completeness and quality of systematic reviews of acute management of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury: A comprehensive evidence map."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of developing countries, early evidence suggests that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food production systems is complex, heterogenous, and dynamic.

In this study, we undertake a nationwide analysis of urban water access in the United States, with the aim of explaining the drivers of infrastructural inequality in the 50 largest metropolitan areas. Drawing on statistical analysis and regression modeling of census microdata at the household scale, our analysis reveals spatial and sociodemographic patterns of racialized, class-based, and housing disparities that characterize plumbing poverty. Among unplumbed households, we show that households headed by people of color are almost 35% more likely to lack piped water as compared to white, non-Hispanic households. Precarious housing conditions are an equally strong predictor: Renter-occupied households in the 50 largest US metros were 1.61 times more likely than owner-occupied households to lack piped water. We argue that insecure domestic water access in the United States should be understood as a housing issue that reflects structural inequalities of race and class, particularly in cities with widening wealth gaps.

To evaluate the effectiveness of transmission prevention strategies, infectivity modeling can be used to interpret and analyze various virus responses. In this study, compartmental modeling approaches are used to model and quantify the success of various control techniques, such as social behaviors. Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), a province in Canada, is a relatively isolated and easily-monitored region that can be used to study the characterization and effectiveness of infectivity model coefficients. The province has few points of entry and a lower contact frequency than densely populated urban districts. Based on the results, the implications of social distancing removed an estimated 85% of the susceptible population from potential exposure to a viral transmission. The modeling also determined a basic COVID-19 reproductive number of 3.7 in NL, higher than the globalized average of 2.3. Compartmental models are used to determine the validity of alternative pandemic responses, such as nonvaccine social practices to fight the wave of infection.

Direct threats to biodiversity within PAs and their interactions with broader-scale threats are both likely to vary with PA spatial and management characteristics (e.g., location, dependence on ecotourism revenues, governmental support). Private Land Conservation Areas (PLCAs) are interesting case study systems for assessing cross-scale threats to PAs and their determinants. Despite the growing number of PLCAs around the world, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the long-term capacity of these privately owned areas to conserve biodiversity. Their potential impermanence is commonly raised as a key concern. To better understand the threats to which different types of PLCAs are likely to be vulnerable, we asked 112 PLCA landholders in South Africa what they perceived as the top threats to their PLCAs. Landowners identified direct threats to the biodiversity within their PLCAs (e.g., poaching, extreme weather, inappropriate fire regimes, alien species) as well as describing broader socio-economic threats (e.g., regional crime, national legislation and politics, global economic recessions), which were noted to interact across scales. We found support for the hypothesis that patterns in the perceived multi-scale threats to a PLCA correspond with its management and spatial characteristics, including its remoteness, dependence on ecotourism or hunting revenues, and richness of megafaunal species. Understanding the threats to which different PLCAs may be vulnerable is useful for developing more nuanced, targeted strategies to build PLCA resilience to these threats (for example, by strengthening the capacity of self-funded PLCAs to cope with the threat of economic downturns through more innovative financial instruments or diversified revenue streams). Our findings highlight the importance of considering interactions between broad-scale socio-economic changes and direct threats to biodiversity, which can influence the resilience of PAs in ways that are not anticipated by more traditional, discipline-specific consideration of direct threats to the biodiversity within their boundaries.","output":"Cross-scale and social-ecological changes constitute main threats to private land conservation in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019, a new illness with no effective treatment or vaccine that has reached pandemic proportions.

Type III interferon, also known as lambda IFN (IFN-III or IFN-), is a complementary pathway to the antiviral response by IFN-I. This work analyzed the IFN- (IFN-III) mediated antiviral response against DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) infection. METHODS: Dengue fever patients were sampled to determine their IFN- levels by ELISA. To study the IFN- response during DENV infection we selected the epithelial cell line C33-A, and we demonstrated that it is permissive to DENV-2 infection. The effect of IFN- on virus replication was determined in these cells, in parallel to the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS), genes measured by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: We found increased (~1.8 times) serological IFN- in dengue fever patients compared to healthy blood donors. IFN- inhibited DENV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The reduction of viral titer corresponded with increased ISG mRNA levels (MX1 and OAS1), with the highest inhibition occurring at ISGs peak expression. Presence of IFN-negative regulators, SOCS1 and SOCS3, during DENV-2 infection was associated with reduced IFN-1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence described here suggests that IFN- is a good candidate inhibitor of viral replication in dengue infection. Mechanisms for the cellular and organismal interplay between DENV and IFN-  need to be further studied as they could provide insights into strategies to treat this disease.

Because of important clinical consequences of inappropriate treatment, a current review of the potential modifications undergone by S. aureus and adaptation to new treatment options is necessary. RECENT FINDINGS Vancomycin has been considered the treatment of choice for pneumonia due to MRSA. However, detection of a progressive increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration for this antibiotic, its limited access to the lung parenchyma, and its considerable adverse effects have called into question its position. Linezolid has been shown to have a better pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. The prior uncertainty regarding the clinical superiority of linezolid appears to have been resolved with the publication of a recent trial. Linezolid achieved a higher clinical and microbiological response rate (the latter was not statistically significant), together with a lower incidence of all types of renal adverse effects in patients with nosocomial pneumonia, compared with vancomycin. Tigecycline, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin were inferior to the compared drug in their respective clinical trials. The clinical efficacy of telavancin was similar to that of vancomycin. The renal adverse effects of telavancin have to be clarified. Other drugs are efficacious against MRSA but their profile should be evaluated in nosocomial pneumonia. SUMMARY Current therapeutic alternatives for nosocomial pneumonia due to MRSA appear to be limited to vancomycin and linezolid. However, vancomycin pitfalls, together with the apparent clinical superiority of linezolid, appear to restrict its indication.

Due to difficulties discriminating pelvic visceral sensation, IC/BPS likely represents multiple phenotypes with different etiologies that present with overlapping symptomatic manifestations, which complicates clinical management. We hypothesized that unique bladder pain phenotypes or \\"symptomatic clusters\\" would be identifiable using machine learning analysis (unsupervised clustering) of validated patient-reported urinary and pain measures. Patients (n = 145) with pelvic pain/discomfort perceived to originate in the bladder and lower urinary tract symptoms answered validated questionnaires [OAB Questionnaire (OAB-q), O'Leary-Sant Indices (ICSI/ICPI), female Genitourinary Pain Index (fGUPI), and Pelvic Floor Disability Index (PFDI)]. In comparison to asymptomatic controls (n = 69), machine learning revealed three bladder pain phenotypes with unique, salient features. The first group chiefly describes urinary frequency and pain with the voiding cycle, in which bladder filling causes pain relieved by bladder emptying. The second group has fluctuating pelvic discomfort and straining to void, urinary frequency and urgency without incontinence, and a sensation of incomplete emptying without urinary retention. Pain in the third group was not associated with voiding, instead being more constant and focused on the urethra and vagina. While not utilized as a feature for clustering, subjects in the second and third groups were significantly younger than subjects in the first group and controls without pain. These phenotypes defined more homogeneous patient subgroups which responded to different therapies on chart review. Current approaches to the management of heterogenous populations of bladder pain patients are often ineffective, discouraging both patients and providers. The granularity of individual phenotypes provided by unsupervised clustering approaches can be exploited to help objectively define more homogeneous patient subgroups. Better differentiation of unique phenotypes within the larger group of pelvic pain patients is needed to move toward improvements in care and a better understanding of the etiologies of these painful symptoms.","output":"Unsupervised Machine Learning Approaches Reveal Distinct Phenotypes of Perceived Bladder Pain: A Pilot Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A cluster of unknown acute pneumonia cases by a novel coronavirus signaled an outbreak in Wuhan province of China in December 2019.

Methods: We analyzed quarterly HIV/AIDS-related data from 2015 to the second quarter of 2020 using an anomaly detection approach. The data included the number of consultations, the number of HIV tests performed by public health centers or municipalities, and the number of newly reported HIV cases with and without an AIDS diagnosis.

Here, we report the crystal structures of yeast Npl4 in complex with Lys48-linked diubiquitin and with the Npl4-binding motif of Ufd1. The distal and proximal ubiquitin moieties of Lys48-linked diubiquitin primarily interact with the C-terminal helix and N-terminal loop of the Npl4 C-terminal domain (CTD), respectively.

Ufd1 occupies a hydrophobic groove of the Mpr1/Pad1 N-terminal (MPN) domain of Npl4, which corresponds to the catalytic groove of the MPN domain of JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme (JAMM)-family deubiquitylating enzyme.

The Families Actively Improving Relationships (FAIR) program is an action-oriented, evidence-based behavioral treatment for opioid and methamphetamine disorders in parents involved in the child welfare (CW) system. A seven-clinician team operates out of a Medicaid-funded clinic, primarily delivering services in the community. Attending to underlying mechanisms of FAIR's intervention strategies that promote client engagement and clinical outcomes, FAIR rapidly adapted it procedures in response to COVID-19-onset disruptions. This study analyzes administrative records and Medicaid claims data from January 2019 to July 2020, including 157 clients and 17,449 claims. We considered COVID-19 presence as MarchCJuly 2020. The study examined changes in the frequency and reimbursement volume of FAIR service delivery pre- and postonset of COVID-19. Although average monthly reimbursement per clinician did not significantly decline, reimbursement per client significantly declined by 31% (pre: $1005 [$732]; post: $698 [$546], p < .001). Clinicians delivered services on significantly more days per month during COVID-19 (mean (sd) = 16.73 (6.33); 20.26 (7.24), t(127) = ?2.70, p < .01). Average clinician caseload size was stable, as was the average monthly service receipt days for clients. Thus, this study attributes reductions in reimbursement per client when FAIR provided services remotely to the elimination of in-person billable services and reductions in session length, but not in frequency. Medicaid-funded clinics and community-based substance use treatment interventions such as FAIR can successfully sustain and implement substance use treatment practices with deliberate, rapid adaptation to ensure that families receive needed supports in the face of contextual crises.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on service delivery for an evidence-based behavioral treatment for families involved in the child welfare system()()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a public health emergency worldwide The scientific community has put in much effort and published studies that described COVID-19's biology, transmission, clinical diagnosis, candidate therapeutics, and vaccines However, to date, only a few data are available on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on ophthalmological care in different health care systems, its future consequences in terms of disability, and access to sight-saving cures for many patients To reduce human-to-human transmission of the virus and also ensure supply of infrastructures, human resources, and disposable medical devices to many regions, it is crucial to assess risks and postpone non-essential outpatient visits and elective surgical procedures, especially in older patients and those with comorbidities This delay or suspension in essential eye procedures may cause significant and rapid vision impairment to irreversible blindness Determining the risk-benefit profile of treating these ocular pathologies is a public health issue of supreme priority, even though many patients benefiting from therapeutic treatments are elderly, who are more vulnerable to COVID-19 If not reversible, this process could lead to a dramatic increase in disability and unsustainable social costs for many Governments","output":"Early impact of COVID-19 outbreak on eye care: Insights from EUROCOVCAT group"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) has been demonstrated to be associated with non-organ and organ-specific autoantibodies (antinuclear antibody, extractable nuclear antibody, double-stranded DNA, muscle acetylcholine receptor antibody) and systemic autoimmune diseases.

But how can the teaching of all the learning objectives necessary for medical training be guaranteed during an exceptional situation with constantly changing conditions? In the case of the BSc Human Medicine at ETH Zurich (ETHZ), the answer is: Hybrid teaching. The field report \\"COVID-19 as a chance for hybrid teaching concepts\\" outlines how ETHZ switched to hybrid teaching within a very short time and how hospital placements were combined with video conferences. The qualitative surveys conducted at the end of the semester and the weekly quantitative surveys of students from March to June indicate the importance of personal exchange despite the ban on contact and that interactivity is possible even without physical proximity.

Therefore it was not clear either how the pandemic would impact the healthcare system. As a result it was initially predicted that the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark would overwhelm the healthcare system and thus both the diagnosis and treatment of other hospital patients were compromised for an extended period. AIM: To develop a mathematical model, which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected persons, for early estimation of the epidemic's course, its Infection Fatality Rate and the healthcare system load in Denmark, both retrospectively and prospectively. METHODS: The SEIRS (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible) model including deaths outside hospitals and separate assessments of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases (based on seroprevalence) with different immunological memories. Optimal model parameters are in part identified by Monte Carlo based Least Square Error methods while micro-outbreaks are modeled by noise and explored in Monte Carlo simulations. Estimates for infected population sizes are obtained by using a quasi steady state method. RESULTS: The calculations and simulations made by the model were shown to fit with the observed development of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark. The antibody prevalence in the general population in May 2020 was 1.37%, which yields a relative frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of 1 to 5.2. Due to the large asymptomatic population, the Infection Mortality Rate was only 0.4%. However, with no non-pharmacological restrictions the COVID-19 death toll was calculated to have more than doubled the national average yearly deaths within a year. The transmission rate a0 was 5.4 in the initial free epidemic period, 0.4 in the lock-down period and 0.8-1.0 in the successive re-opening periods through August 2020. The large asymptomatic population made the termination of the epidemic difficult and micro-outbreaks occurred when the country re-opened. The estimated infected population size July 15 to August 15 was 2,100 and 12,200 for October 1-20, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the model show, that COVID-19 has a low Infection Fatality Rate because the majority of infected persons are either asymptomatic or with few symptoms. A minority of the infected persons, therefore, requires hospitalization. That means that for a given infection pressure of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected there will be a lower pressure on the capacity of the health care system than previously predicted. Further the epidemic will be difficult to terminate since about 84% of the infected individuals are asymptomatic but still contagious. The model may be useful if a major infection wave occurs in the autumn-winter season as it could make robust estimates both for the scale of an ongoing expanding epidemic and for the expected load on the healthcare system. The simulation may also be useful to evaluate different testing strategies based on estimated infected population sizes. The model can be adjusted and scaled to other regions and countries, which is illustrated with Spain and USA.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in Denmark, February through October 2020: Nature of the past epidemic and how it may develop in the future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought forward the centrality of public communication as a force for information, and in highlighting the differential impact on diverse segments of the society.

Unlike observations performed in vitro, the membranous web detected in liver tissue seems essentially made of clusters of single-membrane vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and close to lipid droplets. This suggests that the DMVs could be a hallmark of laboratory-adapted HCV strains, possibly due to their ability to achieve a high level of replication. Alternatively, the concealment of viral RNA in DMVs may be part of innate immune response mechanisms particularly developed in hepatoma cell lines cultured in vitro.

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus responsible for the 2019 global pandemic of COVID-19 community acquired pneumonia. We have undertaken a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: CONCOR-1 is an open-label, multicentre, randomized trial. Inclusion criteria include the following: patients > 16 years, admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection, receiving supplemental oxygen for respiratory complications of COVID-19, and availability of blood group compatible CCP. Exclusion criteria are : onset of respiratory symptoms more than 12 days prior to randomization, intubated or imminent plan for intubation, and previous severe reactions to plasma. Consenting patients are randomized 2:1 to receive either approximately 500 mL of CCP or standard of care. CCP is collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 and who have detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies quantified serologically. The primary outcome is intubation or death at day 30. Secondary outcomes include ventilator-free days, length of stay in intensive care or hospital, transfusion reactions, serious adverse events, and reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Exploratory analyses include patients who received CCP containing high titre antibodies. A sample size of 1200 patients gives 80% power to detect a 25% relative risk reduction assuming a 30% baseline risk of intubation or death at 30 days (two-sided test;  = 0.05). An interim analysis and sample size re-estimation will be done by an unblinded independent biostatistician after primary outcome data are available for 50% of the target recruitment (n = 600).

Recent advancements in training load monitoring solutions have coincided with increases in the literature describing the physical demands of basketball, but there are currently no reviews that summarize all the available basketball research. Additionally, a thorough appraisal of the load monitoring methodologies and measures used in basketball is lacking in the current literature. This type of critical analysis would allow for consistent comparison between studies to better understand physical demands across the sport. OBJECTIVES The objective of this systematic review was to assess and critically evaluate the methods and technologies used for monitoring physical demands in competitive basketball athletes. We used the term 'training load' to encompass the physical demands of both training and game activities, with the latter assumed to provide a training stimulus as well. This review aimed to critique methodological inconsistencies, establish operational definitions specific to the sport, and make recommendations for basketball training load monitoring practice and reporting within the literature. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was performed using EBSCO, PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science to identify studies through March 2020. Electronic databases were searched using terms related to basketball and training load. Records were included if they used a competitive basketball population and incorporated a measure of training load. This systematic review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO Registration # CRD42019123603), and approved under the National Basketball Association (NBA) Health Related Research Policy. RESULTS Electronic and manual searches identified 122 papers that met the inclusion criteria. These studies reported the physical demands of basketball during training (n = 56), competition (n = 36), and both training and competition (n = 30). Physical demands were quantified with a measure of internal training load (n = 52), external training load (n = 29), or both internal and external measures (n = 41). These studies examined males (n = 76), females (n = 34), both male and female (n = 9), and a combination of youth (i.e. under 18 years, n = 37), adults (i.e. 18 years or older, n = 77), and both adults and youth (n = 4). Inconsistencies related to the reporting of competition level, methodology for recording duration, participant inclusion criteria, and validity of measurement systems were identified as key factors relating to the reporting of physical demands in basketball and summarized for each study. CONCLUSIONS This review comprehensively evaluated the current body of literature related to training load monitoring in basketball. Within this literature, there is a clear lack of alignment in applied practices and methodological framework, and with only small data sets and short study periods available at this time, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions about the true physical demands of basketball. A detailed understanding of modern technologies in basketball is also lacking, and we provide specific guidelines for defining and applying duration measurement methodologies, vetting the validity and reliability of measurement tools, and classifying competition level in basketball to address some of the identified knowledge gaps. Creating alignment in best-practice basketball research methodology, terminology and reporting may lead to a more robust understanding of the physical demands associated with the sport, thereby allowing for exploration of other research areas (e.g. injury, performance), and improved understanding and decision making in applying these methods directly with basketball athletes.","output":"Measuring Physical Demands in Basketball: An Explorative Systematic Review of Practices."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread around the world resulting in an acute respiratory illness pandemic.

Virus titration assay was performed to determine the virus infectivity. The expression of viral mRNA and protein was measured by real-time PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assay, respectively. The transcript levels of cytokines were evaluated by real-time PCR. RESULTS LiCl significantly suppressed the synthesis of viral RNA and protein; however, it did not block PRRSV binding and entry. Further studies confirmed that LiCl inhibited PRRSV replication at an early stage and TNF-, an antiviral cytokine, was significantly increased after LiCl treatment. Thus, we suggested that LiCl inhibited PRRSV infection by up-regulating the level of antiviral cytokine TNF- at an early infection stage.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in elasticity of the cornea, sclera, and limbus when subjected to different intraocular pressures (IOP) using wave-based optical coherence elastography (OCE). Special attention was given to the elasticity changes of the limbal region with respect to the elasticity variations in the neighboring corneal and scleral regions. Methods: Continuous harmonic elastic waves (800 Hz) were mechanically induced in the sclera near the corneo-sclera limbus of in situ porcine eye-globes (n = 8). Wave propagation was imaged using a phase-sensitive optical coherence tomography system (PhS-OCT). The eyes were subjected to five different IOP-levels (10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 mm Hg), and spatially distributed propagation velocities were calculated along corneal, limbal, and scleral regions. Finite element analysis (FEA) of the same regions under the same excitation conditions were conducted for further validation of results. Results: FEA demonstrated that the stiffness of the heterogeneous cornea-limbus-sclera transition can be characterized by phase velocity measurements of the elastic waves produced at 800 Hz in the anterior eye. Experimental results revealed that the wave speed in the limbus (cL = 6.5 m/s) is between the cornea (cc = 2.9 m/s) and sclera (cs = 10.0 m/s) at a physiological IOP level (15 mm Hg) and rapidly increases as the IOP level is increased, even surpassing the wave speed in the sclera. Finally, the change in elastic wave speed in the limbus (&#916;cLa18.5 m/s) was greater than in the cornea (&#916;cc a12.6 m/s) and sclera (&#916;csa8.1 m/s) for the same change in IOP. Conclusions: We demonstrated that wave-based OCE can be utilized to assess limbus biomechanical properties. Moreover, experimental evidence showed that the corneo-scleral limbus is highly nonlinear compared to the cornea and sclera when the eye-globe is deformed by an increase of IOP. This may suggest that the limbus has enough structural flexibility to stabilize anterior eye shape during IOP changes.","output":"Dynamic Optical Coherence Elastography of the Anterior Eye: Understanding the Biomechanics of the Limbus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare accessibility and equity remain important issues, as corruption in the form of informal payments is still prevalent in many countries across the world. This study employs a panel data analysis over the 2006C2013 period to explore the role of different institutional factors in explaining the prevalence of informal payments. Covering 117 countries, our findings confirm the significant role of both formal and informal institutions. Good governance, a higher trust among individuals, and a higher commitment to tackling corruption are associated with diminishing informal payments. In addition, higher shares of private finance, such as out-of-pocket and domestic private health expenditure, are also correlated with a lower prevalence of informal payments. In policy terms, this displays how correcting institutional imperfections may be among the most efficient ways to tackle informal payments in healthcare.","output":"Institutional Determinants of Informal Payments for Health Services: An Exploratory Analysis across 117 Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a widespread impact on societies across the globe. As part of the effort to control transmission in the United States, many businesses either closed or instituted nonpharmaceutical control measures and allowed only essential workers on-site. During summer and fall of 2020, employers began formulating \\"return to work\\" strategies designed to mitigate the risk of transmission among employees. On a population level, several countries implemented national testing and surveillance strategies that proved effective in mitigating citizen-to-citizen transmission and contributed to suppressing COVID-19. A crucial component of many such strategies is population-based testing to identify and engage individuals with asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection, which also is relevant to return-to-work strategies. The authors describe an approach that multisite employers might use to help mitigate transmission of COVID-19 in the workplace. This approach leverages a bioinformatics platform informed by real-time PCR test data at the county and subcounty (eg, Public Use Microdata Area) level, allowing for population-based testing to be selectively targeted for employees in geographies with elevated SARS-CoV-2 positivity. A \\"Command Center\\" application integrates data from multiple sources (eg, local infection trends, employee symptom diaries, Bluetooth thermometers) in real time, which can be used to inform decisions regarding surveillance and employee self-isolation or quarantine; a mobile phone-based application provides for rapid, secure communication with employees.

The procedure is complicated with significant morbidity; the most severe complication being the anastomotic leakage. Anastomotic fistulas are reported in 5-25% of cases and are mainly due to gastric transplant ischemia. Here, we report our experience of ischemic pre-conditioning using preoperative arterial embolization (PreopAE) before esophagectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The medical records of all patients who underwent oncologic esophagectomy from 2008 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: patients who received PreopAE, and a control group of patients who did not benefit from ischemic pre-conditioning. The target arteries selected for PreopAE were the splenic artery, left gastric artery, and right gastric artery. Evaluation of the results was based on anastomotic leakage, postoperative mortality, technical success of PreopAE, and complications related to the embolization procedure. RESULTS Forty-six patients underwent oncologic esophagectomy with PreopAE and 13 patients did not receive ischemic conditioning before surgery. Thirty-eight PreopAE were successfully performed (83%), but right gastric artery embolization failed for 8 patients. Anastomotic leakage occurred in 6 PreopAE patients (13%) and in 6 patients (46%) in the control group (p = 0.02). The mortality rate was 2% in the PreopAE group and 23% in the control group (p = 0.03). Eighteen patients suffered from partial splenic infarction after PreopAE, all treated conservatively.

METHODS Among 122 children (0-18 years old) diagnosed with M. pneumoniae pneumonia, 95 children with the results of macrolide sensitivity test were included in this study. Clinical manifestations were acquired using retrospective medical records. RESULTS The macrolide resistant rate of M. pneumoniae was 87.2% (82 of 94 patients) in children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia. One patient showed a mixed type of wild type and A2063G mutation in 23S rRNA of M. pneumoniae.

While the reduced human presence and mobility, causing declines in visitation rates of protected areas, may generally favour biodiversity conservation in natural ecosystems, the pandemic has caused major disruptions of the food supply chain. Furthermore, the \\"reverse migration\\"of labour has led to scarcity of workforce in many localities hitting agricultural operations. The cumulative effect is food insecurity for millions of people in both the developed and developing countries. It is therefore crucial to encourage local food production systems at the household and community levels. Tropical homegardens, which are resilient and sustainable production systems, are important in this respect. Homegardening is a unique farming system, which combines divergent production and service functions around the homesteads and contribute to the supply of fresh food at the household level. Being a decentralized production system, such practices may reduce food wastage along the supply chain. A prominent structural attribute of homegardens is the great diversity of species ranging from creeping herbs to tall trees and livestock, implying their potential for biodiversity conservation. Although land-use systems are challenged as never before in the wake of the pandemic, homegardening may provide a way forward to overcome the looming food insecurity at the household level in the rural areas of many countries. ?

It argues that both populist leaders mobilised masculinity as a resource in statecraft. Both initially responded to the pandemic with dismissiveness and denialism. For the rest of his term, Trump diminished the harms of COVID and emphasised protecting the economy. Duterte, however, eventually embraced the fear of COVID, imposed a strict lockdown, and secured emergency powers. This article first analyses differences in the masculinities the two politicians performed. It then explores how this performance of masculinity contributed to structuring public discourses in relation to the pandemic and situates it in neoliberal governance more broadly. For example, the performance of invincibility constructed others vulnerability and illness as an individual weakness rather than socially and relationally produced. Trumps co-optation of the language of freedom encouraged protests against health measures and positioned medical experts as the real threat. In contrast, Dutertes securitised approach made it difficult for citizens to protest repressive laws enacted by his government. Dutertes war on COVID was marked by his demand for obedience and discipline, thereby constituting anyone who questioned the harmful effects of a police-led lockdown as a threat to national security. Finally, the article reflects on the ways Chinas growing role in global politics affects notions and practices of populist masculinities. Both leaders flexed diplomatic masculinity differently in relation to China: Duterte touted his personal closeness to China as a path to securing resources for the Philippines, while Trumps vilification of China constructed COVID as a foreign enemy as opposed to a crisis he was responsible for. Ultimately, these masculine responses undermined dissent and centred muscularity, either in the form of individual resilience or securitisation and policing, as the solution to the pandemic.

In 2016, the first official Chinese CCBT system was launched by Chinese Cognitive Behavior Therapy Professional Organizations and included four items: getting out of depression, overcoming anxiety, staying away from insomnia and facing Obsessive-compulsive disorder. During the COVID-19 epidemic, Chinese CCBT system served the public for free. This study explored the effects of CCBT on anxiety and depression by comparing the use of the platform during the epidemic and during the same period in 2019. Methods: Users were divided into a depression group or an anxiety group according to their own discretion. The subjects used the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) before each training. Each training group completed the corresponding CCBT training project, which had 5C6 training sessions, an average of once every 5 days. The training content in 2019 and 2020 was identical. This study compared the demographic characteristics, depression, and anxiety levels of CCBT platform users during the lockdown period in Wuhan (LP2020), where the outbreak was concentrated in China, from January 23 to July 23, 2020 and the same period in 2019 (SP2019).

Here, we thus studied the hydrogen/deuterium (H/D)-exchange behavior of unfolded ubiquitin in 6.0 M guanidinium chloride at pH 2.6 and 20C. We employed a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-quenched H/D-exchange NMR technique with the use of spin desalting columns, which allowed us to make a quick medium exchange from 6.0 M guanidinium chloride to a quenching DMSO solution. The technique is particularly effective for studies of the H/D-exchange kinetics of unfolded proteins in concentrated denaturant. By the backbone resonance assignment of the hetero-nuclear single quantum coherence spectrum of 15N-labeled ubiquitin in the DMSO solution, we successfully investigated the H/D-exchange kinetics of 27 identified peptide amide groups in the ubiquitin sequence. Although most of these amide groups were not protected, the four amide groups of Ile3, Val5, Ile13 and Leu73 were weakly but significantly protected with a protection factor of 2.5C3.0, indicating that there were residual structures in unfolded ubiquitin and that these amide groups were 60C67% hydrogen-bonded by the residual structures. We show that the first native -hairpin, composed of residues 2C16 in the native ubiquitin structure, is partially structured even in 6.0 M guanidinium chloride and that the amide group of Leu73 is protected by a nonnative hydrogen-bonding interaction.

ARDS represents an unmet medical need with an urgency to develop effective pharmacotherapies. Multiple promising targets have been identified that could lead to the development of potential therapies for ARDS; however, they have been limited because of difficulty with the mode of delivery, especially in critically ill patients. Nanobiotechnology is the basis of innovative techniques to deliver drugs targeted to the site of inflamed organs, such as the lungs. Nanoscale drug delivery systems have the ability to improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of agents, allowing an increase in the biodistribution of therapeutic agents to target organs and resulting in improved efficacy with reduction in drug toxicity. Although attractive, delivering nanomedicine to lungs can be challenging as it requires sophisticated systems. Here we review the potential of novel nanomedicine approaches that may prove to be therapeutically beneficial for the treatment of this devastating condition.","output":"Nanomedicine for Treatment of Acute Lung Injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When a state deprives us of fundamental liberties, the judiciary is required to assess the government action using the strict scrutiny standard of review. Under this level of scrutiny, the state action must be narrowly tailored and serve a compelling state interest. An essential aspect of strict scrutiny is that the burden of proof is on the government. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, federal courts have largely failed to apply the strict scrutiny standard of review to state actions. Instead, courts have invented an entirely new standard of review specifically for state actions during a public health crisis. Under this COVID-19 standard of review, courts may only overturn state actions that lack a real or substantial relation to public health or that amount to a plain, palpable invasion of rights. This judicial test shifts the burden of proof from the state to the individual. Unsurprisingly, the new COVID-19 standard of review vindicates state deprivations of liberty regardless of evidentiary based merit.This Article addresses the standard of judicial review federal courts are using to reject constitutional challenges to state actions in response to the coronavirus. This Article describes the fundamental liberties abridged by state lock-downs, and the judicial scrutiny historically applied to these types of infringements on liberty. This Article examines the 1905 Supreme Court case of Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which courts utilize to support the new standard of judicial review developed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This Article reviews other legal precedents in the area of quarantine law to expose how the COVID-19 standard of review is a radical divergence from traditional jurisprudence. Lastly, this Article compares federal court opinions using the new COVID-19 standard of review with the few court decisions still using strict scrutiny to review deprivations of liberty. This comparison demonstrates that once subjected to the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny and the burden of proof, state governments utterly fail to support the efficacy and necessity of their COVID-19 emergency measures.JUNE 2020 SUPPLEMENTAL UPDATE. Since the original publication of this Article on May 22, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court has seemingly announced its intent to support the unbridled discretion of state governments and further cover-up unconstitutional state actions in response to COVID-19. On May 29, 2020, the Supreme Court rejected an application for injunctive relief in South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom. This case involved Californias 25% occupancy restriction on churches, which exempted secular businesses from the same restrictions. The church challenged the constitutionality of Californias restriction under the First Amendments Free Exercise Clause and sought to enjoin its application. The Courts denial of injunctive relief was a 5-4 split decision. Chief Justice Roberts concurred with the progressive block of justices in favor of the denial and authored an opinion in support of the decision. According to Justice Roberts, [t]he precise question of when restrictions on particular social activities should be lifted during the pandemic is a dynamic and fact-intensive matter subject to reasonable disagreement. Our Constitution principally entrusts [t]he safety and the health of the people to the politically accountable officials of the States to guard and protect. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 38, 25 S.Ct. 358, 49 L.Ed. 643 (1905). Like the other judicial pronouncements discussed in this Article, this statement by Justice Roberts continues the federal judiciarys campaign to defile constitutional law and declare the supremacy of state police power over the individual freedoms endowed to us by the Constitution. Contrary to Justice Roberts determination, constitutional precedent holds that when government restrictions on fundamental rights are subject to reasonable disagreement (i.e., the government is not able to demonstrate the necessity of its actions), the judiciary must err on the side of liberty. Whatever authority our Constitution provides government officials to guard and protect the safety and health of the people is unquestionably subservient to our fundamental rights. Our Constitution PRINCIPALLY entrusts government with the unrivaled mandate to preserve the sacred rights of humanity.This is the way liberty ends, not with a bang, but with the whimper of faithless justices who dare to tell us that we are too stupid to understand the plainly stated constraints our Constitution places on government.","output":"The COVID-19 Cover-Up;How Federal Courts Are Changing Constitutional Law to Uphold Unconstitutional State Actions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a risk factor for severe complications and death from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Public health efforts to control the pandemic may alter health behaviors related to weight gain, inflammation, and poor cardiometabolic health, exacerbating the prevalence of obesity, poor immune health, and chronic diseases. DESIGN: We reviewed how the pandemic adversely influences many of these behaviors, specifically physical activity, sedentary behaviors, sleep, and dietary intakes, and provided individual level strategies that may be used to mitigate them. RESULTS: At the community level and higher, public health and health care professionals need to advocate for intervention strategies and policy changes that address these behaviors, such as increasing nutrition assistance programs and creating designated areas for recreation and active transportation, to reduce disparities among vulnerable populations. CONCLUSIONS: The long-lasting impact of the pandemic on health behaviors, and the possibility of a second COVID-19 wave, emphasize the need for creative and evolving, multi-level approaches to assist individuals in adapting their health behaviors to prevent both chronic and infectious diseases.","output":"Health behaviours during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: implications for obesity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Diagnostic tests and examinations inform clinical decision making. Thus, an essential part of medical students' workplace-based training is dedicated to core skills in clinical diagnostic sciences. Due to a reduction of clinical internships for fifth-year students in the wake of COVID-19 learning activities replacing this aspect of training were needed. Project description: Virtual Patient online learning materials addressing clinical diagnostic sciences, specifically, radiology, were developed to prepare students for the transition to workplace-based learning. Three types of activities related to interprofessional patient treatment, showing how radiology knowledge improves the diagnosing and treatment of patients, were used to design the narrative of each virtual patient. The materials also showed students \\"how to learn\\" in the clinical workplace while showing \\"what to learn\\". Students complete relevant tasks and compare their approach with experts' approach in a self-directed way. Results: Twenty self-study quizzes, accompanied by nine interactive Webinars were developed, providing 13% of the overall available replacement learning materials for the summer term 2020. In June 2020, 486 students completed the program and collected a mean share of 16% (SD=10) of their required credits by choosing to learn with these materials.

The objective was to report on outcome after 2 years of a technique using laparoscopic USL colpopexy. METHODS A total of 152 uterine prolapse patients underwent laparoscopic USL colpopexy from May 2013 to April 2015. We described the surgical technique and performed a retrospective analysis of this laparoscopic technique. Patients underwent standardized assessment and examination using pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) score. The dependent values of Ba point (bladder), C point (vaginal cuff) and Bp point (rectum) were recorded preoperatively, and at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months of postoperative examination. Pre/postoperative data were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS Mean age, operative time and amount of hemorrhage were 68.2  7.5 years, 118.3  36.4 min and 60.5  73.3 mL, respectively. Overall recurrent prolapse, which was defined as POP-Q stage II or higher, was noted in 29 patients (19%). However, only 2 patients presented recurrent rectocele among 51 patients with preoperative POP-Q stage II of uterine prolapse alone (recurrence rate; 3.9%).

Here, we undertook a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study, and investigated for the first time the possible causal impact of PD on host susceptibility to COVID-19 and its severity. METHODS: Summary statistics of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity were retrieved from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative and used as outcomes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with PD in Genome-wide association study were included as exposure. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was employed as the main approach to analyze the causal relationships between PD and COVID-19. Three additional methods were adopted, allowing the existence of horizontal pleiotropy, including MR-Egger regression, weighted median and weighted mode methods. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were also conducted for estimating the robustness of the identified associations. RESULTS: The MR estimates showed that PD was significantly associated with significantly higher susceptibility to COVID-19 using IVW (OR = 1.024, P = 0.017, 95% CI 1.004C1.045) and weighted median method (OR = 1.029, P = 0.024, 95% CI 1.003C1.055). Furthermore, it revealed that PD was significantly linked to COVID-19 severity based on the comparison of hospitalization versus population controls (IVW, OR = 1.025, P = 0.039, 95% CI 1.001C1.049; weighted median, OR = 1.030, P = 0.027, 95% CI 1.003C1.058). No such association was observed in the cohort of highly severe cases confirmed versus those not hospitalized due to COVID-19.

However, there is only limited information regarding the safety profiles of the proposed drugs, in particular drug-induced cardiotoxicity. Here, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy and cardiotoxicity of remdesivir using cardiomyocytes-derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-CMs) as an alternative source of human primary cardiomyocytes (CMs). In this study, remdesivir exhibited up to 60-fold higher antiviral activity in hPSC-CMs compared to Vero E6 cells; however, it also induced moderate cardiotoxicity in these cells. To gain further insight into the drug-induced arrhythmogenic risk, we assessed QT interval prolongation and automaticity of remdesivir-treated hPSC-CMs using a multielectrode array (MEA). As a result, the data indicated a potential risk of QT prolongation when remdesivir is used at concentrations higher than the estimated peak plasma concentration.

The association of comorbidities and other variables with the risks were studied by fitting a spatial panel data linear model (splm). As results, we observed that on average the greatest risks were reached by July, and that highest risks were observed in some states, Baja California Norte, Chiapas, and Sonora; interestingly, some densely populated states, as Mexico City, had lower values.

While the histone variants have revealed important functions in epigenetic regulations, the deposition in chromatin during S-phase of newly synthesized histone variants remains unclear. The identification of histone variants of H3 and unique features of Physarum polycephalum provides a powerful system for investigating de novo deposition of newly synthesized histones by tracking the incorporation of exogenous histones within cells.

Disturbing the expression of H3 variants by siRNAs revealed mutual compensation of histone transcripts.

Examples in this paper illustrate how industry and public health can collaborate to develop a vaccine to prevent an emerging disease in horses (West Nile virus vaccine), how poultry vaccination can protect animals and prevent transmission to people (avian influenza vaccine), how regulatory changes can pave the way for vaccines that will control the carrier state in animals and thus prevent infection in humans (Bartonella henselae vaccine in cats) and how novel technologies could be applied to vaccinate wildlife reservoir species for rabies. Stemming from the realisation that zoonotic diseases are the predominant source of human emerging infectious diseases, it behoves academic, public health, and animal health agencies to consider creative constructive approaches to combat serious public health challenges.

METHODS: Adapting standardized disaster research methodology in September 2020, the city was divided into high and low strata based on RT-PCR positivity rates, and census block groups within each stratum were randomly selected with probability proportional to size, followed by random selection of households within each group. Using two immunoassays, the proportion of infected individuals was estimated for the city, as well as by positivity rate and by sociodemographic and other characteristics. The degree of under ascertainment of seroprevalence was estimated based on RT-PCR positive cases. RESULTS: Seroprevalence was estimated to be 14% with a near two-fold difference in areas with high (18%) versus low (10%) RT-PCR positivity rates and was four times higher compared to case-based surveillance data.

At present, there are some problems in tourism professional villages, such as imperfect management and inaccurate prediction of future development, which affect the rational allocation of tourism resources. In order to improve the distribution of tourism resources and better predict the development of tourism professional villages, it is necessary to make comprehensive judgment and analysis, especially the analysis of indicators such as the prediction and development judgment of tourism professional villages. This paper discusses the optimization analysis of the agglomeration of tourism specialized villages by backpropagation (BP) neural network and system dynamics model, analyzes the system structure of the agglomeration factors of tourism specialized villages, and promotes the intelligent integration of the agglomeration factors. The development of clusters of professional villages promotes data integration among resources, economy, society, and other elements and presents the characteristics of big data. As the level of concentration of professional villages increases, the complexity of the associated factors also increases, which increases the difficulty and effectiveness of tourism analysis. In view of this situation, taking mountain tourism as the research object, this paper proposes an improved system dynamics model based on BP, extracts features from cross factor (resource, economic, and social) data, and optimizes the relationship between professional village agglomeration and various factors. The MATLAB simulation results show that based on the improved system dynamics analysis, the simplification rate of (resources, economy, and society) data can be controlled at more than 24%, the degree of agglomeration is more than 95%, and the construction time of the relationship map of related factors is less than 40 s. Therefore, the analysis method proposed in this paper is suitable for the calculation of the agglomeration of tourism professional villages in the mountain area and can meet the needs of the development of tourism professional villages in the mountain area.","output":"An Optimization Analysis Model of Tourism Specialized Villages Based on Neural Network and System Dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 43rd meeting of the Reference Material Committee of ISO, ISO/REMCO, that was scheduled to take place in Milan, Italy, from 30 June to 3 July 2020 with Accredia, the Italian accreditation body and INRIM, the Italian Metrology Institute as the hosts, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Additionally, little is known about the acceptability of urban-developed survivorship care programs among rural cancer survivors who may have unique values and different attitudes towards help-seeking. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of cancer survivors who return to their rural communities upon completion of active treatment, and to identify the challenges these survivors experience in engaging with quality of life-related support services. The findings of this study will inform the design and development of new interventions, or modification of existing interventions, to better meet the preferences and needs of rural survivors. Identifying the specific challenges and intervention preferences of rural cancer survivors will help to ensure they benefit as much as urban survivors, from efforts to improve post-treatment quality of life. ABSTRACT: The transition from urban centres back to rural and remote communities can be challenging for rural cancer survivors after treatment. This study aimed to (a) provide deeper understanding of the experiences of rural survivors who have completed active cancer treatment and returned to their rural communities, and (b) determine strategies to re-orient existing services or develop new interventions to more appropriately meet rural survivors service preferences and needs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 adults (64% female) who lived outside of a metropolitan area and had completed active cancer treatment (n = 13), were the carer for a rural/remote cancer survivor (n = 6), or were both a survivor and carer (n = 3). Thematic analysis was conducted to identify dominant themes in the qualitative data. A range of physical, psychological and practical challenges that impact quality of life among rural survivors post-treatment were found. These challenges appeared to be compounded by a lack of trust in local rural healthcare services and a lack of clear post-treatment pathways to quality of life-enhancing support services. Acceptable strategies to overcome barriers included nurse-led, telephone-based, or face-to-face interventions, initiated and continued by the same service provider, and that included support to manage emotional challenges associated with post-treatment survivorship. The findings will inform the design of interventions to better meet rural cancer survivors post-treatment support needs.","output":"Improving Survivors Quality of Life Post-Treatment: The Perspectives of Rural Australian Cancer Survivors and Their Carers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objective A significant proportion of the adult population in the United States (US) live with some form of mental illness. The more prevalent conditions of depression and anxiety are typically managed in primary care settings rather than specialty care. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a novel, measurement-driven psychiatric treatment platform delivered via an online telemental health platform as compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Methods The TAU dataset and the telemental health platform (Brightside) dataset were constructed based on the total populations of adult patients receiving care for depression from January 2018 through December 2020 (November 2018 through March 2021 for the Brightside group). Patients in both groups had a primary mental health diagnosis of depression and the presence of a positive screen for depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) upon initiation of treatment. HITLAB, an independent digital health verification and testing lab, conducted comparative analyses of the two groups using the Chi-square test of independence. Results Close to 80% of telemental health platform patients experienced a reduction of 5 or more points from their baseline PHQ-9 score as compared to 52% of TAU patients. The mean reduction in PHQ-9 score was slightly higher in the Brightside group (-11.5) versus the TAU group (-10.1).

We compare our proposed risk-based quarantine approach against test-driven release policies, which fail to achieve a comparable level of transmission reduction due to the inability of tests to detect exposed people who are not yet infectious but will eventually become so.

A total of 159 blood samples were collected from 52 recovered COVID-19 patients up to six months after symptom onset for longitudinal serological tests. The positive rate of IgG and IgM antibodies was 92.3% and 90.4% in the first month after symptom onset, and the seropositivity of IgG antibody remained high at all follow-up time points, whereas the seropositivity of IgM antibody decreased to 22.73% by the sixth months after symptom onset. The level of IgG antibody was stable, the level of IgM antibody decreased slightly in the early convalescent phase and was detected in only five patients in the sixth month after symptom onset. The level of IgG antibody was higher in the severe and critical group than in the moderate group.

Evidence regarding cross-neutralizing response between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is still controversial. However, other previous coronaviruses may interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection, since they are phylogenetically related and share the same target receptor. Further, the seroconversion of IgM and IgG occurs at around 12 days post onset of symptoms and most patients have neutralizing titers on days 14-20, with great titer variability. Neutralizing antibodies correlate positively with age, male sex, and severity of the disease. Moreover, the use of convalescent plasma has shown controversial results in terms of safety and efficacy, and due to the variable immune response among individuals, measuring antibody titers before transfusion is mostly required.

METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted at a PCR center between October 7 and December 5, 2020. The included patients were referred from a local public health center and 89 primary care facilities. We simultaneously obtained two nasopharyngeal samples with flocked swabs; one was used for the antigen test and the other for real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Using the results of real-time RT-PCR as a reference, the performance of the antigen test was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 1186 patients were included in this study, and the real-time RT-PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in 105 (8.9%). Of these 105 patients, 33 (31.4%) were asymptomatic. The antigen test provided a 98.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 98.0%-99.4%) concordance rate with real-time RT-PCR, along with a sensitivity of 86.7% (95% CI: 78.6%-92.5%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 99.7%-100%). False-negatives were observed in 14 patients, 8 of whom were asymptomatic and had a low viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) > 30). In symptomatic patients, the sensitivity was 91.7% (95% CI: 82.7%-96.9%). CONCLUSION: QuickNavi&#8482;-COVID19 Ag showed high specificity and sufficient sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

Web-based diaries are a useful activity for psychoeducation because of their therapeutic benefits, ability to capture naturalistic data relevant to well-being, and appropriateness for text analysis methods. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine how university students use electronic diaries within a psychoeducation program designed to enhance mental well-being. METHODS: The Science of Happiness course was administered to 154 undergraduate students in a university setting (the United Kingdom). Diaries were collected from the students for 9 weeks. Baseline well-being data were collected using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS). The percentage of negative and positive emotion words used in diaries (emotional tone) and use of words from five life domains (social, work, money, health, and leisure) were calculated using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 2015 software. Random effects (generalized least squares) regression models were estimated to examine whether time, diary characteristics, demographics, and baseline well-being predict the emotional tone of diaries. RESULTS: A total of 149 students participated in the diary study, producing 1124 individual diary entries. Compliance with the diary task peaked in week 1 (n=1041, 92.62%) and was at its lowest in week 3 (n=807, 71.81%). Compared with week 1, diaries were significantly more positive in their emotional tone during week 5 (mean difference 23.90, 95% CI 16.89-30.90) and week 6 (mean difference 26.62, 95% CI 19.35-33.88) when students were tasked with writing about gratitude and their strengths. Across weeks, moderate and high baseline SWEMWBS scores were associated with a higher percentage of positive emotion words used in diaries (increases compared with students scoring low in SWEMWBS were 5.03, 95% CI 0.08-9.98 and 7.48, 95% CI 1.84-13.12, respectively). At week 1, the diaries of students with the highest levels of baseline well-being (82.92, 95% CI 73.08-92.76) were more emotionally positive on average than the diaries of students with the lowest levels of baseline well-being (59.38, 95% CI 51.02-67.73). Diaries largely focused on the use of social words. The emotional tone of diary entries was positively related to the use of leisure (3.56, 95% CI 2.28-4.85) and social words (0.74, 95% CI 0.21-1.27), and inversely related to the use of health words (?1.96, 95% CI ?3.70 to ?0.22). CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence for short-term task-specific spikes in the emotional positivity of web-based diary entries and recommend future studies examine the possibility of long-term impacts on the writing and well-being of students.

The dataset of 91 patients received CT-based BT of cervical cancer was used to train and test DSD-UNET model for auto-segmentation of high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) and organs at risk (OARs). Automatic applicator reconstruction was achieved with DSD-UNET-based segmentation of applicator components followed by 3D skeletonization and polynomial curve fitting. Digitization of the channel paths for tandem and ovoid applicator in the planning CT was evaluated utilizing the data from 32 patients. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard Index (JI), and Hausdorff distance (HD) were used to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy. The segmentation performance of DSD-UNET was compared with that of 3D U-Net. Results showed that DSD-UNET method outperformed 3D U-Net on segmentations of all the structures. The mean DSC values of DSD-UNET method were 86.9%, 82.9%, and 82.1% for bladder, HR-CTV, and rectum, respectively. For the performance of automatic applicator reconstruction, outstanding segmentation accuracy was first achieved for the intrauterine and ovoid tubes (average DSC value of 92.1%, average HD value of 2.3 mm). Finally, HDs between the channel paths determined automatically and manually were 0.88  0.12 mm, 0.95  0.16 mm, and 0.96  0.15 mm for the intrauterine, left ovoid, and right ovoid tubes, respectively.

Furthermore, current screening strategies are not accurate enough to effectively curb the spread of the disease. Therefore, the present study was conducted within a controlled clinical environment to determine eventual detectable variations in the voice of COVID-19 patients, recovered and healthy subjects, and also to determine whether machine learning-based voice assessment (MLVA) can accurately discriminate between them, thus potentially serving as a more effective mass-screening tool. Three different subpopulations were consecutively recruited: positive COVID-19 patients, recovered COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals as controls. Positive patients were recruited within 10 days from nasal swab positivity. Recovery from COVID-19 was established clinically, virologically and radiologically. Healthy individuals reported no COVID-19 symptoms and yielded negative results at serological testing. All study participants provided three trials for multiple vocal tasks (sustained vowel phonation, speech, cough). All recordings were initially divided into three different binary classifications with a feature selection, ranking and cross-validated RBF-SVM pipeline. This brough a mean accuracy of 90.24%, a mean sensitivity of 91.15%, a mean specificity of 89.13% and a mean AUC of 0.94 across all tasks and all comparisons, and outlined the sustained vowel as the most effective vocal task for COVID discrimination. Moreover, a 3-way classification was carried out on an external test set comprised of 30 subjects, 10 per class, with a mean accuracy of 80% and an accuracy of 100% for the detection of positive subjects. Within this assessment, recovered individuals proved to be the most difficult class to identify, and all the misclassified subjects were declared positive; this might be related to mid and short-term vocal traces of COVID-19, even after the clinical resolution of the infection. In conclusion, MLVA may accurately discriminate between positive COVID-19 patients, recovered COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals. Further studies should test MLVA among larger populations and asymptomatic positive COVID-19 patients to validate this novel screening technology and test its potential application as a potentially more effective surveillance strategy for COVID-19.","output":"Machine learning-based voice assessment for the detection of positive and recovered COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective.

Compound 147 is a preferential activator of the ATF6 pathway of the ER unfolded protein response, which requires targeting of cysteine residues primarily on protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). We find that the antiviral activity of 147 is independent of ATF6 induction but does require modification of reactive thiols on protein targets. Targeting PDIs and additional non-PDI targets using RNAi and other small-molecule inhibitors was unable to recapitulate the antiviral effects, suggesting a unique polypharmacology may mediate the activity. Importantly, 147 can impair infection of multiple strains of dengue and Zika virus, indicating that it is suitable as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent.","output":"Small-molecule endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis regulator acts as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of dengue and Zika virus infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a rapid proliferation of serologic assays. However, little is known about their clinical performance. Here, we compared two commercial SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays. METHODS: 103 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 153 control specimens were analyzed using SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays by Abbott and EUROIMMUN (EI). Duration from symptom onset was determined by medical record review. Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and concordance were calculated. RESULTS: The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 assay had a diagnostic specificity of 99.4% (95% CI; 96.41-99.98%), and sensitivity of 0.0% (95% CI; 0.00-26.47%) at <3 days post symptom onset, 30.0% (95% CI; 11.89-54.28) at 3-7d, 47.8% (95% CI; 26.82-69.41) at 8-13d and 93.8% (95% CI; 82.80-98.69) at &#8805;14d. Diagnostic specificity on the EI assay was 94.8% (95% CI; 89.96-97.72) if borderline results were considered positive and 96.7% (95% CI; 92.54-98.93) if borderline results were considered negative. The diagnostic sensitivity was 0.0% (95% CI; 0.00-26.47%) at <3d, 25.0% (95% CI; 8.66-49.10) at 3-7d, 56.5% (95% CI; 34.49-76.81) at 3-7d and 85.4% (95% CI; 72.24-93.93) at &#8805;14d if borderline results were considered positive. The qualitative concordance between the assays was 0.83 (95% CI; 0.75-0.91). CONCLUSION: The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 assay had fewer false positive and false negative results than the EI assay.

There is a dearth of research on whether the provinces' approaches to managing wait lists are equitable from a patients' needs perspective or if they are associated with patients' perception of outcomes. The surgical cost models used in the past won't be useful to governments and hospital managers. New models based on hospitals' marginal costs, associated with running on weekends or off-hours and social distancing parameters, will be needed.

While individuals infected with Delta are at risk to develop severe lung disease, infection with Omicron often causes milder symptoms, especially in vaccinated individuals1,2. The question arises whether widespread Omicron infections could lead to future cross-variant protection, accelerating the end of the pandemic. Here we show that without vaccination, infection with Omicron induces a limited humoral immune response in mice and humans. Sera from mice overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor and infected with Omicron neutralize only Omicron, but no other VOCs, whereas broader cross-variant neutralization was observed after WA1 and Delta infections. Unlike WA1 and Delta, Omicron replicates to low levels in the lungs and brains of infected animals, leading to mild disease with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and diminished activation of lung-resident T cells. Sera from unvaccinated, Omicron-infected individuals show the same limited neutralization of only Omicron itself. In contrast, Omicron breakthrough infections induce overall higher neutralization titers against all VOCs. Our results demonstrate that Omicron infection enhances preexisting immunity elicited by vaccines but, on its own, may not confer broad protection against non-Omicron variants in unvaccinated individuals.","output":"Limited cross-variant immunity from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron without vaccination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The worldwide spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has prompted numerous countries to restrict public life. Related measures, such as limits on social gatherings, business closures, or lockdowns, are expected to considerably reduce the individual opportunities to move outside the home. As physical activity (PA) and sport participation significantly contribute to health, this study has two objectives. The objectives of this study are to assess changes in PA and well-being since the coronavirus outbreak in affected countries. Additionally, we will evaluate the impact of digital home-based exercise programs on PA as well as physical and mental health outcomes. Method: A multinational network trial will be conducted with three planned phases (A, B, and C). Part A consists of administering a structured survey. It investigates changes in PA levels and health during the coronavirus outbreak and measures the preferences of the participants regarding online training programs. Part B is a two-armed randomized-controlled trial. Participants assigned to the intervention group (IG) will complete a digital 4-week home exercise training (live streaming via internet) guided by the survey results on content and time of program. The control group (CG) will not receive the program. Part C is 4-week access of both CG and IG to a digital archive of pre-recorded workouts from Part B. Similar to Part A, questionnaires will be used in both Part B and C to estimate the effects of exercise on measures of mental and physical health. Results and Discussion: The ASAP project will provide valuable insights into the importance of PA during a global pandemic. Our initial survey is the first to determine how governmental confinement measures impact bodily and mental well-being. Based on the results, the intervention studies will be unique to address health problems potentially arising from losses in PA. If proven effective, the newly developed telehealth programs could become a significant and easy-to-distribute factor in combating PA decreases. Results of the study may hence guide policy makers on methods to maintain PA and health when being forced to restrict public life.

The pattern of rare communicable diseases that can affect people returning to EU/EEA from travel abroad, visiting EU/EEA or establishing in the EU/EEA is of special relevance. The objective of this manuscript is to give an overview about the EURaDMoG study and discuss the feasibility of establishing a European network on rare communicable diseases and other rare conditions linked to mobility and globalization. METHODS: We undertook a three-steps process where we first conducted a narrative review to estimate the prevalence and incidence and to list rare communicable and non-communicable diseases linked to mobility and globalization in the EU/EEA; second, we organized an international consultation workshop with experts in the diseases previously selected; and finally, the feasibility study analysed how successful a European expert network on rare diseases linked to mobility and globalization focused on health care provision would be, accounting for different operational and also sustainability criteria. RESULTS: First, considering the areas or topics that the network should cover, it was concluded that communicable and non-communicable rare diseases linked to mobility and globalization should be differentiated. Second, since all non-communicable rare diseases linked to mobility and globalization identified are already covered by different European Reference Networks (ERNs), there is no need for them to be included in a new European network. Three scenarios were considered for establishing a potential European network for rare communicable diseases linked to Mobility and Globalisation with a focus on Health Care provision: 1) To maintain the current situation Status Quo scenario; 2) to create a specific European expert network (EEN) on rare communicable diseases linked to mobility and globalisation; 3) to develop a new ERN on communicable rare diseases linked to mobility and globalisation. CONCLUSIONS: Since the focus is the provision of health care, an ERN could have the potential to better boost the quality of care being facilitated by technological tools and online platforms that permit the safe and ethically acceptable exchange of data. However, this potential new network should not eclipse current existing networks and they should be complementary.","output":"European expert network on rare communicable diseases and other rare diseases linked to mobility and globalisation focused on health care provision (EURaDMoG): a feasibility study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the number of Coronavirus Disease (2019) (COVID-19) cases increase globally, countries are taking more aggressive preventive measures against this pandemic.

Twenty-five renal transplant recipients (RTR) presenting consecutively with COVID-19 symptoms and positive NP swab PCR for SARS-CoV2 between 03/01/2020 - 05/01/2020 were included. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, management and outcomes were collected. RESULTS: All 25 patients were hospitalized. Patients had a median age of 56, all African American and deceased donor transplant recipients. Most had hypertension (96%), about half (52%) had diabetes, 64% had pulmonary disease including obstructive sleep apnea, COPD and pulmonary hypertension. Most common presenting symptom was dyspnea (64%), followed by fever and cough (56%) and diarrhea (56%). One-half of patients had multifocal opacities on initial chest x-ray (52%). Immunosuppression with tacrolimus and low dose prednisone was continued, while mycophenolate mofetil was held on admission. Following institution guidelines, hydroxychloroquine was given to 32%, while 48% received both hydroxychloroquine and steroids. Prophylactic anticoagulation was given to 80% of patients and therapeutic coagulation to 8%. Oxygen supplementation given to 60% of patients and one patient required intubation.

We investigated how heterogeneity in Health-Care Worker (HCW) behaviors, especially compliance to hand hygiene, may cause superspreading events. In particular, we compared the superspreading potential of peripatetic (noncohorted) HCWs with that of other HCWs. We developed an agent-based model for hand transmission of a pathogen in a hospital ward. Three HCW profiles were allowed: 2 assigned profiles, one with frequent contacts with a limited number of patients, another with fewer contacts but with more patients; and one peripatetic profile, with a single daily contact with all patients. We used data from the literature on common nosocomial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococci). The average number of patients colonized over 1 month increases with noncompliance to hand hygiene. Importantly, we show that this increase depends on the profile of noncompliant HCWs; for instance, it remains low for a single noncompliant assigned HCW but can be quite large for a single noncompliant peripatetic HCW. Outbreaks with this single fully noncompliant peripatetic HCW (representing only 4.5% of the staff) are similar to those predicted when all HCWs are noncompliant following 23% of patient contacts. Noncompliant peripatetic HCWs may play a disproportionate role in disseminating pathogens in a hospital ward. Their unique profile makes them potential superspreaders. This suggests that average compliance to hygiene may not be a good indicator of nosocomial risk in real life health care settings with several HCW profiles.","output":"Peripatetic health-care workers as potential superspreaders."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is relatively common in children, with most of its histological types being minimal changed disease.

The framework incorporates heterogeneous group behavior and interaction dynamics, and optimizes intervention and resources for effective containment. We demonstrate its usage by analyzing and optimizing containment strategies for the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, and its implementation for responses to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Our analysis shows that timely action within 1.5 months from the onset of confirmed cases can cut down 90% of overall infections and bring rapid containment within 6-8 months. The additional medical resources required are minor and would ensure proper treatment and quarantine of patients while reducing the risk of infections among healthcare workers. The benefit (in infection / death control) would be reduced by 10 to over 100 fold and time to containment would increase by 2-4 fold when intervention and medical resources are injected within 5 months. In contrast, the additional resources needed to bring down the overall infection in a delayed intervention are significant, with inferior results. The disease module can be tailored for different pathogens. It expands the well-used SEIR model to include social and intervention activities, asymptomatic and post-recovery transmission, hospitalization, outcome of recovery, and funeral events. The model also examines the transmission rate of health care workers and allows for heterogenous infection factors among different groups. It also captures time-variant human behavior during the horizon of the outbreak. The framework optimizes the intervention timeline and resource allocation during an infectious disease outbreak and offers insights on how resource availability in time and quantity can affect the disease trends and containment significantly. This can inform policy, disease management and resource allocation. While focusing on bed availability for quarantine and treatment appears to be simplistic, their necessity for Ebola responses cannot be overemphasized. We link these insights to a web-based tool to provide quick and intuitive observations for decision making and investigation of the disease outbreak situation. Subsequent use of the system to determine the optimal timing and effectiveness and tradeoffs analysis of various non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies for COVID-19 provide a foundation for policy makers to execute the first-step response. These results have been implemented on the ground since March 2020. The web-based tool pinpoints accurately the import of disease from global travels and associated disease spread and health burdens.

The GPs involvement requires better coordination between involved partners, in particular oncologists and GPs. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a feasibility study of remote participation of GPs in multi-disciplinary consultation meetings (MCMs). We analysed participation, participants satisfaction, and their impact on therapeutic decisions. METHODS: We conducted a feasibility study in the regional cancer centre of Toulouse, France. All patient cases discussed in the MCMs for myelodysplasia from 1 January to 31 March 2016 were included. Cases of patients aged over 18 years, with a diagnosis of myelodysplasia and registered with a GP were included if patients gave informed consent. One investigator collected the data provided by GPs during three telephone or video calls: before, during, and after the MCM, respectively. RESULTS: Of 86 patient cases discussed during three months of MCMs, 44 were eligible for GP participation; 27 GPs participated in discussions of 27 patient cases. The GPs participation in the MCM led to a change in management in five cases, with four times treatment intensifications and once de-intensification. Medical, social, family-related, and psychological domains were discussed with input from the GPs. Overall, all participants were satisfied with the MCMs. CONCLUSION: Remote participation of GPs in MCMs is feasible and may result in adapting oncological and haematological management for patients. This patient-centred approach requires a specific organisation that, when implemented, satisfies the needs of all participants.","output":"Adapting patients' oncological treatment through remote participation of general practitioners in multi-disciplinary consultation meetings: A feasibility study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media creates digital communication channels to interact with customers and needed attention to the broadening understanding of marketing.

However, assumptions that they are an outdated or costly service model have resulted in many centre closures in England. The perspectives of 42 people attending, providing, making referrals to or purchasing places at four diverse day centres for older people were collected in interviews. Using these data, we explore day centres relevance to social workers efforts to promote person-centred support for older people enabling them to maintain or improve their well-being. These are explored from the perspectives of choice, control and person-centredness and local authority responsibilities for shaping the care market under the Care Act 2014. FINDINGS: Attenders highly valued centres congregate nature and the continuity they offered which contributed to the development of person-centred relationships. Attenders exercised choice in attending day centres. Social work staff were more positive about day centres relevance to personalisation than those responsible for making decisions about the shape of local care services. APPLICATIONS: With social isolation recognised as a serious risk of old age, the value of togetherness in group environments may need highlighting. Enactment of personalisation policies need not necessarily lead to individualisation; day centres may be community-based assets for some. Those shaping the care market may be encouraged to acknowledge wider outcomes, and frontline social workers may benefit from hearing positive experiences that may help in the development of effective care plans for older people who would like to benefit from day centre participation.","output":"Choice, control and person-centredness in day centres for older people"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pattern recognition is an important skill of Computational Thinking and is one of the most important competences for solving a problem that involves finding similarities or patterns in small problems to solve more complex ones.

Cyanogenesis in forage sorghum is a major concern in agriculture as the leaves of domesticated sorghum are potentially toxic to livestock, especially at times of drought which induces increased production of the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin. The wild sorghum species endemic to Australia have a negligible content of dhurrin in the above ground tissues and thus represent a potential resource for key agricultural traits like low toxicity. In this study we investigated the differential expression of cyanogenesis related genes in the leaf tissue of the domesticated species Sorghum bicolor and the Australian native wild species Sorghum macrospermum grown in glasshouse-controlled water-stress conditions using RNA-Seq analysis to analyse gene expression. The study identified genes, including those in the cyanogenesis pathway, that were differentially regulated in response to water-stress in domesticated and wild sorghum. In the domesticated sorghum, dhurrin content was significantly higher compared to that in the wild sorghum and increased with stress and decreased with age whereas in wild sorghum the dhurrin content remained negligible. The key genes in dhurrin biosynthesis, CYP79A1, CYP71E1 and UGT85B1, were shown to be highly expressed in S. bicolor. DHR and HNL encoding the dhurrinase and -hydroxynitrilase catalysing bio-activation of dhurrin were also highly expressed in S. bicolor. Analysis of the differences in expression of cyanogenesis related genes between domesticated and wild sorghum species may allow the use of these genetic resources to produce more acyanogenic varieties in the future.","output":"Transcript profiles of wild and domesticated sorghum under water-stressed conditions and the differential impact on dhurrin metabolism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microwave ablation (MWA) is an alternative locoregional therapy to surgical resection of solid tumors in the treatment of malignancies, and is widely used for hepatic tumors. It has a slightly higher overall survival (OS) rate compared to external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and proton beam therapy (PBT), and better long-term recurrence-free OS rate compared to radiofrequency ablation (RFA). In this paper, current commercial devices, most recent noncommercial designs, and the principles behind them alongside the recently reported developments and issues of MWA are reviewed. The paper also provides microscopic insights on effects of microwave irradiation in the body. Our review shows that MWA is a safe and effective, minimally invasive method with high ablation completion rates. However, for large tumors, the completion rates slightly decrease, and recurrences increase. Thus, for large tumors we suggest using a cooled shaft antenna or multiple antenna placements. Comparisons of the two common ablation frequencies 915 MHz and 2.45 GHz have shown inconsistent results due to non-identical conditions. This review suggests that 915 MHz devices are more effective for ablating large tumors and the theory behind MWA effects corroborates this proposition. However, for small tumors or tumors adjacent to vital organs, 2.45 GHz is suggested due to its more localized ablation zone. Among the antenna designs, the double-slot antenna with a metallic choke seems to be more effective by localizing the radiation around the tip of the antenna, while also preventing backward radiation towards the skin. The review also pertains to the use of MWA in COVID-19 patients and risk factors associated with the disease. MWA should be considered for COVID-19 patients with hepatic tumors as a fast treatment with a short recovery time. As liver injury is also a risk due to COVID-19, it is recommended to apply liver function tests to monitor abnormal levels in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, and other liver function indicators.","output":"Percutaneous microwave ablation applications for liver tumors: recommendations for COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its outbreak in late 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been ravaging the health system of most countries of the world.

Rapid detection of high-risk patients is crucial to reduce mortality in this population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognositc accuracy of the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) for in-hospital mortality in older adults with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in Wuhan Hankou Hospital in China from 1 January 2020 to 29 February 2020. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the predictive value of MEWS, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Sequential Organ Function Assessment (SOFA), quick Sequential Organ Function Assessment (qSOFA), Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), Combination of Confusion, Urea, Respiratory Rate, Blood Pressure, and Age 65 (CURB-65), and the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Criteria (SIRS) for in-hospital mortality. Logistic regression models were performed to detect the high-risk older adults with COVID-19. RESULTS: Among the 235 patients included in this study, 37 (15.74%) died and 131 (55.74%) were male, with an average age of 70.61 years (SD 8.02). ROC analysis suggested that the capacity of MEWS in predicting in-hospital mortality was as good as the APACHE II, SOFA, PSI and qSOFA (Difference in AUROC: MEWS vs. APACHE II, ?0.025 (95% CI [?0.075 to 0.026]); MEWS vs. SOFA, ?0.013 (95% CI [?0.049 to 0.024]); MEWS vs. PSI, ?0.015 (95% CI [?0.065 to 0.035]); MEWS vs. qSOFA, 0.024 (95% CI [?0.029 to 0.076]), all P > 0.05), but was significantly higher than SIRS and CURB-65 (Difference in AUROC: MEWS vs. SIRS, 0.218 (95% CI [0.156C0.279]); MEWS vs. CURB-65, 0.064 (95% CI [0.002C0.125]), all P < 0.05). Logistic regression models implied that the male patients (75 years) had higher risk of death than the other older adults (estimated coefficients: 1.16, P = 0.044).

Accordingly, the Korean government is sizing up and modernizing slaughterhouses to expedite the slaughter and to increase the safety of livestock products. The labor-intensive slaughter industry is undergoing major changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which will speed up the automation of slaughterhouses. Various automation devices are also being introduced in Korea, and currently the Korean government is introducing a pork meat yield grading machine to increase the accuracy of judgments based on the increasing slaughter volume. However, because such equipment is quite expensive, it is not easy to introduce, and a detailed study on the utility of the related equipment and an economic feasibility analysis has not been conducted. Therefore, in this study, we tried to prove the validity of the introduction of the equipment through the effectiveness study and economic analysis of the automatic meat yield grading machine, and a plan to increase the economic effect was considered.AbstractCurrently, the pork industry is incorporating in-line automation with the aim of increasing the slaughtered pork carcass throughput while monitoring quality and safety. In Korea, 21 parameters (such as back-fat thickness and carcass weight) are used for quality grading of pork carcasses. Recently, the VCS2000 systeman automatic meat yield grading machine systemwas introduced to enhance grading efficiency and therefore increase pork carcass production. The VCS2000 system is able to predict pork carcass yield based on image analysis. This study also conducted an economic analysis of the system using a costbenefit analysis. The subsection items of the cost-benefit analysis considered were net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and benefit/cost ratio (BC ratio), and each method was verified through sensitivity analysis. For our analysis, the benefits were grouped into three categories: the benefits of reducing labor costs, the benefits of improving meat yield production, and the benefits of reducing pig feed consumption through optimization. The cost-benefit analysis of the system resulted in an NPV of approximately 615.6 million Korean won, an IRR of 13.52%, and a B/C ratio of 1.65.","output":"Economic Analysis of the Use of VCS2000 for Pork Carcass Meat Yield Grading in Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The initial 15 months of COVID\\\\19 were associated with a decline in hospital care for overdose or self\\\\harm in adolescents and young adults, according to a study conducted in Ontario.","output":"COVID\\\\19 linked to decreases in ED/hospital OD encounters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Uremic toxins are a heterogeneous group of molecules that accumulate in the body due to the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Data about COVID-19 infection in cancer patients are scarce, and they point out a higher risk of complications due to the viral infection in this population. Moreover, cancer treatments could increase viral complications, specially those treatments based on the use of immunotherapy with checkpoints antibodies. There are no clinical data about the safety of immune check point antibodies in cancer patients when they become infected by SARS-CoV-2. As checkpoint inhibitors, mainly anti PD-1 and anti CTLA-4 antibodies, are an effective treatment for most melanoma patients, avoiding their use during the pandemic could lead to a decrease in the chances of curing melanoma. Methods: In Spain we have started a national registry of melanoma patients infected by SARS-Cov-2 since April 1st, 2020. A retrospective analysis of patients included in the Spanish registery has been performed weekly since the activation of the study.

Misconceptions have relied on seasonal mediation of respiratory diseases driven solely by environmental variables. However, seasonality is expected to be driven by host social behavior, particularly in highly susceptible populations. A key gap in understanding the role of social behavior in respiratory disease seasonality is our incomplete understanding of the seasonality of indoor human activity. We leverage a novel data stream on human mobility to characterize activity in indoor versus outdoor environments in the United States. We use a mobile app-based location dataset encompassing over 5 million locations nationally. We classify locations as primarily indoor (e.g. stores, offices) or outdoor (e.g. playgrounds, farmers markets), disentangling location-specific visitor counts into indoor and outdoor, to arrive at a fine-scale measure of indoor to outdoor human activity across time and space. We find the proportion of indoor to outdoor activity during a baseline year is seasonal, peaking in winter months. The measure displays a latitudinal gradient with stronger seasonality at northern latitudes and an additional summer peak in southern latitudes. We statistically fit this baseline indoor-outdoor activity measure to inform incorporation of this complex empirical pattern into infectious disease dynamic models. However, we find that the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic caused these patterns to shift significantly from baseline, and the empirical patterns are necessary to predict spatio-temporal heterogeneity in disease dynamics. Our work empirically characterizes, for the first time, the seasonality of human social behavior at a large-scale with high spatio-temporal resolution, and provides a parsimonious parameterization of seasonal behavior that can be included in infectious disease dynamics models. We provide critical evidence and methods necessary to inform the public health of seasonal and pandemic respiratory pathogens and improve our understanding of the relationship between the physical environment and infection risk in the context of global ecological change.","output":"Disentangling the rhythms of human activity in the built environment for airborne transmission risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection causes COVID-19, ranging from mild to critical disease in symptomatic subjects. It is essential to better understand the immunologic responses occurring in patients with the most severe outcomes. In this study, parameters related to the humoral immune response elicited against SARS-CoV-2 were analysed in 61 patients with different presentations of COVID-19 who were recruited in Hospitals and Primary Healthcare Centres in Madrid, Spain, during the first pandemic peak between April and June 2020. Subjects were allocated as mild patients without hospitalization, severe patients hospitalized or critical patients requiring ICU assistance. Critical patients showed significantly enhanced levels of B cells with memory and plasmablast phenotypes, as well as higher levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 with neutralization ability, which were particularly increased in male gender. Despite all this, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity was defective in these individuals. Besides, patients with critical COVID-19 also showed increased IgG levels against herpesvirus such as CMV, EBV, HSV-1 and VZV, as well as detectable CMV and EBV viremia in plasma. Altogether, these results suggest an enhanced but ineffectual immune response in patients with critical COVID-19 that allowed latent herpesvirus reactivation.

It was evaluated the viability of oxygenation and pulmonary ventilation with an emergency mechanical ventilation device called 10D-EMV in animal experiments. A two-stage sequential adaptive study was conducted in 10 sheep, divided into group I (PEEP valve close to the device) and group II (PEEP valve distal to the device). Each animal underwent mechanical ventilation for a total of 120 minutes. Results: : The mean oxygenation in group I and group II were 368 mmHg and 366 mmHg, respectively, while the mean partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 58 mmHg and 48 mmHg.

Additionally, ongoing multi-targeted therapies are limited only for few carcinogenesis pathways, due to continually emerging and evolving mutations of proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressive genes. CRISPR/Cas9, as a specific gene-editing tool, is used to correct causative mutations with minimal toxicity, but is also employed as an adjuvant to immunotherapy to achieve a more robust immunological response. Some of the most critical limitations of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology include off-target mutations, resulting in nonspecific restrictions of DNA upstream of the Protospacer Adjacent Motifs (PAM), ethical agreements, and the lack of a scientific consensus aiming at risk evaluation. Currently, CRISPR/Cas9 is tested on animal models to enhance genome editing specificity and induce a stronger anti-tumor response. Moreover, ongoing clinical trials use the CRISPR/Cas9 system in immune cells to modify genomes in a target-specific manner. Recently, error-free in vitro systems have been engineered to overcome limitations of this gene-editing system. The aim of the article is to present the knowledge concerning the use of CRISPR Cas9 technique in targeting treatment-resistant cancers.

Having demonstrated in a previous study that hypnosis facilitates the exploration of such events, we now aim to explore and classify the content of these events and to determine whether there is an association between the type of event, the state of consciousness in which the patient verbalized it, and possible causal attributions of the disorder. METHOD Thirty-two women (age 52  7 years) suffering from fibromyalgia and receiving care in a primary healthcare center participated in the same semi-structured interview twice: once in a wakeful state and once under hypnosis. They answered two questions: what other events in your life coincided with the onset of fibromyalgia? Are those events related to your fibromyalgia in any way? To counteract biases related to order or recall, the order of the two interviews was randomized with a 3-month period in between. RESULTS The patients verbalized 23 different types of events, which we classified into eight categories, mostly psychosocial events. Although the relationship between the three variables was not statistically significant, two of the bivariate associations predicted (type of event and state of consciousness; and state of consciousness and causal attribution) were confirmed (2 , P values of .01 and <.001 respectively).

However, due to the great variability in published results regarding COVID-19-induced chemosensory impairments and their follow-up, prognosis for chemosensory functions in patients with such complaints remains unclear. Objective: To describe the various chemosensory alterations associated with COVID-19 and their prevalence and evolution at 3 to 7 months after infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: A follow-up study of 704 health care workers with a RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 28/2/2020 and 14/6/2020 was conducted 3 to 7 months after onset of symptoms. Data were collected with an online questionnaire. Participant had to be []18 years old without respiratory illness in the 2 weeks prior to questionnaire completion. Main outcomes and measures: Outcomes included differences in reported chemosensory self-assessment of olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal functions across time points and Chemosensory Perception Test scores from an easy-to-use at-home self-administered chemosensory test. Results: Among the 704 health care worker participants, 593 (84.2%) were women, the mean (SD) age was 42 (12) years and the questionnaire was answered on average 4.8 (0.8) months after COVID-19. During COVID-19, a decrease in olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal sensitivities were reported by 81.3%, 81.5% and 48.0% respectively. Three to seven months later, reduced sensitivity was still reported by 52.0%, 41.9% and 23.3% respectively. Chemosensory Perception Test scores indicate that 19.5% of participants had objective olfactory impairment. Conclusions and relevance: A significant proportion of COVID-19 cases have persistent chemosensory impairments at 3 to 7 months after their infection but the majority of those who had completely lost their olfactory, gustatory and trigeminal sensitivity have improved. Given the possible neurological underpinnings of this observation and the important number of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, further longitudinal studies are needed to better characterize this phenotype and to report eventual post-COVID-19 neurological sequelae.","output":"COVID-19 Has Long Term Effects on Chemosensory Functions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXTE: Le prsent document ainsi que les constats qu&#039;il nonce ont t rdigs en rponse  une interpellation du ministre de la Sant et des Services sociaux dans le contexte de l&#039;urgence sanitaire lie  la maladie  coronavirus (COVID-19) au Qubec L&#039;objectif est de raliser une recension sommaire des donnes publies et de mobiliser les savoirs cls afin d&#039;informer les dcideurs publics et les professionnels de la sant et des services sociaux Bien que les constats reposent sur un reprage exhaustif des donnes scientifiques publies, la slection et l&#039;valuation de la qualit mthodologique des tudes ne reposent pas sur une mthode systmatique selon les normes habituelles  l&#039;INESSS Par ailleurs, les positions ne dcoulent pas d&#039;un processus de consultation labor Dans les circonstances d&#039;une telle urgence de sant publique, l&#039;INESSS reste  l&#039;aff?t de toutes nouvelles donnes susceptibles de lui faire modifier cette rponse POSITION DE L&#039;INESSS: Bas sur la documentation scientifique disponible au moment de sa rdaction, et sur les consultations menes, l&#039;INESSS estime que: TRAITEMENT COVID-19 confirme, patients non hospitaliss: -Les biothrapies diriges contre l&#039;interleukine-6 (siltuximab) ou son rcepteur (tocilizumab, sarilumab) ciblent un mdiateur cl de la rponse immunitaire antivirale mais aussi du syndrome de libration des cytokines, une complication survenant au cours d&#039;une phase plus tardive de l&#039;infection Pour ne pas nuire aux mcanismes de dfense contre l&#039;infection virale ces biothrapies ne devraient pas tre envisags chez des patients COVID-19 confirms dont l&#039;tat clinique ne justifie pas une hospitalisation COVID-19 confirme, patients hospitaliss dans un tat grave ou critique: -L&#039;incertitu","output":"COVID-19 et biothrapies diriges contre l'interleukine 6 ou son rcepteur"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People who use drugs, or who have in the past, often report that doctors and/or treatment providers devalue, or are unwilling to believe their claims in regards to substance use issues, in particular the presence and severity of withdrawal.

METHODS: Beginning in April 2020, respondents of the Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were asked a series of 8 questions about sources of COVID-19 information and prevention behaviors. We analyzed the prevalence of information-seeking and prevention behaviors among respondents who answered at least 1 of the 8 questions (N = 1,004) overall, by demographic characteristics, and by the presence of chronic conditions. RESULTS: Most respondents reported engaging in prevention behaviors, including handwashing (98.2%), reducing or avoiding travel (96.6%), avoiding crowds and public events (96.5%), and keeping household members at home (87.5%); however, the prevalence of prevention behaviors varied significantly by age, sex, and education. The most frequently reported source of COVID-19 information was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website (40.8%) followed by the Florida Department of Health's website (32.9%). We found significant differences in information sources across all demographic and chronic condition subgroups.

Providing them with a supportive social environment by pairing individuals with compatible partners improves their life quality and also their use as research animals. Therefore, identifying suitable social partners will benefit both the animals and the science. Previous work showed that female rhesus macaques were more likely to form successful pairs that exhibit little aggression if they showed similarities in certain personality traits measured in infancy. In the current study, we assessed the relationships between the same personality traits and the quality of social interactions between partners. This is important since by ensuring that animals benefit the most from being paired to a compatible partner, we are more likely to expose the animals to positive experiences instead of simply avoiding negative ones. We found that pairs with similar emotionality scores showed more positive social interactions, and pairs with similar nervous temperament used fewer behavioral signals to communicate their dominance relationship. Moreover, pairs that paid more attention to unfamiliar monkey faces were more anxious. These results highlight the importance of taking the animals personalities into consideration when attempting to match social partners and provide them with an environment that fits their needs. ABSTRACT: Previous reports suggest that female macaques with greater similarity in emotionality and nervous temperament, as evaluated in a well-established BioBehavioral Assessment (BBA) at the California National Primate Research Center, were more likely to form successful pairs. We tested whether the same measures can also predict the quality of social interactions among 20 female rhesus macaque pairs. We correlated the pairs emotionality and nervous temperament scores obtained in infancy and the levels of behaviors recorded systematically during the pairing process years later. Supporting previous findings, partners with similar emotionality scores were more affiliative, and pairs with similar nervous temperament expressed less dominance/submissive behavior. Exploratorily, we found that pairs that were better at processing social information (part of BBA) were also more anxious. Such animals should be prioritized to be introduced in rooms that house calmer, less aggressive animals and provide opportunities for hiding to alleviate their anxiety. Indeed, positive social experiences not only promote animal welfare, but also reduce stress related confounds and unexplained data variability. Therefore, by incorporating the animals temperament into the pair configuration process we increase the likelihood of forming high-quality pairs, both in terms of welfare and the research of which they are a part.","output":"Temperament Predicts the Quality of Social Interactions in Captive Female Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), affects 213 countries or territories globally. We received a request from National Health Systems Resource Centre, a public agency in India, to conduct rapid evidence synthesis (RES) on community health workers (CHWs) for COVID-19 prevention and control in 3 days. METHODS: We searched PubMed, websites of ministries (n=3), public agencies (n=6), multilateral institutions (n=3), COVID-19 resource aggregators (n=5) and preprints (n=1) (without language restrictions) for articles on CHWs in pandemics. Two reviewers screened the records independently with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. One reviewer extracted data with another reviewer cross-checking it. A framework on CHW performance in primary healthcare not specific to pandemic was used to guide data extraction and narrative analysis. RESULTS: We retrieved 211 records and finally included 36 articles. Most of the evidence was from low-and middle-income countries with well-established CHW programmes. Evidence from CHW programmes initiated during pandemics and for CHW involvement in pandemic response in high-income countries was scant. CHW roles and tasks change substantially during pandemics. Clear guidance, training for changed roles and definition of what constitutes essential activities (ie, those that must to be sustained) is required. Most common additional activities during pandemics were community awareness, engagement and sensitisation (including for countering stigma) and contact tracing. CHWs were reported to be involved in all aspects of contact tracing - this was reported to affect routine service delivery. CHWs have often been stigmatised or been socially ostracised during pandemics. Providing PPE, housing allowance, equal training opportunities, transportation allowance, improving salaries (paid on time and for a broad range of services) and awards in high-profile public events contributed to better recruitment and retention. We also created inventories of resources with guiding notes on guidelines for health workers (n=24), self-isolation in the community (n=10) and information, education and counselling materials on COVID-19 (n=16).

OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the feasibility of the endonasal endoscopic approach in a variety of age groups and to perform measurements of the corridors and spaces available for surgery as a guide for case selection. METHODS Only patients <18 years were included. The choice of operative corridor/approach is described in relation to pathological entity and location. Preoperative/postoperative visual fields and endocrine panels, extent of resection, as well as postoperative long-term complications are described. Prospective magnetic resonance image-based anatomic measurements of key distances were performed to determine age-dependent surgical indications and limitations. RESULTS Forty purely endoscopic procedures were performed in 33 pediatric patients (5-18 years of age) harboring a variety of skull base lesions, from benign tumors to congenital malformations. For the 20 patients in whom gross total resection was the intended goal of surgery, gross total resection was attained in 15 (75%). There were 2 infections (5%) and no cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Significant improvement was shown in 58.3% of patients with visual deficits. Hormone overproduction resolved in 75% of patients, while preoperative hormone insufficiency only improved in 29.2%. Wider intercarotid distance at the superior clivus (P = .01) and shorter nare-dens working distance (P = .001) predicted improved outcomes and fewer postoperative complications.

Methods: We performed an analysis of the intervention escalation phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ontario, Canada. Specifically, we integrated social contact patterns derived from empirical data with a disease transmission model, that enabled the usage of age-stratified COVID-19 incidence data to infer age-specific susceptibility, daily contact mixing patterns in workplace, household, school, and community settings;and transmission acquired in these settings under different physical distancing measures. Findings: We quantified the age- and setting (household, workplace, community, and school)-specific mixing patterns and their evolution during the escalation of public health interventions in Ontario, Canada. We estimated a reduction in the average individual contact rate from 1227 to 658 per day, with an increase in household contacts, following the implementation of control measures. We estimated increasing trends by age in both the susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of symptomatic individuals diagnosed.

As an abundant innate immune cell type, neutrophils are well known for their contributions to antimicrobial defense. However, their dysfunction is also associated with different inflammatory signatures during the pathogenesis of infection. Herein, in this mini-review, we summarize the recent progress on the potential role of neutrophils during COVID-19-associated inflammatory responses. In particular, we highlight the interactions between neutrophils and viruses as well as the relationship of neutrophils with cytokine storm and thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. Lastly, we discuss the importance of neutrophils as potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19.","output":"Immunopathological Roles of Neutrophils in Virus Infection and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Evidence showed that partial or complete loss of smell and taste might be a possible primary symptom of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). This study aimed to systematically review and pool all available evidence on the olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this systematic review, a comprehensive search was carried out systematically through e-databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS);that was limited to English-language studies published from 2019 up to 6th May 2020. Afterward, all studies reported the taste and smell dysfunction in the COVID-19 patients were included. The quality of the studies was assessed by the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). The pooled prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction was estimated using the random effects meta-analysis method. Results: Among 28 eligible included studies in this systematic review, finally, 22 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. According to the random effect meta-analysis, the global pooled prevalence (95% confidence interval) of any olfactory dysfunction, anosmia, and hyposmia was 55% (40%-70%), 40% (22%-57%), and 40% (20%-61%) respectively. The pooled estimated prevalence of any gustatory dysfunction, ageusia, and dysgeusia was 41% (23%-59%), 31% (3%-59%), and 34% (19%-48%) respectively. Conclusion: Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction is prevalent among COVID-19 patients. Therefore, olfactory and gustatory dysfunction seems to be part of important symptoms and notify for the diagnosis of COVID-19, especially in the early phase of the infection.","output":"Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in 2019 novel coronavirus: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In contrast to the many theoretical studies on the transmission of human-mosquitoes malaria infection, few studies have considered a multiple structure model formulations including (i) the chronological age of humans and mosquitoes population, (ii) the time since humans and mosquitoes are infected and (iii) humans waning immunity (i.e., the progressive loss of protective antibodies after recovery). Such structural variables are well documented to be fundamental for the transmission of human-mosquitoes malaria infections. Here we formulate an age-structured model accounting for the three structural variables. Using integrated semigroups theory, we first handle the well-posedness of the model proposed. We also investigate the existence of model's steady-states. A disease-free equilibrium always exists while the existence of endemic equilibria is discussed. We derive the threshold R0 (the basic reproduction number). The expression of the R0 obtained here particularly highlight the effect of above structural variables on key important epidemiological traits of the human-vector association. This includes, humans and mosquitoes transmission probability and survival rates. Next, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition that implies the bifurcation of an endemic equilibrium. In some configuration where the age-structure of the human population is neglected, we show that, depending on the sign of some constant Cbif given by the parameters, a bifurcation occurs at R0 = 1 that is either forward or backward. In the former case, it means that there exists a (unique) endemic equilibrium if and only if R0>1. In the latter case, no endemic equilibrium exists for R0<<1 small enough, a unique exists if R0>1 while multiple endemic equilibria exist when 0<<R0<1 close enough to 1.","output":"Human-vector malaria transmission model structured by age, time since infection and waning immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of positive patients infected by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the city of Padang continues to increase and is highest in West Sumatra Province Until May 5, 2020, there were 131 positive confirmed cases Six of them are primary health care officers The purpose of this study was to measure the description of the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in the prevention of Covid-19 in primary health care staff in Padang City This research uses descriptive quantitative method which was carried out in March - June 2020 in Padang City primary health cares The study population are primary health care officers who deal with patients directly in the city of Padang with a sample of 100 people Data were collected using a questionnaire and analyzed univariately The results showed that 55% of staff used incomplete PPE, 57% are old, 54% have low knowledge, 54% have negative attitudes, 46% PPE are not available at the primary health care, and 45% lacked leadership support The results also noted that 58% of officers began using PPE when announcing the first positive case in Padang City For further research can conduct bivariate analysis and qualitative research for in-depth analysis","output":"Descriptive study of behavior in using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to prevent Covid-19 for primary health care officers in Padang City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The past 20 years have seen major public health emergencies and natural disasters, including the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003; the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008; and the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) of 2019, which caused mass casualties, infections, and panic.

Accordingly, it is important to examine social closeness in the context of computer-mediated communication in more detail and to take a closer look at the relation between the feeling of presence to achieve the maximum potential for such communication. In this paper we introduce the concept of sensory synchronization as a predictor for perceived social presence. To this end, social activities conducted virtually during the Covid-19 pandemic were surveyed and analyzed to understand the connection between a feeling of presence and possible sensory synchronization of communication partners. Context of activities were collected in preliminary interviews and examined more closely in an online survey (N = 234). Most frequently reported activities included video calls, playing virtual games and virtual meals. The results showed that there is a significant positive correlation between sensory synchronization and social presence in all activity categories. The activity categories significantly explain different variances of the evaluated social presence and sensory synchronization. The results of this work motivate further research on the topic of sensory synchronization and social presence. New predictors in social presence research were identified and a questionnaire for the assessment of sensory synchronization and social presence was developed. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Social Presence Despite Isolation - Insights into the Relation Between Psychological Distance and Sensory Synchronization in Computer-Mediated Communication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GAD-Ab) are sometimes associated with chronic drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Identifying the factors influencing their alumnis intentions to invest in their alma mater can be of significant importance when establishing a sustainable revenue stream. Within this context, empirical research on the potential role of trust is scarce. This paper aims to deepen the analysis of the relationship between alumni trust and engagement as well as three outcomes, namely support, commitment, and attitude toward donation. A structural equation model was tested on two samples of US (n = 318) and Italian (n = 314) alumni. Although both countries are affluent and developed countries, the USA has an established tradition of alumni donations, which is not such a developed practice in Italy. For both countries, results confirm that engagement is an antecedent of trust, which in turn leads to the three investigated outcomes (support, commitment, and attitude toward donations). In contrast, the effect of commitment on attitude toward donations is significant only for the USA universities. The paper has interesting theoretical and managerial implications. From a theoretical point of view, the study aims to address a gap concerning the role of trust in the HE context.

Therefore, we compared the ITA indications for RRA with the recommendations by the 2015 American Thyroid Association guidelines (ATA). METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 380 consecutive DTC patients treated with surgery and RRA, followed at the Section of Endocrinology, University of Siena, Italy from January 2006 to December 2019. RESULTS: Using ITA a significant increase of DTC patients classified as low or high risk and a significant decrease of patients defined at intermediate risk were observed (p < 0.0001). Consequently, the percentage of patients without routinary indication for RRA (47.4%, versus 38.2%, p < 0.0001) and those with a definite indication for RRA (8.2 versus 1.8%, p < 0.0001) was significantly higher compared to ATA. Moreover, using ITA the percentage of patients with a selective use of RRA was lower in comparison to ATA (44.7% versus 60%, p < 0.0001). Nevertheless, the prevalence of distant metastases, at post-ablative whole body scan, in patients without indication for RRA, was not different using either ATA or ITA (2.1% and 1.1% respectively, p = 0.37).

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to describe the CQI implementation process and examine its effect on HIV and TB service delivery at selected primary healthcare facilities in two South African districts. METHOD: We used a separate sample, pre- and post-test, quasi-experimental study design based on data collected from the clinical audit of patient cohorts seen in 2014 and 2015 respectively. Quality was measured based on the extent to which prescribed services were provided. Tailored CQI interventions were implemented based on service delivery gaps identified by the 2014 CQI audit. Data were summarised and analysed using a combination of univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The services identified as low quality were related to opportunistic infections management and laboratory practices. Compliance to prescribed service items in antiretroviral treatment initiation and monitoring, pharmacy and laboratory management, exceeded 70% across study sites. Over 80% of low quality service delivery items were optimised in less than six months with targeted quality improvement support. CONCLUSION: The observed improvements signal the effectiveness of the CQI approach, its capacity to rapidly improve under-performance, its high replicability and the need to provide quality maintenance support to sustain or improve healthcare facilities performing well.

Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on neurosurgical practice and to determine whether surgical procedures are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A multicenter case-control study was conducted, involving patients who underwent neurosurgical intervention in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during 2 periods: pre-COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The surgical intervention data evaluated included diagnostic category, case priority, complications, length of hospital stay, and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 850 procedures were included, 36% during COVID-19. The median number of procedures per day was significantly lower during the COVID-19 period (5.5 cases) than during the pre-COVID-19 period (12 cases; P < 0.0001). Complications, length of hospital stay, and 30-day mortality did not differ during the pandemic.

We extracted the JAK/STAT pathway from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, hsa04630). The effects of the following drugs, and their combinations, commonly used in RA were tested: methotrexate, prednisolone, rituximab, tocilizumab, tofacitinib and baricitinib. Following viral systems were also tested for their ability to evade the JAK/STAT pathway: Measles, Influenza A, West Nile virus, Japanese B virus, Yellow Fever virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Kaposi's sarcoma virus, Hepatitis B and C virus, cytomegalovirus, Hendra and Nipah virus and Coronavirus. Good correlation of edges and minimum vertex cover with clinical efficacy were observed (for edge, rho = - 0.815, R2 = 0.676, p = 0.007, for vertex cover rho = - 0.793, R2 = 0.635, p = 0.011). In the viral systems both edges and vertex cover were associated with acuteness of viral infections.

It is now questionable how PAD can be affected by changes in lifestyle imposed by the Sars-CoV-19 Pandemic. This study's main objective is to evaluate how the limitations of social behavior set by Sars-CoV-19 Pandemic impact the perception and evolution of the disease in a group of patients with a diagnosed PAD. METHODS: The changes in the in the perception and the evolution of the PAD were evaluated by comparing results of a modified VascuQol-6 quality of life (QoL) survey referring to the time frame defined \\"No-Sars-CoV-2 period\\" (from July to December 2019) with results referring to the time frame defined \\"Sars-CoV-2 period\\" (from January to June 2020).

Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curves evaluated a delta value for each patient with revascularization of lower limb peripheral arteries. Optimal cut-offs were chosen based on their specificity, sensitivity. RESULTS: One-hundred-two PAD patients gave their informed consent to take part in the study. A significant general worsening of patients PAD perception in the Sars-CoV-2 period was recorded for the following items: lower limbs health status perception; overall activity limitation; walking ability limitation; overall daily walking distance; lower limbs fatigue perception; concerns about PAD worsening; pain discomfort (P < 0.05).

To control this virus, vaccine design becomes imperative. In this study, potential epitopes-based vaccine candidates were explored. Six hundred (600) genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from the viPR database to generate CD8+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell and linear B-cell epitopes which were screened for antigenicity, immunogenicity and non-allergenicity. The results of this study provide 19 promising candidate CD8+ T-cell epitopes that strongly overlap with 8 promising B-cells epitopes. Another 19 CD4+ T-cell epitopes were also identified that can induce IFN-?3 and IL-4 cytokines. The most conserved MHC-I and MHC-II for both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitopes are HLA-A*02:06 and HLA-DRB1*01:01 respectively. These epitopes also bound to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). The population coverage of the conserved Major Histocompatibility Complex Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) for both CD8+ T-cell and CD4+ T-cell ranged from 65.6% to 100%. The detailed analysis of the potential epitope-based vaccine and their mapping to the complete COVID-19 genome reveals that they are predominantly found in the location of the surface (S) and membrane (M) glycoproteins suggesting the potential involvement of these structural proteins in the immunogenic response and antigenicity of the virus. Since the majority of the potential epitopes are located on M protein, the design of multi-epitope vaccine with the structural protein is highly promising though the whole M protein could also serve as a viable epitope for the development of an attenuated vaccine. Our findings provide a baseline for the experimental design of a suitable vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Immunoinformatics prediction of overlapping CD8+ T-cell, IFN-?3 and IL-4 inducer CD4+ T-cell and linear B-cell epitopes based vaccines against COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality and is independently associated with cardiovascular disease. The mainstay of treatment for CKD is blockade of the reninCangiotensinCaldosterone system (RAAS), which reduces blood pressure and proteinuria and slows kidney function decline. Despite this treatment, many patients progress to kidney failure, which requires dialysis or kidney transplantation, and/or die as a result of cardiovascular disease. The apelin system is an endogenous physiological regulator that is emerging as a potential therapeutic target for many diseases. This system comprises the apelin receptor and its two families of endogenous ligands, apelin and elabela/toddler. Preclinical and clinical studies show that apelin receptor ligands are endothelium-dependent vasodilators and potent inotropes, and the apelin system has a reciprocal relationship with the RAAS. In preclinical studies, apelin regulates glomerular haemodynamics and acts on the tubule to promote aquaresis. In addition, apelin is protective in several kidney injury models. Although the apelin system has not yet been studied in patients with CKD, the available data suggest that apelin is a promising potential therapeutic target for kidney disease.","output":"The therapeutic potential of apelin in kidney disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Plusieurs comits dexperts recommandent la vaccination anti-Covid-19 chez les patients suivis pour sclrose en plaques (SEP).

We developed and validated a fit-for-purpose disease-specific instrument to assess symptoms in patients with COVID-19 to inform endpoints in an interventional trial for non-hospitalized patients. METHODS: The initial drafting of the 23-item Symptoms Evolution of COVID-19 (SE-C19) Instrument was developed based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention symptom list and available published literature specific to patients with COVID-19 as of Spring 2020. The measurement principles outlined in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) guidance and the FDA's series of four methodological Patient-Focused Drug Development guidance documents were also considered. Following initial development, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 30 non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Interviews involved two stages: (1) concept elicitation, to obtain information about the symptoms experienced as a result of COVID-19 in the patients own words, and (2) cognitive debriefing, for patients to describe their understanding of the SE-C19 instructions, specific symptoms, response options, and recall period to ensure the content of the SE-C19 is relevant and comprehensive. Five clinicians treating COVID-19 outpatients were also interviewed to obtain their insights on symptoms experienced by patients and provide input on the SE-C19. RESULTS: Patients reported no issues regarding the relevance or appropriateness of the SE-C19 instructions, including the 24-h recall period. The comprehensiveness of the SE-C19 was confirmed against the conceptualization of the patient experience of symptoms developed in the qualitative research. Minor conceptual gaps were revealed to capture nuances in the experience of nasal and gustatory symptoms and systemic manifestations of sickness. Almost all items were endorsed by patients as being appropriate, well understood, and easy to respond to. The clinicians largely approved all items, response options, and recall period. CONCLUSIONS: The qualitative research provided supportive evidence of the content validity of the SE-C19 to assess the symptoms of outpatients with COVID-19, and its use in clinical trials to evaluate the benefit of treatment. Minor changes may be considered to improve conceptual clarity and ease of responding.","output":"Development and content validation of the Symptoms Evolution of COVID-19: a patient-reported electronic daily diary in clinical and real-world studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 had a great impact on the physical and mental health of people all over the world, especially for students whose physical and mental development was not yet mature. In order to understand the physical and mental conditions of students during the epidemic period and provide a theoretical basis for coping with psychological problems in public health emergencies, this study explored the mediating role of sleep disorders in the effect of the psychological stress response (PSR) on non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), along with the moderating role of emotional management ability (EMA). METHODS: The SRQ-20, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, NSSI Behavior Questionnaire, and Emotional Management Questionnaire were used to investigate the mental health of Chinese students in April 10C20 (Time point 1, T1) and May 20C30 (Time point 2, T2), 2020. A total of 1,955 students (Mage = 19.64 years, 51.4% male) were examined at T1 and 342 students (Mage = 20.06 years, 48.2% male) were reassessed at T2. RESULTS: Overall, the detection rate of PSR and NSSI were 17.60% (n = 344) and 24.90% (n = 486) respectively in the T1 sample, and were 16.37% (n = 56) and 25.44% (n = 87), in the T2 sample. We also found that sleep disorders played a mediating role in the effect of PSR on NSSI in the T1 and T2 samples. In addition, EMA was shown to regulate the effect of PSR on sleep disorders and the effect of sleep disorders on NSSI in the T1 samples. CONCLUSION: We found that PSR resulting from public health emergency might lead to NSSI behaviors in individuals. PSR may also cause sleep disorders, which can bring about NSSI. However, these effects were also moderated by the EMA. This research expands our understanding of PSR and NSSI in students during the pandemic.","output":"Impacts of the psychological stress response on nonsuicidal self-injury behavior in students during the COVID-19 epidemic in China: the mediating role of sleep disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Significance: There is a scarcity of published research on the potential role of thermal imaging in the remote detection of respiratory issues due to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). This is a comprehensive study that explores the potential of this imaging technology resulting from its convenient aspects that make it highly accessible: it is contactless, noninvasive, and devoid of harmful radiation effects, and it does not require a complicated installation process. Aim: We aim to investigate the role of thermal imaging, specifically thermal video, for the identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected people using infrared technology and to explore the role of breathing patterns in different parts of the thorax for the identification of possible COVID-19 infection. Approach: We used signal moment, signal texture, and shape moment features extracted from five different body regions of interest (whole upper body, chest, face, back, and side) of images obtained from thermal video clips in which optical flow and super-resolution were used. These features were classified into positive and negative COVID-19 using machine learning strategies. Results: COVID-19 detection for male models [receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.605 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.58 to 0.64] is more reliable than for female models (ROC AUC = 0.577 95% CI 0.55 to 0.61). Overall, thermal imaging is not very sensitive nor specific in detecting COVID-19; the metrics were below 60% except for the chest view from males. Conclusions: We conclude that, although it may be possible to remotely identify some individuals affected by COVID-19, at this time, the diagnostic performance of current methods for body thermal imaging is not good enough to be used as a mass screening tool.","output":"COVID-19 classification using thermal images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many people, during this COVID - pandemic 'forced lockdowns', are currently restricting themselves in their indoor areas.

DESIGN: A total of 17 Centers, from 10 countries, following 9,499 patients with hemoglobinopathies, participated in the survey. MAIN OUTCOME DATA: Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 were collected from medical records and summarized. RESULTS: A total of 13 patients, 7 with TM, 3 with TI, and 3 with SCD, with confirmed COVID-19, were identified in 6 Centers from different countries. The overall mean age of patients was 33.712.3 years (range:13C66); 9/13 (69.2%) patients were females. Six patients had pneumonia, and 4 needed oxygen therapy. Increased C-reactive protein (6/10), high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 6/10), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; 6/10) were the most common laboratory findings. 6/10 patients had an exacerbation of anemia (2 with SCD). In the majority of patients, the course of COVID-19 was moderate (6/10) and severe in 3/10 patients. A 30-year-old female with TM, developed a critical SARS-CoV-2 infection, followed by death in an Intensive Care Unit. In one Center (Oman), the majority of suspected cases were observed in patients with SCD between the age of 21 and 40 years. A rapid clinical improvement of tachypnea/dyspnea and oxygen saturation was observed, after red blood cell exchange transfusion, in a young girl with SCD and worsening of anemia (Hb level from 9.2 g/dl to 6.1g/dl). CONCLUSIONS: The data presented in this survey permit an early assessment of the clinical characteristics of COVID 19 in different countries. 70% of symptomatic patients with COVID- 19 required hospitalization.
